Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the First Quarter Earnings Call of Albany International. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer section. Instructions will be given at that time. At the request of Albany International, this conference call on Friday, May 5 2017 will be webcast and recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, John Cozzolino, for introductory comments. Please go ahead.
John Cozzolino
Thank you, operator, and good morning everyone. As a reminder for those listening on the call, please refer to our detailed press release issued last night regarding our quarterly financial results, with particular reference to the Safe Harbor notice contained in the text of the release about our forward-looking statements and the use of certain non-GAAP financial measures and associated reconciliation of GAAP. And for purposes of this conference call, those same statements also apply to our verbal remarks this morning. And for a full discussion, please refer to that earnings release, as well as our SEC filings, including our 10-K.
Now I will turn the call over to Joe Morone, our Chief Executive Officer, who will provide some opening remarks. Joe?
Joseph Morone
Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Albany’s Q1 2017 earnings call. As usual, I'll summarize the quarter, John will then go into more detail, I'll follow with our outlook and we'll close with Q&A.
In Q1, 2017, both businesses continued to perform well and in line with our short and long-term expectations and objectives. Machine Clothing once again generated strong income and strong new product performance and Albany Engineered Composites once again generated strong growth, executed well on each of its key programs and continued to position itself for both improved profitability and additional new business.
In Machine Clothing, sales were essentially flat both sequentially and in comparison to Q1 2016. There were no significant deviations from recent market trends during the quarter, once again, we offset a significant decline in publication grade sales with incremental gains in the other grades, most notably during Q1 in tissues. 
By the end of Q1, the publication grades accounted for 23% of total sales, compared to 25%, a year ago, 27%, two years ago, and 30% three years ago. Our new product performance continued to be strong across all product lines, especially in tissues. And while competitive pricing pressure remained intense, particularly in Europe and Asia, the top-line impact was offset by volume growth in Asia.
Machine Clothing profitability was once again strong in Q1 2017 due to incremental productivity gains and good plant utilization. Gross margin, segment net income and adjusted EBITDA were all in line with very strong comps from Q1 2016.
Meanwhile AEC continued on its growth trajectory. Q1 sales grew to $56 million from $27 million in Q1 2016 which was the last quarter before we acquired our Salt Lake City division. Excluding Salt Lake, Q1 sales grew by 34%, compared to Q1 2016. The year began slowly for AEC but revenue accelerated as Q1 progressed and we entered into Q2 with this business right on track toward our full year target of 25% to 35% revenue growth over full year 2016.
The growth in Q1 was once again led by LEAP. AEC continues to execute well on the very aggressive LEAP brand schedule while in the marketplace, the LEAP engine continues to perform well. The order backlog for LEAP exceeded 12,000 engines at the end of Q1 with no signs of market softening, CFM delivered its 100th LEAP engine during the quarter and the LEAP engines now in service are operating well and meeting all of their performance targets.

Q1 sales in Salt Lake were flat compared to Q4, but as with the rest of AEC, we expect a sharp increase in Salt Lake sales for the balance of 2017. It has been a full year since the acquisition and our experience today particularly our experience with Salt Lake’s customers validates our view of the growth potential that motivated the acquisition in the first place. For all of Salt Lake’s key growth and legacy programs, we are meeting customer expectations in the near and long-term demand outlook is strong. 
Of particular note, since our last earnings call, our two recent developments in the CH-53K program. Salt Lake was informed during the quarter that it was selected by Sikorsky from more than 200 suppliers as the supplier of the year for the CH-53K program. And in early April, the CH-53K was officially approved by the Department of Defense to enter into production and deployment. 
As full rate production next decade and assuming no additional content, this program has the potential to generate as much as $150 million per year of AEC revenue. As for AEC profitability, adjusted EBITDA as a percent of sales improved to 9% in Q1, compared to 8% in Q4 and 5% a year ago. Profitability withheld back by a still substantial effort to complete the integration of Salt Lake into AEC for example.
Although our ERP system successfully went live in Salt Lake in February, the typical inefficiencies associated with learning a new system and modifying work processes will continue to be a drag on productivity well into the second half of the year. Shortly after the end of the quarter, we announced a significant restructuring at Salt Lake, which coupled with continuous improvement in operation should result in gradual improvements to profitability by the end of the year. 
Q1 was also marked by a significant increase in new business development activity in AEC, as John and I have often discussed with all of you, AEC is pursuing new business opportunities on three fronts, on existing aerospace platforms, on new aerospace platforms, and through diversification outside of aerospace. The most notable development during Q1 were again on a first front existing aerospace platform.
AEC received a significant number of formal requests for proposal and more preliminary expressions of interest from a broad cross-section of OEMs, largely processed by AEC’s execution and emphasis on lean manufacturing in its existing programs with those OEMs. So in sum, this is a good quarter for both businesses with stable market trends, good product performance and strong adjusted EBITDA in Machine Clothing, and in AEC, with continued strong growth and good performance on all of the key growth and legacy programs combined with encouraging progress in new business developments and important steps toward gradually improving profitability. 
Now let’s turn to John for a more detailed look at the quarter. John? 
John Cozzolino
Thank you, Joe. I’d like to refer you to our Q4 financial performance slides. Starting with Slide 3, net sales by segment total company net sales in Q1 increased 15.6%, compared to Q1, 2016, excluding currency effects, net sales increased 17% compared to last year.
MC net sales in Q1 excluding currency effects were essentially flat compared to Q1 2016. Q1 is the second consecutive quarter of flat year-over-year sales because, as Joe noted, declines in publication sales were offset by incremental increases in other grades. 
AEC net sales in Q1 increased by just over $29 million, that’s about $20 million of that increase due to the Salt Lake City acquisition. The remainder of the increase in AEC sales was due to growth in the LEAP program. 
Turning to Slide 4, total company gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 38.1% in Q1, compared to 42.1% in Q1, 2016. The lower gross margin percent reflects the change in the business mix due to higher AEC sales. This trend as you can see on the chart, started in Q2 2016 and we continue to expect this trend to continue as AEC growth accelerates over the next few years. 

MC gross profit margin in Q1 was very good at 48.5% of net sales and somewhat better within the last four quarters. AEC gross profit margin increased to 12.1% of net sales in Q1 2017, compared to 11.5% of net sales in the comparable period last year.
Slide 5 shows net income and adjusted EBITDA by segment for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the total company in Q1 2017 was $43.5 million, compared to $41.3 million in Q1 last year. MC adjusted EBITDA was $48.3 million in the quarter, compared to $49 million in Q1 last year. AEC adjusted EBITDA improved to $5.2 million in the quarter compared to $1.5 million in Q1 last year, as the acquisition added $2.9 million to adjusted EBITDA in the current quarter.
Moving to Slide 6, earnings per share, we reported net income attributable to the company in Q1 of $0.34 per share, compared to $0.42 per share in Q1 of last year. Adjustments for restructuring, foreign currency revaluation and tax adjustments as well as acquisition expenses in Q1 2016 are noted on the slide. 
Excluding the adjustments, net income attributable to the company was $0.46 per share in both Q1, 2017 and Q1 2016. The restructuring in Q1 2017 was centered in AEC and represents an important step in AEC’s efforts to gradually improve profitability. 
Lastly Slide 7 shows our total debt and net debt. Total debt dropped just over $4 million to a balance of about $480 million at the end of Q1. However, with a declining cash balance of approximately $38 million net debt increased $34 million during the quarter. 
Net debt typically increases in Q1 due to incentive compensation payments, seasonal increases in accounts receivable and inventory and high first quarter income tax payments. So a simple cash flow effects for Q1 were compounded by sharp increases in receivables and inventory and capital expenditures associated with multiple program ramps in AEC. 
Payments for all capital expenditures in Q1 were about $25 million consistent with our expectation of full year capital expenditures of between $95 million and $105 million. As we’ve mentioned previously, we expect 2017 and 2018 to be peak years for capital spending due to aggressive program ramps in AEC. At this rate of spending for capital expenditures, we expect additional quarterly increases in net debt for the remainder of the year, but at a considerably lower level than in Q1.
Now I’d like to turn it back to Joe for some additional comments before we go to Q&A.
Joseph Morone
Thanks, John. Turning briefly to our outlook, in Machine Clothing, the market appears stable and we entered Q2 with a good order backlog. So even though we have been anticipating and are seeing some inflationary pressures, Machine Clothing remains on track toward its full year objective of annual Adjusted EBITDA in the middle of that $180 million to $195 million range that we have discussed on numerous occasions. 
For AEC, again, we expect – we continue to expect full year 2017 revenue to be in the 25% to 35% range higher than full year 2016. And for adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of sales to slowly improve. And for the longer term, the intensity of new business development activity in Q1 suggests that there is more upside than downside risk to our current estimate of $450 million to $500 million of revenue by 2020, and that there is considerable potential for substantial growth beyond 2020 as well.
In sum, this is a good quarter for both businesses as MC generated strong adjusted EBITDA, and AEC’s strong growth and again both businesses remain firmly on track toward both their short and long-term goals.
And with that’s let’s go to any questions. Kevin?
Question-and-Answer Session 
Operator 
[Operator Instructions] And the first question is from the line of John Franzreb of Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead.

John Franzreb 
Good morning, Joe and John.
Joseph Morone
Good morning, John. 
John Franzreb 
I’d like to start with the paper mix, as you kind of referenced this in your prepared remarks, you gave us with the publication grades were, you kind of talked to what’s the mix is to the other grades A, and B, can you talk, I think, we are going to kind of bottom out in the degradation of the publication market, or it’s something I think you may want to exit and close it?
Joseph Morone
If you take all of the – let’s take the first question which is the mix, if I understood it correctly, the size packaging. And it’s about 35% of our sales, if you take tissue, pulp, all of the non-wovens and – related grades like corrugated belts it’s about 35% stable to growing, all of the pieces of that have some elements of growth in the marketplace. 
See, if you assume that demand for those grades in aggregate and really the demand for packaging as well, they are G&P type of demand growth out in the marketplace. That tends to translate to slightly lower demand for Machine Clothing growth, but if you figure and you aggregate all of those non-publication grades are growing on the order of 1% from a Machine Clothing consumption. 
That’s a pretty good estimate. We – there are some, as for decline in publication there are some analysts out there who expect some sort of flattening, we have seen no sign of that at all that if you look at Q1, for example, there is – some people argue that where most of the shrinkage in magazine consumption has already taken place and that there is going to be some plateau of consumption of business magazines or fashion magazines. 
But, if you take Q1, look at the trends in advertising and magazines we are down another 16% which is a pretty good predictor of where that industry is going. So, our model does not assume a flattening, it assumes at some point there is going to be a slowdown in the growth, in the shrinkage, but just because it’s becoming such a small piece of the remainder. 
For us, we are just assuming 5% to 10% declines in publications offset by flat to 1% growth in the other grades. That’s what gets us to more or less volume stability over time, gradual diminution of the top-line decline being replaced by more or less flat top-line. 
John Franzreb 
Okay, got it. And switching over to EC, you have some restructuring charges as of the quarter you just reported, but you also said there is some in the coming quarter. Could you just provide some color as to what these charges before? When do you expect to realize the benefits of these actions? And numerically, how much we are talking about and last date going forward?
Joseph Morone
Hi, John, I think the right way to think about this is to go back to our objectives for this business which is to get EBITDA margin from 8% at the end of the last year to 18% to 20% by 2020. And that improvement will be driven by a combination of learning curve efficiencies as we ramp the program which be reflected in greater labor and material productivity. 
Fixed cost leverage both at the gross margin level and in SG&A plus some synergies associated with combining these two organizations. And if you model out a steady ramp in EBITDA margin between now and 2020 and just spread it out evenly and assume all of those forms of productivity improvements are gradually being implemented, you get, I think you get pretty close to what we are expecting. And these steps in Salt Lake are one of the planned measures along the steady improvement journey that we are anticipating and confident about over the next four years. 
John Franzreb 
Okay, all right. But then, how about, in regards to the ramp as of to revenue, I believe you said that’s flat year-over-year, but you are expecting their legacy program to grow significantly in this year. If you talk about which programs are going to hit first and what kinds of growth rates you are agreeing to just that echoes it? 

Joseph Morone
The Boeing fuselage frame program is going through the steepest ramp right now. And the following behind that in terms of ramp is the JSF program that’s starting to ramp a little later than the Boeing program and then among the legacy programs, the missile program at Lockheed JASSM is also showing some growth. 
The CH53-K program which went all of a sudden done will be the largest program with a big ramp doesn’t really ramp until the end of the decade. So, it’s the sequence is, Boeing, JSF, and then CH53-K. But we are seeing also in the important legacy program the missiles, we are seeing some growth potential there as well. 
We are not ready at this point to give you a more precise growth estimate other than the aggregate 25% to 35%, but, first approximation of both LEAP and Salt Lake, look like they are growing at that pace. 
John Franzreb 
One last question and I’ll get back into queue. You talked about your optimism for informal request for proposals.
Joseph Morone
Yes. 
John Franzreb 
You didn’t mention where is it coming from. Was it coming from the Albany let’s call it the legacy business, versus the Albany business tied to LEAP or is the SLC side of the business. Could you kind of tell us where – what’s this underlying demand so far that comes?
Joseph Morone
Yes, this is – I think you could tell us on the tone of my comments, this is a pretty big deal and it’s – I would say, it’s one of the biggest surprises of the acquisition. We knew the acquisition would elevate our profile in the industry, because it took us from primarily in a Saffran shop with some good programs in Rolls-Royce. So mainly in engine shop to really now one of the prominent suppliers in the composites industry. 
And, we knew that we were well positioned on the important growth platforms. But we didn’t fully anticipate was that the timing of that acquisition lined up really well with the timing at which a number of our major OEMs were getting ready for their own ramps and trying to put their own supply chains in order. 
And the net result is coupled with - their need to ramp coupled with our increasing visibility coupled with outstanding execution at our Boerne, in Texas, plus really strong execution on each of the key programs in Salt Lake plus high visibility and good execution in LEAP. 
All of those together, have just increased our profile with all of our key OEMS. So whether it’s Boeing, whether it’s Lockheed, whether it’s Sikorsky, whether it’s GE, whether it’s Saffran, it’s that kind of conversions of they are focused on supply chain and we are executing. That’s what’s really triggered these conversations.
John Franzreb 
Okay. Thanks, Joe, I’ll get back in queue.
Joseph Morone
We keep saying that risk of this business is execution and it did all for growth that this is – this work as we execute and that’s why we just put so much emphasis on operational execution.
John Franzreb 
Thank you.
Operator 
And next question is from the line of Steve Levenson, Big Rock Research. Please go ahead.
Steve Levenson
Thanks, good morning, Joe and John.
Joseph Morone
Hey, Steve.
Steve Levenson
In your remarks and in the press release you mentioned there is more upside than downside related to LEAP and I am wondering if that’s a richer mix of 737 MAX and A-320 NEO? Would you expect the contribution from the Chinese Comac C919, which went for the first time this morning?
Joseph Morone
Yes, that was significant. You know, we – LEAP is the sole source on Comac, sole source on the MAX which is also, according to the COO of Boeing entering into service, the first engine deliveries are this month and then of course, LEAP is being generated, is being delivered as probably flying on about 45 aircrafts now, perhaps more on the NEO side. 
I didn’t mean to suggest that there is more upside on LEAP per se, as this is just really strong execution on the LEAP. We are ramping too, no deviation from CFM and on their expectation to ramp to 2000 engines per year from this year a target of 450 to 500. 

The one really interesting or a couple of interesting pieces out there that suggests there is still upward market pressure is, Boeing’s CEO on their earnings call made it clear that they are overbooked at their current production, planned production rates ramping to 57 planes per month and that there is enough market demand out there to go above 57 planes a month. 
There is also clearly pressure on the Airbus side given the problems with the gear turbo fan is having clear pressure on the Airbus side for CFM to deliver more engines. CFM to its credit has been resisting all pressures from Boeing and Airbus today to ramp up production because, they feel they supply rightly, their supply chain is pushed to the limit. 
Now and what is distinguishing CFM in the marketplace and LEAP in the marketplace is to actually delivering what they have promised. So you don’t want to push their supply chain too soon to go to higher rates because the last time they want to do is compromise their validation of their well earned reputation that when they promise something, they deliver it. 
Steve Levenson
Okay, thanks. Just got here a couple more quick questions. If it’s not from volume, then can you comment a little bit, and I know, you can’t go into index, but on you are seeing out of your factory on the production of the blades?
Joseph Morone
We are really happy with the yields and if you look at any historical standard of composite parts being introduced on to the engine, and we are talking rotating parts, these aren’t secondary parts, these are primary parts. This is a real success story. Now, we still have more improvements to go and on a daily basis, we are working with our customer on those improvements, but this is a good story and we are delighted with the progress so far. Let’s say we are right on track for what we need to do to hit the ramp.
Steve Levenson
Okay, thanks. And you talked about CFM, with existing pressure, do you see any weak links? Do you hear anything about weak links in the supply chain that could constrain the production ramp at all?
Joseph Morone
Well, no. But the way that translates to us would be – are we seeing any diminution of pressure to ramps at a breathtaking speed and the answer is no, we are not. So our two datapoints are number one, we are watching CFM’s customers as it takes for more output and on the other hand we are feeling – we are not feeling any diminution of pressure for us to meet the targets that we’ve been handed. 
Steve Levenson
Got it. Thank you. One other question related to LEAP is, there has been some chatter in a few trade journal articles about Boeing and the thinking on a mid-size aircraft in the CFM is beginning to think about the engine that it could supply which they said is not a LEAP, but I would imagine is some derivation from the LEAP. Would you expect continuous composite fan blades in case it’s really the more material in a new engine would compatible with playing that size?
Joseph Morone
Well, it does feel soon, you’ve seen this a number of times already, but there – we are clearly in the multi-dimensional chess, the stage of the multi-dimensional chess game now where everybody is positioning against everybody else. So clearly Boeing is trying to position against itself against Airbus for that gap in the market. I think it would be on the stake and I’ll underestimate the impact that Comac’s emergence it is having in Boeing’s thinking as well, it’s not just about Airbus. 
And like, so that’s number one, number two, it’s clear that Boeing is trying to when emphasizing the development cost associated with its business plans, it’s clear it’s trying to signal to its suppliers both engine and airframes that they expect if you are going to play on the new middle market aircrafts, so you are going to have to pay part of the development cost and it was interesting that Saffran’s CEO clearly up the entity on his earnings call by saying yes, we are interested, yes, we are in, yes, we are talking to Boeing about this. 

Yes, it fits within the CFM agreement. All I can tell you about whether there will be composites on that new engine and what that new engine will look like is, Saffran has in CFM is responsible for the fan module and the low pressured turbine. It has made a big bet on 3D woven composites for its future architectures and the fan module. 
So if Boeing pulls the trigger and CFM wins or the one if it’s going to be two engines prior, those one of the engine suppliers, any advanced composites on that engine has to go through any 3D woven composites on that engine has to go through Albany Saffran Composite have to be manufactured in our division. 
Steve Levenson
Got it. Sounds great, thanks. And one last question related to Machine Clothing. Since you still see declines in the publishing grade, do you think you’ll get to the point, where the demand for packaging and tissue exceeds the decline in publishing grades such that there will be little growth in that business?
Joseph Morone
We think it’s – we really like this business. It’s a great business. The long lived installed base generates a lot of cash because of the value created for the customers, but we just think it’s a track run just to think if this is a growth business. 
The other grades will have some growth, but publication will continue to decline, but more importantly even where the grades have growth, there is enough innovation going on in our industry that the lives of our products extend just enough with innovation to wipe out whatever incremental growth there might be from the growth in those grades. 
So, we are very careful to always tell investors think of this as a flat adjusted EBITDA business in that range of $180 million to $195 million and a piece of that flat going forward is stable volume, stable top-line or stabilizing top-line. We just think it’s a trap to thing that’s going to grow. And if it does, that’s upside.
Steve Levenson
Okay, appreciate the – all the details. Thanks very much. 
Joseph Morone
Thanks, Steve.
Operator 
[Operator Instructions] And we do have a question from the line of John Franzreb with Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead.
John Franzreb 
Just looking with the P&C side of the business, Joe. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive landscape? Are there any sizable material contracts up for bid this year and what your take is on industry path to be right now and the pricing environment? 
Joseph Morone
We are not seeing anything right now that would alter the dynamics of the industry. I mean, it’s never say never, but right now, it’s all of the patterns that we’ve seen over the years from publication being displaced by digital media, packaging tissue and pulp and non-wovens growing to offset that. Long-term growth in paper production in Asia, all those trends continue. 
The pricing pressures we think are heavily driven by industry structure both in our customer and in our Machine Clothing industry. So, downstream in those geographies, where there is overcapacity in our customer base that translates to pricing pressure on our industry and then in our industry, where there is overcapacity that in turn translates into pricing pressure to us and our competitors. 
When those two line up together, overcapacity in our customer base plus overcapacity in our industry, the pricing pressure was most intense. So, that’s Europe. Asia, there is strong pricing pressure, but it’s at least as I tried to allude to in my commentary, it’s a least somewhat mitigated by volume growth in Asia, particularly in packaging. 
There is less – the paper industry is more consolidated in the Americas. The Machine Clothing industry is more consolidated in the Americas. So, while it’s really a struggle to get any kind of price relief in the Americas, there isn’t the same – price pressure that there is in Europe and Asia. None of that has changed. That’s where we’ve been really since we came out of the recession and that’s just the way of life. We don’t see anything right now that would alter that dynamic either for the good or the bad. 

John Franzreb 
Okay and your take on with capacity in the industry, if you could? 
Joseph Morone
I think there is – the industry has – our industry, Machine Clothing with overcapacity in Europe, with a lot of competition in Asia, it’s hard to say overcapacity, because there is so much growth, but there is – there are lot of competitors there including emerging competitors. So, and that’s the predictor of pricing pressure. 
John Franzreb 
Okay, got it. And can you just update us on the composites initiatives as the automotive market obviously spoke about it sometime maybe an overview of some people – want to be helpful and where we stand?
Joseph Morone
Yes, so we keep talking about these three categories of growth opportunity and so, new business potential on existing aerospace platforms, on new aerospace platforms, and then, via diversification. The surprise, as I mentioned before, as I’ve expressed in the last couple of quarters that how much potential there is on the first of those, because we would have expected that to be pretty much washed out and it’s not. 
There is a lot of growth potential there. Steve, in his questions pointed to what we see as the single biggest and potentially very large opportunity in the second category which is the potential for Boeing new middle of market aircraft and that is when you get a big new commercial platform that you get the opportunities, waves of opportunities as well as there is a scramble among suppliers to position themselves when that occurs. 
And there will be opportunities both on the airframe and on the engine. On the diversification, we keep seeing opportunities to diversify across a diversity of fields from downward drilling, body armor to applications in the space, but we keep coming back to the same reality, nothing is as big a market for light weight impact resistant composites to think of a side impact being in a car, if you can make that lighter weight, but still impact resistant just the way of fan blades. 
Our fan blades can resist a bird’s dry kit. You can see the potential application for the same kind of composites that we make on the automotive – in the automotive industry. The challenge in automotive – we’ve discussed before is it has to get to a significantly different price point in order to break through a serious way. 
So, it’s the R&D we’ve been doing over the last two years in collaboration with people in the automotive industry as has been to understand how far down we can drive cost, particularly cost of the materials and how much degradation of material of performance that is the impact resistance do we get as we drive down the cost curve. 
We are making good technical progress in that exploration, we are not yet at the point where we think it’s worth pushing hard on the commercial application, we see potential applications at the very high end, but they are one-offs and given – given all of the opportunity that we are seeing now in the aerospace side, a one-off application in automotive isn’t worth it. 
So, we – and this is some of the advice we are getting from the automotive – from the big OEMs too is, yes, what will turn their heads is when we can show a clear pathway from that high-end super-performing vehicle down to the middle of market. 
And right now, our view is let’s continue to push on the cost performance through R&D until we see a pathway down into a larger part of the market before we start seriously considering the capital investment required on that side. So this is still R&D pro mode. 
I think if anything has changed in the past year, it is on the hand, we made technical progress, but on the other hand the opportunity cost over on the composites, on the aerospace side look a lot bigger now than they did before. There is a target rich environment in the space we are already in and so it gives us more patience, if you will, on the automotive side. 

So we are probing, but it’s looking more like a mid next decade commercial application than anything immediate. And we think it would be a trap right now to go after the early applications, because they are feeling like one-offs.
John Franzreb 
Got it. Thank you, Joe.
Operator 
All right. The next question is from the line of Greg Vasse, Times Square Capital. Please go ahead.
Joseph Morone
Hey, Greg.
Gregory Vasse
Good morning, Joe, and John. How are you guys doing?
Joseph Morone
Good, how are you?
Gregory Vasse
Good, good. Hey, are you guys willing to, I guess, provide any color on the progression of AEC sales through the quarter? It seems like, comps might get a little bit more difficult by the fourth quarter and additionally should we see revenue growth remain fairly linear from 2017 to 2018? Or should we start to decelerate into the end of 2018 as we start to comp some larger numbers? Thanks. 
Joseph Morone
Well, what we’ve said so far is, 25% to 35% full year growth between 2016 and 2017 and then another 25% to 35% full year growth from 2017 to 2018. And there should be – we haven’t guided, but that doesn’t get you the $450 million to $500 million with upside by 2020. So there is clearly – so if you take those two numbers, and then project out to 2020, you will see there is still more growth there. 
So, there will still be positive comps. We are – it’s a little difficult to math this business on year-over-year quarterly comps. We think it’s a much more reliable to look at full year comparisons 2016 versus 2017 versus 2018, because the actual flow through the year can be a little bit lumpy. As we’ve seen in the past, Q4 has been a big quarter and I think that will become less of a factor and really just the demands on the particular timing demands on the ramps will become more of a factor that drives the sequential projection. 
For this year, clearly, if we are reiterating our 25% to 35% growth guidance, and we had $56 million of sales in Q1, we are going to have to be – to hit our guidance, we are going to have to be in the $65 million to $70 plus million per quarter range for the rest of the year and yes we will hit that guidance. I reiterated that guidance several times today, so yes, that’s we do expect to see a step-up from Q1.
Gregory Vasse
Great, great. And given the AEC, what really had it stride until the end of the decade, when show up its full production valuing the segment is a little bit more of a DCF exercise at this point. So, as such, what kind of EBITDA to free cash flow conversion should we be computing for full production?
Joseph Morone
Well, there are two – if you think about the free cash flow, I think you can take our guidance we’ve given on EBITDA to map out where EBITDA comes out in 2020. We’ve given you a range for Machine Clothing and we’ve said 18% to 20% EBITDA margins on $450 million to $500 million in sales by 2020. So the variables to work with are essentially CapEx and changes in working capital, but the big one is CapEx. 
And unless we are seeing big waves of new investments as new programs come on, we are sticking with our estimate of average CapEx between 2016 and 2020 total company of $80 million. And 2017 and 2018, it will be above $80 million, 2019 and 2020, it should be below $80 million. 
But just be conservative, take our projections of CapEx – of EBITDA for 2020, subtract out $80 million of CapEx, make some interest will be coming down, the taxes will be going up, dividends will probably be up a little bit, if the Board wants to go there. So, you put all that together, there should be substantial free cash after dividends, after CapEx, after taxes in 2020, if we hit our targets, if we perform.
Gregory Vasse
Excellent, great color guys. Last one for me. We are starting to reach a nice level of contract diversity within AEC and given the – still a fair amount of applications that can switch to composites in the future and you have a nice runway to higher content per plane or whatever it is that you’ll be putting the composites on. 

Would you be strategically disadvantaging yourself if you ever were to split these two businesses in the medium-term and lose that PMC cash generation that could be rolled in the AEC development? So I am just wondering, should we think about if the opportunity is or even richer for you would that maybe prolong the amount of time that would make sense for both of your segments to stay together as a unified business, maybe just provide some color on that. Thanks.
Joseph Morone
Greg, first of all thanks for the – thanks for getting on the call and asking the questions. But, as John and I have tried to describe to – pretty much every investor we talk to over time is, that question about is a future structure of the company is premature for now at some point if you can model – if you do your models, it’s pretty clear by the end of the decade, AEC will be cash flow positive and ready to standalone and our Board will view those questions as it constantly does through the lens of how do you maximize the net present value of future shareholder returns. 
We are all shareholders, that’s how we think about the question. And you can’t judge today where everything will play out in 2020 or 2019 or 2021 or whenever it is, but the two key points that are very clear in our minds, Machine Clothing is a great business. 
It is a long lived business with – where you have an opportunity to generate serious value for your customers which translates into recurring cash flow. And a second concept that is firmly embedded in our heads is, we believe outside growth compared to market is the best pathway to long-term shareholder value. 
And so the more pressure, the more opportunity we see for growth on the AEC side because a better the marriage between the two companies – the two businesses feels. And I am not trying to prejudge where we go, or how the Board would decide out there, but, this we like the cash flow and grow combination and if you can sustain one and accelerate growth in the other, that’s so far has led to really good returns for our shareholders over the last five years. 
Gregory Vasse
Excellent. Take care guys. Thanks.
Joseph Morone
Thanks, Greg. 
Operator 
Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jim Foung at Gabelli. Please go ahead.
James Foung
Hi, good morning. 
Joseph Morone
Hey, Jim. 
James Foung
Came into the call late here. So apologize if the question has been asked. But, Joe, I was just wondering, if you could just talk a little bit about the LEAP engines forecast has CFM kind of many changes to the engine forecast expect to go by in 2017 and 2018? 
Joseph Morone
We talked a little bit about it, Jim. But, in essence, they have not changed.
James Foung
Okay.
Joseph Morone
It’s still 500 this year, I think 1100 next year.
James Foung
Right.
Joseph Morone
Then 1800 and 2000 plus. What’s interesting is, that there is market pressure to do more.
James Foung
Right.
Joseph Morone
And it’s coming from both sides. That’s coming from Boeing which is saying they are overbooked at their current ramp rate and could support more than 57 planes a month by 2019, 2020. And Airbus, which has customers who are – needs - who are not being satisfied with the competitor to LEAP and so there is pressure there for more engines. 
But CFM, in our view to their credit have resisted those pressures because they know that this ramp is an unprecedented ramp and so their supply chain is already stretched. CFM’s reputation is heavily built around reliability, delivery of performance that they promise. Their engines are in fact being delivered on-time and are hitting, the LEAP engines are hitting performance targets. 
So, it’s more important to CFM to meet their commitments, meet their obligations, preserve their reputation then to stretch the supply chain to a point where they start running into trouble. But, that said, all of the market pressures are in the right direction right now. But no, there hasn’t been any change to the ramp.

James Foung
So that’s a good problem for… 
Joseph Morone
Yes, it’s a good problem.
James Foung
For you.
Joseph Morone
Yes.
James Foung
And could you just break out that $56 million in AEC sales? How much of that was just LEAP versus everything else?
Joseph Morone
$20 million was Salt Lake. 10-ish was our legacy business. The rest was 25-ish with LEAP.
James Foung
Okay, right. Okay, and then, today there is an article on China…
Joseph Morone
Comac.
James Foung
Yes, potentially flying the Comac C919.
Joseph Morone
Yes.
James Foung
I assume that’s what engine they are using, if they are using the LEAP or CFM. I think they are using…
Joseph Morone
They are using LEAP. 
James Foung
The LEAP, okay.
Joseph Morone
They are using LEAP. LEAP is the exclusive supplier for the C919.
James Foung
Oh, okay. 
Joseph Morone
Which had its flight test today.
James Foung
Right, right. 
Joseph Morone
So, LEAP is exclusive on Comac, exclusive on the Boeing MAX and shares the NEO with Pratt.
James Foung
So that’s another pause. I mean, did CFM factor in kind of engines for the Comac? Okay.
Joseph Morone
Yes, it is.
James Foung
Okay, I mean, it remains to be seen how if they were to keep their schedule, I think entering to service is like, they talk about mix share or is it something or?
Joseph Morone
Yes, and Jim, I think the more important impact of the C 919, since CFM has built its engine ramp projections with the C 919 in mind, the more important variable to watch here is, if the C 919 starts succeeding and start pulling share from Boeing and Airbus, you will see reaction from Boeing and Airbus. And the reaction is going to be in the form – I think history teaches is in the form of innovation more pressure to introduce performance improvements on their engines or on their planes, more pressure to move forward with next generation single line – for example sooner than they had anticipated. That kind of competitive pressure for a supplier like us who got a differentiated product usually leads to good things. That creates more demand for innovation, for higher performance, so.
James Foung
It’s another best way…
Joseph Morone
That will play out over next decade. 
James Foung
Are you guys using opportunity to bid on new airplanes, I mean, should take a look. 
Joseph Morone
That’s to the extent that C 919 becomes a disruptor enforces Airbus and Boeing to do more than they wanted, yes. 
James Foung
If they became just a disruptor in China, would you most likely – what will happen versus the rest of the world? Is that enough of a change for Boeing and Airbus to be more in…
Joseph Morone
The Chinese market is the most important… 
James Foung
Right.
Joseph Morone
Growth market in the aerospace industry.
James Foung
Right.
Joseph Morone
Than any other market, but if you look at Boeing’s and Airbus’s projections for the next 20 years of demand for aircrafts, there is replacements of existing aircraft and then there is passenger flight mile growth. And a lot of that growth and therefore a lot of the growth and demand is in Asia in general and China in particular. So, yes, and they had modeled in, in their forecast the expectation that Comac would penetrate the markets with a certain amount if Comac overperforms and starts disrupting that market, yes, that’s something to watch in - with the dynamics of the industry next decade very carefully.
James Foung
Right, okay. And then just last one for me, just on the CH53-K helicopter. So, that’s been proved – so they’ve got funding on that and just wondering, you talk about the long-term opportunity, but is there any near-term opportunity, like any impact to revenues in this year or next year?
Joseph Morone
No, that was – we’ve built into our estimate of $450 million to $500 million with upside in 2020, that assume the ramp rate that for the CH53-K that the Marines and Sikorsky have been talking about which is, but, one a year going to, three or four a year by 2020 getting to its full ramp up in 2023, 2024, and 2025. So, our investor package estimates $35 million to $45 million of revenue per year by 2020 growing to a lot more than that. And once it’s fully ramped and this year, that program will probably be closer to 10-ish million, $7 million that will ramp from this year to 2020 and then from 2020 to 2024, 2025.

James Foung
Great, okay. Thanks so much. That’s all I had. 
Joseph Morone
Thank you, Jim. Thank you for the questions.

  Albany International Corp (AIN) Ichimoku Reveals Positive Momentum

						Albany International Corp (AIN) Ichimoku Reveals Positive Momentum					











Shares of Albany International Corp (AIN) opened the last session at $54.60, touching a high of $54.65 and a low of $53.75 , yielding a change of -0.55.  The latest reading places the stock above the Ichimoku cloud which indicates positive momentum and a potential buy signal for the equity.  
The Ichimoku cloud is a favorite technical indicator used primarily in Asian markets. The cloud is one of the only indicators that is both forward and backward looking. The cloud produces better levels of support and resistance and is a breakout trader’s best friend. The cloud is also one of the easiest indicators to use. Any trader, regardless of skill level or expertise, can use the cloud to quickly and efficiently analyze any product on any time frame. The cloud shines in the fact that it can be universally applied to any trading plan by any trader.
 It is a type of chart used in technical analysis to display support and resistance, momentum, and trend in one view. TenkanSen and KijunSen are similar to moving averages and analyzed in relationship to one another. When the shorter term indicator, TenkanSen, rises above the longer term indicator, KijunSen, the securities trend is typically positive. When TenkanSen falls below KijunSen, the securities trend is typically negative. TenkanSen and KijunSen as a group are then analyzed in relationship to the Cloud, which is composed of the area between Senkou A and Senkou B. A multi-faceted indicator designed to give support/resistance levels, trend direction, and entry/exit points of varying strengths. General theory behind this indicator states that if price action is above the cloud, the overall trend is bullish, and if below the cloud, the overall trend is bearish. There are also moving averages (the Tenkan and Kijun lines) which act like the MACD crossover signals with the Tenkan crossing from underneath the Kijun as a bullish signal, while crossing overhead giving a bearish signal.
It is no secret that most investors have the best of intentions when diving into the equity markets. Making sound, informed decisions can help the investor make the most progress when dealing with the markets. Often times, investors may think they have everything in order, but they still come out on the losing end. Investors may need to figure out ways to keep emotion out of stock picking. Sometimes trading on emotions can lead to poor results. Making hasty decisions and not paying attention to the correct data can lead to poor performing portfolios in the long-term.
Checking on some popular technical levels, Albany International Corp (AIN) has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of 27.21. The CCI technical indicator can be employed to help figure out if a stock is entering overbought or oversold territory. CCI may also be used to help discover divergences that may signal reversal moves. A CCI closer to +100 may provide an overbought signal, and a CCI near -100 may provide an oversold signal.
Tracking other technical indicators, the 14-day RSI is presently standing at 58.61, the 7-day sits at 52.63, and the 3-day is resting at 41.59 for Albany International Corp (AIN). The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a highly popular technical indicator. The RSI is computed base on the speed and direction of a stock’s price movement. The RSI is considered to be an internal strength indicator, not to be confused with relative strength which is compared to other stocks and indices. The RSI value will always move between 0 and 100. One of the most popular time frames using RSI is the 14-day. 
Moving averages have the ability to be used as a powerful indicator for technical stock analysis. Following multiple time frames using moving averages can help investors figure out where the stock has been and help determine where it may be possibly going. The simple moving average is a mathematical calculation that takes the average price (mean) for a given amount of time. Currently, the 7-day moving average is sitting at 53.91.
Let’s take a further look at the Average Directional Index or ADX. The ADX measures the strength or weakness of a particular trend. Investors and traders may be looking to figure out if a stock is trending before employing a specific trading strategy. The ADX is typically used along with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) which point to the direction of the trend. The 14-day ADX for Albany International Corp (AIN) is currently at 24.95. In general, and ADX value from 0-25 would represent an absent or weak trend. A value of 25-50 would support a strong trend. A value of 50-75 would signify a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would point to an extremely strong trend.

July 24--Albany International forecasts $16m loss
Union Leader staff
July 23. 2017 10:49PM
------

Albany International Corp. CEO Joseph Morone said the company is still on track to grow revenue this year 25 to 35 percent. (UNION LEADER FILE)
-- Albany International Corp. said it expects to record a second-quarter pre-tax charge of approximately $16 million associated with revisions in the estimated profitability of two contracts in its Rochester-based Albany Engineered Composites segment.
The charge, which will be recorded as part of the company's second-quarter financial results Aug. 1, is due to second-quarter 2017 downward revisions of estimated customer demand for the components manufactured by the composites segment related to the two contracts, the company said in a news release.
Albany International has a contract to manufacture composite components for the Rolls-Royce BR 725 engine, which powers Gulfstream's G-650 business jet. The contract obligates the company to supply the components for the life of the BR 725 program.
During the second quarter, Albany revised its estimate of the profitability of the contract and determined that an additional charge of approximately $10 million should be recorded as a provision for anticipated losses through the end of the program.
The charge is driven primarily by a reduction in the estimated future demand for these components, Albany said. The company previously recorded a charge of $14 million in the second quarter of 2015 for the program, including $11 million for the write-off of development costs for nonrecurring engineering and tooling, and $3 million for anticipated future losses.
Albany Engineered Composites's subsidiary, Albany Aerospace Composites LLC, has a contract to make composite struts for the Airbus A380, under which it is obligated to supply composite wing box struts through 2020 and floor beam struts through 2023.
During the second quarter, the company revised its estimate of the profitability of the contract and determined that a charge of approximately $6 million should be recorded as a provision for anticipated losses through contract completion. The revision is driven by a decrease in estimated demand for these components during the contract term, as well as by program inefficiencies.
"Unlike AEC's key growth and legacy programs, these two programs are exposed to the weakest segments in the commercial aerospace market -- business jets and super wide-bodies," CEO Joseph Morone said in a statement. "We do not consider either program to be strategic or material to AEC's growth prospects."
Combined revenue of the contracts for the first quarter was $1.1 million, the company said.
"We are meeting customer expectations in both programs, but because of very challenging legacy contracts, we lost money on both in Q1 2017 and had been expecting both programs to continue to lose money for several more years before turning profitable," Morone said.
Albany International is on track to grow revenue 25 to 35 percent this year, said Morone, citing what he noted in the company's first-quarter release. He said the company has the potential for revenue to reach $450 million to $500 million by 2020.
"While the recording of these projected future losses will obviously have a material impact on Q2 results, our outlook for AEC -- both in 2017 and beyond -- remains unchanged."

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Management's Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of the Company. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes.  Business Environment Overview and Trends  Our reportable segments, Machine Clothing (MC) and Albany Engineered Composites (AEC) draw on the same advanced textiles and materials processing capabilities, and compete on the basis of proprietary, product-based advantage that is grounded in those core capabilities.  The Machine Clothing segment is the Company's long-established core business and primary generator of cash. While the paper and paperboard industry in our traditional geographic markets has suffered from well-documented declines in publication grades, the industry is still expected to grow slightly on a global basis, driven by demand for packaging and tissue grades, as well as the expansion of paper consumption and production in Asia and South America. We feel we are now well-positioned in these markets, with high-quality, low-cost production in growth markets, substantially lower fixed costs in mature markets, and continued strength in new product development, field services, and manufacturing technology. Because of pricing pressures and industry overcapacity, the machine clothing and paper industries will continue to face top line pressure. Nonetheless the business has potential for flat earnings in the future. It has been a significant generator of cash, and we seek to maintain the cash-generating potential of this business by maintaining the low costs that we achieved through restructuring, and competing vigorously by using our differentiated products and services to reduce our customers' total cost of operation and improve their paper quality.  The AEC segment provides significant growth potential for our Company both near and long term. Our strategy is to grow by focusing our proprietary technology on high-value aerospace and defense applications that cannot be served effectively by conventional composites. AEC (including Albany Safran Composites, LLC ("ASC"), in which our customer SAFRAN Group owns a 10 percent noncontrolling interest) supplies a number of customers in the aerospace industry. AEC's largest aerospace customer is the SAFRAN Group. Through ASC, AEC develops and sells composite aerospace components to SAFRAN, with the most significant program at present being the production of fan blades and other components for the LEAP engine. AEC (through ASC and otherwise) is also developing other new and potentially significant composite products for aerospace (engine and airframe) applications. Other growth programs of note are the fan case for the GE9X engine, and composite parts for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) LiftFan (R) for Rolls Royce. AEC is actively engaged in research to develop new applications in the aircraft engine, airframes, and automotive markets.  Consolidated Results of Operations  Net sales  The following table summarizes our net sales by business segment:  (in thousands, except percentages)  Years ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Machine Clothing $608,581 $655,026 $674,747 Albany Engineered Composites 101,287 90,319 82,667 Total $709,868 $745,345 $757,414 % change -4.8 % -1.6 %  2015 vs. 2014  � Changes in currency translation rates had the effect of decreasing net sales by $39.6 million during 2015, compared to 2014 due to the broad weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar.  � Excluding the effect of changes in currency translation rates:  � Consolidated Net sales increased 0.6%.  � Net sales in MC decreased 1.3%.  � Net sales in AEC increased 13.9%.  � Excluding the effect of changes in currency translation rates, the year-over-year decline in MC segment sales was primarily attributable to lower sales in the North American printing and writing markets.  � The AEC segment sales increase was due to higher sales related to the LEAP and GE9X programs.  2014 vs. 2013  � Changes in currency translation rates had the effect of decreasing net sales by $3.6 million during 2014 compared to 2013.  � Excluding the effect of changes in currency translation rates:  � Net sales were down 1.1% compared to 2013.  � Net sales in MC decreased 2.4%.  � Net sales in AEC increased 9.3%.  � The year-over-year decline in MC segment sales was primarily attributable to lower sales in the Americas, which were negatively impacted by certain mill closures by key customers.  � The AEC segment sales increase was due to higher sales related to the LEAP and Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) LiftFan (R) programs.  Backlog  Backlog in the Machine Clothing segment was $171.0 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $195.5 million at December 31, 2014. The decrease reflects a trend toward shorter order-to-delivery times. Backlog in the Albany Engineered Composites segment was $34.0 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $22.8 million at December 31, 2014. The backlog in each segment is generally expected to be invoiced during the next 12 months.  Gross Profit The following table summarizes gross profit by business segment: (in thousands, except percentages) Years ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Machine Clothing $286,847 $282,300 $289,100 Albany Engineered Composites (6,596 ) 10,750 4,799 Corporate expenses (1,565 ) (1,415 ) (3,345 ) Total $278,686 $291,635 $290,554 % of Net Sales 39.3 % 39.1 % 38.4 %  The decrease in gross profit during 2015 was principally due to the net effect of the following individually significant items:  � The increase in MC gross profit was principally due to the effect on raw materials and freight that resulted from lower crude oil costs.  � The decrease in AEC gross profit was principally due to a charge of $14.0 million for a revision in the contract profitability of its BR 725 program which is a long-term manufacturing contract in the Boerne, Texas facility.  The increase in gross profit during 2014 was principally due to the net effect of the following individually significant items:  � The reduction in MC net sales described above resulted in a gross profit decrease of $8.5 million.  � A decrease of $7.5 million in Cost of goods sold resulting from restructuring activities.  � An increase in Cost of goods sold from inflation on direct labor and manufacturing overhead expenses, of approximately $2.6 million and $1.9 million, respectively.  � A $1.6 million charge to Cost of goods sold in 2014 to correct an error in the value of Machine Clothing inventories reported in prior periods.  � AEC's Boerne, Texas operation increased gross profit by $5.0 million, principally due to operational improvements that resulted in lower Cost of goods sold.  � A $1.9 million reduction in cost associated with the Company's U.S. postretirement plan, principally resulting from plan changes in 2013. These costs are reported as Corporate expenses in the table above.  Selling, Technical, General, and Research (STG&R) The following table summarizes STG&R by business segment: (in thousands, except percentages) Years ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Machine Clothing $123,325 $141,023 $150,164 Albany Engineered Composites 21,882 20,301 18,663 Corporate expenses 45,738 45,002 44,528 Total $190,945 $206,326 $213,355 % of Net Sales 26.9 % 27.7 % 28.2 %  The decrease in STG&R expenses in 2015 in comparison to 2014, was principally due to the net effect of the following individually significant items:  � Changes in currency translation rates reduced MC STG&R costs by $13.5 million.  � MC revaluation of nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities resulted in gains of $5.1 million during 2015 and gains of $3.9 million in 2014.  � Restructuring activities and reduced travel in MC each resulted in a $2.7 million decline in STG&R.  The decrease in STG&R expenses in 2014 in comparison to 2013, was principally due to the net effect of the following individually significant items:  � Revaluation of nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities, primarily in the MC segment, which resulted in gains of $3.9 million during 2014 and losses of $0.3 million in 2013.  � Currency translation effects, primarily in the MC segment, which decreased STG&R by $2.8 million compared to 2013.  � An increase of $2.2 million due to research and development activities associated with new technology platforms in the MC segment.  � A reduction of approximately $1.8 million in 2014 due to reduced travel and lower costs for pensions in the MC segment.  � An increase of $1.6 million in the AEC segment, principally due to increased research activities.  � A gain on the sale of a former manufacturing facility in Australia, which reduced 2013 Corporate expenses by $3.8 million, which was mostly offset by reductions in Corporate expenses for research, professional fees, health care expenses and incentive compensation in 2014.  Research and Development The following table summarizes expenses associated with internally funded research and development by business segment: (in thousands) Years ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Machine Clothing $19,838 $20,575 $18,335 Albany Engineered Composites 11,042 11,050 10,065 Corporate expenses 868 745 1,820 Total $31,748 $32,370 $30,220  Pension Plan Settlement Charges  In 2014, certain participants of the U.S. pension plan were notified of a limited-time opportunity whereby they could elect to receive the value of their pension benefit in a lump-sum payment. All lump-sum payments were funded from pension plan assets and were paid during 2014. The initiative was part of the Company's pension plan de-risking strategy, and resulted in a non-cash settlement charge of $8.2 million in 2014.  Restructuring In addition to the items discussed above affecting gross profit, STG&R, and pension settlement charges, operating income was affected by restructuring costs of $23.8 million in 2015, $5.8 million in 2014, and $25.1 million in 2013. The following table summarizes restructuring expense by business segment: (in thousands) Years ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Machine Clothing $22,211 $4,828 $24,568 Albany Engineered Composites - 931 540 Corporate expenses 1,635 - - Total $23,846 $5,759 $25,108  In 2015, the Company announced a plan to discontinue manufacturing operations at its press fabric manufacturing facility in G�ppingen, Germany and manufacturing operations were discontinued during the second quarter. The restructuring program was driven by the Company's need to balance manufacturing capacity with demand. Approximately 50 employees were terminated under this plan, and the estimated severance payments were recorded in the first quarter of 2015. We recorded charges of $11.4 million related to this restructuring, including $3.3 million related to the write down of the land and former manufacturing facility to estimated fair market value. Cost savings associated with this action will reduce Cost of goods sold in future periods.  In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company implemented an early retirement program for certain employees in the United States. Restructuring charges associated with this restructuring program were $8.1 million. Cost savings from this initiative are expected to be $5 million to $6 million and will reduce STG&R expenses, most of which will be recognized in 2016.  2015 restructuring charges also includes $4.3 million related to the reduction in STG&R employment in Machine Clothing and Corporate. Machine Clothing restructuring costs in 2014 and 2013 were principally related to restructuring of manufacturing operations in France, where employment was reduced by approximately 200 positions.  Albany Engineered Composites restructuring expenses in 2014 and 2013 were principally related to organizational changes and exiting certain aerospace programs.  For more information on our restructuring charges, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.  Operating Income The following table summarizes operating income/(loss) by business segment: (in thousands) Years ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Machine Clothing $141,311 $136,450 $114,370 Albany Engineered Composites (28,478 ) (10,483 ) (14,404 ) Corporate expenses-pension settlement - (8,190 ) - Corporate expenses-other (48,938 ) (46,417 ) (47,875 ) Total $63,895 $71,360 $52,091  Other Earnings Items (in thousands) Years ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Interest expense, net $9,984 $10,713 $13,759 Other expense/(income), net 2,433 (6,853 ) 7,256 Income tax (benefit)/expense (5,787 ) 25,751 13,372 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax - - (46 ) Net (loss)/income attributable to the noncontrolling interest (14 ) 180 141  Interest Expense, net  Interest expense, net, decreased $0.7 million in 2015 and $3.0 million in 2014 principally due to lower average interest rates. See the Capital Resources section for further discussion of borrowings and interest rates.  Other Expense/(Income), net  The decrease in Other expense/(income), net included the following individually significant items:  � Foreign currency revaluations of cash and intercompany balances resulted in losses of $1.5 million in 2015, gains of $6.4 million in 2014, and losses of $5.2 million in 2013.  � In July 2013, the Company's MC manufacturing facility in Germany was damaged by severe weather. The insurance recovery gain resulted in income of $1.1 million in 2014.  Income Taxes  The Company has operations which constitute a taxable presence in 18 countries outside of the United States. All of these countries except one had income tax rates that were lower than the United States federal tax  rate of 35% during the periods reported. The jurisdictional location of earnings is a significant component of our effective tax rate each year and therefore on our overall income tax expense.  The Company's effective tax rate for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 was (11.2%), 38.1% and 43.0%, respectively. The tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as the income tax rate in the U.S. and in non-U.S. jurisdictions and the mix of income earned in those jurisdictions. The rate is also affected by U.S. tax costs on foreign earnings that have been or will be repatriated to the U.S., and discrete items that may occur in any given year but are not consistent from year to year.  Significant items that impacted the 2015 tax rate included the following (percentages reflect the effect of each item as a percentage of income before income taxes):   A tax benefit of $28.6 million (-55.5%) for a worthless stock deduction related to the Company's investment in its Germany subsidiary, where manufacturing operations have ceased.   A tax charge of $6.4 million (12.5%) related to the estimated settlement of the German step-up appeal.   A tax charge of $0.4 million (0.8%) related to uncertain tax positions.   A $0.5 million (-0.9%) net tax benefit related to other discrete items.   A net effective tax rate reduction of 6.2% was recognized from income tax rate differences between non-U.S. jurisdictions and the U.S. rate. Earnings in Brazil, Switzerland, Mexico and China, where tax rates are lower than the U.S. rate of 35%, contributed to the majority of the reduction noted. Additionally, the net effect of a U.S. tax benefit on foreign earnings that have been or will be repatriated, and foreign withholdings resulted in a reduction of 1.8% to the effective tax rate.   Income tax rate on continuing operations, excluding discrete items, was 32%.  Significant items that impacted the 2014 tax rate included the following (percentages reflect the effect of each item as a percentage of income before income taxes):   Tax charge of $7.5 million (11.1%), primarily related to an unfavorable outcome in the tax court pertaining to another taxpayer with similar facts to the Company.   A net tax benefit was recognized in the amount of $6.8 million (-10.0%) primarily due to the lapse in a tax statute.   A $0.3 million (0.3%) net tax expense related to other discrete items.   A net tax rate reduction of 10.2% was recognized from rate differences between non-U.S. and U.S. jurisdictions. Earnings in Brazil, Switzerland, and China, where tax rates are lower than the U.S. notional rate of 35%, contributed to the majority of the reduction noted. U.S. tax costs on foreign earnings and foreign withholdings offset the tax rate benefits gained from operating in low tax jurisdictions by 8%. Included in the U.S. tax costs on foreign earnings is a $2.2 million (3.3%) expense recognized for the future repatriation of prior year earning   Income tax rate on continuing operations, excluding discrete items, was 34%.  Significant items that impacted the 2013 tax rate included the following:   A discrete charge of $1.8 million (5.7%) related to the settlement of a competent authority claim with U.S. and France.   A discrete tax benefit of $3.7 million (-12.0%) related to the release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets.   A $0.1 million (0.6%) net tax benefit related to other discrete items.   A net tax rate increase of 0.2% was recognized in 2013 from rate differences between non-U.S. and U.S. jurisdictions. Lesser earnings in jurisdictions where tax rates differ substantially from the U.S. tax rate coupled with lower tax benefits on non-U.S. restructuring charges contributed to net tax rate increase.   The income tax rate on continuing operations, excluding discrete items, was 49%.  Segment Results of Operations  Machine Clothing Segment  Machine Clothing is our primary business segment and accounted for 86% of our consolidated revenues during 2015. Machine Clothing products are purchased primarily by manufacturers of paper and paperboard.  According to RISI, Inc., global production of paper and paperboard is expected to grow at an annual rate of approximately 2% over the next five years, driven primarily by secular demand increases in Asia and South America, with stabilization in the mature markets of Europe and North America.  Shifting demand for paper, across different paper grades as well as across geographical regions, continues to drive the elimination of papermaking capacity in areas with significant established capacity, primarily in the mature markets of Europe and North America. At the same time, the newest, most efficient machines are being installed in areas of growing demand, including Asia and South America generally, as well as tissue and towel paper grades in all regions. Recent technological advances in paper machine clothing, while contributing to the papermaking efficiency of customers, have lengthened the useful life of many of our products and had an adverse impact on overall paper machine clothing demand.  The Company's manufacturing and product platforms position us well to meet these shifting demands across product grades and geographic regions. Our strategy for meeting these challenges continues to be to grow share in all markets, with new products and technology, and to maintain our manufacturing footprint to align with global demand, while we offset the effects of inflation through continuous productivity improvement.  We have incurred significant restructuring charges in recent periods as we reduced Machine Clothing manufacturing capacity and administrative positions in the United States, Canada, Germany, France, and Sweden.  Review of Operations (in thousands, except percentages) Years ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Net sales $608,581 $655,026 $674,747 % change from prior year -7.1 % -2.9 % Gross profit 286,847 282,300 289,100 % of net sales 47.1 % 43.1 % 42.8 % STG&R expenses 123,325 141,023 150,164 Operating income 141,311 136,450 114,370  Net Sales  2015 vs. 2014  � Changes in currency translation rates had the effect of decreasing 2015 sales by $38.0 million compared to 2014 due to the broad weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar. Excluding the effect of changes in currency translation rates, sales decreased 1.3%.  � Excluding the effect of changes in currency translation rates, the year-over-year decline in MC sales was primarily attributable to lower sales in the North American printing and writing markets.  2014 vs. 2013  � Changes in currency translation rates had the effect of decreasing 2014 sales by $3.6 million compared to 2013. Excluding the effect of changes in currency translation rates, sales decreased 2.4%.  � The year-over-year decline in MC sales was primarily attributable to lower sales in the Americas, reflecting certain mill closures by key customers. Sales in other regions were relatively flat compared to 2013.  Gross Profit  2015 vs. 2014  The increase in 2015 gross profit was principally due to the effect on raw materials and freight that resulted from lower crude oil costs.  2014 vs. 2013  The decrease in 2014 gross profit was principally due to the net effect of the following individually significant items:  � The reduction in MC sales described above resulted in a gross profit decrease of $8.5 million.  � A decrease of $7.5 million in Cost of goods sold resulting from restructuring activities.  � An increase in Cost of goods sold from inflation on direct labor and manufacturing overhead expenses, of approximately $2.6 million and $1.9 million, respectively.  � A $1.6 million charge to Cost of goods sold in 2014 to correct the value of inventories reported in prior periods.  Operating Income  2015 vs. 2014  The increase in 2015 operating income was principally due to the net effect of the following individually significant items:  � Higher gross profit, as described above.  � As described above, STG&R expenses declined $17.7 million, including $13.5 million that resulted from changes in currency translation rates.  � Restructuring charges of $22.2 million in 2015, compared to $4.8 million in 2014.  2014 vs. 2013  The increase in 2014 operating income was principally due to the net effect of the following individually significant items:  � Restructuring charges of $4.8 million in 2014, compared to $24.6 million in 2013.  � Revaluation of nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities, which resulted in gains of $3.9 million in 2014 compared to losses of $0.3 million in 2013.  Albany Engineered Composites Segment  The Albany Engineered Composites (AEC) segment, including Albany Safran Composites, LLC (ASC), in which our customer SAFRAN Group owns a 10 percent noncontrolling interest, provides highly engineered advanced composite structures based on proprietary technology to customers in the aerospace and defense industries. AEC's largest program relates to CFM International's LEAP engine, which is scheduled to enter into service in 2016. AEC, through ASC, is the exclusive supplier of advanced composite fan blades and cases for this  program under a long-term supply contract. In 2015, approximately 15% of this segment's sales were related to U.S. government contracts or programs.  Review of Operations (in thousands, except percentages) Years ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Net sales $101,287 $90,319 $82,667 % change from prior year 12.1 % 9.3 % Gross profit (6,596 ) 10,750 4,799 % of net sales -6.5 % 11.9 % 5.8 % STG&R expenses 21,882 20,301 18,663 Operating loss (28,478 ) (10,483 ) (14,404 )  Net Sales  2015 vs. 2014  � The increase in 2015 sales was principally due to higher sales in the GE9X and LEAP programs.  2014 vs. 2013  � The increase in 2014 sales was principally due to higher sales in the LEAP and Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) LiftFan (R) programs.  Gross Profit  2015 vs. 2014  The decrease in gross profit was principally due to the net effect of the following individually significant items:  � In the second quarter of 2015, we recorded a $14.0 million charge for a revision in the estimated profitability of the BR 725 program.  � While sales at the Company's Boerne, Texas operation increased $2.3 million, manufacturing costs increased $4.4 million.  � Higher sales in the LEAP program increased gross profit by approximately $1.1 million.  2014 vs. 2013  The increase in gross profit was principally due to the net effect of the following individually significant items:  � AEC's Boerne, Texas operation increased gross profit by $5.0 million principally due to operational improvements that resulted in lower Cost of goods sold.  Long-term contracts  AEC has contracts with certain customers, including its contract for the LEAP program, where revenue is determined by cost, plus a defined profit margin. Revenue earned under these arrangements accounted for approximately 50 percent, 54 percent, and 48 percent of segment revenue for 2015, 2014, and 2013 respectively.  In addition, AEC has long-term fixed price contracts. In accounting for those contracts, we estimate the profit margin expected at the completion of the contract and recognize a pro-rata share of that profit during the course of the contract using a cost-to-cost or units of delivery approach. Changes in estimated contract profitability will affect revenue and gross profit when the change occurs, which could have a significant favorable or unfavorable effect on revenue and gross profit in any reporting period.

Albany International Corporation, originally the Albany Felt Company, is an industrial-goods company based in Rochester, New Hampshire, United States. It makes two different lines of products: machine clothing, in particular felts for use in paper manufacturing and textile processing; and composites used in the aerospace industry. Its shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol AIN.[4] It is included in both the S&P 600 and the Russell 2000 stock indices.[3]
The company was founded in Albany, New York, in 1895 to make felts, serving the many paper mills in the region. It grew and prospered throughout the early 20th century, even during the Great Depression. In the later half of the 20th century it began acquiring overseas firms and expanding into the composites sector. In 2013 it moved its headquarters to New Hampshire to better serve its aerospace customers.

Overview[edit]
Albany International has two divisions: Albany Engineered Composites and Machine Clothing. The former are primarily used in aerospace applications to help make craft lighter, such as the main brace on the landing gear assembled by Messier-Bugatti-Dowty for the 787 Dreamliner, the first use of structural composites in that part of a commercial airliner.[5] Machine Clothing, headquartered in Neuhausen, Switzerland,[6] is the company's traditional core business, descending from the felts used in early paper machines, still accounting for 86% of its sales in 2015.[2] Specialized textiles that brace and dry paper as it travels through the machines that make it still makes up the majority of the Machine Clothing product line.[7] Other customers for these engineered fabrics include makers of building products, such as flooring, shingles and carpet,[8] and tanners (the company claims to be the largest manufacturer of felts for leather manufacture in the world).[9] Its competitors include one other American company, Xerium Technologies, and two privately-held foreign concerns, Valmet Fabrics Oy and Asahi Kasei Spandex Europe GmbH.[10]
Corporate headquarters is outside the city of Rochester, New Hampshire, near Skyhaven Airport, along with Albany Engineered Composites' main plant and a research and development center. The company operates 18 other facilities in nine other countries. The Machine Clothing division's plants account for most of these; its textiles are made in Brazil Canada, China, Mexico, South Korea and several European countries as well as at several locations in the United States. Composites are also made in Salt Lake City Utah, Boerne Texas and Commercy France. The company also operates research centers in Sélestat, France, and Halmstad, Sweden.[11]
History[edit]
Albany International has grown steadily since its founding. For over a century it was based in the city from which it takes its name.
19th-century American paper industry[edit]
In the late 19th century, much of the growing American paper industry was based along the Hudson River in and around the cities of Albany and Troy, due to the cities' proximity to the ample softwood forests of the nearby Adirondack Mountains, the major raw material for papermaking.[1] To make paper, manufacturers used the Fourdrinier paper machine developed early in the century, which could make continuous paper rolls. In order to do so, its belts needed to be clothed in special felts that could both brace paper and help dry it.[12]
A dozen companies were already providing felt for Albany's paper mills in the early 1890s when one of them, the Albany Huyck felt mill, burned down in 1894. This left its talented superintendent, Duncan Fuller, who had patented a new weaving method, jobless. He was soon re-employed by the three founding partners of the newly formed Albany Felt Company.[13]
1895–1901: Startup years[edit]
The company was incorporated on March 8, 1895.[1] It had several advantages that gave it the confidence to enter a crowded market—an ideal location near many potential customers and Fuller's proven expertise. Most significant were the partners themselves–Selden Marvin, a local bank president who served as the company's first secretary; James Cox, its first president, and Parker Corning, vice president.[13]




Corning, ca. 1910


Corning was a member of a family prominent in Albany business and politics—his nephew, Erastus, later served as the city's mayor for four decades—and had just graduated from Yale. The family provided most of the company's initial capital. His father put up most of the company's initial $40,000 in cash, and the family's prize-winning herd of Southdown sheep were fleeced for most of the company's wool.[14]
The new company needed to first set up a plant, and space was found on Thacher Street in northern Albany, at the corner of the Cornings' 700-acre (280 ha) family farm.[14] By the summer of 1895, 36 workers were using seven rented looms in the property. In 1896 the company recorded $27,000 in sales.[1]
1902–1946: Rapid growth[edit]
Within five years that number had more than quadrupled, following continued growth in the paper industry. Albany Felt was selling its products to paper makers all over the Northeast. The Thacher Street plant was at maximum capacity. Management decided to expand, and purchased five acres (2.0 ha) straddling the boundary between Albany and what was at the time the town of Colonie to its north. The new facility was completed in 1902.[15]




The 1902 headquarters building, now listed on the National Register of Historic Places


By 1920 sales had increased to $2 million annually, making the company the second largest in the industry, as Albany Felt continued to serve the rapidly consolidating American paper industry.[16] The new plant, now corporate headquarters as well, had been expanded more than once to accommodate the company's 223 employees. In 1923, the same year Corning, who had replaced Cox as president in 1918, stepped away from the company to serve the first of six terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, it began implementing his plans to sell to customers outside the U.S. as well.[17]
The following year the village of Menands was incorporated in the area around the plant, giving the company the address it would be known by for decades afterwards. By 1925 sales had reached $2.5 million with the growth of the Roaring Twenties economy, leading to another expansion of the plant which doubled its size. Corning's focus on efficiency and expanding markets made it very easy for the company to not only survive but prosper when the Great Depression began in 1929. Within three years sales had again reached $2 million; in 1937 they reached $3 million, prompting another expansion of the plant.[18]
Corning, the only founder still alive by that time, had returned from Congress to take a more active role in the company. U.S. entry into World War II in 1941 again increased demand as paper suppliers sought to meet new defense contracts. After Corning's death two years later, control of the company passed to his cousin Lewis Parker.[19]
1947–1969: International expansion[edit]
The end of the war and the return to prosperity opened up new economic possibilities for many American firms, and Albany Felt was no exception. Parker realized that the company would need to start producing its fabrics closer to its increasingly distant customers. By 1947 extra production capacity was opened up in the Albany, and the main building was expanded yet again to increase office space the next year. Four years later, with the company having built up a large enough customer base in Canada, it created a Canadian subsidiary and built a 90,000-square-foot (8,400 m2) plant in Cowansville, Quebec, its first expansion outside the Capital District.[17]
It was soon followed by a plant in the Southeast[17] and, in 1954, the last expansion of the Menands corporate headquarters building.[19] During the next two decades, Albany Felt entered even more foreign markets in a production capacity. Joint ventures brought the company to Latin America, Scandinavia, France, the Netherlands and Australia, as well as into product lines beyond industrial felt.[17]
This growth led to a major turning point in the company's history. In 1969 management found itself confronted with a hostile takeover attempt. To fend it off, Albany Felt merged with Wisconsin's Appleton Wire Works, another manufacturer of paper machine clothing, and Swedish feltmaker Nordiska Maskinfilt. The new company was renamed Albany International. It had 6,242 employees, twice as many as Albany Felt had had before, and became the world's first company that provided fabrics for all stages of the papermaking process worldwide.[20]
1970–1988: Going public[edit]
In 1972, Albany International introduced its current logo. This coincided with another momentous event in the company's history—later that year, it went public. In July 1974 its shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).[21]
During the 1970s the company continued to grow through further acquisitions. Among these were machine-clothing companies in England, Brazil and Norway, as well as a Boston-area research firm.[21] Reflecting its widening focus, in 1976 management moved the company's headquarters to the nearby, recently renovated Henry M. Sage Estate, nearby in Menands. Production and lower-level management activities continued at the original building.[22]
These acquisitions came with an increasing debt load. In 1983, at the behest of the largest group of shareholders, management took the company private again via a leveraged buyout. To make that work, Albany International focused on its core business, selling many of the acquisitions it had made not directly related to papermaking. At the same time it modernized production within that area and increased its efficiency. Four years after going private, the shareholders voted to take the company public again. Shares traded first on the NASDAQ in 1987, and were once again listed on the NYSE in 1988.[21]
At the same time the company moved its headquarters back to the original building. To make room for upper management again, most production that had been going on there was instead moved to a plant across the Hudson in East Greenbush. Some renovations were made to the building to accommodate this change.[22]
1989–present: Composites and move from Albany[edit]
The 1990s posed new challenges for the newly republicized Albany International. A worldwide recession in the early years of the decade squeezed customers, while the end of the Cold War opened up new markets. The company continued its strategy of acquisitions and aggressively entering new markets, while increasing its own efficiency wherever possible.[23]
Asia, where the company had had no previous presence, was the first target. Albany International opened a plant in Chungju, South Korea. It entered the potentially vast Chinese market by first purchasing an existing machine-clothing manufacturer in Guangzhou's Panyu District. These were accompanied by new plants in Europe.[23]
The next year the company acquired Techniweave, a maker of aerospace composites in Rochester, New Hampshire. It was merged with a Texas-based composite manufacturer in 2006. The combined companies formed the basis of Albany Engineered Composites,[23] a growing part of the company's sales and profits today.[2]
In 2007 Albany International built its first plant in China, in the coastal city of Hangzhou. That same year the company began a multiyear restructuring process aimed at remaining competitive in the long term. It sold noncore businesses such as its filtration division and Albany Door Systems, a maker of high-speed industrial doors,[23] acquired by Swedish lockmaker Assa Abloy in 2011.[24] PrimaLoft, an insulating fabric developed by the company for the U.S. military, was spun off.[23]
The company implemented Six Sigma and lean manufacturing processes to improve its efficiency at all levels. It was thus able to weather the Great Recession of 2008 and improve its performance afterward, as it had 80 years earlier when the Depression struck.[23] Growth, particularly in the composites business, led management to move the company's headquarters out of the Albany area.
At the beginning of 2011, the company officially made Rochester its headquarters.[6] The last production in the Menands building ended that same year.[25] However, it took two more years for all remaining operations to be removed to Rochester. In 2012 the building was sold to a developer who has since converted it into apartments; the company moved its remaining operations out the year afterwards.[19] The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014, recognizing the fact that despite expansions it had remained unchanged architecturally since the early 20th century.[26]
Future[edit]
The company describes its current strategy as "focus and lead". In more specific terms, it means making sure the cash flow from its Machine Clothing division remains steady while working, through a joint venture with Safran, to complete its contribution to the CFM International LEAP aircraft engine under development. This will in turn further increase Albany Engineered Composites' position within its market.[27] In his 2015 letter to shareholders, Chief Executive Officer Joseph Morone pointed to General Electric's recent choice of Albany as the supplier of the fan case for its GE9X engines as a step toward this goal.[28]
Despite recent declines in sales, management sees the company as progressing toward those goals. In his letter, Morone points to an increase in adjusted EBITDA despite increased spending on research and development. At the same time, the company was able to pay down $32 million in debt, and fully fund its pension plans in the U.S., U.K. and Canada.[28]
Strategic acquisitions are also a continuing part of the company's growth strategy. In February 2016 Albany agreed to acquire Harris Corp.'s aero-structures division, itself bought from Exelis just the year before, which makes composites used primarily in airframes, for a total consideration of $210 million, paid for partially out of the company's cash on hand, with the rest coming from an increase to its revolving credit facility. Morone said that while the division had growth opportunities, the company saw "complementarity" between it and Albany Engineered Composites that could further increase earnings in the medium term.[29]

Albany International Corporation, originally the Albany Felt Company, is an industrial-goods company based in Rochester, New Hampshire, United States. It makes two different lines of products: machine clothing, in particular felts for use in paper manufacturing and textile processing; and composites used in the aerospace industry. Its shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol AIN.[4] It is included in both the S&P 600 and the Russell 2000 stock indices.[3]
The company was founded in Albany, New York, in 1895 to make felts, serving the many paper mills in the region. It grew and prospered throughout the early 20th century, even during the Great Depression. In the later half of the 20th century it began acquiring overseas firms and expanding into the composites sector. In 2013 it moved its headquarters to New Hampshire to better serve its aerospace customers.

Overview[edit]
Albany International has two divisions: Albany Engineered Composites and Machine Clothing. The former are primarily used in aerospace applications to help make craft lighter, such as the main brace on the landing gear assembled by Messier-Bugatti-Dowty for the 787 Dreamliner, the first use of structural composites in that part of a commercial airliner.[5] Machine Clothing, headquartered in Neuhausen, Switzerland,[6] is the company's traditional core business, descending from the felts used in early paper machines, still accounting for 86% of its sales in 2015.[2] Specialized textiles that brace and dry paper as it travels through the machines that make it still makes up the majority of the Machine Clothing product line.[7] Other customers for these engineered fabrics include makers of building products, such as flooring, shingles and carpet,[8] and tanners (the company claims to be the largest manufacturer of felts for leather manufacture in the world).[9] Its competitors include one other American company, Xerium Technologies, and two privately-held foreign concerns, Valmet Fabrics Oy and Asahi Kasei Spandex Europe GmbH.[10]
Corporate headquarters is outside the city of Rochester, New Hampshire, near Skyhaven Airport, along with Albany Engineered Composites' main plant and a research and development center. The company operates 18 other facilities in nine other countries. The Machine Clothing division's plants account for most of these; its textiles are made in Brazil Canada, China, Mexico, South Korea and several European countries as well as at several locations in the United States. Composites are also made in Salt Lake City Utah, Boerne Texas and Commercy France. The company also operates research centers in Sélestat, France, and Halmstad, Sweden.[11]
History[edit]
Albany International has grown steadily since its founding. For over a century it was based in the city from which it takes its name.
19th-century American paper industry[edit]
In the late 19th century, much of the growing American paper industry was based along the Hudson River in and around the cities of Albany and Troy, due to the cities' proximity to the ample softwood forests of the nearby Adirondack Mountains, the major raw material for papermaking.[1] To make paper, manufacturers used the Fourdrinier paper machine developed early in the century, which could make continuous paper rolls. In order to do so, its belts needed to be clothed in special felts that could both brace paper and help dry it.[12]
A dozen companies were already providing felt for Albany's paper mills in the early 1890s when one of them, the Albany Huyck felt mill, burned down in 1894. This left its talented superintendent, Duncan Fuller, who had patented a new weaving method, jobless. He was soon re-employed by the three founding partners of the newly formed Albany Felt Company.[13]
1895–1901: Startup years[edit]
The company was incorporated on March 8, 1895.[1] It had several advantages that gave it the confidence to enter a crowded market—an ideal location near many potential customers and Fuller's proven expertise. Most significant were the partners themselves–Selden Marvin, a local bank president who served as the company's first secretary; James Cox, its first president, and Parker Corning, vice president.[13]




Corning, ca. 1910


Corning was a member of a family prominent in Albany business and politics—his nephew, Erastus, later served as the city's mayor for four decades—and had just graduated from Yale. The family provided most of the company's initial capital. His father put up most of the company's initial $40,000 in cash, and the family's prize-winning herd of Southdown sheep were fleeced for most of the company's wool.[14]
The new company needed to first set up a plant, and space was found on Thacher Street in northern Albany, at the corner of the Cornings' 700-acre (280 ha) family farm.[14] By the summer of 1895, 36 workers were using seven rented looms in the property. In 1896 the company recorded $27,000 in sales.[1]
1902–1946: Rapid growth[edit]
Within five years that number had more than quadrupled, following continued growth in the paper industry. Albany Felt was selling its products to paper makers all over the Northeast. The Thacher Street plant was at maximum capacity. Management decided to expand, and purchased five acres (2.0 ha) straddling the boundary between Albany and what was at the time the town of Colonie to its north. The new facility was completed in 1902.[15]




The 1902 headquarters building, now listed on the National Register of Historic Places


By 1920 sales had increased to $2 million annually, making the company the second largest in the industry, as Albany Felt continued to serve the rapidly consolidating American paper industry.[16] The new plant, now corporate headquarters as well, had been expanded more than once to accommodate the company's 223 employees. In 1923, the same year Corning, who had replaced Cox as president in 1918, stepped away from the company to serve the first of six terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, it began implementing his plans to sell to customers outside the U.S. as well.[17]
The following year the village of Menands was incorporated in the area around the plant, giving the company the address it would be known by for decades afterwards. By 1925 sales had reached $2.5 million with the growth of the Roaring Twenties economy, leading to another expansion of the plant which doubled its size. Corning's focus on efficiency and expanding markets made it very easy for the company to not only survive but prosper when the Great Depression began in 1929. Within three years sales had again reached $2 million; in 1937 they reached $3 million, prompting another expansion of the plant.[18]
Corning, the only founder still alive by that time, had returned from Congress to take a more active role in the company. U.S. entry into World War II in 1941 again increased demand as paper suppliers sought to meet new defense contracts. After Corning's death two years later, control of the company passed to his cousin Lewis Parker.[19]
1947–1969: International expansion[edit]
The end of the war and the return to prosperity opened up new economic possibilities for many American firms, and Albany Felt was no exception. Parker realized that the company would need to start producing its fabrics closer to its increasingly distant customers. By 1947 extra production capacity was opened up in the Albany, and the main building was expanded yet again to increase office space the next year. Four years later, with the company having built up a large enough customer base in Canada, it created a Canadian subsidiary and built a 90,000-square-foot (8,400 m2) plant in Cowansville, Quebec, its first expansion outside the Capital District.[17]
It was soon followed by a plant in the Southeast[17] and, in 1954, the last expansion of the Menands corporate headquarters building.[19] During the next two decades, Albany Felt entered even more foreign markets in a production capacity. Joint ventures brought the company to Latin America, Scandinavia, France, the Netherlands and Australia, as well as into product lines beyond industrial felt.[17]
This growth led to a major turning point in the company's history. In 1969 management found itself confronted with a hostile takeover attempt. To fend it off, Albany Felt merged with Wisconsin's Appleton Wire Works, another manufacturer of paper machine clothing, and Swedish feltmaker Nordiska Maskinfilt. The new company was renamed Albany International. It had 6,242 employees, twice as many as Albany Felt had had before, and became the world's first company that provided fabrics for all stages of the papermaking process worldwide.[20]
1970–1988: Going public[edit]
In 1972, Albany International introduced its current logo. This coincided with another momentous event in the company's history—later that year, it went public. In July 1974 its shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).[21]
During the 1970s the company continued to grow through further acquisitions. Among these were machine-clothing companies in England, Brazil and Norway, as well as a Boston-area research firm.[21] Reflecting its widening focus, in 1976 management moved the company's headquarters to the nearby, recently renovated Henry M. Sage Estate, nearby in Menands. Production and lower-level management activities continued at the original building.[22]
These acquisitions came with an increasing debt load. In 1983, at the behest of the largest group of shareholders, management took the company private again via a leveraged buyout. To make that work, Albany International focused on its core business, selling many of the acquisitions it had made not directly related to papermaking. At the same time it modernized production within that area and increased its efficiency. Four years after going private, the shareholders voted to take the company public again. Shares traded first on the NASDAQ in 1987, and were once again listed on the NYSE in 1988.[21]
At the same time the company moved its headquarters back to the original building. To make room for upper management again, most production that had been going on there was instead moved to a plant across the Hudson in East Greenbush. Some renovations were made to the building to accommodate this change.[22]
1989–present: Composites and move from Albany[edit]
The 1990s posed new challenges for the newly republicized Albany International. A worldwide recession in the early years of the decade squeezed customers, while the end of the Cold War opened up new markets. The company continued its strategy of acquisitions and aggressively entering new markets, while increasing its own efficiency wherever possible.[23]
Asia, where the company had had no previous presence, was the first target. Albany International opened a plant in Chungju, South Korea. It entered the potentially vast Chinese market by first purchasing an existing machine-clothing manufacturer in Guangzhou's Panyu District. These were accompanied by new plants in Europe.[23]
The next year the company acquired Techniweave, a maker of aerospace composites in Rochester, New Hampshire. It was merged with a Texas-based composite manufacturer in 2006. The combined companies formed the basis of Albany Engineered Composites,[23] a growing part of the company's sales and profits today.[2]
In 2007 Albany International built its first plant in China, in the coastal city of Hangzhou. That same year the company began a multiyear restructuring process aimed at remaining competitive in the long term. It sold noncore businesses such as its filtration division and Albany Door Systems, a maker of high-speed industrial doors,[23] acquired by Swedish lockmaker Assa Abloy in 2011.[24] PrimaLoft, an insulating fabric developed by the company for the U.S. military, was spun off.[23]
The company implemented Six Sigma and lean manufacturing processes to improve its efficiency at all levels. It was thus able to weather the Great Recession of 2008 and improve its performance afterward, as it had 80 years earlier when the Depression struck.[23] Growth, particularly in the composites business, led management to move the company's headquarters out of the Albany area.
At the beginning of 2011, the company officially made Rochester its headquarters.[6] The last production in the Menands building ended that same year.[25] However, it took two more years for all remaining operations to be removed to Rochester. In 2012 the building was sold to a developer who has since converted it into apartments; the company moved its remaining operations out the year afterwards.[19] The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014, recognizing the fact that despite expansions it had remained unchanged architecturally since the early 20th century.[26]
Future[edit]
The company describes its current strategy as "focus and lead". In more specific terms, it means making sure the cash flow from its Machine Clothing division remains steady while working, through a joint venture with Safran, to complete its contribution to the CFM International LEAP aircraft engine under development. This will in turn further increase Albany Engineered Composites' position within its market.[27] In his 2015 letter to shareholders, Chief Executive Officer Joseph Morone pointed to General Electric's recent choice of Albany as the supplier of the fan case for its GE9X engines as a step toward this goal.[28]
Despite recent declines in sales, management sees the company as progressing toward those goals. In his letter, Morone points to an increase in adjusted EBITDA despite increased spending on research and development. At the same time, the company was able to pay down $32 million in debt, and fully fund its pension plans in the U.S., U.K. and Canada.[28]
Strategic acquisitions are also a continuing part of the company's growth strategy. In February 2016 Albany agreed to acquire Harris Corp.'s aero-structures division, itself bought from Exelis just the year before, which makes composites used primarily in airframes, for a total consideration of $210 million, paid for partially out of the company's cash on hand, with the rest coming from an increase to its revolving credit facility. Morone said that while the division had growth opportunities, the company saw "complementarity" between it and Albany Engineered Composites that could further increase earnings in the medium term.[29]

To make room for upper management again, most production that had been going on there was instead moved to a plant across the Hudson in East Greenbush. Some renovations were made to the building to accommodate this change.[22]
1989–present: Composites and move from Albany[edit]
The 1990s posed new challenges for the newly republicized Albany International. A worldwide recession in the early years of the decade squeezed customers, while the end of the Cold War opened up new markets. The company continued its strategy of acquisitions and aggressively entering new markets, while increasing its own efficiency wherever possible.[23]
Asia, where the company had had no previous presence, was the first target. Albany International opened a plant in Chungju, South Korea. It entered the potentially vast Chinese market by first purchasing an existing machine-clothing manufacturer in Guangzhou's Panyu District. These were accompanied by new plants in Europe.[23]
The next year the company acquired Techniweave, a maker of aerospace composites in Rochester, New Hampshire. It was merged with a Texas-based composite manufacturer in 2006. The combined companies formed the basis of Albany Engineered Composites,[23] a growing part of the company's sales and profits today.[2]
In 2007 Albany International built its first plant in China, in the coastal city of Hangzhou. That same year the company began a multiyear restructuring process aimed at remaining competitive in the long term. It sold noncore businesses such as its filtration division and Albany Door Systems, a maker of high-speed industrial doors,[23] acquired by Swedish lockmaker Assa Abloy in 2011.[24] PrimaLoft, an insulating fabric developed by the company for the U.S. military, was spun off.[23]
The company implemented Six Sigma and lean manufacturing processes to improve its efficiency at all levels. It was thus able to weather the Great Recession of 2008 and improve its performance afterward, as it had 80 years earlier when the Depression struck.[23] Growth, particularly in the composites business, led management to move the company's headquarters out of the Albany area.
At the beginning of 2011, the company officially made Rochester its headquarters.[6] The last production in the Menands building ended that same year.[25] However, it took two more years for all remaining operations to be removed to Rochester. In 2012 the building was sold to a developer who has since converted it into apartments; the company moved its remaining operations out the year afterwards.[19] The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014, recognizing the fact that despite expansions it had remained unchanged architecturally since the early 20th century.[26]
Future[edit]
The company describes its current strategy as "focus and lead". In more specific terms, it means making sure the cash flow from its Machine Clothing division remains steady while working, through a joint venture with Safran, to complete its contribution to the CFM International LEAP aircraft engine under development. This will in turn further increase Albany Engineered Composites' position within its market.[27] In his 2015 letter to shareholders, Chief Executive Officer Joseph Morone pointed to General Electric's recent choice of Albany as the supplier of the fan case for its GE9X engines as a step toward this goal.[28]
Despite recent declines in sales, management sees the company as progressing toward those goals. In his letter, Morone points to an increase in adjusted EBITDA despite increased spending on research and development. At the same time, the company was able to pay down $32 million in debt, and fully fund its pension plans in the U.S., U.K. and Canada.[28]
Strategic acquisitions are also a continuing part of the company's growth strategy. In February 2016 Albany agreed to acquire Harris Corp.'s aero-structures division, itself bought from Exelis just the year before, which makes composites used primarily in airframes, for a total consideration of $210 million, paid for partially out of the company's cash on hand, with the rest coming from an increase to its revolving credit facility. Morone said that while the division had growth opportunities, the company saw "complementarity" between it and Albany Engineered Composites that could further increase earnings in the medium term.[29]

Albany International Corporation, originally the Albany Felt Company, is an industrial-goods company based in Rochester, New Hampshire, United States. It makes two different lines of products: machine clothing, in particular felts for use in paper manufacturing and textile processing; and composites used in the aerospace industry. Its shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol AIN.[4] It is included in both the S&P 600 and the Russell 2000 stock indices.[3]
The company was founded in Albany, New York, in 1895 to make felts, serving the many paper mills in the region. It grew and prospered throughout the early 20th century, even during the Great Depression. In the later half of the 20th century it began acquiring overseas firms and expanding into the composites sector. In 2013 it moved its headquarters to New Hampshire to better serve its aerospace customers.

Overview[edit]
Albany International has two divisions: Albany Engineered Composites and Machine Clothing. The former are primarily used in aerospace applications to help make craft lighter, such as the main brace on the landing gear assembled by Messier-Bugatti-Dowty for the 787 Dreamliner, the first use of structural composites in that part of a commercial airliner.[5] Machine Clothing, headquartered in Neuhausen, Switzerland,[6] is the company's traditional core business, descending from the felts used in early paper machines, still accounting for 86% of its sales in 2015.[2] Specialized textiles that brace and dry paper as it travels through the machines that make it still makes up the majority of the Machine Clothing product line.[7] Other customers for these engineered fabrics include makers of building products, such as flooring, shingles and carpet,[8] and tanners (the company claims to be the largest manufacturer of felts for leather manufacture in the world).[9] Its competitors include one other American company, Xerium Technologies, and two privately-held foreign concerns, Valmet Fabrics Oy and Asahi Kasei Spandex Europe GmbH.[10]
Corporate headquarters is outside the city of Rochester, New Hampshire, near Skyhaven Airport, along with Albany Engineered Composites' main plant and a research and development center. The company operates 18 other facilities in nine other countries. The Machine Clothing division's plants account for most of these; its textiles are made in Brazil Canada, China, Mexico, South Korea and several European countries as well as at several locations in the United States. Composites are also made in Salt Lake City Utah, Boerne Texas and Commercy France. The company also operates research centers in Sélestat, France, and Halmstad, Sweden.[11]
History[edit]
Albany International has grown steadily since its founding. For over a century it was based in the city from which it takes its name.
19th-century American paper industry[edit]
In the late 19th century, much of the growing American paper industry was based along the Hudson River in and around the cities of Albany and Troy, due to the cities' proximity to the ample softwood forests of the nearby Adirondack Mountains, the major raw material for papermaking.[1] To make paper, manufacturers used the Fourdrinier paper machine developed early in the century, which could make continuous paper rolls. In order to do so, its belts needed to be clothed in special felts that could both brace paper and help dry it.[12]
A dozen companies were already providing felt for Albany's paper mills in the early 1890s when one of them, the Albany Huyck felt mill, burned down in 1894. This left its talented superintendent, Duncan Fuller, who had patented a new weaving method, jobless. He was soon re-employed by the three founding partners of the newly formed Albany Felt Company.[13]
1895–1901: Startup years[edit]
The company was incorporated on March 8, 1895.[1] It had several advantages that gave it the confidence to enter a crowded market—an ideal location near many potential customers and Fuller's proven expertise. Most significant were the partners themselves–Selden Marvin, a local bank president who served as the company's first secretary; James Cox, its first president, and Parker Corning, vice president.[13]




Corning, ca. 1910


Corning was a member of a family prominent in Albany business and politics—his nephew, Erastus, later served as the city's mayor for four decades—and had just graduated from Yale. The family provided most of the company's initial capital. His father put up most of the company's initial $40,000 in cash, and the family's prize-winning herd of Southdown sheep were fleeced for most of the company's wool.[14]
The new company needed to first set up a plant, and space was found on Thacher Street in northern Albany, at the corner of the Cornings' 700-acre (280 ha) family farm.[14] By the summer of 1895, 36 workers were using seven rented looms in the property. In 1896 the company recorded $27,000 in sales.[1]
1902–1946: Rapid growth[edit]
Within five years that number had more than quadrupled, following continued growth in the paper industry. Albany Felt was selling its products to paper makers all over the Northeast. The Thacher Street plant was at maximum capacity. Management decided to expand, and purchased five acres (2.0 ha) straddling the boundary between Albany and what was at the time the town of Colonie to its north. The new facility was completed in 1902.[15]




The 1902 headquarters building, now listed on the National Register of Historic Places


By 1920 sales had increased to $2 million annually, making the company the second largest in the industry, as Albany Felt continued to serve the rapidly consolidating American paper industry.[16] The new plant, now corporate headquarters as well, had been expanded more than once to accommodate the company's 223 employees. In 1923, the same year Corning, who had replaced Cox as president in 1918, stepped away from the company to serve the first of six terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, it began implementing his plans to sell to customers outside the U.S. as well.[17]
The following year the village of Menands was incorporated in the area around the plant, giving the company the address it would be known by for decades afterwards. By 1925 sales had reached $2.5 million with the growth of the Roaring Twenties economy, leading to another expansion of the plant which doubled its size. Corning's focus on efficiency and expanding markets made it very easy for the company to not only survive but prosper when the Great Depression began in 1929. Within three years sales had again reached $2 million; in 1937 they reached $3 million, prompting another expansion of the plant.[18]
Corning, the only founder still alive by that time, had returned from Congress to take a more active role in the company. U.S. entry into World War II in 1941 again increased demand as paper suppliers sought to meet new defense contracts. After Corning's death two years later, control of the company passed to his cousin Lewis Parker.[19]
1947–1969: International expansion[edit]
The end of the war and the return to prosperity opened up new economic possibilities for many American firms, and Albany Felt was no exception. Parker realized that the company would need to start producing its fabrics closer to its increasingly distant customers. By 1947 extra production capacity was opened up in the Albany, and the main building was expanded yet again to increase office space the next year. Four years later, with the company having built up a large enough customer base in Canada, it created a Canadian subsidiary and built a 90,000-square-foot (8,400 m2) plant in Cowansville, Quebec, its first expansion outside the Capital District.[17]
It was soon followed by a plant in the Southeast[17] and, in 1954, the last expansion of the Menands corporate headquarters building.[19] During the next two decades, Albany Felt entered even more foreign markets in a production capacity. Joint ventures brought the company to Latin America, Scandinavia, France, the Netherlands and Australia, as well as into product lines beyond industrial felt.[17]
This growth led to a major turning point in the company's history. In 1969 management found itself confronted with a hostile takeover attempt. To fend it off, Albany Felt merged with Wisconsin's Appleton Wire Works, another manufacturer of paper machine clothing, and Swedish feltmaker Nordiska Maskinfilt. The new company was renamed Albany International. It had 6,242 employees, twice as many as Albany Felt had had before, and became the world's first company that provided fabrics for all stages of the papermaking process worldwide.[20]
1970–1988: Going public[edit]
In 1972, Albany International introduced its current logo. This coincided with another momentous event in the company's history—later that year, it went public. In July 1974 its shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).[21]
During the 1970s the company continued to grow through further acquisitions. Among these were machine-clothing companies in England, Brazil and Norway, as well as a Boston-area research firm.[21] Reflecting its widening focus, in 1976 management moved the company's headquarters to the nearby, recently renovated Henry M. Sage Estate, nearby in Menands. Production and lower-level management activities continued at the original building.[22]
These acquisitions came with an increasing debt load. In 1983, at the behest of the largest group of shareholders, management took the company private again via a leveraged buyout. To make that work, Albany International focused on its core business, selling many of the acquisitions it had made not directly related to papermaking. At the same time it modernized production within that area and increased its efficiency. Four years after going private, the shareholders voted to take the company public again. Shares traded first on the NASDAQ in 1987, and were once again listed on the NYSE in 1988.[21]
At the same time the company moved its headquarters back to the original building. To make room for upper management again, most production that had been going on there was instead moved to a plant across the Hudson in East Greenbush. Some renovations were made to the building to accommodate this change.[22]
