Hyaluronic acid from bacterial culture



Patent number:  4517295
                                            

Abstract:  Hyaluronic acid, a polysaccharide, is prepared in high yield from streptococcus bacteria by fermenting the bacteria under anaerobic conditions in a CO.sub.2 -enriched growth medium, separating the bacteria from the resulting broth and isolating the hyaluronic acid from the remaining constituents of the broth. The bacteria may be grown free of endotoxins by filtering all ingredients through a 10K Millipore.RTM. filter prior to inoculation of the medium and subsequently maintaining pyrogen-free conditions. Separation of the microorganisms from the polysaccharide is facilitated by killing the bacteria with trichloroacetic acid. After removal of the bacterial cells and concentration of the higher molecular weight fermentation products, the hyaluronic acid is isolated and purified by precipitation, resuspension and reprecipitation.
                        

Type: 
                                                    Grant
                                            

Filed: 
                        February 18, 1983
                    

Date of Patent: 
                                                        May 14, 1985
                        

Assignee: 
                                                                        Diagnostic, Inc.
                                

Inventors:
