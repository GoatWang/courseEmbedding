Linus Cheung Wing Lam, JP (Chinese: 張永霖) (born 1948 in Hong Kong) was the chairman of Asia Television in 2008-2009,[1] Chief Executive Officer of Hong Kong Telecom (HKT) and Executive Director of Cable & Wireless plc in the United Kingdom in 1994-2000, following the merger of Cable & Wireless HKT with PCCW Limited (PCCW) in 2000, Linus served as the Deputy Chairman of PCCW until 2004.[2] Prior to joining HKT, Linus spent 23 years at Cathay Pacific, before departing as Deputy Managing Director.[3] Linus then served on the board of China Unicom since 2004 and HKR International since 2006.[2]
Apart from being a businessman, Linus is also known as an art collector. In 2016, Sotheby's elected Linus as its first director from Asia, working with its largest shareholder to add expertise in a major market.[4]
He graduated from the bachelor degree in social science of the University of Hong Kong.[5][6]
He now hosts a radio programme called "Linus Cheung's World" in RTHK.[7]

Education[edit]
THaving earned over $HK 10 million a year serving as the executive officer in Hong Kong Telecom, Linus studied three secondary schools within two years before university. He was transferred from Raimondi College to St' Mark's School during form six and subsequently to St. Stephen's Girls College for no Form Seven studies were available in St' Mark's School at that time.
Before successfully admitted by the University of Hong Kong, he had to walk through the arduous two-year secondary path. Even attending university, another problem came to get Linus – he worried for the expense of ten dollars a day - half for dormitory fee and half for expenses of dining and had to earn it on his own. For the sake of the expenses, he taught English in the Western Kai Fong Welfare Association Social Service Centre during the nighttime.
Linus also said that the key to success is persevered efforts. Exemplified by his own case, Linus knew only a smattering of Putonghua even over 10 years after his graduation from university. He started from scratch and practiced Putonghua from the very basics. He can now read articles and talked with friends for three hours in Putonghua with native tongue in utmost purity. He is proud of the achievement of his good command of Putonghua with his effort.
Career[edit]
Early years[edit]
In 1960s, Linus Cheung studied at Raimondi College for his secondary education. After his graduation from the Department of Economics and Political Science in the University of Hong Kong in 1971, Linus joined Cathay Pacific Hong Kong and worked for it for 23 years. He has served as the deputy managing director of Cathay Pacific and was invited by David Clive Wilson, Baron Wilson of Tillyorn, the then Governor of Hong Kong to temporarily transfer to and work in Hong Kong government's Central Policy Unit on a full-time basis in 1989.
Hong Kong Telecom[edit]
Linus became the chief executive officer of Hong Kong Telecom in 1994.
In 1998 and 1999, Linus was rated as the "The Best Telecom CEO in Asia" by the magazine “Telecom Asia” for two years in a row. In 1999, Linus was rated as "The Best Executive in Hong Kong" in a campaign jointly held by DHL and the South China Morning Post. In 2000, Cable & Wireless Worldwide PLC intended to dispose of Hong Kong Telecommunications Limited to Singapore Telecommunications Limited. For fear of Hong Kong's telecom market falling into the grip of foreign enterprise, Linus helped Pacific Century CyberWorks, which was owned by Richard Li, buy out Hong Kong Telecom by borrowing loans amounting to 90 billion Hong Kong dollars.
PCCW[edit]
In August 2000, Pacific Century CyberWorks merged with Hong Kong Telecom into PCCW Limited, with employment contracts signed with a few senior management, of which Linus's term of deputy chairman of PCCW Limited was three years.
In February 2004, Linus resigned with service termination compensation amounting to $HK 45 million.

Linus Cheung Wing Lam, JP (Chinese: 張永霖) (born 1948 in Hong Kong) was the chairman of Asia Television in 2008-2009,[1] Chief Executive Officer of Hong Kong Telecom (HKT) and Executive Director of Cable & Wireless plc in the United Kingdom in 1994-2000, following the merger of Cable & Wireless HKT with PCCW Limited (PCCW) in 2000, Linus served as the Deputy Chairman of PCCW until 2004.[2] Prior to joining HKT, Linus spent 23 years at Cathay Pacific, before departing as Deputy Managing Director.[3] Linus then served on the board of China Unicom since 2004 and HKR International since 2006.[2]
Apart from being a businessman, Linus is also known as an art collector. In 2016, Sotheby's elected Linus as its first director from Asia, working with its largest shareholder to add expertise in a major market.[4]
He graduated from the bachelor degree in social science of the University of Hong Kong.[5][6]
He now hosts a radio programme called "Linus Cheung's World" in RTHK.[7]

Education[edit]
THaving earned over $HK 10 million a year serving as the executive officer in Hong Kong Telecom, Linus studied three secondary schools within two years before university. He was transferred from Raimondi College to St' Mark's School during form six and subsequently to St. Stephen's Girls College for no Form Seven studies were available in St' Mark's School at that time.
Before successfully admitted by the University of Hong Kong, he had to walk through the arduous two-year secondary path. Even attending university, another problem came to get Linus – he worried for the expense of ten dollars a day - half for dormitory fee and half for expenses of dining and had to earn it on his own. For the sake of the expenses, he taught English in the Western Kai Fong Welfare Association Social Service Centre during the nighttime.
Linus also said that the key to success is persevered efforts. Exemplified by his own case, Linus knew only a smattering of Putonghua even over 10 years after his graduation from university. He started from scratch and practiced Putonghua from the very basics. He can now read articles and talked with friends for three hours in Putonghua with native tongue in utmost purity. He is proud of the achievement of his good command of Putonghua with his effort.
Career[edit]
Early years[edit]
In 1960s, Linus Cheung studied at Raimondi College for his secondary education. After his graduation from the Department of Economics and Political Science in the University of Hong Kong in 1971, Linus joined Cathay Pacific Hong Kong and worked for it for 23 years. He has served as the deputy managing director of Cathay Pacific and was invited by David Clive Wilson, Baron Wilson of Tillyorn, the then Governor of Hong Kong to temporarily transfer to and work in Hong Kong government's Central Policy Unit on a full-time basis in 1989.
Hong Kong Telecom[edit]
Linus became the chief executive officer of Hong Kong Telecom in 1994.
In 1998 and 1999, Linus was rated as the "The Best Telecom CEO in Asia" by the magazine “Telecom Asia” for two years in a row. In 1999, Linus was rated as "The Best Executive in Hong Kong" in a campaign jointly held by DHL and the South China Morning Post. In 2000, Cable & Wireless Worldwide PLC intended to dispose of Hong Kong Telecommunications Limited to Singapore Telecommunications Limited. For fear of Hong Kong's telecom market falling into the grip of foreign enterprise, Linus helped Pacific Century CyberWorks, which was owned by Richard Li, buy out Hong Kong Telecom by borrowing loans amounting to 90 billion Hong Kong dollars.
PCCW[edit]
In August 2000, Pacific Century CyberWorks merged with Hong Kong Telecom into PCCW Limited, with employment contracts signed with a few senior management, of which Linus's term of deputy chairman of PCCW Limited was three years.
In February 2004, Linus resigned with service termination compensation amounting to $HK 45 million.

        November 7, 2016
      

        NEW YORK, Nov. 07, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sotheby's announced today that Linus Wing Lam Cheung has been unanimously elected to join the Company's Board of Directors. Mr. Cheung is the retired Chief Executive Officer of Hong Kong Telecom and a renowned collector of Chinese Art.


        'Linus brings a wealth of business experience and sophistication to our Board and company,' said Domenico De Sole, Chairman of Sotheby's Board of Directors. 'His unique insights on Asia, as well as the many areas in which Sotheby's operates, will be incredibly valuable.  Having had the pleasure of knowing him as a client for years, we are very pleased to now welcome him as an independent Director.' 
      

        Mr. Cheung served as Executive Chairman of Asia Television Limited from 2008 to 2009, Chief Executive Officer of Hong Kong Telecom from 1994 to 2000 and, following Hong Kong Telecom's merger with Pacific Century Cyberworks (PCCW) in 2000, PCCW's Deputy Chairman until 2004.  Prior to joining Hong Kong Telecom, Mr. Cheung spent 23 years at Cathay Pacific Airways where he concluded his tenure as Deputy Chief Executive Officer.
      

        'I am delighted to be joining the Board of Sotheby's, a company I have long admired during my decades as a collector,' commented Mr. Cheung.  'As the art market continues to evolve and grow in China and across Asia, I look forward to sharing my expertise and experience to best position the Company for future success.'
      

        Mr. Cheung has served on the board of China Unicom Ltd. since 2004 and HK Resort International Ltd. since 2006.  Previously, he served on the boards of Cathay Pacific Airways, Hong Kong Telecom, Cable and Wireless plc, and Taikang Insurance.
      

        In addition to his past executive leadership positions, Mr. Cheung has been actively involved with his alma mater, the University of Hong Kong, where he earned a BSocSc degree with honors and a Diploma in Management Studies with distinction. He spent 10 years as a member of the Council of the University of Hong Kong and also served as Chairman of the University of Hong Kong School of Professional and Continuing Education and as Chairman of the Centennial College.
      

        In connection with Mr. Cheung's appointment, Sotheby's and its largest shareholder, Taikang Insurance Group, have entered into an agreement whereby Taikang has agreed it will not increase its ownership position beyond 15% for a period of three years, subject to certain conditions.
