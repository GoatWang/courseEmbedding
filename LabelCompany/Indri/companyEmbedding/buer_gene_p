Columbus McKinnon Promotes Buer and Giesige to Vice President | Business Wire


























































Columbus McKinnon Promotes Buer and Giesige to Vice President






June 03, 2009 07:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



AMHERST, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Columbus McKinnon Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCO), a leading designer, 
      manufacturer and marketer of material handling products, today announced 
      the Board of Directors appointed Gene P. Buer and Charles R. Giesige as 
      officers of the Company. Mr. Buer will serve as Vice President Hoist 
      Products – the Americas. Prior to this promotion he was Executive 
      Director- Hoist Products. Mr. Giesige will serve as Vice President 
      Rigging Products – the Americas. He previously was Executive Director, 
      Rigging and CES, Americas. Both serve as members of the Company’s 
      management executive committee.
    

      Mr. Buer has over 35 years of experience in sales and operational 
      management. He joined Columbus McKinnon in 2005 as President of the 
      Company’s Crane Equipment and Service division and was promoted to 
      Executive Director in 2008.
    

      Mr. Giesige joined Columbus McKinnon in 2006 as Executive Director in 
      the Company’s chain, forging and rigging groups, bringing over 25 years 
      of finance and operations experience to the Company.
    

      Timothy T. Tevens, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, 
      “These promotions are well-earned as the experience and strong 
      leadership qualities of both Gene and Chuck have enabled them to drive 
      success in their respective businesses. As we adjust our organization in 
      the face of the current global economic downturn, including the 
      consolidation of our North American hoist and rigging manufacturing 
      facilities, I am confident that, under Gene and Chuck’s guidance, our 
      hoist and rigging operations will emerge even stronger and 
      better-positioned to take advantage of future opportunities.”
