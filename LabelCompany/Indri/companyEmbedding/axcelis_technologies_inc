Badger Meter (BMI) Q2 Earnings Top Estimates, Sales Lag


July 21, 2017, 11:00:00 AM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

  Badger Meter Inc.  's BMI  second-quarter 2017 earnings per share rose 12.5% year over year to a record 36 cents and also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents.    Sales in the quarter inched up 0.3% year over year to a record $104 million, but fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $108 million. Domestic residential and commercial municipal water product sales were flat year over year as some customers delayed orders to capitalize on the latest advancement in the ORION Cellular technology, the ORION Cellular Long-Term Evolution (LTE) endpoint, which began shipment in Jun 2017. Domestic sales of flow instrumentation products increased but were partially offset by fewer international projects.Â  The oil and gas business also improved during the quarter.   Cost and Margins    Cost of sales decreased 2% year over year to $63 million. Gross profit in the quarter was $41 million, up 4% from $39.4 million in the prior-year quarter. Gross margin was 39.4%, a 150 basis points (bps) expansion from the year-ago quarter owing to pricing discipline, manufacturing cost controls and its strategy to acquire or consolidate much of distribution network. These actions helped negate the impact of higher brass costs.    Selling, engineering and administration expenses were flat year over year to $24.5 million owing mainly to staffing reductions in the flow instrumentation business in the second half of 2016 and lower health care expenses. Operating income went up 11% to $16.6 million from $14.9 million in the year-earlier quarter. Consequently, operating margin expanded 150 (bps) to 15.9%.   Badger Meter, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise       Badger Meter, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise    |      Badger Meter, Inc. Quote   Financial Position      Badger Meter reported cash and cash equivalents of $13.8 million   at the end of second-quarter 2017, up from $7.3 million at   year-end 2016. Receivables were pegged at $64.4 million at the   second quarter end, higher than $59.8 million as of Dec 31, 2016.   Inventories were $74 million at the end of second quarter   compared with $78 million as of Dec 31, 2016.        Badger Meter acquired D-Flow Technology AB of LuleÃ¥, Sweden in   the second quarter. D-Flow Technology specializes in the design   and development of ultrasonic technology, primarily for use in   flow measurement. With this buyout, the company further   strengthened its presence in the ultrasonic flowmeter market. The   acquisition will help Badger Meter to further enhance its   successful E-Series Ultrasonic product line, lower production   costs and provide a platform for further advancement of   ultrasonic capabilities.           In the last one year, Badger Meter has outperformed the   industry    with respect to price performance. The stock gained around 19.7%,   while the industry rose 17.1%.     Zacks Rank & Key Picks      Badger Meter currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).        Some better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Applied   Optoelectronics, Inc.   AAOI    , Axcelis Technologies, Inc.   ACLS    and Broadcom Limited   AVGO    .        Applied Optoelectronics has delivered a average positive earnings   surprise of 118.33% in the last four quarters. The company sports   a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see    the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here    .      Broadcom Limited, a Zacks Rank #1 stock, has an average positive   earnings surprise of 6.73% for the past four quarters.        Axcelis Technologies carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has   delivered an impressive average positive earnings surprise of   135.78% in the trailing four quarters.     Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric   Cars?      Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150   years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating   millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles   (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching   265 miles on a single charge.        With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to   multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according   to Zacks research.        It's not the one you think.

 Akoustis names John Kurtzweil as CFO
Akoustis  Technologies Inc of Charlotte,  NC, USA, which designs and manufactures patented single-crystal BulkONE bulk  acoustic wave (BAW) high-band RF filters for mobile and other wireless  applications, has named John T. Kurtzweil as chief financial officer (CFO),  replacing Cindy Payne, who remains with the firm as VP of finance and corporate  controller. Concurrent with his appointment as CFO, Kurtzweil has resigned as a  director on the Akoustis board. 
Kurtzweilâs senior-executive leadership and financial experience  includes 19 years as CFO of publicly traded technology companies, as well as  the placement of an aggregate $1.9bn in equity and debt-financing instruments.  He was previously VP finance at Cree Inc, which makes lighting-class LEDs,  lighting and semiconductor products for power and radio-frequency applications.  In addition, he was CFO of Wolfspeed, a Cree company and provider of  wide-bandgap technology for power semiconductors and RF power amplifiers.  Kurtzweil currently serves on the board of directors of Axcelis Technologies. 
From 2012 to 2014, Kurtzweil was senior VP, CFO & special  advisor to the CEO of Extreme Networks Inc. From 2006 to 2012, he was executive  VP of finance, CFO and treasurer of Cree, during which time Creeâs annual  revenue grew from $396m to $1.2bn. From 2004 to 2006, Kurtzweil was senior VP  & CFO of fabless semiconductor firm Cirrus Logic Inc. From 2002 to 2003, he  was senior VP & CFO of ON Semiconductor. Kurtzweil is a CPA (WI), CMA, has  an MBA from the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota, and a  bachelor's degree from Arizona State University in Accounting. 
âI have had the opportunity to interact with John since his  appointment to our board this past January,â notes CEO Jeff Shealy. âHaving  been the CFO at a number of multi-billion-dollar Nasdaq-listed technology  companies, he has expertise not only in finance, but also in strategic  planning, capital formation and M&A,â he adds. 
Kurtzweil says he is joining Akoustis as its CFO âat a time when  we are squarely focused on entering the fast-growing high-band BAW RF filter  market utilizing our patented single-crystal technologyâ¦ My prior experiences  plus insights gained from being on the board uniquely position me to make an  immediate impact.â 
Akoustis is addressing market requirements for improved RF  filters, targeting higher bandwidth, higher operating frequencies and higher  output power compared to incumbent polycrystalline BAW technology. Performance  is driven by the advances of high-purity, single-crystal piezoelectric  materials and the resonator-filter process technology. The material properties  drive electro-mechanical coupling, which translates to wide filter bandwidth.  High-band RF filters are achieved by leveraging the firmâs high-sound-velocity,  single-crystal piezoelectric materials, which offer high-thermal conductivity  along the path of heat flow, enabling high power handling capability of the RF  filter.

Kurtzweil is a CPA (WI), CMA, has an MBA from theÂ University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota,Â and a bachelorâs degree fromÂ Arizona State UniversityÂ in Accounting.
Â 
Commenting on the announcement, Akoustis CEO, Jeff Shealy, stated âI have had the opportunity to interact with John since his appointment to our Board this past January and I can say with certainity that he is a tremendous addition to the Akoustis management team.Â  Having been the CFO at a number of multi-billion dollar Nasdaq-listed technology companies, he has expertise not only in finance, but also in strategic planning, capital formation and M&A.âÂ  Mr. Shealy continued, âFurthermore, I would like to thank Cindy Payne for her numerous contributions as CFO over the last two years and our entire management team looks forward to working with her in her new role.â 
Â 
Â Mr. Kurtzweil commented âI am very excited to be joining Akoustis as its CFO at a time when we are squarely focused on entering the fast growing high band BAW RF filter market utilizing our patented single crystal technology.Â  My prior experiences plus insights gained from being on the Board uniquely position me to make an immediate impact.â
Â 
Akoustis is pioneering next-generation material science to address the market requirements for improved RF filters â targeting higher bandwidth, higher operating frequencies and higher output power compared to incumbent polycrystalline BAW technology deployed today. Superior performance is driven by the significant advances of high-purity, single-crystal piezoelectric materials and the resonator-filter process technology.Â The advanced material properties drive electro-mechanical coupling, which translates to wide filter bandwidth. High-band RF filters are achieved by leveraging the Companyâs high-sound velocity, single-crystal piezoelectric materials.Â These single-crystal piezoelectric materials offer high-thermal conductivity along the path of heat flow, enabling high-power handling capability of the RF filter.
Â 
About Akoustis Technologies, Inc.

ISO-9001 certified commercial wafer-manufacturing facility located in Canandaigua, NY, which includes a state-of-the-art class 100 / class 1000 cleanroom facility â tooled for 150-mm diameter â for the design, development, fabrication and packaging of RF filters, MEMS and semiconductor devices.
