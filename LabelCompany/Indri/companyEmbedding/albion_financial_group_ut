As they settle into the community, find work, and begin the process of assimilation, many refugees go on to innovate and start their own businesses.  This week host Doug Wells speaks with Aden Batar, Director of Immigration and Refugee Resettlement with Catholic Community Services, and Natalie El-Deiry, Deputy Director of Development & Strategic Initiatives with the International Rescue Committee. The IRC runs several entrepreneurship-focused programs including the nationally-recognized Spice Kitchen Incubator, a food entrepreneurship program in cooperation with Salt Lake County, that helps refugees and immigrants prepare to start their own food businesses.]]>

For generations many rural Utah communities have mostly depended on the extraction of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for local jobs. But this dependence has proven painful over the last decade. Disappearing coal jobs are hurting places like Carbon and Emery Counties, and the boom and bust cycles of oil and gas have left Uintah and Duchesne County residents uncertain.
But the impact investment firm Accelerant BSP and the Utah Governor's Office of Economic Development have been working to help local Utah communities develop new employment opportunities.  Joel McKay Smith's firm Accelerant BSP works to pair hiring companies with rural communities. Ben Hart, Deputy Director of the Governor's Office for Economic Development, also discusses how the state is helping rural Utah to expand its economic horizons.]]>

He is also author of Beyond Competitive Advantage: How to Solve the Puzzle of Sustaining Growth While Creating Value. Zenger says corporate strategy is often determining “what we're notgoing to do, rather than what we're going to do.” Speaking with host Doug Wells, Zenger outlines the three “sights” that help determine a corporate theory, and discusses some well-known examples.]]>

Rick Haskell, Assistant Professor of Finance, at Westminster College talks about his Business 101 class, that emphasizes “purpose-driven enterprise” and social entrepreneurism.

When Pat Crowley realized he could make a better energy bar using “cricket flour” for protein, he knew he'd encounter the ick factor. Eating bugs simply doesn't appeal to Americans. But he knew a lesson could be taken from the introduction of sushi to American taste buds in the 1970s. He knew he had to acknowledge people's fear of eating bugs, before they would overcome it and take the first bite.
Crowley talks with host Doug Wells about how he went from being a surf and whitewater raft guide to an entrepreneur who aims to create an entirely new food category. He is driven by his concern for our ability to conserve fresh drinking water in the future, and he says how we raise animals for protein is a big part of the problem. Crowley shares how he meticulously strategized to re-introduce crickets – an ancient food source – into our diets, with Chapul.]]>

Hill is author of Raw Deal: How the “Uber Economy” and Runaway Capitalism Are Screwing American Workers. He discusses the current problems these “gig economy” businesses pose for workers, traditional businesses, and local governments, as well as possible solutions to protect workers going forward.]]>

Sunny Washington, is President and co-founder of Ardusat, an educational technology company that partners with the private satellite company Spire Global that assembles, builds, and launches very small cube satellites.

It's over-filling our landfills and littering our oceans – and it will never decompose. But because plastic comes from oil, why can't it be returned to oil, and be profitable? This is a solution Priyanka Bakaya has devoted much of her career working to solve. Her company PK Clean open its first full-scale commercial plant to convert plastics back into oil in Salt Lake City, Utah, a few years ago in partnership with Utah's largest recycler, Rocky Mountain Recycling. Bakaya talks about the marginal – but profitable – economics of plastics recycling, how she got into the space, and how being a “Clean Tech” entrepreneur has become her passion.]]>

His Hello Eats will soon launch with partnering restaurants in Provo, Utah, and he thinks it will become the new go-to app for restaurants across the country. Gabe acknowledges this space already has competitors, with existing apps like Seamless and Grubhub. But he points out some restaurant owners have compared Seamless to the mob. Gabe says these apps exploit restaurants and create price inflation, which ultimately hurts restaurant owners. Gabe says his App, in comparison, will be payments-based and will cost restaurants and customers nothing to use. That means a low margin, but profitable at scale, he says.
Gundersen is well-known in the Utah tech community. With his brother Jordan he co-founded Izeni, the Provo-based software developer that helps aspiring entrepreneurs to build websites and apps. Gabe also partnered with Clint Betts who created Beehive Startups to launch StartSLC in 2015.]]>

In 2010 after he developed a simple mortgage loan processing program to help his brother in-law's practice, he soon realized he had a tool that could make home buying easier for many people. Thus, Simple Nexus was born. The program aims to help loan originators smooth interactions between borrowers and realtors.

But the process drew attention and controversy recently with a proposed deal to lure a Facebook data center to West Jordan, Utah. What benefits and drawbacks might these kinds of deals bring? What does the process of deal-making for economic development between companies and government entities usually look like?
This week we hosted a panel discussion about economic development in Utah and how state and local municipalities work together to offer incentives aimed at attracting companies to relocate or expand here. Theresa Foxley, Deputy Director of the Governor's Office of Economic Development, talks about the state's holistic strategies and goals for corporate recruitment. Mike Caldwell, Mayor of Ogden City, speaks about the strategies behind Ogden's ambitions to develop its economy around outdoor recreation and advanced manufacturing. Mark DeYoung, CEO of Vista Outdoors, describes the formulaic process of decision-making his company took before choosing to locate to Utah. Vista Outdoors, a year publicly traded company, was offered a tax credit of up to $1.35 million dollars over 7 years to base the firm's new headquarters here in Utah.]]>

But the company faced dire circumstances and Chapter 11 bankruptcy after the 2008 financial crisis when fuel costs plummeted. Crystal Call Maggelet, CEO of FJ Management, was forced to make difficult decisions to keep her company alive, including merging with her closest rival, Pilot Travel Centers. Pilot Flying J is now the largest source for over-the-road diesel fuel, and largest Travel Center chain in the country with over 550 locations.
Maggelet's father Jay Call founded Flying J in the early 1960s, and saw the business morph into a thriving, multi-state travel center business. Growing up amid her father's successes, Crystal faced challenges and naysayers when she decided to launch her own hotel business – Crystal Inn – in downtown Salt Lake City, Utah. After the unexpected death of her father in a small plane crash, Maggelet would later assert the company's pilot seat after Flying J's CEO had expanded the company beyond its means and the Great Recession hit. Learn how Maggelett stabilized the sinking business, and repaid all of their debts despite serious doubts from their creditors.
Along with managing the Pilot Flying J and the Crystal Inn chain, FJ Management oversees Big West Oil, which operates a petroleum refinery in North Salt Lake, the Maverik fuel and convenience store chain, and TAB Bank, an industrial loan chartered bank.]]>

Effective sustainability projects involve changing behaviors. Bill Wilson is the Founder and President of Sustain3, a technology firm that helps companies encourage their employees to participate in setting and achieving sustainability goals.  Sustain3 provides a platform for companies to engage their employees with regular, short bursts of information to help them develop more environmentally-friendly habits. Little things like turning off computers and monitors before going home can generate significant savings for companies. Wilson also shares how he helped to introduce Benefit Corporations to Utah.]]>

Betts says two out of every three Utah children living in low-income families and attending 3rd grade do not read at a proficient level. He says literacy and access to books at home at a young age is an important indicator of a child's outlook for future academic and professional success.]]>

our story
we serve people, not products



 

            We thrive in a culture of continuous learning and believe that we must work to understand what has come before in order to gain clarity on why the world is as it is today.            




In the summer of 1982, Toby Levitt and John Bird found themselves discussing flaws prevalent among financial firms nationwide. “Although there was lip service to the idea of putting the client first,” recalls Bird, “at the end of the day, advisers got paid for selling a product.”
The two envisioned a firm free from any product sales agenda, a firm where clients truly come first. This vision became a reality later that year when Levitt and Bird founded Albion Financial Group: a fee-only Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) legally and culturally committed to each client’s best interest. A fee-only pioneer, Albion has become a nationally recognized, award-winning investment manager and wealth advisor. And, no surprise, the client still comes first. 
INDIVIDUALIZED INVESTING
Goals, timing and risk tolerance—they’re different for each client. We believe in listening. We believe in doing the right thing. And as a fiduciary with a fee-only compensation structure, there’s no pressure to do anything but what’s right for each client.
Our investment relationships begin with a face-to-face conversation. This allows Albion and potential clients to discuss financial goals and investment philosophies—laying the foundation for a personalized and integrated long-term investment plan.
ONE TEAM, A WORLD OF OPTIONS
Managing multiple portfolios or advisors is neither convenient nor financially efficient. Consolidating and coordinating investments through Albion streamlines this experience without sacrificing access to any investment vehicle. And unlike the big brokerage houses, our clients enjoy access to the world-class skill and experience of the entire Albion investment team, not just a single assigned advisor.

BBB Reason for Ratings

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

I called these guys to see if they would look at doing a review of my retirement plan. They told me they'd be happy to help me for $10,000. Or if you had a million dollars they will waive fees. Business must be good.

I called these guys to see if they would look at doing a review of my retirement plan. They told me they'd be happy to help me for $10,000. Or if you had a million dollars they will waive fees. Business must be good.

I called these guys to see if they would look at doing a review of my retirement plan. They told me they'd be happy to help me for $10,000. Or if you had a million dollars they will waive fees. Business must be good.

I called these guys to see if they would look at doing a review of my retirement plan. They told me they'd be happy to help me for $10,000. Or if you had a million dollars they will waive fees. Business must be good.

I called these guys to see if they would look at doing a review of my retirement plan. They told me they'd be happy to help me for $10,000. Or if you had a million dollars they will waive fees. Business must be good.
