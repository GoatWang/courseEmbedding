Concepts inLp-testing

Software testing
Software testing is an investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the product or service under test. Software testing can also provide an objective, independent view of the software to allow the business to appreciate and understand the risks of software implementation. Test techniques include, but are not limited to, the process of executing a program or application with the intent of finding software bugs (errors or other defects). 
                            
                            more from Wikipedia

Property testing
In computer science, a property testing algorithm for a decision problem is an algorithm whose query complexity to its input is much smaller than the instance size of the problem. Typically property testing algorithms are used to decide if some mathematical object has a "global" property, or is "far" from having this property, using only a small number of "local" queries to the object. 
                            
                            more from Wikipedia

Hamming distance
In information theory, the Hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different. Put another way, it measures the minimum number of substitutions required to change one string into the other, or the number of errors that transformed one string into the other. 
                            
                            more from Wikipedia

Metric space
In mathematics, a metric space is a set where a notion of distance between elements of the set is defined. The metric space which most closely corresponds to our intuitive understanding of space is the 3-dimensional Euclidean space. In fact, the notion of "metric" is a generalization of the Euclidean metric arising from the four long-known properties of the Euclidean distance. 
                            
                            more from Wikipedia

Bounded set
"Bounded" and "boundary" are distinct concepts; for the latter see boundary (topology). A circle in isolation is a boundaryless bounded set, while the half plane is unbounded yet has a boundary. In mathematical analysis and related areas of mathematics, a set is called bounded, if it is, in a certain sense, of finite size. Conversely, a set which is not bounded is called unbounded. The word bounded makes no sense in a general topological space, without a metric. 
                            
                            more from Wikipedia

Lp space
In mathematics, the L spaces are function spaces defined using a natural generalization of the p-norm for finite-dimensional vector spaces. They are sometimes called Lebesgue spaces, named after Henri Lebesgue, although according to Bourbaki (1987) they were first introduced by Riesz (1910). L spaces form an important class of Banach spaces in functional analysis, and of topological vector spaces. 
                            
                            more from Wikipedia

Convex function
In mathematics, a real-valued function defined on an interval is called convex (or convex downward or concave upward) if the graph of the function lies below the line segment joining any two points of the graph. Equivalently, a function is convex if its epigraph (the set of points on or above the graph of the function) is a convex set. More generally, this definition of convex functions makes sense for functions defined on a convex subset of any vector space. 
                            
                            more from Wikipedia

Domain of a function
In mathematics, the domain of definition or simply the domain of a function is the set of "input" or argument values for which the function is defined. That is, the function provides an "output" or value for each member of the domain. For instance, the domain of cosine is the set of all real numbers, while the domain of the square root consists only of numbers greater than or equal to 0 (ignoring complex numbers in both cases).

Concepts inLP/LISP: literate programming for Lisp

Literate programming
Literate programming is an approach to programming introduced by Donald Knuth as an alternative to the structured programming paradigm of the 1970s. The literate programming paradigm, as conceived by Knuth, represents a move away from writing programs in the manner and order imposed by the computer, and instead enables programmers to develop programs in the order demanded by the logic and flow of their thoughts. 
                            
                            more from Wikipedia

Lisp (programming language)
Lisp (historically, LISP) is a family of computer programming languages with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized Polish prefix notation. Originally specified in 1958, Lisp is the second-oldest high-level programming language in widespread use today; only Fortran is older (by one year). Like Fortran, Lisp has changed a great deal since its early days, and a number of dialects have existed over its history. 
                            
                            more from Wikipedia

Lisp
A lisp is a speech impediment, historically also known as sigmatism. Stereotypically, people with a lisp are unable to pronounce sibilants, and replace them with interdentals, though there are actually several kinds of lisp. The result is that the speech is unclear. "Interdental" lisping is produced when the tip of the tongue protrudes between the front teeth and "dentalised" lisping is produced when the tip of the tongue just touches the front teeth. 
                            
                            more from Wikipedia

Self-hosting
The term self-hosting was coined to refer to the use of a computer program as part of the toolchain or operating system that produces new versions of that same program¿for example, a compiler that can compile its own source code. Self-hosting software is commonplace on personal computers and larger systems. Other programs that are typically self-hosting include kernels, assemblers, shells and revision control software.

Compiled language
A compiled language is a programming language whose implementations are typically compilers, and not interpreters (step-by-step executors of source code, where no translation takes place). The term is somewhat vague; in principle any language can be implemented with a compiler or with an interpreter. A combination of both solutions is also increasingly common: a compiler can translate the source code into some intermediate form, which is then passed to an interpreter which executes it.

Donald Knuth
Donald Ervin Knuth is a computer scientist and Professor Emeritus at Stanford University. He is the author of the seminal multi-volume work The Art of Computer Programming. Knuth has been called the "father" of the analysis of algorithms. He contributed to the development of the rigorous analysis of the computational complexity of algorithms and systematized formal mathematical techniques for it. In the process he also popularized the asymptotic notation.

Software documentation
Software documentation or source code documentation is written text that accompanies computer software. It either explains how it operates or how to use it, and may mean different things to people in different roles.

Syntactic sugar
Syntactic sugar is a computer science term that refers to syntax within a programming language that is designed to make things easier to read or to express. It makes the language "sweeter" for humans to use: things can be expressed more clearly, more concisely, or in an alternative style that some may prefer.

An ISO TP4-TP0 Gateway

            Landweber, Lawrence H.; Tasman, Mitchell; Yeong, Wengyik
        

            The ISO TP4 and TP0 transport layer protocols and associated network service paradigms cannot interoperate, yet both are likely to be in common use. To allow users of TP4 to communicate with users of TP0, transport layer gateways will be needed. This paper discusses several design alternatives, and describes a prototype gateway implementation.

             Demonstrations Interactive learning with Gateway Labs Mary Johansen, Jason Kapusta and Doug Baldwin Dept. of Computer Science SUNY Geneseo {mmj96, jmk98, baldwin}@cs.geneseo. A gateway lab is an interactive, computer-delivered tutorial that helps students make the transition from passively acquired knowledge of abstract concepts to active and concrete use of that knowledge. This demonstration consists of a show and tell  period in which we show how gateway labs reinforce concepts of syntax, mathematics, and algorithms, followed by edu an audience participation  session in which we demonstrate additional gateways and pedagogical points according to participants  questions and comments. We also explain how participants can acquire copies of gateway labs from our WWW site. This demonstration complements the paper Three years  experience with Gateway Labs . Windows-based applications Sheila in Visual Basic using project teams E. Castaneda Dubuque Clarke College, Iowa, cast@ keller.clarke.edu This demonstration presents the fundamentals of Microsoft s Visual Basic as used in a one-semester, upper-level Computer Information Systems class. Student teams choose, design, program and document a complete user application in their first introduction to Windows-based programming.
