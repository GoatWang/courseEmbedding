Crown Castle: Investors








InvestorsA stable model for future growth.
As the nation’s largest provider of wireless infrastructure, Crown Castle is helping enable the essential services that people rely on to stay in touch, conduct business, and live their lives every day. As consumer demand for data services continues to grow, wireless carrier demand for space on our shared infrastructure will only grow with it. This compelling business model, combined with our disciplined allocation of capital, virtually assures our financial stability for years to come. In January of 2014, we officially became a REIT. 
This conversion marked the alignment of our business structure with our long-term commitment to provide the nation’s wireless carriers with the prime real estate they need to meet the demands of their consumers. Because today, access to technology and information is no longer a luxury. It’s a necessity.Upcoming EventsNewsCrown Castle Announces Pricing of Public Offerings of Common Stock and Mandatory Convertible Preferred StockJuly 21, 2017Crown Castle Announces Proposed Public Offerings of Common Stock and Mandatory Convertible Preferred StockJuly 19, 2017Crown Castle Reports Second Quarter 2017 Results and Updates Outlook for Full Year 2017July 19, 2017Crown Castle Announces Revised Schedule for Second  Quarter 2017 Earnings Release and Conference CallJuly 18, 2017Recent Events

Crown Castle: Towers







































Towers






As demand for wireless connectivity continues to increase, you need the ability to quickly expand to ensure that your customers continue to receive the service they expect. The shared infrastructure model is the most efficient way to give wireless carriers access to every market. For you as a carrier, the benefits are hard to ignore. In addition to lower costs than building and owning towers, leasing allows you to better allocate your capital and focus on your core business.

Experience: We have 20 years of experience in the tower industry and enjoy strong relationships with every major wireless carrier. They rely on our expertise to handle even the most complex situations.
Turnkey solutions: We design, build, and maintain cost-effective infrastructure solutions from start to finish and can get you on air quickly.
Local presence: We have 40 district offices in the US, across 4 regional areas, and our people on the ground have the knowledge and authority to ensure proper planning.
Staff: Many of our seasoned professionals have over 10 years of experience in the industry. They can provide site acquisition, construction, architecture and engineering, and zoning and permitting services.
Customer satisfaction: We are the industry leaders in customer satisfaction based on speed, responsiveness, and tools.

On July 19, 2017, Crown Castle signed a definitive agreement to acquire Lightower for approximately $7.1 billion in cash. Lightower is a fiber network operator primarily in the northeast United States. This transaction increases Crown castle's fiber network to approximately 60,000 route miles.[4]
On August 31, 2004 Crown Castle completed the sale of its UK subsidiary, Crown Castle UK, to National Grid Transco plc for $2.035 billion in cash[5][6] National Grid Transco plc was renamed as National Grid plc in July 2005, while Crown Castle UK was renamed National Grid Wireless in October 2005.
On January 12, 2007, Crown Castle completed the acquisition of Global Signal Inc., a rival U.S. tower operator which was based in Sarasota, Florida.[7]
On December 11, 2011, Crown Castle announced a definitive agreement to purchase NextG Networks, Inc. for about $1.0 billion. NextG had over 7,000 distributed antenna system nodes on-air at the time of the agreement with another 1,500 nodes under construction as well as rights to more than 4,600 miles of fiber optic cables.[8]
On September 28, 2012, Crown Castle entered a tower leasing agreement with T-Mobile USA. The deal leases 7,200 wireless towers to the company for a term of 28 years in exchange for $2.4 billion. After the deal ends in 2040, Crown Castle may be able to purchase the towers for an additional $2.4 billion.[9]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Santa Cruz:













Does Crown Castle carry a valid contracting license?



In California, any remodeling or construction project that exceeds $500 (labor and materials), requires a contractor to have an active license with the California Contractor State License Board (CSLB).
Crown Castle currently holds license 1234 (Contractor, Electrical), which was Active when we last checked.











How important is contractor licensing in Santa Cruz?



The CSLB is one of the highest rated licensing boards in the US. Applicants are required to pass a written board exam and prove at least four years of prior, relevant work experience. In addition, the CSLB requires all license holders to maintain at least $2,500 in operating capital and provides you with a range of other consumer protections.











Your liability risk when hiring Crown Castle



Contractors in California are required to carry workers' compensation insurance if they have employees and proof of liability insurance with the cumulative limit of $1 million for licensees with five or fewer persons, and an additional 100,000 for each additional member over five, not to exceed $5 million total.











Financial recourse when hiring Crown Castle



All licensed contractors in California are required to maintain a bond, which provides you with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations. If you feel as though you have been taken advantage of, you should leave feedback on the contractor's BuildZoom profile and file a complaint with the CSLB.











What else should I know before hiring Crown Castle



California contractors are required to submit their fingerprints to the board, which are then checked against criminal records held by the California Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to obtaining a valid contracting license.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The California State License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Crown Castle International Corp. is an American corporation headquartered in Houston, Texas, which provides infrastructure for broadcasting, mobile telephony and wireless broadband including small cell, traditional cell sites, rooftop sites and indoor/outdoor distributed antenna systems. It operates in the United States, including Puerto Rico. It provides mobile telephone coverage to all of the top 100 markets in the US[3] on behalf of service providers such as Verizon, AT&T Mobility, Sprint and T-Mobile. In 2015, the company ranked #166 in the S&P 500 index.
Recent History[edit]
On July 19, 2017, Crown Castle signed a definitive agreement to acquire Lightower for approximately $7.1 billion in cash. Lightower is a fiber network operator primarily in the northeast United States. This transaction increases Crown castle's fiber network to approximately 60,000 route miles.[4]
On August 31, 2004 Crown Castle completed the sale of its UK subsidiary, Crown Castle UK, to National Grid Transco plc for $2.035 billion in cash[5][6] National Grid Transco plc was renamed as National Grid plc in July 2005, while Crown Castle UK was renamed National Grid Wireless in October 2005.
On January 12, 2007, Crown Castle completed the acquisition of Global Signal Inc., a rival U.S. tower operator which was based in Sarasota, Florida.[7]
On December 11, 2011, Crown Castle announced a definitive agreement to purchase NextG Networks, Inc. for about $1.0 billion. NextG had over 7,000 distributed antenna system nodes on-air at the time of the agreement with another 1,500 nodes under construction as well as rights to more than 4,600 miles of fiber optic cables.[8]
On September 28, 2012, Crown Castle entered a tower leasing agreement with T-Mobile USA. The deal leases 7,200 wireless towers to the company for a term of 28 years in exchange for $2.4 billion. After the deal ends in 2040, Crown Castle may be able to purchase the towers for an additional $2.4 billion.[9]
On October 20, 2013, Crown Castle entered a tower leasing agreement with AT&T Mobility. The deal leases 9,700 wireless towers to the company for a term of 28 years in exchange for $4.85 billion. Crown Castle also gained the right to acquire the towers outright in the future for $4.2 billion. 600 towers will be acquired outright by Crown Castle in the future. AT&T will pay $1,900 a month per site to access the towers with rent rising approximately 2% per year.[10]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
