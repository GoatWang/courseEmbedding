Berkeley Lights is enabling precise cell by cell selection and manipulation to empower: cell line development, antibody discovery and engineering, and manufacturing of personalized cellular therapies.







Our STORY












OUR STORY


Founded in 2011, Berkeley Lights, Inc. delivers breakthrough platforms and devices that fundamentally change the way biological processes are done. Our technology will revolutionize how scientist and researchers study the interaction of cells and transform and accelerate cellular therapies.
 






Science & Engineering


Berkeley Lights believes that biological challenges, no matter how profound will be solved through a collaborative partnership of science and engineering.
 






Development


Our team of biologists, engineers and software designers have created an environment that is both flexible and consistent. Our foundational belief is that our technology and platforms will enable a broad set of applications, creating a new ecosystem for biological discovery. To achieve this goal, we needed to create foundational technologies that could be modified to allow for the greatest variety of functionality.
 






Precision


In biology, the smallest unit of life that exists is the single cell. Each specialized human cell type has very specific characteristics and plays a very specific role in the body.
 






Partnering


Berkeley Lights is dedicated to bringing transformational platforms to market that incorporate precise cell by cell selection and manipulation.

Beacon & Applications












Beacon


We are now taking orders for the first in a series of powerful tools that will culminate in the industry gold standard for personalized biopharmaceutical, cell genomic, and cellular therapy applications.
 
 






Cell Line Development


Every day saved in the development of a biological equates to significant financial gains. Getting to market faster, cheaper and better is the goal.
 






Antibody Discovery


Actionable Results in Days Instead of Weeks or Months
 






Assays


Assaying on the Beacon platform is fast and easy. A number of different assays can be performed to fully characterize each cell such as IgG secretion, affinity, species cross–reactivity, and functional assays.
 





 
 




Searchlight & Applications












Cellular Therapy


Berkeley Lights is developing the ultimate patient-centric therapeutic approach: an integrated, self-contained platform that will enable a fully automated process for the delivery of cellular therapy protocols.
 






Cellular Therapy Manufacturing


Leveraging our cross-functional team of biologists and engineers, we are developing SearchLight, a fully-automated, sterile platform that will manufacture allogeneic and autologous cell therapies.
 






SearchLight


Searchlight: Your Cellular Therapy Manufacturing Platform.
Leveraging our expertise in precise cellular processing, Berkeley Lights is developing a fully integrated platform that will enable the development and manufacturing of cellular therapies.
 





 
 




OUR TECHNOLOGY












OUR TECHNOLOGY


Berkeley Lights, Inc. delivers a fundamentally new approach to biopharmaceutical, genomic and clinical applications.
 






OptoSelect Chip


For the first time, biologists can directly view and manipulate individual cells (or other micro-objects).
 






OEP


Opto electro positioning (OEP) enables parallel manipulation of hundreds of single cells in a single field of view. The base silicon of each nano-fluidic chip contains millions of light induced electrical switches. Computer patterned low intensity white light activates these switches, inducing a dielectrophoretic force that repels cells or beads above 1 um. This force is used to guide cells into nano-pens for subsequent steps such as culture or secretion assays. This entire process occurs in normal cell culture media and is compatible with all media formulations tested to date. An upright fluorescent microscope allows selection of cells based on size, shape and fluorescence intensity in up to 5 fluorescent channels.
 






WORKFLOW


BLI follows a rigorous process for translating existing or novel workflows onto our system. First, the desired workflows are entensively documented, including detailed specifications for each step of the process. The workflow is then mapped onto the existing set of system moduels which are linked together to complete the entire process. If new modules are needed, changes are made first to software, then consumable design and finally hardware if necessary. BLI works closely with customers to provide detailed and continuous development updates. Customer programs conclude with delivery of an automated system capable of performing the specified workflow.
 






AUTOMATION


The Berkeley Lights Beacon platform is designed to operate with a high degree of automation.  Cells and reagents are loaded and unloaded from the system in standard 96 well plates. Most aspects of a workflow including cell import, selection, culture, assay and export are automated by highly developed software packages enabling push-button, walk-away operation. Cell selection, cell counting and assay analysis are implemented on the Beacon platform by our proprietary automated OEP technology and OptoSelect software.

Berkeley Lights Emerges from Stealth Mode with $90 Million in the Bank  











Tweet








9/21/2015 11:08:28 AM


Partners with Sequoia and Walden Riverwood Ventures and raises $90 million

Emeryville, CA – September 21, 2015 – Berkeley Lights, Inc. (BLI) emerged from stealth today, announcing its fundamentally new approach to biopharmaceuticals, genomics and clinical applications. The company also announced it has partnered with Sequoia and Walden Riverwood Ventures and raised $90 million in funding to date.
"Berkeley Lights is poised to transform antibody discovery, cell-line development and single cell annotation and genomics,” said Igor Khandros, Berkeley Lights CEO and co-founder. “Our nanofluidic biosystems enable interactive biology at the cellular level, empowering scientists and researchers to study and interact with single cells in ways never before possible. Early engagements with biopharma companies and leading research institutes are demonstrating the enormous potential of our platform to enable new workflows and streamline existing ones. Massively parallel single cell sorting, selection, assaying, culturing and recovery for follow-on sequencing or processing can now be done on a single nanofluidic chip.”
The Berkeley Lights’ platform, which includes its OptoSelect™ light technology, automates challenging tasks such as tumor profiling – morphology, surface markers, sequence and protein secretions – of single cells from fine needle aspirates (FNAs) and other precious samples.
BLI is also engaged with several global biopharmaceutical companies to enable new workflows for therapeutic antibody discovery and production cell line development. Amgen’s Vice President of Research, Philip Tagari, will present information on BLI’s OptoSelectTM technology and its application in antibody discovery at the Discovery Summit conference on September 22nd. The company is pursuing collaborations to extend the use of its opto-nanofluidic platform into clinical and other applications.

In conjunction with the financing, Michael Moritz of Sequoia and Michael Marks of Walden Riverwood Ventures (WRV) joined Lip-Bu Tan of WRV, and company co-founders Bill Davidow, Dr. Wu and Dr. Khandros, on Berkeley Lights’ Board of Directors.
ABOUT BERKELEY LIGHTS:
Berkeley Lights opto-nanofluidic platforms are enabling interactive biology at the cellular level and empowering scientists and researchers to study and interact with single cells in ways never before possible. Headquartered in Emeryville, California, Berkeley Lights is working with biopharma and biotech companies to facilitate drug discovery and cell line development, and with research institutes on single-cell annotation and genomics. For more information, visit the company’s website at www.berkeleylights.com.
About Sequoia
The Sequoia team helps a small number of daring founders build legendary companies. We spur them to push the boundaries of what’s possible. In partnering with Sequoia, companies benefit from our unmatched community and the lessons we’ve learned over 40 years working with Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, John Morgridge, Jerry Yang, Elon Musk, Larry Page, Jan Koum, Brian Chesky, Drew Houston, Adi Tatarko and Jack Dorsey, among many others. In aggregate, Sequoia-backed companies account for more than 20% of NASDAQ’s total value. We’re proud that their success also fuels great causes: since 2000 alone we have returned more than $10 billion to non-profits like the Ford Foundation, Mayo Clinic and MIT.
About Walden Riverwood Ventures

Walden-Riverwood Ventures is a partnership between two successful VC firms, Walden International and Riverwood Capital. Walden International is a leading international venture capital firm that has been providing investors access to cross-border, IT opportunities with the advantage of an unrivaled Pan Asia network since 1987.

Contemporary lighting is an updated mix of the latest trends and styles. Classified by simple smooth angles, grays, monochromes, mixed with clear or white glass.
	




Modern lighting is characterized by clean, sharp lines dominantly in brushed steels and chromes. Modern Lighting transforms lighting fixtures into an artpiece for your home.
	




Traditional lighting is characterized by smooth classic lines that range a variety of historical periods and will make any home look more elegant.
	






Transitional lighting is defined as a mix of contemporary and traditional. This style fuses two top selling styles into one beautiful design for your space.
	




Rustic lighting is known for use of earthy tones, sturdy wrought irons and antler decorations. Rustic lighting fits in everything from a cabin, home in the mountains, or home in the suburbs.
	




Colonial lighting is marked by simple, traditional lines often combined with the use of basic woods or irons. Lanterns, chandeliers and wall sconces with candle-style bulbs make a simple yet attractive luminaire for any space.

Voltage

Low Voltage

			 These outdoor lights run on low voltage direct current (DC) between 12V and 24V. They require an external transformer, and can easily be installed by a homeowner. Wiring between lights can be buried directly in the ground
		






Line Voltage

			 These outdoor lights run on mains power, which is the same power that is inside your home (AC). They do not require an external transformer, but they are best left to professional installation, since they must pass electrical code inspection in most areas.

Why don't we show the price?

					Like many retailers, LightingDirect.com can choose to set its own prices independently. And even though manufacturers require LightingDirect.com and other retailers to display a product's "minimum advertised price" (or MAP), the retailer can choose to sell for less than that. But the price must be conveyed in other ways, and each individual manufacturer's MAP policy determines where the price can be seen.
				

					To see the price for this product at LightingDirect.com, you'll need to place it in your shopping cart, and maybe even proceed to final checkout. If you're not ready to buy the product, simply remove it from the cart.
				

					LightingDirect.com apologizes for any inconvenience. We'd just like to offer you the chance to save extra money while we adhere to manufacturers' MAP policies. LightingDirect.com is also working to educate manufacturers on how their policies impact customers and their buying behavior.

Contemporary lighting is an updated mix of the latest trends and styles. Classified by simple smooth angles, grays, monochromes, mixed with clear or white glass.
	




Modern lighting is characterized by clean, sharp lines dominantly in brushed steels and chromes. Modern Lighting transforms lighting fixtures into an artpiece for your home.
	




Traditional lighting is characterized by smooth classic lines that range a variety of historical periods and will make any home look more elegant.
	






Transitional lighting is defined as a mix of contemporary and traditional. This style fuses two top selling styles into one beautiful design for your space.
	




Rustic lighting is known for use of earthy tones, sturdy wrought irons and antler decorations. Rustic lighting fits in everything from a cabin, home in the mountains, or home in the suburbs.
	




Colonial lighting is marked by simple, traditional lines often combined with the use of basic woods or irons. Lanterns, chandeliers and wall sconces with candle-style bulbs make a simple yet attractive luminaire for any space.

Voltage



Low Voltage

			 These outdoor lights run on low voltage direct current (DC) between 12V and 24V. They require an external transformer, and can easily be installed by a homeowner. Wiring between lights can be buried directly in the ground
		






Line Voltage

			 These outdoor lights run on mains power, which is the same power that is inside your home (AC). They do not require an external transformer, but they are best left to professional installation, since they must pass electrical code inspection in most areas.

Why don't we show the price?

					Like many retailers, LightingDirect.com can choose to set its own prices independently. And even though manufacturers require LightingDirect.com and other retailers to display a product's "minimum advertised price" (or MAP), the retailer can choose to sell for less than that. But the price must be conveyed in other ways, and each individual manufacturer's MAP policy determines where the price can be seen.
				

					To see the price for this product at LightingDirect.com, you'll need to place it in your shopping cart, and maybe even proceed to final checkout. If you're not ready to buy the product, simply remove it from the cart.
				

					LightingDirect.com apologizes for any inconvenience. We'd just like to offer you the chance to save extra money while we adhere to manufacturers' MAP policies. LightingDirect.com is also working to educate manufacturers on how their policies impact customers and their buying behavior.
