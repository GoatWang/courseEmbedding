All forward-looking statements attributable to Mitel, or persons acting on its behalf, and are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements set forth in this paragraph. Undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. In addition, material risks that could cause results of operations to differ include the Mitel's ability to achieve or sustain profitability in the future since its acquisition of Aastra; fluctuations in the quarterly and annual revenues and operating results; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; current and ongoing global economic instability, political unrest and related  sanctions, particularly in connection with the Ukraine and the Middle East; intense competition; reliance on channel partners for a significant component of sales; dependence upon a small number of outside contract manufacturers to manufacture products; the ability to successfully integrate the acquisition of Aastra and realize certain synergies; and, our ability to implement and achieve our business strategies successfully. Additional risks are described under the heading "Risk Factors" in Mitel's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2015.  Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Except as required by law, we do not have any intention or obligation to update or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, future events or developments, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting the forward-looking statements.

Mitel Next Berlin 2016 - Interview of Graham Bevington




Mitel Next Berlin 2016 - Interview of Graham Bevington



By the Experts at MitelFeb 18, 2016 

 
Video Transcript
 
It's been a really exciting day for everybody in the Mitel Enterprise division. We've launched MiTeam, a new collaboration tool, real time, real simple. You basically can send an email, to invite someone into your group. It takes us to a different level, it moves us beyond all the over the top applications that require special power, drain the battery, have to be within the wall garden.
 
We're really changing the game now, and we're leveraging the mobile infrastructure and the mobile guys' knowledge to make sure that we can do things so differently now. The future's really exciting, as Mitel moves forward and integrates the cloud, mobile, and enterprise. We really are taking our applications and our services to the next level.
 
When it really gets exciting is when we move into verticals. Then you can really start to see people's eyes light up, as they see the application of all three technologies in such a different way. Today, we talked about health care. Previously, we've talked about hospitality. There'll be more verticals coming down the line, as we start to articulate our story of how a combined Mitel is so different from the rest of the market.
