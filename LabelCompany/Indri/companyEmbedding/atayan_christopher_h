Finalist
When Christopher H. Atayan arrived for his first day on the job at AMCON Distributing Company, he was met with utter chaos. The business had negative availability of $2 million on its bank lines, it was being sued in four separate jurisdictions, it was being delisted by the American Stock Exchange, it was behind on taxes, it was losing business, and it was more than $65 million in debt. Those are just some of the details.
Atayan was brought in as chairman and CEO to get rid the mess and save the Omaha-based company from total destruction. That was in 2006. In 2008 and 2009, AMCON, a wholesale distributor of consumer products to retail outlets and convenience stores and an operator of health food stores, achieved two record years of profitability.
How did he do it? Atayan developed a simple strategic plan. The strategy was divided by needs, with the first priority being crisis management, followed by debt reduction and growth. Atayan created a small corporate staff that would handle the crisis, while the operating units would focus on their respective businesses and customers.
To quell the crisis, AMCON shut down a money losing division and sold a bottled water operation. Atayan installed a new team of auditors and developed a financial department that had seven CPAs on staff. The attention to detail allowed the company to gain reinstatement on the NYSE and begin down a path of financial stability.
While these decisions took place, Atayan installed a culture centered on putting one foot in front of the other. It was his ability to align management to the corporate financial and cultural objects that proved to be the key ingredient in turning the company around.
In 2009, Atayan bought out the company’s founders and made a significant personal investment in AMCON.

AMCON Distributing Company Names Christopher Atayan Chairman








February 04, 2008 07:30 AM Eastern Standard Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AMCON Distributing Company (“AMCON”) 
      (AMEX:DIT), an Omaha, Nebraska-based consumer products company, is 
      pleased to announce that at its Annual Shareholders Meeting, Christopher 
      H. Atayan, the Company’s Chief Executive 
      Officer, was named to the additional post of Chairman of the Board. 
      Atayan succeeds William F. Wright, AMCON’s 
      founder and largest common shareholder. Wright will remain as a director 
      and consultant to the Company on strategic matters. This appointment is 
      part of the management transition plan that was initiated in March 2006. “We 
      are delighted that Bill will continue to work closely with us as we 
      implement our strategic plan. We will continue to build on his vision of 
      creating the premier service provider in the industry,” 
      said Atayan.
    


      Our Annual Shareholders Meeting was held in Irving, Texas on January 29, 
      2008 and all matters up for consideration were approved. Additionally, 
      the Company named Timothy Pestotnik, a Director of the Company, to the 
      position of Lead Director. He succeeds Raymond Bentele who remains a 
      director. Atayan commented, “We look forward 
      to working with Tim as we continue to position AMCON as a leader in 
      corporate governance and appreciated Ray’s 
      efforts in the role over the years.”


      The Chairman and CEO’s 2007 annual letter to 
      shareholders can be found at www.amcon.com/fiscal07.aspx.
    

      AMCON is a leading wholesale distributor of consumer products, including 
      beverages, candy, tobacco, groceries, food service, frozen and chilled 
      foods, and health and beauty care products with distribution centers in 
      Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. 
      Chamberlin's Natural Foods, Inc. and Health Food Associates, Inc., both 
      wholly-owned subsidiaries of The Healthy Edge, Inc., operate health and 
      natural product retail stores in central Florida (6), Kansas, Missouri, 
      Nebraska and Oklahoma (4). The retail stores operate under the names 
      Chamberlin's Market & Cafe and Akins Natural Foods Market.
    

This news release contains forward-looking statements that are 
      subject to risks and uncertainties and which reflect management's 
      current beliefs and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry 
      conditions, Company performance and financial results. A number of 
      factors could affect the future results of the Company and could cause 
      those results to differ materially from those expressed in the Company's 
      forward-looking statements including, without limitation, availability 
      of sufficient cash resources to conduct its business and meet its 
      capital expenditures needs. Moreover, past financial performance should 
      not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance. 
      Accordingly, the Company claims the protection of the safe harbor for 
      forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities 
      Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to all such forward-looking 
      statements.
