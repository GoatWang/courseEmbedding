1 In U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2016. Source Ameriprise Q2 Earnings Release. Includes all assets managed by entities in the Columbia and Threadneedle group of companies. Contact us for more current data.
2Source: ICI as of December 31, 2016 for Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC.
3The Overall Morningstar Rating is as of December 31, 2016 and for Class Z shares. Out of 101 Z-share Columbia funds rated by Morningstar, 18 funds received a 5-star Overall Rating and 33 funds received a 4-star Overall Rating. Class Z shares are sold at net asset value and have limited eligibility. Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. offers multiple share classes, not all necessarily available through all firms, and the share class ratings may vary. Contact us for details. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a retail mutual fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For share classes that do not have a 3-, 5- or 10-year actual performance history, the fund’s independent Morningstar Rating metric is then compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
The Morningstar RatingTM is for Class Z shares only; other classes may have different performance characteristics and may have different ratings.

1 In U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2016. Source Ameriprise Q2 Earnings Release. Includes all assets managed by entities in the Columbia and Threadneedle group of companies. Contact us for more current data.
2Source: ICI as of December 31, 2016 for Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC.
3The Overall Morningstar Rating is as of December 31, 2016 and for Class Z shares. Out of 101 Z-share Columbia funds rated by Morningstar, 18 funds received a 5-star Overall Rating and 33 funds received a 4-star Overall Rating. Class Z shares are sold at net asset value and have limited eligibility. Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. offers multiple share classes, not all necessarily available through all firms, and the share class ratings may vary. Contact us for details. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a retail mutual fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For share classes that do not have a 3-, 5- or 10-year actual performance history, the fund’s independent Morningstar Rating metric is then compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
The Morningstar RatingTM is for Class Z shares only; other classes may have different performance characteristics and may have different ratings.

Overview






Investment Approach
BlackRock Debt Strategies Fund, Inc.’s (DSU) (the 'Fund') primary investment objective is to provide current income by investing primarily in a
diversified portfolio of US companies’ debt instruments, including corporate loans, which are rated in the lower rating categories of the established
rating services (BBB or lower by S&P’s or Baa or lower by Moody’s) or unrated debt instruments, which are in the judgment of the investment adviser of
equivalent quality. The Fund’s secondary objective is to provide capital appreciation. Corporate loans include senior and subordinated corporate loans,
both secured and unsecured. The Fund may invest directly in such securities or synthetically through the use of derivatives.No assurance can be given that the Fund's investment objective will be achieved.

The performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. 
Returns are shown net of advisory fees paid by the fund and net of the fund’s operating fees and expenses. Investors who purchase shares of the fund through an investment adviser or other financial professional may separately pay a fee to that service provider. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

If a Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains in the current fiscal year; a portion of its distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of a shareholder's investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect a Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with 'yield' or 'income'. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Fund's net asset value per share. Although the character of income will not be determined until the end of the fund’s fiscal year, please refer to the 'Closed-End Fund Resources' section of the BlackRock website for Section 19 notices that provide estimated amounts and sources of the fund's distributions, which should not be not be relied upon for tax reporting purposes. A Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year will be sent to shareholders to illustrate how the Fund’s distributions should be reported for federal income tax purposes.
The December 2016 distribution is show on a post-split basis, reflecting the 1-for-3 reverse stock split that went effective on November 16, 2016.


 
The performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares may be worth more or less than the original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted, and numbers may reflect small variances due to rounding. Standardized performance and performance data current to the most recent month end may be found in the Performance section.

Premium/Discount
The amount the Fund is trading above or below the reported NAV expressed as a percentage of NAV. When the Fund’s closing price is greater than the Fund’s NAV, it is said to be trading at a &quot;Premium&quot; and the percentage is expressed as a positive number. When the Fund’s closing price is less than the Fund’s NAV, it is said to be trading at a &quot;Discount&quot; and the percentage is expressed as a negative number. Closing price is determined using the last traded price on the Fund’s listed exchange and NAV is calculated daily (usually 4:00pm eastern time).

The annual yield an investor would receive if the most recent fund distribution and current fund price stayed the same going forward. It is calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution and dividing by the fund&#39;s market price from the as-of-date. The distribution rate may include a return of capital. Please refer to the &quot;Closed-End Fund Resources&quot; section of the BlackRock website for Section 19 notices that provide estimated amounts and sources of the fund&#39;s distributions, which should not be relied upon for tax reporting purposes.

The fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency. Credit quality ratings on underlying securities of the fund are received from S&P, Moody’s and Fitch and converted to the equivalent S&P major rating category. This breakdown is provided by BlackRock and takes the median rating of the three agencies when all three agencies rate a security the lower of the two ratings if only two agencies rate a security and one rating if that is all that is provided. Unrated securities do not necessarily indicate low quality. Below investment-grade is represented by a rating of BB and below. Ratings and portfolio credit quality may change over time.





Negative weightings may result from specific circumstances (including timing differences between trade and settle dates of securities purchased by the funds) and/or the use of certain financial instruments, including derivatives, which may be used to gain or reduce market exposure and/or risk management.

Allocations are subject to change.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the SEC Edgar database. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


Common shares for most of the closed-end funds identified above are only available for purchase and sale at current market price on a stock exchange. A closed-end fund’s dividend yield, market price and NAV will fluctuate with market conditions. The information for these funds is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell Fund shares.


Performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. All returns assume reinvestment of all dividends. The market value and net asset value (NAV) of a fund's shares will fluctuate with market conditions. Closed-end funds may trade at a premium to NAV but often trade at a discount.  The fund is actively managed and its characteristics will vary. Stock and bond values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions. International investing involves special risks including, but not limited to political risks, currency fluctuations, illiquidity and volatility. These risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets. Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments. Principal of mortgage- or asset-backed securities normally may be prepaid at any time, reducing the yield and market value of those securities. Obligations of US govt. agencies are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the US govt. Non-investment-grade debt securities (high-yield/junk bonds) may be subject to greater market fluctuations, risk of default or loss of income and principal than higher rated securities. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative and are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns. In addition, many emerging securities markets have lower trading volumes and less liquidity. The fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns. Derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. The Fund is subject to numerous risks, including investment risks. Shares of closed-end funds often trade at a discount from their net asset value. The Fund is not a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.  The amounts and sources of distributions reported in any notices are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. Yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the Fund's NAV at the end of the end of the period.  Some investors may be subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT).   Some BlackRock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end. Those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields. There is no assurance that a fund will repeat that yield in the future. Subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary income or capital gains in the form of dividends will likely be lower.


The Funds are distributed by BlackRock Investments, LLC (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”).

2Source: ICI as of December 31, 2016 for Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC.
3The Overall Morningstar Rating is as of December 31, 2016 and for Class Z shares. Out of 101 Z-share Columbia funds rated by Morningstar, 18 funds received a 5-star Overall Rating and 33 funds received a 4-star Overall Rating. Class Z shares are sold at net asset value and have limited eligibility. Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. offers multiple share classes, not all necessarily available through all firms, and the share class ratings may vary. Contact us for details. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a retail mutual fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For share classes that do not have a 3-, 5- or 10-year actual performance history, the fund’s independent Morningstar Rating metric is then compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
The Morningstar RatingTM is for Class Z shares only; other classes may have different performance characteristics and may have different ratings.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
