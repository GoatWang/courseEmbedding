As expected, after a minor adjustment to the terms of its earlier announced agreement to acquire HS Infusion Holdings, Inc.’s home infusion and home nursing products and services business Home Solutions, BioScrip, Inc. (BIOS  -  Free Report)	 has finally completed the transaction.We note that in its effort to focus on its Infusion Services business, the company had decided to acquire Home Solutions in June. Home Solutions particularly caters to patients suffering from chronic and acute medical conditions. According to BioScrip, the consolidated company will be a stronger player in the infusion services market with the complimentary services and enhanced focus on higher margin, core infusion therapies.We note that, while the initial closing consideration was $85 million, it was reduced to $75 million later on. The cash component of the consideration was lowered to $67.5 million from $80.0 million.Price  Price |  QuoteThe combined company is expected to generate revenues of more than $1 billion. Additionally, the acquisition, while accelerating the company’s growth in core business, is likely to generate between $14−$17 million in cost savings within approximately 12−18 months following the completion. In terms of operating synergy, the inclusion of Home Solutions will benefit BioScrip with respect to balance sheet and leverage profile, supply chain efficiencies, infrastructure optimization, and other corporate and organizational improvements.As per the latest amendment of the Asset Purchase Agreement to facilitate the timely closure of this transaction, BioScrip and Home Solutions now have to arrange for a shareholder meeting to seek BioScrip stockholder approval to increase its authorized share capital. The date of this meeting will be announced accordingly.We note that over the recent past, BioScrip has been recording consistent growth in its core Infusion Services business where it has a strong presence and enjoys a competitive advantage. BioScrip has already taken a number of steps to focus on the core Infusion business in order to drive further growth therein.These include the sale of its legacy specialty and mail service pharmacies; the divestiture of its home health services business; the latest divestment of the PBM business to ProCare Rx; and its plan to sell or shift 9 core patient service activities accumulated through acquisitions, to alliance pharmacy providers.The company has been engaged in a series of takeovers and sell-outs in recent times as well, the latest example being the impending buyout of Home Solutions. Further, BioScrip continues to evaluate a huge pipeline of acquisition opportunities to further expand its infusion footprint in the U.S.Currently, the company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Key Picks in the SectorBetter-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Almost Family Inc.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
