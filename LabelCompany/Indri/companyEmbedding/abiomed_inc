					Full Description



ABIOMED, Inc., incorporated on June 4, 1987, is a provider of temporary percutaneous mechanical circulatory support devices. The Company offers care to heart failure patients. The Company operates in the segment of the research, development and sale of medical devices to assist or replace the pumping function of the failing heart. The Company develops, manufactures and markets products that are designed to enable the heart to rest, heal and recover by improving blood flow to the coronary arteries and end-organs and/or temporarily performing the pumping function of the heart. The Company's product portfolio includes the Impella 2.5, Impella CP, Impella RP, Impella LD, Impella 5.0 and AB5000. Its products are used in the cardiac catheterization lab (cath lab), by interventional cardiologists, the electrophysiology lab, the hybrid lab and in the heart surgery suite by heart surgeons.Impella 2.5The Impella 2.5 catheter is a percutaneous micro heart pump with an integrated motor and sensors. The device is designed primarily for use by interventional cardiologists to support patients in the cath lab who may require assistance to maintain their circulation. The Impella 2.5 catheter can be inserted through the femoral artery to reach the left ventricle of the heart where it is deployed to draw blood out of the ventricle and deliver it to the circulatory system. The Impella 2.5 is introduced with normal interventional cardiology procedures and can pump approximately 2.5 liters of blood per minute.Impella CPThe Impella CP is primarily used by either interventional cardiologists to support patients in the cath lab or by surgeons in the heart surgery suite. The Impella CP provides blood flow of approximately one liter more per minute than the Impella 2.5.Impella 5.0 and Impella LDThe Impella 5.0 and Impella LD are percutaneous micro heart pumps with integrated motors and sensors for use primarily in the heart surgery suite. These devices are designed to support patients who require higher levels of circulatory support. The Impella 5.0 can be inserted into the left ventricle through femoral cut down or through the axillary artery. The Impella 5.0 pump is passed into the ascending aorta, across the valve and into the left ventricle. The Impella LD pump is similar to the Impella 5.0 pump, but is implanted directly into the ascending aorta through an aortic graft. Both of these procedures are normally performed with the assistance of heart surgeons in the surgery suite. The Impella 5.0 and Impella LD products can pump over five liters of blood per minute, providing circulatory support.Impella RPThe Impella RP is a percutaneous catheter-based axial flow pump that is designed to allow approximately four liters of flow per minute. The Impella RP device provides support of the right heart during times of acute failure for certain patients who have received a left ventricle assist device or have suffered heart failure due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or a failed heart transplant.AB5000The Company manufactures and sells the AB5000 Circulatory Support System for the temporary support of acute heart failure patients in profound shock, including patients suffering from cardiogenic shock after a heart attack, post-cardiotomy cardiogenic shock, or myocarditis. AB5000 is a cardiac assist device that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for all indications where heart recovery is the desired outcome, including patients who have undergone cardiac surgery and develop low cardiac output, or patients who suffer from acute cardiac disorders leading to hemodynamic instability.The Company competes with Getinge Group, Teleflex Inc., Abbott Laboratories, St. Jude Medical, Inc., HeartWare International Inc., Terumo Heart, Inc. and CardiacAssist Inc.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

History[edit]
Abiomed was founded in Danvers by David M. Lederman[3] in 1981 as Applied Biomedical Corporation, and began working on the development of an artificial heart.[4] Funded by federal research grants,[5] Lederman partnered with The Texas Heart Institute to develop the AbioCor, implanting the first artificial heart into a Kentucky man in July 2001.[6] Fourteen of the AbioCor devices were implanted, during clinical trials from 2001 to 2004, with the longest-living recipient surviving 512 days.[7] The AbioCor won FDA approval in 2006 for patients who are near death and do not qualify for a heart transplant.[8]
In 2004, Michael R. Minogue became president and CEO of Abiomed.[9] In 2005, Abiomed purchased ventricular assist device company Impella CardioSystems AG of Aachen, Germany,[10] maker of the Impella heart pump, developed by Thorsten Siess,[11] who is now the Chief Technology Officer at Abiomed.[12]
Since 2005, Impella heart devices have received a series of FDA approvals.[13]
In 2007, the Impella 2.5 heart pump was among 35 healthcare products to receive a 2007 Medical Design Excellence Award.[14]
Minogue helped found the Medical Technology Veterans Program (MVP), a career training and mentorship initiative designed to help veterans entering the civilian workforce transition into jobs in the medical device and life sciences industries.[15] He currently serves as chairman of the program.

History[edit]
Abiomed was founded in Danvers by David M. Lederman[3] in 1981 as Applied Biomedical Corporation, and began working on the development of an artificial heart.[4] Funded by federal research grants,[5] Lederman partnered with The Texas Heart Institute to develop the AbioCor, implanting the first artificial heart into a Kentucky man in July 2001.[6] Fourteen of the AbioCor devices were implanted, during clinical trials from 2001 to 2004, with the longest-living recipient surviving 512 days.[7] The AbioCor won FDA approval in 2006 for patients who are near death and do not qualify for a heart transplant.[8]
In 2004, Michael R. Minogue became president and CEO of Abiomed.[9] In 2005, Abiomed purchased ventricular assist device company Impella CardioSystems AG of Aachen, Germany,[10] maker of the Impella heart pump, developed by Thorsten Siess,[11] who is now the Chief Technology Officer at Abiomed.[12]
Since 2005, Impella heart devices have received a series of FDA approvals.[13]
In 2007, the Impella 2.5 heart pump was among 35 healthcare products to receive a 2007 Medical Design Excellence Award.[14]
Minogue helped found the Medical Technology Veterans Program (MVP), a career training and mentorship initiative designed to help veterans entering the civilian workforce transition into jobs in the medical device and life sciences industries.[15] He currently serves as chairman of the program.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
