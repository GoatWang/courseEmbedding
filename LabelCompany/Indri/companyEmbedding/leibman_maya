FORT WORTH, Texas, Nov. 30, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:   AAL) today announced the promotion of Beverly Goulet to Executive Vice President and Chief Integration Officer and Maya Leibman to Executive Vice President and Chief Information Officer. Both previously held the title of Senior Vice President, and both will continue to report to Chairman and CEO Doug Parker. 
"We are incredibly fortunate to have these two capable and extremely talented leaders as part of the American team," said Parker. "The successful integration of American and US Airways could not have happened without both Bev and Maya's outstanding leadership. And because of them and other leaders like them, we are well on our way to restoring American as the greatest airline in the world.
"Maya recently led a team that completed the most successful reservation system cutover in aviation history as evidenced by widespread employee readiness and zero customer disruption. This was one of many important technological milestones Maya and her team have flawlessly executed since our merger two years ago. Bev has been responsible for creating, building and leading our integration management office since the merger. She and her team have successfully planned and coordinated the many projects required to integrate two airlines and the success of our integration to date is a testament to her leadership." 
Parker continued, "While both of these leaders have made extraordinary contributions to American and possess great technical and subject matter expertise, those are not the only attributes today's announcement recognizes. Both Bev and Maya contribute in ways which stretch far beyond their respective areas of expertise. They are intellectually curious, focused on driving collaborative teamwork, have a high degree of emotional intelligence, and embody the humility and sense of privilege necessary to lead and support 100,000 team members."   
Goulet was named Senior Vice President and Chief Integration Officer in early 2013. Since that time she has been responsible for the complex process of integrating American Airlines and US Airways into one airline. In her prior role as chief restructuring officer of AMR Corp., which she assumed in late 2011, she led American's Chapter 11 restructuring process and was heavily involved in the analysis and negotiation of American's merger with US Airways. 
Goulet joined American in 1993 as associate general counsel for corporate finance. In that capacity, she was involved in American's aircraft and other financing transactions. She was appointed managing director, corporate development in 1999, with responsibility for American's corporate development initiatives including mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and strategic investments. She became American's Vice President, Corporate Development and Treasurer in 2002. Prior to joining American, Goulet practiced corporate and securities law in Dallas for 13 years. She received both her Bachelor of Arts and Juris Doctor degrees from the University of Michigan.  
Leibman has been American's Chief Information Officer for nearly four years. In this role, she is responsible for all information technology systems, including systems development, infrastructure, operations and strategy. In addition, she oversees the integration of the American Airlines and US Airways technology environments. 
Prior to her role as CIO, Leibman was president of the AAdvantage loyalty program, where she oversaw all aspects of the AAdvantage program and led the customer relationship management and customer research initiatives for the airline worldwide. Leibman joined the airline in 1994 in the revenue management department and led a variety of pricing and yield management teams focused on optimizing airline revenue. Leibman received her Bachelor of Arts in English literature from the University of Chicago and her Master of Business Administration from the University of California, Berkeley.
