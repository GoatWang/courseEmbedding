Deliver secure Linux virtual desktops and apps







Centrally deliver graphics-intensive 3D apps

Virtualize Skype for Business 







Over 100 million people are using Skype for Business to communicate for work. According to Microsoft, 79% of enterprise customers in the United States use or plan to use Skype for Business for telephony—and three out of four Citrix customers adopting unified communications have chosen Skype for Business.
Without proper consideration and design for optimization, virtual app and desktop users will very likely find the Microsoft Skype for Business experience to be subpar—but Citrix has the solution. XenApp and XenDesktop include the HDX RealTime Optimization Pack, developed with and endorsed by Microsoft, which allows you to publish Skype for Business as a virtualized application or within a virtual desktop—with the same performance as a local installation.
Read more about delivering Skype for Business with XenApp and XenDesktop











Enable virtual desktops on or offline







Citrix DesktopPlayer extends the benefits of XenDesktop to BYO and corporate laptop users, enabling them to run Windows virtual desktops on Windows or Mac devices whether they are online, offline, or over a slow and intermittent network connection. The type 2 client hypervisor features centralized management capabilities, including zero-touch provisioning, one-to-many patching, and role-based policy management for comprehensive IT control.
DesktopPlayer for Windows and Mac secures virtual computers and reduces the risk of data loss for on-the-go laptop users with features such as time-based lockout, expiration, and remote wipe policies. With these capabilities, sensitive information within the virtual desktop stays safe—even if the device is lost or stolen.

Accelerate workspace mobility with application layering







Application layering has emerged as the best way to separate apps from the underlying operating system, so they can be managed once and delivered from any end user computing solution to any device. Application compatibility is one of the most important criteria in realizing the value out of any layering solution.
Citrix App Layering offers full-stack layering technology. This enhances compatibility by layering the entire Windows workspace as modular virtual disks, including the Windows operating system itself (OS layer), apps (app layers), and a writable persistent layer that captures all user settings, apps, and data. Leverage the most scalable and feature-rich app-layering solution that simplifies the transition to the cloud, with the need to only manage a single app image across both on-premises and cloud-based deployments.
Learn more about Citrix App Layering











Deliver secure Linux virtual desktops and apps







Today’s mobile workforce has increased demand for secure access to mission-critical, high-performing Linux apps and desktops from any device. These Linux resources are essential to many industries, such as those conducting research and development work on chip design, numerical computation for financial and scientific modeling, or providing proprietary Linux-only apps to their engineers and developers.
XenApp and XenDesktop give users secure access to mission-critical, specialized Linux desktops from non-Linux devices. IT administrators can manage both Windows and Linux applications and desktops using a single console to reduce complexity and increase ROI of infrastructure investment by avoiding the need to purchase new hardware.

Learn more about delivering Linux desktops and apps 











Centrally deliver graphics-intensive 3D apps







Design and manufacturing companies are embracing a new approach to IT. Instead of installing CAD applications on costly high-end workstations, they are moving desktops, apps and data to the datacenter and cloud providers, where they can be securely accessed on-demand by users anywhere. Apps and desktops run centrally on either virtual or physical machines freeing people to work on any device they choose—even a tablet. Network optimizations ensure an experience that looks, feels and acts like a traditional high-end PC no matter what the access type.
The most complete and effective virtualization solution for 3D apps comes from Citrix, the longtime leader in virtualization and mobile workstyles. Accessible on any device, the solution provides compression and graphics acceleration technologies to optimize professional 3D graphics apps over low-bandwidth, high-latency networks. Designed for seamless integration and proven in demanding production environments, the Citrix solution combines high performance with simplicity and manageability unmatched by point solutions or piecemeal strategies.

Deliver secure access to web and SaaS apps in any browser







Web-based apps are now a common part of many organizations’ IT strategy, but web browsers can cause many of the same headaches as any Windows app—from compatibility issues to frequent updates. To ease the delivery of specific browser-based apps to user, regardless of their chosen browser, Citrix offers Secure Browser. Secure Browser is a virtual browser that enables IT to deliver secure remote access to web and SaaS applications with zero endpoint configuration.
Secure Browser lets users choose any browser without the need for IT to test every type, version or plugin. This is especially significant as a broader range of devices enter the workplace, including mobile devices equipped with native browsers that often break web apps.

XenApp vs. XenDesktop—which one do I need?
XenApp is an application virtualization solution that helps you optimize productivity with universal access to virtual apps, desktops, and data from any device. XenDesktop carries all the same functionality as XenApp, plus the option to implement a scalable VDI solution. Compare below to see which product best suits your business needs.

Virtualize Skype for Business 







Over 100 million people are using Skype for Business to communicate for work. According to Microsoft, 79% of enterprise customers in the United States use or plan to use Skype for Business for telephony—and three out of four Citrix customers adopting unified communications have chosen Skype for Business.
Without proper consideration and design for optimization, virtual app and desktop users will very likely find the Microsoft Skype for Business experience to be subpar—but Citrix has the solution. XenApp and XenDesktop include the HDX RealTime Optimization Pack, developed with and endorsed by Microsoft, which allows you to publish Skype for Business as a virtualized application or within a virtual desktop—with the same performance as a local installation.
Read more about delivering Skype for Business with XenApp and XenDesktop











Enable virtual desktops on or offline







Citrix DesktopPlayer extends the benefits of XenDesktop to BYO and corporate laptop users, enabling them to run Windows virtual desktops on Windows or Mac devices whether they are online, offline, or over a slow and intermittent network connection. The type 2 client hypervisor features centralized management capabilities, including zero-touch provisioning, one-to-many patching, and role-based policy management for comprehensive IT control.
DesktopPlayer for Windows and Mac secures virtual computers and reduces the risk of data loss for on-the-go laptop users with features such as time-based lockout, expiration, and remote wipe policies. With these capabilities, sensitive information within the virtual desktop stays safe—even if the device is lost or stolen.

Accelerate workspace mobility with application layering







Application layering has emerged as the best way to separate apps from the underlying operating system, so they can be managed once and delivered from any end user computing solution to any device. Application compatibility is one of the most important criteria in realizing the value out of any layering solution.
Citrix App Layering offers full-stack layering technology. This enhances compatibility by layering the entire Windows workspace as modular virtual disks, including the Windows operating system itself (OS layer), apps (app layers), and a writable persistent layer that captures all user settings, apps, and data. Leverage the most scalable and feature-rich app-layering solution that simplifies the transition to the cloud, with the need to only manage a single app image across both on-premises and cloud-based deployments.
Learn more about Citrix App Layering











Deliver secure Linux virtual desktops and apps







Today’s mobile workforce has increased demand for secure access to mission-critical, high-performing Linux apps and desktops from any device. These Linux resources are essential to many industries, such as those conducting research and development work on chip design, numerical computation for financial and scientific modeling, or providing proprietary Linux-only apps to their engineers and developers.
XenApp and XenDesktop give users secure access to mission-critical, specialized Linux desktops from non-Linux devices. IT administrators can manage both Windows and Linux applications and desktops using a single console to reduce complexity and increase ROI of infrastructure investment by avoiding the need to purchase new hardware.

Learn more about delivering Linux desktops and apps 











Centrally deliver graphics-intensive 3D apps







Design and manufacturing companies are embracing a new approach to IT. Instead of installing CAD applications on costly high-end workstations, they are moving desktops, apps and data to the datacenter and cloud providers, where they can be securely accessed on-demand by users anywhere. Apps and desktops run centrally on either virtual or physical machines freeing people to work on any device they choose—even a tablet. Network optimizations ensure an experience that looks, feels and acts like a traditional high-end PC no matter what the access type.
The most complete and effective virtualization solution for 3D apps comes from Citrix, the longtime leader in virtualization and mobile workstyles. Accessible on any device, the solution provides compression and graphics acceleration technologies to optimize professional 3D graphics apps over low-bandwidth, high-latency networks. Designed for seamless integration and proven in demanding production environments, the Citrix solution combines high performance with simplicity and manageability unmatched by point solutions or piecemeal strategies.

Deliver secure access to web and SaaS apps in any browser







Web-based apps are now a common part of many organizations’ IT strategy, but web browsers can cause many of the same headaches as any Windows app—from compatibility issues to frequent updates. To ease the delivery of specific browser-based apps to user, regardless of their chosen browser, Citrix offers Secure Browser. Secure Browser is a virtual browser that enables IT to deliver secure remote access to web and SaaS applications with zero endpoint configuration.
Secure Browser lets users choose any browser without the need for IT to test every type, version or plugin. This is especially significant as a broader range of devices enter the workplace, including mobile devices equipped with native browsers that often break web apps.

XenApp vs. XenDesktop—which one do I need?
XenApp is an application virtualization solution that helps you optimize productivity with universal access to virtual apps, desktops, and data from any device. XenDesktop carries all the same functionality as XenApp, plus the option to implement a scalable VDI solution. Compare below to see which product best suits your business needs.

How Citrix Workspace delivers an integrated digital workspace



Watch demo series

























What makes a Citrix Workspace? 












                        App and desktop delivery
                    













Citrix Workspace features XenApp and XenDesktop – the industry’s leading solutions for application and desktop delivery, with over 100 million users worldwide. Citrix Workspace enables secure, remote access to Windows applications and desktops as well as Linux, web and SaaS applications from any device, over any network.














                        Enterprise mobility management
                    













Citrix Workspace, using XenMobile technology, delivers full access to mobile device management (MDM), mobile application management (MAM), mobile content management (MCM), secure network gateway, and enterprise-grade mobile productivity apps in one comprehensive solution.














                        File sync and sharing
                    













Citrix Workspace delivers enterprise-class data services across all corporate and personal mobile devices, while maintaining total IT control. Using ShareFile, you can access, sync, and securely share files from any device. Offline access keeps productivity up, even when users are on the go.














                        Branch networking and WAN
                    













Citrix Workspace includes NetScaler SD-WAN, a solution that combines real-time path selection, edge routing, stateful firewall, end-to-end QoS, and WAN optimization.














                        Secure remote access
                    













Citrix Workspace includes NetScaler Unified Gateway to consolidate remote access infrastructure and provide single sign-on across all applications whether in a datacenter, in a cloud, or delivered as SaaS.

Additional use cases









Be prepared for frequent Windows 10 updates

Create smart workspaces with Citrix Workspace IoT










Be prepared for frequent Windows 10 updates







A growing number of employees are installing Windows 10 on their personal devices and in need of immediate access to core business applications. IT must fully migrate to Windows 10, but this move presents a number of challenges, including business disruptions, app incompatibility, and time-consuming testing processes. And once you migrate, you’ll need a way to keep up with twice-yearly OS updates. Citrix Workspace solutions enable you to centrally roll out Windows 10 to hundreds or thousands of employees at once, saving you the time-consuming process of updating each device individually. Employees can also use the new OS on Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux or Chrome, allowing them to stay productive from anywhere. Windows 7 will reach end of support in 2020, which is not as far away as you think. Citrix can simplify your Windows 10 migration today and manage updates in the future.
See how Citrix eliminates the complexity of Windows 10











Migrate faster and enjoy simplified maintenance for Office 365







Moving to cloud-based Microsoft Office 365 introduces new complexity, including keeping up with frequent releases and yet another login for IT and users to manage. Citrix Workspace simplifies updates through centralizing app management and app layering and Citrix Workspace technology allows secure single sign-on to Office 365 for employees and external users. Secure your environment even further through conditional access policies that set the right level of access to apps and data.  And get more out of your Office 365 investment by extending the storage capacity of OneDrive.
Learn how Citrix Workspace simplifies Office 365 management











Create smart workspaces with Citrix Workspace IoT







The Internet of Things (IoT) connects devices (such as printers, monitors, VoIP lines, or even company cars) to a network, enabling information gathering and remote management of these devices through software. IoT is becoming an increasingly critical component of enterprise IT strategies. Put to use in your office building, IoT not only offers significant savings in energy, efficiency, security, and time, but it can also automate processes that can make employees’ work lives easier and more productive.
With Citrix Workspace IoT you can provide new services that enable the secure delivery of apps and data within adaptive personalized digital workspaces. That means that the right data, resources, and things come together to optimize insight and work execution.

Optimized server virtualization for all your data center workloads


























Tackle the IT data center challenges of today’s modern businesses
Citrix XenServer is a leading virtualization management platform optimized for application, desktop and server virtualization infrastructures. Consolidation and containment of workloads on XenServer enables organizations of any vertical or size to transform their business IT compute infrastructures.



















































Explore some of the key use cases for XenServer   









Optimize experience for XenApp and XenDesktop







Consolidate and contain data center servers







Deliver high-performance 3D graphics










Optimize experience for XenApp and XenDesktop







XenServer is a comprehensive server virtualization platform with enterprise-class features built in to easily handle different workload types, mixed operating systems and storage or networking configurations. For the most demanding app, and desktop virtualization use cases, its industry-leading scalability and performance under load, can cater to the largest XenApp or XenDesktop deployments. IT gets the benefit of features unique to XenServer, such as enhanced virtualized graphics with NVIDIA and Intel, and enhanced workload security with Direct Inspect APIs, all of which reduce virtual infrastructure costs and complexity.
XenApp and XenDesktop license holders are able to apply those product licenses directly to XenServer infrastructure via the license server; no separate or specific XenServer license is required.











Consolidate and contain data center servers







XenServer enables IT to consolidate and contain a significant number of datacenter servers. This increases overall utilization of existing hardware resources, while lowering infrastructure total cost of ownership. Administrators can maximize efficiencies within their infrastructure, eliminating planned outages and minimizing unplanned ones. Comprehensive server consolidation and containment with XenServer also allows for significant performance and capacity gains in CPU cores, host RAM, VM RAM and virtual disks per VM, as well as integration with Microsoft Windows Update Services for automatic Windows VM driver updates.

Deliver high-performance 3D graphics







XenServer 7 is the leading hypervisor providing support for high-performance enhanced 3D graphics, with the widest variety of GPU pass-through and virtualized GPU vendor options. Only XenServer includes support for Intel’s Virtual Graphics Technology (GVT-g), a CPU embedded GPU with no extra hardware required to facilitate enhanced graphics workloads.
XenServer support of NVIDIA GRID vGPU has been extended for Linux graphical applications and desktops. With the latest NVIDIA GRID Maxwell-gen hardware integration, vGPU sessions per host have now increased to 128.

The first thing I noticed with the new XenServer 7 is that everything is still familiar. Some of the new features I’m excited about include offline storage migration, XenServer Health Check, automated XenServer VM driver management via Windows Update, and the ability to access more than 128GB RAM for a VM. We love XenServer, some of our hosts have been running for more than 400 days with no problems.

Citrix Systems, Inc. is an American multinational software company that provides server, application and desktop virtualization, networking, software as a service (SaaS), and cloud computing technologies. It was founded in Richardson, Texas in 1989 by Ed Iacobucci, who served as chairman until his departure in 2000.
The company began by developing remote access products for Microsoft operating systems. It licensed source code from Microsoft and has been in partnership with the company throughout its history. Citrix came to prominence in the 1990s as a leader in thin client technology, purpose built for accessing remote servers. The company had its first initial public offering in 1995 and, with few competitors, experienced large revenue increases between 1995 and 1999.
The company acquired Sequoia Software Corp. in 2001 and ExpertCity, a provider of remote desktop products, in 2003. Between 2005 and 2012, Citrix acquired more than a dozen other companies, allowing it to expand into server and desktop virtualization, as well as cloud, Infrastructure as a Service, and SaaS offerings. In 2014, Citrix acquired Framehawk and used its technology to improve the delivery of virtual desktops and applications over wireless networks. In 2016, as part of a USD$1.8 billion product deal with LogMeIn, Citrix spun off the GoTo product line into a new business entity, entitled GetGo. In 2017, Citrix completed the merger of GetGo with LogMeIn's products.
Citrix is based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and Santa Clara, California, with subsidiary operations in California and Massachusetts, and additional development centers in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, India, and the United Kingdom. It currently services around 330,000 organizations worldwide.[3] In 2014, the company was ranked 741 on the Fortune 1000. Citrix reported $3.28 billion in revenue and a net income of more than $300 million in 2015. In December 2015, Citrix employed approximately 9,500 people, but noted that its November restructure was due to eliminate nearly 700 full-time jobs. As of December 31, 2016 , Citrix had approximately 9,600 employees, including approximately 1,700 employees related to the GoTo Business.[4] David Henshall became the company's CEO in July 2017.[5]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Citrix was founded in Richardson, Texas in 1989 by former IBM developer Ed Iacobucci with $3 million in funding.[6] Following its initial setup and development, Iacobucci moved the company to his former home of Coral Springs, Florida.[6] The company's first employees were five other engineers from IBM that Iacobucci convinced to join his team. Iacobucci served as chairman of the company and Roger Roberts became the CEO of Citrix in 1990.[6][7][8] Citrix was originally named Citrus, but changed its name after an existing company claimed trademark rights.[9] The Citrix name is a portmanteau of Citrus and UNIX.[10]
The company's first product was Citrix Multiuser, an extension of OS/2 developed over two years. Citrix licensed the OS/2 source code from Microsoft,[6][7][11] and developed its own Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) protocol for Citrix Multiuser.[12] Multiuser allowed multiple users working on separate computers remote access to software on a server, even from computers not built to run OS/2.[11][13] Three days before the product launched in 1991, Microsoft announced they would be switching from OS/2 to Windows. The switch made Multiuser nearly unusable without significant changes to make it compatible with Windows or DOS. The company discussed closing in 1991, but investments from Intel, Microsoft and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers among others, allowed the company to work on a new version of Multiuser.[6][7]
Multi-Win version 2.0 was released in 1992. It was compatible with DOS applications and allowed up to five users.[14] In 1993, Citrix released a new remote applications server, WinView, which had the ability to run DOS and Windows applications.[15] By 1994, the company's yearly revenue equaled US$10 million.[6]
The company launched WinFrame, a multi-user operating system based on Microsoft’s Windows NT, in 1995.[6] The new product allowed up to 15 users and was the first thin client for Windows.[16][17]
Rise in popularity[edit]
Citrix had its initial public offering in December 1995.[18] The company's share price doubled from $15 to $30.[6] During the mid-1990s, Citrix became the leader of its growing industry with very few competitors, and the company's revenues doubled year over year between 1995 and 1999.[7]
In 1997, during negotiations to extend licenses of Windows NT 4.0 source code to Citrix, Microsoft stated it would develop its own competing software to WinFrame. Citrix stocks dropped 62 percent after the announcement.[13] Following weeks of discussions, Iacobucci was able to persuade Microsoft to agree to license Citrix technology for Windows NT Server 4.0, which resulted in Windows Terminal Server Edition in 1998.[7][8][19] This agreement allowed Citrix to keep its position in the marketplace and be NT 4.0 compatible.[13] Citrix also earned $75 million through the agreement, along with a royalty arrangement that was valued at approximately $100 million.[13][18]
Citrix released MetaFrame 1.0 in conjunction with Terminal Server Edition. Due to weaknesses in Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Terminal Server Edition worked best using the ICA protocol developed by Citrix and found in MetaFrame. This meant that Citrix technology was purchased and installed on most machines running Terminal Server Edition.[8][19]
In 1997, the company opened a new headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. It also opened offices in Sydney, London and Paris that same year.[18]
In 1998, Mark Templeton became the CEO of Citrix after serving as vice president of marketing.[18] Also in 1998, it licensed its ICA protocol to IBM and Key Tronics.[6] Citrix licensed its ICA protocol to Motorola for use in digital wireless handsets in 1999.[7]
During 1999, the thin-client model Citrix used became a software trend and the company's customers increased to 15 million.[6] Major clients included Sears, AT&T, and Chevron.[8][13] A sudden drop in stocks in 2000 led to Iacobucci leaving the company and CEO Mark Templeton being demoted to president and senior executive officer. Templeton was later reinstated in 2001.[18][20]
Expansion[edit]
In 2001 Citrix acquired the Sequoia Software Corp. for $185 million.[6] That same year it released MetaFrame XP, a new platform using MetaFrame technology.[21] This was later rebranded by Citrix as Presentation Server, in 2005.[22]
On July 9, 2002, Citrix announced a 10% job cut. At the time the company employed about 1,900 workers. After the announcement the stock hit a five-year low.[23]
Citrix acquired ExpertCity, a provider of remote desktop products, in December 2003 for $225 million in cash and stock. The acquisition was the largest for the company up to that date.[24] Through the acquisition, Citrix gained ExpertCity's existing products GoToMyPC and GoToAssist, and ExpertCity became the Citrix Online division of the company.[24][25] In 2004, the company introduced Citrix GoToMeeting.[18]
Between 2005 and 2012, the company acquired over a dozen companies that allowed them to expand in new markets. Citrix acquired acceleration hardware maker NetScaler in 2005, which allowed the company to offer optimized application delivery.[26] The company entered the server and desktop virtualization market with the purchase of XenSource in August 2007.[27] Citrix expanded cloud and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offerings in August 2010 with the acquisition of VMLogix.[28] In February 2011, Citrix entered the European Software as a Service (SaaS) market with the acquisition of Netviewer.[29][30]
The company became a leader in IaaS after the acquisition of Cloud.com, provider of cloud infrastructure for companies, in July 2011.[31] Citrix began offering VDI-in-a-box to small and medium businesses with the acquisition of Kaviza in May 2011.[32] The company acquired technology for cloud-based file sharing and storage through its purchase of ShareFile in October 2011.[33]
In May 2012, Citrix acquired Virtual Computer, maker of intelligent desktop virtualization. The technology is used in the company's XenClient Enterprise edition.[34] Citrix entered the mobile video and telecom markets in June 2012 when the company acquired ByteMobile.[35] Also in 2012, the company acquired Zenprise. Zenprise's Mobile application management (MAM) technology was released as XenMobile in February 2013.[36]
In 2007, the company opened a headquarters in Silicon Valley.[18] In 2008, the company changed the name of its Presentation Server product line to XenApp.[37] Also in 2008, Citrix announced an expanded alliance with Microsoft on desktop virtualization solutions.[18] On January 29, 2009, Citrix announced that 460 employee positions would be cut, comprising 10% of its workforce.[38] In August 2010, Citrix announced a partnership with Google to bring the company's products to Chrome OS devices.[39][40]
Citrix acquired Framehawk in January 2014 in order to use the company's technology to improve the delivery of virtual desktops and applications over wireless networks, including cellular, where speed and quality may be poor.[41] In May 2014, Citrix acquired Scalextreme[42] to bolster its cloud capabilities for its core business unit of XenDesktop and Xenapp such as auto scaling, patching and automation of complex deployments from the cloud.
On January 29, 2015, Citrix announced that 700 full-time and 200 contractor positions would be eliminated.[43] This constituted about 10% of its workforce. The cuts were expected to save between $90 and $100 million a year. Two hundred of the layoffs occurred in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where the company is headquartered.[44]
The company had 10,081 employees as of February 2015.[45] In December 2015, Citrix employed approximately 9,500 people, but noted that its November restructure was due to eliminate nearly 700 full-time jobs.[2]
On July 14, 2015, Citrix added full support for Windows 10 to its desktop virtualization products.[46]

Citrix reported net income of $251.7 million in 2014, down from $339.5 million in 2013.[47] In July 2015, the company announced several changes to its board of directors, including Robert Calderoni's becoming executive chairman and adding Jesse Cohn as a senior partner of activist hedge fund Elliott Management.[48] That same month the company announced that president and CEO Mark Templeton would retire after a replacement was found,[49] and on October 21, the company named its executive chairman, Robert Calderoni, as interim president and CEO.[50]
In January 2016, Kirill Tatarinov, a former Microsoft executive, was named the president and CEO of Citrix and joined the company's board. Calderoni remained executive chairman of the board.[51]
In July 2016, as part of a deal with Boston-based SaaS company LogMeIn, Citrix announced it had spun off its GoTo product line, which included GoToMeeting, GoToWebinar, GoToWebcast, GoToTraining, GoToAssist and GoToMyPC, into a wholly owned subsidiary called GetGo.[52] In February 2017, Citrix completed a merger through which GetGo became a subsidiary of LogMeIn. The transaction was valued at approximately $1.8 billion.[53]
In July 2017, David Henshall replaced Tatarinov as the company's CEO.[5]

Main article: List of mergers and acquisitions by Citrix
Citrix has expanded and added new technologies and services through a number of mergers and acquisitions.[50] Its first acquisition was DataPac in 1997, which Citrix purchased in order to utilize DataPac's technology and its position in the Asia-Pacific region.[62][63][64] Other major acquisitions include ExpertCity in 2004, NetScaler in 2005, XenSource in 2007 and ShareFile in 2011. As of 2015, Citrix has acquired nearly 50 companies.[65]
Products[edit]
Citrix creates software that allows the individuals of an enterprise to work and collaborate remotely regardless of device or network. The main areas the company works in are desktop and apps; Desktop as a Service (DaaS); networking and cloud; and Software as a service (SaaS).[66][67]
Desktops and apps[edit]
Citrix offers a number of products related to desktop and application virtualization. These tools allow access to Windows desktops and applications independently of the machine they are actually on, and from any device with any operating system.[68] Citrix XenApp provides application virtualization (now integrated as part of XenDesktop), and Citrix XenDesktop, Citrix VDI-in-a-Box and XenClient all provide desktop virtualization.[69][70] The DesktopPlayer for Mac allows online and offline access to Windows virtual desktops from Macs.[71] Citrix Workspace Cloud is a platform for building and delivering desktops and applications from the cloud.[72] ShareFile allows companies and organizations to sync and share files.[73] XenMobile offers mobile app and device management, Citrix Receiver is client software that allows universal access to virtual applications and desktops, and AppDNA, software that provides application migration and management.[69]

Networking and cloud[edit]
Citrix products related to cloud computing and networking include Citrix XenServer for server virtualization[70] [76] and its NetScaler brand of network appliances, including WAN optimization devices, Software-Defined WAN delivery equipment, Application Delivery Controllers (ADC), Gateways, and AppFirewall web application firewall.[67] The company also has ByteMobile Adaptive Traffic Management, which aims to optimize mobile video services through traffic management, policy control and caching, and ByteMobile Insight, which provides mobile data and subscriber analytics.[77][78]
Software as a Service (SaaS)[edit]
Citrix software as a service (SaaS) products are focused on collaboration and communications. The offerings include Podio, a cloud-based collaboration service, and OpenVoice, which provides audio conferencing.[70][73]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
The company's philanthropic activities include corporate giving—such as corporate donations of in-kind gifts—and employee match programs.[79][80] Citrix provides discounted and donated products to non-profits and other qualifying organizations through TechSoup.[81] In addition, Citrix employees are allowed to take two paid volunteer days each year and participate in the company's annual "Global Day of Impact"—an event that encourages Citrix employees to volunteer in their local communities.[82][83][84]
Near its Fort Lauderdale headquarters, Citrix has provided business training to non-profit teams. In particular, the company helped a local non-profit organization launch a computer on wheels to offer training to low-income neighborhoods. In 2007, the company connected a Broward County, Florida neighborhood with Agogo, Ghana through donated technology and training. Using the technology, the "Cyber Sister Cities" work together to sell African organic honey in the United States.[85] Furthermore, the company's Raleigh office began a program called "Project Code" in 2014, which leads youth from local Boys & Girls Clubs through coding exercises and teaches them about computer science.[86]
In addition to its philanthropic activities, Citrix has donated some of its open-source technology to non-profit software organizations to continue its development and gain more contributors. Citrix gave Cloudstack to the Apache Foundation in 2012 and Xen hypervisor to the Linux Foundation in 2013.[87][88]

Citrix Systems, Inc. is an American multinational software company that provides server, application and desktop virtualization, networking, software as a service (SaaS), and cloud computing technologies. It was founded in Richardson, Texas in 1989 by Ed Iacobucci, who served as chairman until his departure in 2000.
The company began by developing remote access products for Microsoft operating systems. It licensed source code from Microsoft and has been in partnership with the company throughout its history. Citrix came to prominence in the 1990s as a leader in thin client technology, purpose built for accessing remote servers. The company had its first initial public offering in 1995 and, with few competitors, experienced large revenue increases between 1995 and 1999.
The company acquired Sequoia Software Corp. in 2001 and ExpertCity, a provider of remote desktop products, in 2003. Between 2005 and 2012, Citrix acquired more than a dozen other companies, allowing it to expand into server and desktop virtualization, as well as cloud, Infrastructure as a Service, and SaaS offerings. In 2014, Citrix acquired Framehawk and used its technology to improve the delivery of virtual desktops and applications over wireless networks. In 2016, as part of a USD$1.8 billion product deal with LogMeIn, Citrix spun off the GoTo product line into a new business entity, entitled GetGo. In 2017, Citrix completed the merger of GetGo with LogMeIn's products.
Citrix is based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and Santa Clara, California, with subsidiary operations in California and Massachusetts, and additional development centers in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, India, and the United Kingdom. It currently services around 330,000 organizations worldwide.[3] In 2014, the company was ranked 741 on the Fortune 1000. Citrix reported $3.28 billion in revenue and a net income of more than $300 million in 2015. In December 2015, Citrix employed approximately 9,500 people, but noted that its November restructure was due to eliminate nearly 700 full-time jobs. As of December 31, 2016 , Citrix had approximately 9,600 employees, including approximately 1,700 employees related to the GoTo Business.[4] David Henshall became the company's CEO in July 2017.[5]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Citrix was founded in Richardson, Texas in 1989 by former IBM developer Ed Iacobucci with $3 million in funding.[6] Following its initial setup and development, Iacobucci moved the company to his former home of Coral Springs, Florida.[6] The company's first employees were five other engineers from IBM that Iacobucci convinced to join his team. Iacobucci served as chairman of the company and Roger Roberts became the CEO of Citrix in 1990.[6][7][8] Citrix was originally named Citrus, but changed its name after an existing company claimed trademark rights.[9] The Citrix name is a portmanteau of Citrus and UNIX.[10]
The company's first product was Citrix Multiuser, an extension of OS/2 developed over two years. Citrix licensed the OS/2 source code from Microsoft,[6][7][11] and developed its own Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) protocol for Citrix Multiuser.[12] Multiuser allowed multiple users working on separate computers remote access to software on a server, even from computers not built to run OS/2.[11][13] Three days before the product launched in 1991, Microsoft announced they would be switching from OS/2 to Windows. The switch made Multiuser nearly unusable without significant changes to make it compatible with Windows or DOS. The company discussed closing in 1991, but investments from Intel, Microsoft and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers among others, allowed the company to work on a new version of Multiuser.[6][7]
Multi-Win version 2.0 was released in 1992. It was compatible with DOS applications and allowed up to five users.[14] In 1993, Citrix released a new remote applications server, WinView, which had the ability to run DOS and Windows applications.[15] By 1994, the company's yearly revenue equaled US$10 million.[6]
The company launched WinFrame, a multi-user operating system based on Microsoft’s Windows NT, in 1995.[6] The new product allowed up to 15 users and was the first thin client for Windows.[16][17]
Rise in popularity[edit]
Citrix had its initial public offering in December 1995.[18] The company's share price doubled from $15 to $30.[6] During the mid-1990s, Citrix became the leader of its growing industry with very few competitors, and the company's revenues doubled year over year between 1995 and 1999.[7]
In 1997, during negotiations to extend licenses of Windows NT 4.0 source code to Citrix, Microsoft stated it would develop its own competing software to WinFrame. Citrix stocks dropped 62 percent after the announcement.[13] Following weeks of discussions, Iacobucci was able to persuade Microsoft to agree to license Citrix technology for Windows NT Server 4.0, which resulted in Windows Terminal Server Edition in 1998.[7][8][19] This agreement allowed Citrix to keep its position in the marketplace and be NT 4.0 compatible.[13] Citrix also earned $75 million through the agreement, along with a royalty arrangement that was valued at approximately $100 million.[13][18]
Citrix released MetaFrame 1.0 in conjunction with Terminal Server Edition. Due to weaknesses in Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Terminal Server Edition worked best using the ICA protocol developed by Citrix and found in MetaFrame. This meant that Citrix technology was purchased and installed on most machines running Terminal Server Edition.[8][19]
In 1997, the company opened a new headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. It also opened offices in Sydney, London and Paris that same year.[18]
In 1998, Mark Templeton became the CEO of Citrix after serving as vice president of marketing.[18] Also in 1998, it licensed its ICA protocol to IBM and Key Tronics.[6] Citrix licensed its ICA protocol to Motorola for use in digital wireless handsets in 1999.[7]
During 1999, the thin-client model Citrix used became a software trend and the company's customers increased to 15 million.[6] Major clients included Sears, AT&T, and Chevron.[8][13] A sudden drop in stocks in 2000 led to Iacobucci leaving the company and CEO Mark Templeton being demoted to president and senior executive officer. Templeton was later reinstated in 2001.[18][20]
Expansion[edit]
In 2001 Citrix acquired the Sequoia Software Corp. for $185 million.[6] That same year it released MetaFrame XP, a new platform using MetaFrame technology.[21] This was later rebranded by Citrix as Presentation Server, in 2005.[22]
On July 9, 2002, Citrix announced a 10% job cut. At the time the company employed about 1,900 workers. After the announcement the stock hit a five-year low.[23]
Citrix acquired ExpertCity, a provider of remote desktop products, in December 2003 for $225 million in cash and stock. The acquisition was the largest for the company up to that date.[24] Through the acquisition, Citrix gained ExpertCity's existing products GoToMyPC and GoToAssist, and ExpertCity became the Citrix Online division of the company.[24][25] In 2004, the company introduced Citrix GoToMeeting.[18]
Between 2005 and 2012, the company acquired over a dozen companies that allowed them to expand in new markets. Citrix acquired acceleration hardware maker NetScaler in 2005, which allowed the company to offer optimized application delivery.[26] The company entered the server and desktop virtualization market with the purchase of XenSource in August 2007.[27] Citrix expanded cloud and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offerings in August 2010 with the acquisition of VMLogix.[28] In February 2011, Citrix entered the European Software as a Service (SaaS) market with the acquisition of Netviewer.[29][30]
The company became a leader in IaaS after the acquisition of Cloud.com, provider of cloud infrastructure for companies, in July 2011.[31] Citrix began offering VDI-in-a-box to small and medium businesses with the acquisition of Kaviza in May 2011.[32] The company acquired technology for cloud-based file sharing and storage through its purchase of ShareFile in October 2011.[33]
In May 2012, Citrix acquired Virtual Computer, maker of intelligent desktop virtualization. The technology is used in the company's XenClient Enterprise edition.[34] Citrix entered the mobile video and telecom markets in June 2012 when the company acquired ByteMobile.[35] Also in 2012, the company acquired Zenprise. Zenprise's Mobile application management (MAM) technology was released as XenMobile in February 2013.[36]
In 2007, the company opened a headquarters in Silicon Valley.[18] In 2008, the company changed the name of its Presentation Server product line to XenApp.[37] Also in 2008, Citrix announced an expanded alliance with Microsoft on desktop virtualization solutions.[18] On January 29, 2009, Citrix announced that 460 employee positions would be cut, comprising 10% of its workforce.[38] In August 2010, Citrix announced a partnership with Google to bring the company's products to Chrome OS devices.[39][40]
Citrix acquired Framehawk in January 2014 in order to use the company's technology to improve the delivery of virtual desktops and applications over wireless networks, including cellular, where speed and quality may be poor.[41] In May 2014, Citrix acquired Scalextreme[42] to bolster its cloud capabilities for its core business unit of XenDesktop and Xenapp such as auto scaling, patching and automation of complex deployments from the cloud.
On January 29, 2015, Citrix announced that 700 full-time and 200 contractor positions would be eliminated.[43] This constituted about 10% of its workforce. The cuts were expected to save between $90 and $100 million a year. Two hundred of the layoffs occurred in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where the company is headquartered.[44]
The company had 10,081 employees as of February 2015.[45] In December 2015, Citrix employed approximately 9,500 people, but noted that its November restructure was due to eliminate nearly 700 full-time jobs.[2]
On July 14, 2015, Citrix added full support for Windows 10 to its desktop virtualization products.[46]
Recent history[edit]
Citrix reported net income of $251.7 million in 2014, down from $339.5 million in 2013.[47] In July 2015, the company announced several changes to its board of directors, including Robert Calderoni's becoming executive chairman and adding Jesse Cohn as a senior partner of activist hedge fund Elliott Management.[48] That same month the company announced that president and CEO Mark Templeton would retire after a replacement was found,[49] and on October 21, the company named its executive chairman, Robert Calderoni, as interim president and CEO.[50]
In January 2016, Kirill Tatarinov, a former Microsoft executive, was named the president and CEO of Citrix and joined the company's board. Calderoni remained executive chairman of the board.[51]
In July 2016, as part of a deal with Boston-based SaaS company LogMeIn, Citrix announced it had spun off its GoTo product line, which included GoToMeeting, GoToWebinar, GoToWebcast, GoToTraining, GoToAssist and GoToMyPC, into a wholly owned subsidiary called GetGo.[52] In February 2017, Citrix completed a merger through which GetGo became a subsidiary of LogMeIn. The transaction was valued at approximately $1.8 billion.[53]
In July 2017, David Henshall replaced Tatarinov as the company's CEO.[5]

Near its Fort Lauderdale headquarters, Citrix has provided business training to non-profit teams. In particular, the company helped a local non-profit organization launch a computer on wheels to offer training to low-income neighborhoods. In 2007, the company connected a Broward County, Florida neighborhood with Agogo, Ghana through donated technology and training. Using the technology, the "Cyber Sister Cities" work together to sell African organic honey in the United States.[85] Furthermore, the company's Raleigh office began a program called "Project Code" in 2014, which leads youth from local Boys & Girls Clubs through coding exercises and teaches them about computer science.[86]
In addition to its philanthropic activities, Citrix has donated some of its open-source technology to non-profit software organizations to continue its development and gain more contributors. Citrix gave Cloudstack to the Apache Foundation in 2012 and Xen hypervisor to the Linux Foundation in 2013.[87][88]

Citrix Systems, Inc. is an American multinational software company that provides server, application and desktop virtualization, networking, software as a service (SaaS), and cloud computing technologies. It was founded in Richardson, Texas in 1989 by Ed Iacobucci, who served as chairman until his departure in 2000.
The company began by developing remote access products for Microsoft operating systems. It licensed source code from Microsoft and has been in partnership with the company throughout its history. Citrix came to prominence in the 1990s as a leader in thin client technology, purpose built for accessing remote servers. The company had its first initial public offering in 1995 and, with few competitors, experienced large revenue increases between 1995 and 1999.
The company acquired Sequoia Software Corp. in 2001 and ExpertCity, a provider of remote desktop products, in 2003. Between 2005 and 2012, Citrix acquired more than a dozen other companies, allowing it to expand into server and desktop virtualization, as well as cloud, Infrastructure as a Service, and SaaS offerings. In 2014, Citrix acquired Framehawk and used its technology to improve the delivery of virtual desktops and applications over wireless networks. In 2016, as part of a USD$1.8 billion product deal with LogMeIn, Citrix spun off the GoTo product line into a new business entity, entitled GetGo. In 2017, Citrix completed the merger of GetGo with LogMeIn's products.
Citrix is based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and Santa Clara, California, with subsidiary operations in California and Massachusetts, and additional development centers in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, India, and the United Kingdom. It currently services around 330,000 organizations worldwide.[3] In 2014, the company was ranked 741 on the Fortune 1000. Citrix reported $3.28 billion in revenue and a net income of more than $300 million in 2015. In December 2015, Citrix employed approximately 9,500 people, but noted that its November restructure was due to eliminate nearly 700 full-time jobs. As of December 31, 2016 , Citrix had approximately 9,600 employees, including approximately 1,700 employees related to the GoTo Business.[4] David Henshall became the company's CEO in July 2017.[5]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Citrix was founded in Richardson, Texas in 1989 by former IBM developer Ed Iacobucci with $3 million in funding.[6] Following its initial setup and development, Iacobucci moved the company to his former home of Coral Springs, Florida.[6] The company's first employees were five other engineers from IBM that Iacobucci convinced to join his team. Iacobucci served as chairman of the company and Roger Roberts became the CEO of Citrix in 1990.[6][7][8] Citrix was originally named Citrus, but changed its name after an existing company claimed trademark rights.[9] The Citrix name is a portmanteau of Citrus and UNIX.[10]
The company's first product was Citrix Multiuser, an extension of OS/2 developed over two years. Citrix licensed the OS/2 source code from Microsoft,[6][7][11] and developed its own Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) protocol for Citrix Multiuser.[12] Multiuser allowed multiple users working on separate computers remote access to software on a server, even from computers not built to run OS/2.[11][13] Three days before the product launched in 1991, Microsoft announced they would be switching from OS/2 to Windows. The switch made Multiuser nearly unusable without significant changes to make it compatible with Windows or DOS. The company discussed closing in 1991, but investments from Intel, Microsoft and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers among others, allowed the company to work on a new version of Multiuser.[6][7]
Multi-Win version 2.0 was released in 1992. It was compatible with DOS applications and allowed up to five users.[14] In 1993, Citrix released a new remote applications server, WinView, which had the ability to run DOS and Windows applications.[15] By 1994, the company's yearly revenue equaled US$10 million.[6]
The company launched WinFrame, a multi-user operating system based on Microsoft’s Windows NT, in 1995.[6] The new product allowed up to 15 users and was the first thin client for Windows.[16][17]
Rise in popularity[edit]
Citrix had its initial public offering in December 1995.[18] The company's share price doubled from $15 to $30.[6] During the mid-1990s, Citrix became the leader of its growing industry with very few competitors, and the company's revenues doubled year over year between 1995 and 1999.[7]
In 1997, during negotiations to extend licenses of Windows NT 4.0 source code to Citrix, Microsoft stated it would develop its own competing software to WinFrame. Citrix stocks dropped 62 percent after the announcement.[13] Following weeks of discussions, Iacobucci was able to persuade Microsoft to agree to license Citrix technology for Windows NT Server 4.0, which resulted in Windows Terminal Server Edition in 1998.[7][8][19] This agreement allowed Citrix to keep its position in the marketplace and be NT 4.0 compatible.[13] Citrix also earned $75 million through the agreement, along with a royalty arrangement that was valued at approximately $100 million.[13][18]
Citrix released MetaFrame 1.0 in conjunction with Terminal Server Edition. Due to weaknesses in Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Terminal Server Edition worked best using the ICA protocol developed by Citrix and found in MetaFrame. This meant that Citrix technology was purchased and installed on most machines running Terminal Server Edition.[8][19]
In 1997, the company opened a new headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. It also opened offices in Sydney, London and Paris that same year.[18]
In 1998, Mark Templeton became the CEO of Citrix after serving as vice president of marketing.[18] Also in 1998, it licensed its ICA protocol to IBM and Key Tronics.[6] Citrix licensed its ICA protocol to Motorola for use in digital wireless handsets in 1999.[7]
During 1999, the thin-client model Citrix used became a software trend and the company's customers increased to 15 million.[6] Major clients included Sears, AT&T, and Chevron.[8][13] A sudden drop in stocks in 2000 led to Iacobucci leaving the company and CEO Mark Templeton being demoted to president and senior executive officer. Templeton was later reinstated in 2001.[18][20]
Expansion[edit]
In 2001 Citrix acquired the Sequoia Software Corp. for $185 million.[6] That same year it released MetaFrame XP, a new platform using MetaFrame technology.[21] This was later rebranded by Citrix as Presentation Server, in 2005.[22]
On July 9, 2002, Citrix announced a 10% job cut. At the time the company employed about 1,900 workers. After the announcement the stock hit a five-year low.[23]
Citrix acquired ExpertCity, a provider of remote desktop products, in December 2003 for $225 million in cash and stock. The acquisition was the largest for the company up to that date.[24] Through the acquisition, Citrix gained ExpertCity's existing products GoToMyPC and GoToAssist, and ExpertCity became the Citrix Online division of the company.[24][25] In 2004, the company introduced Citrix GoToMeeting.[18]
Between 2005 and 2012, the company acquired over a dozen companies that allowed them to expand in new markets. Citrix acquired acceleration hardware maker NetScaler in 2005, which allowed the company to offer optimized application delivery.[26] The company entered the server and desktop virtualization market with the purchase of XenSource in August 2007.[27] Citrix expanded cloud and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offerings in August 2010 with the acquisition of VMLogix.[28] In February 2011, Citrix entered the European Software as a Service (SaaS) market with the acquisition of Netviewer.[29][30]
The company became a leader in IaaS after the acquisition of Cloud.com, provider of cloud infrastructure for companies, in July 2011.[31] Citrix began offering VDI-in-a-box to small and medium businesses with the acquisition of Kaviza in May 2011.[32] The company acquired technology for cloud-based file sharing and storage through its purchase of ShareFile in October 2011.[33]
In May 2012, Citrix acquired Virtual Computer, maker of intelligent desktop virtualization. The technology is used in the company's XenClient Enterprise edition.[34] Citrix entered the mobile video and telecom markets in June 2012 when the company acquired ByteMobile.[35] Also in 2012, the company acquired Zenprise. Zenprise's Mobile application management (MAM) technology was released as XenMobile in February 2013.[36]
In 2007, the company opened a headquarters in Silicon Valley.[18] In 2008, the company changed the name of its Presentation Server product line to XenApp.[37] Also in 2008, Citrix announced an expanded alliance with Microsoft on desktop virtualization solutions.[18] On January 29, 2009, Citrix announced that 460 employee positions would be cut, comprising 10% of its workforce.[38] In August 2010, Citrix announced a partnership with Google to bring the company's products to Chrome OS devices.[39][40]
Citrix acquired Framehawk in January 2014 in order to use the company's technology to improve the delivery of virtual desktops and applications over wireless networks, including cellular, where speed and quality may be poor.[41] In May 2014, Citrix acquired Scalextreme[42] to bolster its cloud capabilities for its core business unit of XenDesktop and Xenapp such as auto scaling, patching and automation of complex deployments from the cloud.
On January 29, 2015, Citrix announced that 700 full-time and 200 contractor positions would be eliminated.[43] This constituted about 10% of its workforce. The cuts were expected to save between $90 and $100 million a year. Two hundred of the layoffs occurred in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where the company is headquartered.[44]
The company had 10,081 employees as of February 2015.[45] In December 2015, Citrix employed approximately 9,500 people, but noted that its November restructure was due to eliminate nearly 700 full-time jobs.[2]
On July 14, 2015, Citrix added full support for Windows 10 to its desktop virtualization products.[46]
Recent history[edit]
Citrix reported net income of $251.7 million in 2014, down from $339.5 million in 2013.[47] In July 2015, the company announced several changes to its board of directors, including Robert Calderoni's becoming executive chairman and adding Jesse Cohn as a senior partner of activist hedge fund Elliott Management.[48] That same month the company announced that president and CEO Mark Templeton would retire after a replacement was found,[49] and on October 21, the company named its executive chairman, Robert Calderoni, as interim president and CEO.[50]
In January 2016, Kirill Tatarinov, a former Microsoft executive, was named the president and CEO of Citrix and joined the company's board. Calderoni remained executive chairman of the board.[51]
In July 2016, as part of a deal with Boston-based SaaS company LogMeIn, Citrix announced it had spun off its GoTo product line, which included GoToMeeting, GoToWebinar, GoToWebcast, GoToTraining, GoToAssist and GoToMyPC, into a wholly owned subsidiary called GetGo.[52] In February 2017, Citrix completed a merger through which GetGo became a subsidiary of LogMeIn. The transaction was valued at approximately $1.8 billion.[53]
In July 2017, David Henshall replaced Tatarinov as the company's CEO.[5]

Citrix Systems, Inc. is an American multinational software company that provides server, application and desktop virtualization, networking, software as a service (SaaS), and cloud computing technologies. It was founded in Richardson, Texas in 1989 by Ed Iacobucci, who served as chairman until his departure in 2000.
The company began by developing remote access products for Microsoft operating systems. It licensed source code from Microsoft and has been in partnership with the company throughout its history. Citrix came to prominence in the 1990s as a leader in thin client technology, purpose built for accessing remote servers. The company had its first initial public offering in 1995 and, with few competitors, experienced large revenue increases between 1995 and 1999.
The company acquired Sequoia Software Corp. in 2001 and ExpertCity, a provider of remote desktop products, in 2003. Between 2005 and 2012, Citrix acquired more than a dozen other companies, allowing it to expand into server and desktop virtualization, as well as cloud, Infrastructure as a Service, and SaaS offerings. In 2014, Citrix acquired Framehawk and used its technology to improve the delivery of virtual desktops and applications over wireless networks. In 2016, as part of a USD$1.8 billion product deal with LogMeIn, Citrix spun off the GoTo product line into a new business entity, entitled GetGo. In 2017, Citrix completed the merger of GetGo with LogMeIn's products.
Citrix is based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and Santa Clara, California, with subsidiary operations in California and Massachusetts, and additional development centers in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, India, and the United Kingdom. It currently services around 330,000 organizations worldwide.[3] In 2014, the company was ranked 741 on the Fortune 1000. Citrix reported $3.28 billion in revenue and a net income of more than $300 million in 2015. In December 2015, Citrix employed approximately 9,500 people, but noted that its November restructure was due to eliminate nearly 700 full-time jobs. As of December 31, 2016 , Citrix had approximately 9,600 employees, including approximately 1,700 employees related to the GoTo Business.[4] David Henshall became the company's CEO in July 2017.[5]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Citrix was founded in Richardson, Texas in 1989 by former IBM developer Ed Iacobucci with $3 million in funding.[6] Following its initial setup and development, Iacobucci moved the company to his former home of Coral Springs, Florida.[6] The company's first employees were five other engineers from IBM that Iacobucci convinced to join his team. Iacobucci served as chairman of the company and Roger Roberts became the CEO of Citrix in 1990.[6][7][8] Citrix was originally named Citrus, but changed its name after an existing company claimed trademark rights.[9] The Citrix name is a portmanteau of Citrus and UNIX.[10]
The company's first product was Citrix Multiuser, an extension of OS/2 developed over two years. Citrix licensed the OS/2 source code from Microsoft,[6][7][11] and developed its own Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) protocol for Citrix Multiuser.[12] Multiuser allowed multiple users working on separate computers remote access to software on a server, even from computers not built to run OS/2.[11][13] Three days before the product launched in 1991, Microsoft announced they would be switching from OS/2 to Windows. The switch made Multiuser nearly unusable without significant changes to make it compatible with Windows or DOS. The company discussed closing in 1991, but investments from Intel, Microsoft and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers among others, allowed the company to work on a new version of Multiuser.[6][7]
Multi-Win version 2.0 was released in 1992. It was compatible with DOS applications and allowed up to five users.[14] In 1993, Citrix released a new remote applications server, WinView, which had the ability to run DOS and Windows applications.[15] By 1994, the company's yearly revenue equaled US$10 million.[6]
The company launched WinFrame, a multi-user operating system based on Microsoft’s Windows NT, in 1995.[6] The new product allowed up to 15 users and was the first thin client for Windows.[16][17]
Rise in popularity[edit]
Citrix had its initial public offering in December 1995.[18] The company's share price doubled from $15 to $30.[6] During the mid-1990s, Citrix became the leader of its growing industry with very few competitors, and the company's revenues doubled year over year between 1995 and 1999.[7]
In 1997, during negotiations to extend licenses of Windows NT 4.0 source code to Citrix, Microsoft stated it would develop its own competing software to WinFrame. Citrix stocks dropped 62 percent after the announcement.[13] Following weeks of discussions, Iacobucci was able to persuade Microsoft to agree to license Citrix technology for Windows NT Server 4.0, which resulted in Windows Terminal Server Edition in 1998.[7][8][19] This agreement allowed Citrix to keep its position in the marketplace and be NT 4.0 compatible.[13] Citrix also earned $75 million through the agreement, along with a royalty arrangement that was valued at approximately $100 million.[13][18]
Citrix released MetaFrame 1.0 in conjunction with Terminal Server Edition. Due to weaknesses in Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Terminal Server Edition worked best using the ICA protocol developed by Citrix and found in MetaFrame. This meant that Citrix technology was purchased and installed on most machines running Terminal Server Edition.[8][19]
In 1997, the company opened a new headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. It also opened offices in Sydney, London and Paris that same year.[18]
In 1998, Mark Templeton became the CEO of Citrix after serving as vice president of marketing.[18] Also in 1998, it licensed its ICA protocol to IBM and Key Tronics.[6] Citrix licensed its ICA protocol to Motorola for use in digital wireless handsets in 1999.[7]
During 1999, the thin-client model Citrix used became a software trend and the company's customers increased to 15 million.[6] Major clients included Sears, AT&T, and Chevron.[8][13] A sudden drop in stocks in 2000 led to Iacobucci leaving the company and CEO Mark Templeton being demoted to president and senior executive officer. Templeton was later reinstated in 2001.[18][20]
Expansion[edit]
In 2001 Citrix acquired the Sequoia Software Corp. for $185 million.[6] That same year it released MetaFrame XP, a new platform using MetaFrame technology.[21] This was later rebranded by Citrix as Presentation Server, in 2005.[22]
On July 9, 2002, Citrix announced a 10% job cut. At the time the company employed about 1,900 workers. After the announcement the stock hit a five-year low.[23]
Citrix acquired ExpertCity, a provider of remote desktop products, in December 2003 for $225 million in cash and stock. The acquisition was the largest for the company up to that date.[24] Through the acquisition, Citrix gained ExpertCity's existing products GoToMyPC and GoToAssist, and ExpertCity became the Citrix Online division of the company.[24][25] In 2004, the company introduced Citrix GoToMeeting.[18]
Between 2005 and 2012, the company acquired over a dozen companies that allowed them to expand in new markets. Citrix acquired acceleration hardware maker NetScaler in 2005, which allowed the company to offer optimized application delivery.[26] The company entered the server and desktop virtualization market with the purchase of XenSource in August 2007.[27] Citrix expanded cloud and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offerings in August 2010 with the acquisition of VMLogix.[28] In February 2011, Citrix entered the European Software as a Service (SaaS) market with the acquisition of Netviewer.[29][30]
The company became a leader in IaaS after the acquisition of Cloud.com, provider of cloud infrastructure for companies, in July 2011.[31] Citrix began offering VDI-in-a-box to small and medium businesses with the acquisition of Kaviza in May 2011.[32] The company acquired technology for cloud-based file sharing and storage through its purchase of ShareFile in October 2011.[33]
In May 2012, Citrix acquired Virtual Computer, maker of intelligent desktop virtualization. The technology is used in the company's XenClient Enterprise edition.[34] Citrix entered the mobile video and telecom markets in June 2012 when the company acquired ByteMobile.[35] Also in 2012, the company acquired Zenprise. Zenprise's Mobile application management (MAM) technology was released as XenMobile in February 2013.[36]
In 2007, the company opened a headquarters in Silicon Valley.[18] In 2008, the company changed the name of its Presentation Server product line to XenApp.[37] Also in 2008, Citrix announced an expanded alliance with Microsoft on desktop virtualization solutions.[18] On January 29, 2009, Citrix announced that 460 employee positions would be cut, comprising 10% of its workforce.[38] In August 2010, Citrix announced a partnership with Google to bring the company's products to Chrome OS devices.[39][40]
Citrix acquired Framehawk in January 2014 in order to use the company's technology to improve the delivery of virtual desktops and applications over wireless networks, including cellular, where speed and quality may be poor.[41] In May 2014, Citrix acquired Scalextreme[42] to bolster its cloud capabilities for its core business unit of XenDesktop and Xenapp such as auto scaling, patching and automation of complex deployments from the cloud.
On January 29, 2015, Citrix announced that 700 full-time and 200 contractor positions would be eliminated.[43] This constituted about 10% of its workforce. The cuts were expected to save between $90 and $100 million a year. Two hundred of the layoffs occurred in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where the company is headquartered.[44]
The company had 10,081 employees as of February 2015.[45] In December 2015, Citrix employed approximately 9,500 people, but noted that its November restructure was due to eliminate nearly 700 full-time jobs.[2]
On July 14, 2015, Citrix added full support for Windows 10 to its desktop virtualization products.[46]
Recent history[edit]
Citrix reported net income of $251.7 million in 2014, down from $339.5 million in 2013.[47] In July 2015, the company announced several changes to its board of directors, including Robert Calderoni's becoming executive chairman and adding Jesse Cohn as a senior partner of activist hedge fund Elliott Management.[48] That same month the company announced that president and CEO Mark Templeton would retire after a replacement was found,[49] and on October 21, the company named its executive chairman, Robert Calderoni, as interim president and CEO.[50]
In January 2016, Kirill Tatarinov, a former Microsoft executive, was named the president and CEO of Citrix and joined the company's board. Calderoni remained executive chairman of the board.[51]
In July 2016, as part of a deal with Boston-based SaaS company LogMeIn, Citrix announced it had spun off its GoTo product line, which included GoToMeeting, GoToWebinar, GoToWebcast, GoToTraining, GoToAssist and GoToMyPC, into a wholly owned subsidiary called GetGo.[52] In February 2017, Citrix completed a merger through which GetGo became a subsidiary of LogMeIn. The transaction was valued at approximately $1.8 billion.[53]
In July 2017, David Henshall replaced Tatarinov as the company's CEO.[5]

Near its Fort Lauderdale headquarters, Citrix has provided business training to non-profit teams. In particular, the company helped a local non-profit organization launch a computer on wheels to offer training to low-income neighborhoods. In 2007, the company connected a Broward County, Florida neighborhood with Agogo, Ghana through donated technology and training. Using the technology, the "Cyber Sister Cities" work together to sell African organic honey in the United States.[85] Furthermore, the company's Raleigh office began a program called "Project Code" in 2014, which leads youth from local Boys & Girls Clubs through coding exercises and teaches them about computer science.[86]
In addition to its philanthropic activities, Citrix has donated some of its open-source technology to non-profit software organizations to continue its development and gain more contributors.

Citrix Systems, Inc. is an American multinational software company that provides server, application and desktop virtualization, networking, software as a service (SaaS), and cloud computing technologies. It was founded in Richardson, Texas in 1989 by Ed Iacobucci, who served as chairman until his departure in 2000.
The company began by developing remote access products for Microsoft operating systems. It licensed source code from Microsoft and has been in partnership with the company throughout its history. Citrix came to prominence in the 1990s as a leader in thin client technology, purpose built for accessing remote servers. The company had its first initial public offering in 1995 and, with few competitors, experienced large revenue increases between 1995 and 1999.
The company acquired Sequoia Software Corp. in 2001 and ExpertCity, a provider of remote desktop products, in 2003. Between 2005 and 2012, Citrix acquired more than a dozen other companies, allowing it to expand into server and desktop virtualization, as well as cloud, Infrastructure as a Service, and SaaS offerings. In 2014, Citrix acquired Framehawk and used its technology to improve the delivery of virtual desktops and applications over wireless networks. In 2016, as part of a USD$1.8 billion product deal with LogMeIn, Citrix spun off the GoTo product line into a new business entity, entitled GetGo. In 2017, Citrix completed the merger of GetGo with LogMeIn's products.
Citrix is based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and Santa Clara, California, with subsidiary operations in California and Massachusetts, and additional development centers in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, India, and the United Kingdom. It currently services around 330,000 organizations worldwide.[3] In 2014, the company was ranked 741 on the Fortune 1000. Citrix reported $3.28 billion in revenue and a net income of more than $300 million in 2015. In December 2015, Citrix employed approximately 9,500 people, but noted that its November restructure was due to eliminate nearly 700 full-time jobs. As of December 31, 2016 , Citrix had approximately 9,600 employees, including approximately 1,700 employees related to the GoTo Business.[4] David Henshall became the company's CEO in July 2017.[5]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Citrix was founded in Richardson, Texas in 1989 by former IBM developer Ed Iacobucci with $3 million in funding.[6] Following its initial setup and development, Iacobucci moved the company to his former home of Coral Springs, Florida.[6] The company's first employees were five other engineers from IBM that Iacobucci convinced to join his team. Iacobucci served as chairman of the company and Roger Roberts became the CEO of Citrix in 1990.[6][7][8] Citrix was originally named Citrus, but changed its name after an existing company claimed trademark rights.[9] The Citrix name is a portmanteau of Citrus and UNIX.[10]
The company's first product was Citrix Multiuser, an extension of OS/2 developed over two years. Citrix licensed the OS/2 source code from Microsoft,[6][7][11] and developed its own Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) protocol for Citrix Multiuser.[12] Multiuser allowed multiple users working on separate computers remote access to software on a server, even from computers not built to run OS/2.[11][13] Three days before the product launched in 1991, Microsoft announced they would be switching from OS/2 to Windows. The switch made Multiuser nearly unusable without significant changes to make it compatible with Windows or DOS. The company discussed closing in 1991, but investments from Intel, Microsoft and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers among others, allowed the company to work on a new version of Multiuser.[6][7]
Multi-Win version 2.0 was released in 1992. It was compatible with DOS applications and allowed up to five users.[14] In 1993, Citrix released a new remote applications server, WinView, which had the ability to run DOS and Windows applications.[15] By 1994, the company's yearly revenue equaled US$10 million.[6]
The company launched WinFrame, a multi-user operating system based on Microsoft’s Windows NT, in 1995.[6] The new product allowed up to 15 users and was the first thin client for Windows.[16][17]
Rise in popularity[edit]
Citrix had its initial public offering in December 1995.[18] The company's share price doubled from $15 to $30.[6] During the mid-1990s, Citrix became the leader of its growing industry with very few competitors, and the company's revenues doubled year over year between 1995 and 1999.[7]
In 1997, during negotiations to extend licenses of Windows NT 4.0 source code to Citrix, Microsoft stated it would develop its own competing software to WinFrame. Citrix stocks dropped 62 percent after the announcement.[13] Following weeks of discussions, Iacobucci was able to persuade Microsoft to agree to license Citrix technology for Windows NT Server 4.0, which resulted in Windows Terminal Server Edition in 1998.[7][8][19] This agreement allowed Citrix to keep its position in the marketplace and be NT 4.0 compatible.[13] Citrix also earned $75 million through the agreement, along with a royalty arrangement that was valued at approximately $100 million.[13][18]
Citrix released MetaFrame 1.0 in conjunction with Terminal Server Edition. Due to weaknesses in Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Terminal Server Edition worked best using the ICA protocol developed by Citrix and found in MetaFrame. This meant that Citrix technology was purchased and installed on most machines running Terminal Server Edition.[8][19]
In 1997, the company opened a new headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. It also opened offices in Sydney, London and Paris that same year.[18]
In 1998, Mark Templeton became the CEO of Citrix after serving as vice president of marketing.[18] Also in 1998, it licensed its ICA protocol to IBM and Key Tronics.[6] Citrix licensed its ICA protocol to Motorola for use in digital wireless handsets in 1999.[7]
During 1999, the thin-client model Citrix used became a software trend and the company's customers increased to 15 million.[6] Major clients included Sears, AT&T, and Chevron.[8][13] A sudden drop in stocks in 2000 led to Iacobucci leaving the company and CEO Mark Templeton being demoted to president and senior executive officer. Templeton was later reinstated in 2001.[18][20]
Expansion[edit]
In 2001 Citrix acquired the Sequoia Software Corp. for $185 million.[6] That same year it released MetaFrame XP, a new platform using MetaFrame technology.[21] This was later rebranded by Citrix as Presentation Server, in 2005.[22]
On July 9, 2002, Citrix announced a 10% job cut. At the time the company employed about 1,900 workers. After the announcement the stock hit a five-year low.[23]
Citrix acquired ExpertCity, a provider of remote desktop products, in December 2003 for $225 million in cash and stock. The acquisition was the largest for the company up to that date.[24] Through the acquisition, Citrix gained ExpertCity's existing products GoToMyPC and GoToAssist, and ExpertCity became the Citrix Online division of the company.[24][25] In 2004, the company introduced Citrix GoToMeeting.[18]
Between 2005 and 2012, the company acquired over a dozen companies that allowed them to expand in new markets. Citrix acquired acceleration hardware maker NetScaler in 2005, which allowed the company to offer optimized application delivery.[26] The company entered the server and desktop virtualization market with the purchase of XenSource in August 2007.[27] Citrix expanded cloud and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offerings in August 2010 with the acquisition of VMLogix.[28] In February 2011, Citrix entered the European Software as a Service (SaaS) market with the acquisition of Netviewer.[29][30]
The company became a leader in IaaS after the acquisition of Cloud.com, provider of cloud infrastructure for companies, in July 2011.[31] Citrix began offering VDI-in-a-box to small and medium businesses with the acquisition of Kaviza in May 2011.[32] The company acquired technology for cloud-based file sharing and storage through its purchase of ShareFile in October 2011.[33]
In May 2012, Citrix acquired Virtual Computer, maker of intelligent desktop virtualization. The technology is used in the company's XenClient Enterprise edition.[34] Citrix entered the mobile video and telecom markets in June 2012 when the company acquired ByteMobile.[35] Also in 2012, the company acquired Zenprise. Zenprise's Mobile application management (MAM) technology was released as XenMobile in February 2013.[36]
In 2007, the company opened a headquarters in Silicon Valley.[18] In 2008, the company changed the name of its Presentation Server product line to XenApp.[37] Also in 2008, Citrix announced an expanded alliance with Microsoft on desktop virtualization solutions.[18] On January 29, 2009, Citrix announced that 460 employee positions would be cut, comprising 10% of its workforce.[38] In August 2010, Citrix announced a partnership with Google to bring the company's products to Chrome OS devices.[39][40]
Citrix acquired Framehawk in January 2014 in order to use the company's technology to improve the delivery of virtual desktops and applications over wireless networks, including cellular, where speed and quality may be poor.[41] In May 2014, Citrix acquired Scalextreme[42] to bolster its cloud capabilities for its core business unit of XenDesktop and Xenapp such as auto scaling, patching and automation of complex deployments from the cloud.
On January 29, 2015, Citrix announced that 700 full-time and 200 contractor positions would be eliminated.[43] This constituted about 10% of its workforce. The cuts were expected to save between $90 and $100 million a year. Two hundred of the layoffs occurred in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where the company is headquartered.[44]
The company had 10,081 employees as of February 2015.[45] In December 2015, Citrix employed approximately 9,500 people, but noted that its November restructure was due to eliminate nearly 700 full-time jobs.[2]
On July 14, 2015, Citrix added full support for Windows 10 to its desktop virtualization products.[46]
Recent history[edit]
Citrix reported net income of $251.7 million in 2014, down from $339.5 million in 2013.[47] In July 2015, the company announced several changes to its board of directors, including Robert Calderoni's becoming executive chairman and adding Jesse Cohn as a senior partner of activist hedge fund Elliott Management.[48] That same month the company announced that president and CEO Mark Templeton would retire after a replacement was found,[49] and on October 21, the company named its executive chairman, Robert Calderoni, as interim president and CEO.[50]
In January 2016, Kirill Tatarinov, a former Microsoft executive, was named the president and CEO of Citrix and joined the company's board. Calderoni remained executive chairman of the board.[51]
In July 2016, as part of a deal with Boston-based SaaS company LogMeIn, Citrix announced it had spun off its GoTo product line, which included GoToMeeting, GoToWebinar, GoToWebcast, GoToTraining, GoToAssist and GoToMyPC, into a wholly owned subsidiary called GetGo.[52] In February 2017, Citrix completed a merger through which GetGo became a subsidiary of LogMeIn. The transaction was valued at approximately $1.8 billion.[53]
In July 2017, David Henshall replaced Tatarinov as the company's CEO.[5]

Main article: List of mergers and acquisitions by Citrix
Citrix has expanded and added new technologies and services through a number of mergers and acquisitions.[50] Its first acquisition was DataPac in 1997, which Citrix purchased in order to utilize DataPac's technology and its position in the Asia-Pacific region.[62][63][64] Other major acquisitions include ExpertCity in 2004, NetScaler in 2005, XenSource in 2007 and ShareFile in 2011. As of 2015, Citrix has acquired nearly 50 companies.[65]
Products[edit]
Citrix creates software that allows the individuals of an enterprise to work and collaborate remotely regardless of device or network. The main areas the company works in are desktop and apps; Desktop as a Service (DaaS); networking and cloud; and Software as a service (SaaS).[66][67]
Desktops and apps[edit]
Citrix offers a number of products related to desktop and application virtualization. These tools allow access to Windows desktops and applications independently of the machine they are actually on, and from any device with any operating system.[68] Citrix XenApp provides application virtualization (now integrated as part of XenDesktop), and Citrix XenDesktop, Citrix VDI-in-a-Box and XenClient all provide desktop virtualization.[69][70] The DesktopPlayer for Mac allows online and offline access to Windows virtual desktops from Macs.[71] Citrix Workspace Cloud is a platform for building and delivering desktops and applications from the cloud.[72] ShareFile allows companies and organizations to sync and share files.[73] XenMobile offers mobile app and device management, Citrix Receiver is client software that allows universal access to virtual applications and desktops, and AppDNA, software that provides application migration and management.[69]
Desktop as a Service (DaaS)[edit]
Citrix technology enables service providers to provide Desktop as a Service (DaaS) offerings to their customers, including business apps and desktops.[66] These products include: Worx Mobile Apps for secure email, browser, and document sharing;[74] and Citrix Workspace Suite for mobile workspaces.[75]
Networking and cloud[edit]
Citrix products related to cloud computing and networking include Citrix XenServer for server virtualization[70] [76] and its NetScaler brand of network appliances, including WAN optimization devices, Software-Defined WAN delivery equipment, Application Delivery Controllers (ADC), Gateways, and AppFirewall web application firewall.[67] The company also has ByteMobile Adaptive Traffic Management, which aims to optimize mobile video services through traffic management, policy control and caching, and ByteMobile Insight, which provides mobile data and subscriber analytics.[77][78]
Software as a Service (SaaS)[edit]
Citrix software as a service (SaaS) products are focused on collaboration and communications. The offerings include Podio, a cloud-based collaboration service, and OpenVoice, which provides audio conferencing.[70][73]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
The company's philanthropic activities include corporate giving—such as corporate donations of in-kind gifts—and employee match programs.[79][80] Citrix provides discounted and donated products to non-profits and other qualifying organizations through TechSoup.[81] In addition, Citrix employees are allowed to take two paid volunteer days each year and participate in the company's annual "Global Day of Impact"—an event that encourages Citrix employees to volunteer in their local communities.[82][83][84]
Near its Fort Lauderdale headquarters, Citrix has provided business training to non-profit teams. In particular, the company helped a local non-profit organization launch a computer on wheels to offer training to low-income neighborhoods. In 2007, the company connected a Broward County, Florida neighborhood with Agogo, Ghana through donated technology and training. Using the technology, the "Cyber Sister Cities" work together to sell African organic honey in the United States.[85] Furthermore, the company's Raleigh office began a program called "Project Code" in 2014, which leads youth from local Boys & Girls Clubs through coding exercises and teaches them about computer science.[86]
In addition to its philanthropic activities, Citrix has donated some of its open-source technology to non-profit software organizations to continue its development and gain more contributors. Citrix gave Cloudstack to the Apache Foundation in 2012 and Xen hypervisor to the Linux Foundation in 2013.[87][88]

Citrix Systems, Inc. is an American multinational software company that provides server, application and desktop virtualization, networking, software as a service (SaaS), and cloud computing technologies. It was founded in Richardson, Texas in 1989 by Ed Iacobucci, who served as chairman until his departure in 2000.
The company began by developing remote access products for Microsoft operating systems. It licensed source code from Microsoft and has been in partnership with the company throughout its history. Citrix came to prominence in the 1990s as a leader in thin client technology, purpose built for accessing remote servers. The company had its first initial public offering in 1995 and, with few competitors, experienced large revenue increases between 1995 and 1999.
The company acquired Sequoia Software Corp. in 2001 and ExpertCity, a provider of remote desktop products, in 2003. Between 2005 and 2012, Citrix acquired more than a dozen other companies, allowing it to expand into server and desktop virtualization, as well as cloud, Infrastructure as a Service, and SaaS offerings. In 2014, Citrix acquired Framehawk and used its technology to improve the delivery of virtual desktops and applications over wireless networks. In 2016, as part of a USD$1.8 billion product deal with LogMeIn, Citrix spun off the GoTo product line into a new business entity, entitled GetGo. In 2017, Citrix completed the merger of GetGo with LogMeIn's products.
Citrix is based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and Santa Clara, California, with subsidiary operations in California and Massachusetts, and additional development centers in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, India, and the United Kingdom. It currently services around 330,000 organizations worldwide.[3] In 2014, the company was ranked 741 on the Fortune 1000. Citrix reported $3.28 billion in revenue and a net income of more than $300 million in 2015. In December 2015, Citrix employed approximately 9,500 people, but noted that its November restructure was due to eliminate nearly 700 full-time jobs. As of December 31, 2016 , Citrix had approximately 9,600 employees, including approximately 1,700 employees related to the GoTo Business.[4] David Henshall became the company's CEO in July 2017.[5]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Citrix was founded in Richardson, Texas in 1989 by former IBM developer Ed Iacobucci with $3 million in funding.[6] Following its initial setup and development, Iacobucci moved the company to his former home of Coral Springs, Florida.[6] The company's first employees were five other engineers from IBM that Iacobucci convinced to join his team. Iacobucci served as chairman of the company and Roger Roberts became the CEO of Citrix in 1990.[6][7][8] Citrix was originally named Citrus, but changed its name after an existing company claimed trademark rights.[9] The Citrix name is a portmanteau of Citrus and UNIX.[10]
The company's first product was Citrix Multiuser, an extension of OS/2 developed over two years. Citrix licensed the OS/2 source code from Microsoft,[6][7][11] and developed its own Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) protocol for Citrix Multiuser.[12] Multiuser allowed multiple users working on separate computers remote access to software on a server, even from computers not built to run OS/2.[11][13] Three days before the product launched in 1991, Microsoft announced they would be switching from OS/2 to Windows. The switch made Multiuser nearly unusable without significant changes to make it compatible with Windows or DOS. The company discussed closing in 1991, but investments from Intel, Microsoft and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers among others, allowed the company to work on a new version of Multiuser.[6][7]
Multi-Win version 2.0 was released in 1992. It was compatible with DOS applications and allowed up to five users.[14] In 1993, Citrix released a new remote applications server, WinView, which had the ability to run DOS and Windows applications.[15] By 1994, the company's yearly revenue equaled US$10 million.[6]
The company launched WinFrame, a multi-user operating system based on Microsoft’s Windows NT, in 1995.[6] The new product allowed up to 15 users and was the first thin client for Windows.[16][17]
Rise in popularity[edit]
Citrix had its initial public offering in December 1995.[18] The company's share price doubled from $15 to $30.[6] During the mid-1990s, Citrix became the leader of its growing industry with very few competitors, and the company's revenues doubled year over year between 1995 and 1999.[7]
In 1997, during negotiations to extend licenses of Windows NT 4.0 source code to Citrix, Microsoft stated it would develop its own competing software to WinFrame. Citrix stocks dropped 62 percent after the announcement.[13] Following weeks of discussions, Iacobucci was able to persuade Microsoft to agree to license Citrix technology for Windows NT Server 4.0, which resulted in Windows Terminal Server Edition in 1998.[7][8][19] This agreement allowed Citrix to keep its position in the marketplace and be NT 4.0 compatible.[13] Citrix also earned $75 million through the agreement, along with a royalty arrangement that was valued at approximately $100 million.[13][18]
Citrix released MetaFrame 1.0 in conjunction with Terminal Server Edition. Due to weaknesses in Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Terminal Server Edition worked best using the ICA protocol developed by Citrix and found in MetaFrame. This meant that Citrix technology was purchased and installed on most machines running Terminal Server Edition.[8][19]
In 1997, the company opened a new headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. It also opened offices in Sydney, London and Paris that same year.[18]
In 1998, Mark Templeton became the CEO of Citrix after serving as vice president of marketing.[18] Also in 1998, it licensed its ICA protocol to IBM and Key Tronics.[6] Citrix licensed its ICA protocol to Motorola for use in digital wireless handsets in 1999.[7]
During 1999, the thin-client model Citrix used became a software trend and the company's customers increased to 15 million.[6] Major clients included Sears, AT&T, and Chevron.[8][13] A sudden drop in stocks in 2000 led to Iacobucci leaving the company and CEO Mark Templeton being demoted to president and senior executive officer. Templeton was later reinstated in 2001.[18][20]
Expansion[edit]
In 2001 Citrix acquired the Sequoia Software Corp. for $185 million.[6] That same year it released MetaFrame XP, a new platform using MetaFrame technology.[21] This was later rebranded by Citrix as Presentation Server, in 2005.[22]
On July 9, 2002, Citrix announced a 10% job cut. At the time the company employed about 1,900 workers. After the announcement the stock hit a five-year low.[23]
Citrix acquired ExpertCity, a provider of remote desktop products, in December 2003 for $225 million in cash and stock. The acquisition was the largest for the company up to that date.[24] Through the acquisition, Citrix gained ExpertCity's existing products GoToMyPC and GoToAssist, and ExpertCity became the Citrix Online division of the company.[24][25] In 2004, the company introduced Citrix GoToMeeting.[18]
Between 2005 and 2012, the company acquired over a dozen companies that allowed them to expand in new markets. Citrix acquired acceleration hardware maker NetScaler in 2005, which allowed the company to offer optimized application delivery.[26] The company entered the server and desktop virtualization market with the purchase of XenSource in August 2007.[27] Citrix expanded cloud and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offerings in August 2010 with the acquisition of VMLogix.[28] In February 2011, Citrix entered the European Software as a Service (SaaS) market with the acquisition of Netviewer.[29][30]
The company became a leader in IaaS after the acquisition of Cloud.com, provider of cloud infrastructure for companies, in July 2011.[31] Citrix began offering VDI-in-a-box to small and medium businesses with the acquisition of Kaviza in May 2011.[32] The company acquired technology for cloud-based file sharing and storage through its purchase of ShareFile in October 2011.[33]
In May 2012, Citrix acquired Virtual Computer, maker of intelligent desktop virtualization. The technology is used in the company's XenClient Enterprise edition.[34] Citrix entered the mobile video and telecom markets in June 2012 when the company acquired ByteMobile.[35] Also in 2012, the company acquired Zenprise. Zenprise's Mobile application management (MAM) technology was released as XenMobile in February 2013.[36]
In 2007, the company opened a headquarters in Silicon Valley.[18] In 2008, the company changed the name of its Presentation Server product line to XenApp.[37] Also in 2008, Citrix announced an expanded alliance with Microsoft on desktop virtualization solutions.[18] On January 29, 2009, Citrix announced that 460 employee positions would be cut, comprising 10% of its workforce.[38] In August 2010, Citrix announced a partnership with Google to bring the company's products to Chrome OS devices.[39][40]
Citrix acquired Framehawk in January 2014 in order to use the company's technology to improve the delivery of virtual desktops and applications over wireless networks, including cellular, where speed and quality may be poor.[41] In May 2014, Citrix acquired Scalextreme[42] to bolster its cloud capabilities for its core business unit of XenDesktop and Xenapp such as auto scaling, patching and automation of complex deployments from the cloud.
On January 29, 2015, Citrix announced that 700 full-time and 200 contractor positions would be eliminated.[43] This constituted about 10% of its workforce. The cuts were expected to save between $90 and $100 million a year. Two hundred of the layoffs occurred in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where the company is headquartered.[44]
The company had 10,081 employees as of February 2015.[45] In December 2015, Citrix employed approximately 9,500 people, but noted that its November restructure was due to eliminate nearly 700 full-time jobs.[2]
On July 14, 2015, Citrix added full support for Windows 10 to its desktop virtualization products.[46]
Recent history[edit]
Citrix reported net income of $251.7 million in 2014, down from $339.5 million in 2013.[47] In July 2015, the company announced several changes to its board of directors, including Robert Calderoni's becoming executive chairman and adding Jesse Cohn as a senior partner of activist hedge fund Elliott Management.[48] That same month the company announced that president and CEO Mark Templeton would retire after a replacement was found,[49] and on October 21, the company named its executive chairman, Robert Calderoni, as interim president and CEO.[50]
In January 2016, Kirill Tatarinov, a former Microsoft executive, was named the president and CEO of Citrix and joined the company's board. Calderoni remained executive chairman of the board.[51]
In July 2016, as part of a deal with Boston-based SaaS company LogMeIn, Citrix announced it had spun off its GoTo product line, which included GoToMeeting, GoToWebinar, GoToWebcast, GoToTraining, GoToAssist and GoToMyPC, into a wholly owned subsidiary called GetGo.[52] In February 2017, Citrix completed a merger through which GetGo became a subsidiary of LogMeIn. The transaction was valued at approximately $1.8 billion.[53]
In July 2017, David Henshall replaced Tatarinov as the company's CEO.[5]

Main article: List of mergers and acquisitions by Citrix
Citrix has expanded and added new technologies and services through a number of mergers and acquisitions.[50] Its first acquisition was DataPac in 1997, which Citrix purchased in order to utilize DataPac's technology and its position in the Asia-Pacific region.[62][63][64] Other major acquisitions include ExpertCity in 2004, NetScaler in 2005, XenSource in 2007 and ShareFile in 2011.

Desktops and apps[edit]
Citrix offers a number of products related to desktop and application virtualization. These tools allow access to Windows desktops and applications independently of the machine they are actually on, and from any device with any operating system.[68] Citrix XenApp provides application virtualization (now integrated as part of XenDesktop), and Citrix XenDesktop, Citrix VDI-in-a-Box and XenClient all provide desktop virtualization.[69][70] The DesktopPlayer for Mac allows online and offline access to Windows virtual desktops from Macs.[71] Citrix Workspace Cloud is a platform for building and delivering desktops and applications from the cloud.[72] ShareFile allows companies and organizations to sync and share files.[73] XenMobile offers mobile app and device management, Citrix Receiver is client software that allows universal access to virtual applications and desktops, and AppDNA, software that provides application migration and management.[69]

Corporate responsibility[edit]
The company's philanthropic activities include corporate giving—such as corporate donations of in-kind gifts—and employee match programs.[79][80] Citrix provides discounted and donated products to non-profits and other qualifying organizations through TechSoup.[81] In addition, Citrix employees are allowed to take two paid volunteer days each year and participate in the company's annual "Global Day of Impact"—an event that encourages Citrix employees to volunteer in their local communities.[82][83][84]
Near its Fort Lauderdale headquarters, Citrix has provided business training to non-profit teams. In particular, the company helped a local non-profit organization launch a computer on wheels to offer training to low-income neighborhoods. In 2007, the company connected a Broward County, Florida neighborhood with Agogo, Ghana through donated technology and training. Using the technology, the "Cyber Sister Cities" work together to sell African organic honey in the United States.[85] Furthermore, the company's Raleigh office began a program called "Project Code" in 2014, which leads youth from local Boys & Girls Clubs through coding exercises and teaches them about computer science.[86]
In addition to its philanthropic activities, Citrix has donated some of its open-source technology to non-profit software organizations to continue its development and gain more contributors. Citrix gave Cloudstack to the Apache Foundation in 2012 and Xen hypervisor to the Linux Foundation in 2013.[87][88]

4 Ways a VDI Storage Solution Can Save (or Cost) Money





























An eBook from Citrix and Pure Storage
Many companies are now benefitting from the flexibility, mobility, and security that virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) offers managing independent physical desktops.
But storage performance and cost remains an issue for VDI. Legacy systems, which rely on traditional spinning disks, fall short in adequately serving end-users. Even hybrid storage systems struggle to feed the voracious IO appetite of VDI systems.
It is possible to meet the demands of a VDI system while cutting both operational and deployment costs.
This eBook will discuss four ways to find savings in VDI storage — both by moving to an all-flash model and by finding the right flash solution.

Citrix Systems, Inc. is an American multinational software company that provides server, application and desktop virtualization, networking, software as a service (SaaS), and cloud computing technologies. It was founded in Richardson, Texas in 1989 by Ed Iacobucci, who served as chairman until his departure in 2000.
The company began by developing remote access products for Microsoft operating systems. It licensed source code from Microsoft and has been in partnership with the company throughout its history. Citrix came to prominence in the 1990s as a leader in thin client technology, purpose built for accessing remote servers. The company had its first initial public offering in 1995 and, with few competitors, experienced large revenue increases between 1995 and 1999.
The company acquired Sequoia Software Corp. in 2001 and ExpertCity, a provider of remote desktop products, in 2003. Between 2005 and 2012, Citrix acquired more than a dozen other companies, allowing it to expand into server and desktop virtualization, as well as cloud, Infrastructure as a Service, and SaaS offerings. In 2014, Citrix acquired Framehawk and used its technology to improve the delivery of virtual desktops and applications over wireless networks. In 2016, as part of a USD$1.8 billion product deal with LogMeIn, Citrix spun off the GoTo product line into a new business entity, entitled GetGo. In 2017, Citrix completed the merger of GetGo with LogMeIn's products.
Citrix is based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and Santa Clara, California, with subsidiary operations in California and Massachusetts, and additional development centers in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, India, and the United Kingdom. It currently services around 330,000 organizations worldwide.[3] In 2014, the company was ranked 741 on the Fortune 1000. Citrix reported $3.28 billion in revenue and a net income of more than $300 million in 2015. In December 2015, Citrix employed approximately 9,500 people, but noted that its November restructure was due to eliminate nearly 700 full-time jobs. As of December 31, 2016 , Citrix had approximately 9,600 employees, including approximately 1,700 employees related to the GoTo Business.[4] David Henshall became the company's CEO in July 2017.[5]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Citrix was founded in Richardson, Texas in 1989 by former IBM developer Ed Iacobucci with $3 million in funding.[6] Following its initial setup and development, Iacobucci moved the company to his former home of Coral Springs, Florida.[6] The company's first employees were five other engineers from IBM that Iacobucci convinced to join his team. Iacobucci served as chairman of the company and Roger Roberts became the CEO of Citrix in 1990.[6][7][8] Citrix was originally named Citrus, but changed its name after an existing company claimed trademark rights.[9] The Citrix name is a portmanteau of Citrus and UNIX.[10]
The company's first product was Citrix Multiuser, an extension of OS/2 developed over two years. Citrix licensed the OS/2 source code from Microsoft,[6][7][11] and developed its own Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) protocol for Citrix Multiuser.[12] Multiuser allowed multiple users working on separate computers remote access to software on a server, even from computers not built to run OS/2.[11][13] Three days before the product launched in 1991, Microsoft announced they would be switching from OS/2 to Windows. The switch made Multiuser nearly unusable without significant changes to make it compatible with Windows or DOS. The company discussed closing in 1991, but investments from Intel, Microsoft and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers among others, allowed the company to work on a new version of Multiuser.[6][7]
Multi-Win version 2.0 was released in 1992. It was compatible with DOS applications and allowed up to five users.[14] In 1993, Citrix released a new remote applications server, WinView, which had the ability to run DOS and Windows applications.[15] By 1994, the company's yearly revenue equaled US$10 million.[6]
The company launched WinFrame, a multi-user operating system based on Microsoft’s Windows NT, in 1995.[6] The new product allowed up to 15 users and was the first thin client for Windows.[16][17]
Rise in popularity[edit]
Citrix had its initial public offering in December 1995.[18] The company's share price doubled from $15 to $30.[6] During the mid-1990s, Citrix became the leader of its growing industry with very few competitors, and the company's revenues doubled year over year between 1995 and 1999.[7]
In 1997, during negotiations to extend licenses of Windows NT 4.0 source code to Citrix, Microsoft stated it would develop its own competing software to WinFrame. Citrix stocks dropped 62 percent after the announcement.[13] Following weeks of discussions, Iacobucci was able to persuade Microsoft to agree to license Citrix technology for Windows NT Server 4.0, which resulted in Windows Terminal Server Edition in 1998.[7][8][19] This agreement allowed Citrix to keep its position in the marketplace and be NT 4.0 compatible.[13] Citrix also earned $75 million through the agreement, along with a royalty arrangement that was valued at approximately $100 million.[13][18]
Citrix released MetaFrame 1.0 in conjunction with Terminal Server Edition. Due to weaknesses in Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Terminal Server Edition worked best using the ICA protocol developed by Citrix and found in MetaFrame. This meant that Citrix technology was purchased and installed on most machines running Terminal Server Edition.[8][19]
In 1997, the company opened a new headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. It also opened offices in Sydney, London and Paris that same year.[18]
In 1998, Mark Templeton became the CEO of Citrix after serving as vice president of marketing.[18] Also in 1998, it licensed its ICA protocol to IBM and Key Tronics.[6] Citrix licensed its ICA protocol to Motorola for use in digital wireless handsets in 1999.[7]
During 1999, the thin-client model Citrix used became a software trend and the company's customers increased to 15 million.[6] Major clients included Sears, AT&T, and Chevron.[8][13] A sudden drop in stocks in 2000 led to Iacobucci leaving the company and CEO Mark Templeton being demoted to president and senior executive officer. Templeton was later reinstated in 2001.[18][20]
Expansion[edit]
In 2001 Citrix acquired the Sequoia Software Corp. for $185 million.[6] That same year it released MetaFrame XP, a new platform using MetaFrame technology.[21] This was later rebranded by Citrix as Presentation Server, in 2005.[22]
On July 9, 2002, Citrix announced a 10% job cut. At the time the company employed about 1,900 workers. After the announcement the stock hit a five-year low.[23]
Citrix acquired ExpertCity, a provider of remote desktop products, in December 2003 for $225 million in cash and stock. The acquisition was the largest for the company up to that date.[24] Through the acquisition, Citrix gained ExpertCity's existing products GoToMyPC and GoToAssist, and ExpertCity became the Citrix Online division of the company.[24][25] In 2004, the company introduced Citrix GoToMeeting.[18]
Between 2005 and 2012, the company acquired over a dozen companies that allowed them to expand in new markets. Citrix acquired acceleration hardware maker NetScaler in 2005, which allowed the company to offer optimized application delivery.[26] The company entered the server and desktop virtualization market with the purchase of XenSource in August 2007.[27] Citrix expanded cloud and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offerings in August 2010 with the acquisition of VMLogix.[28] In February 2011, Citrix entered the European Software as a Service (SaaS) market with the acquisition of Netviewer.[29][30]
The company became a leader in IaaS after the acquisition of Cloud.com, provider of cloud infrastructure for companies, in July 2011.[31] Citrix began offering VDI-in-a-box to small and medium businesses with the acquisition of Kaviza in May 2011.[32] The company acquired technology for cloud-based file sharing and storage through its purchase of ShareFile in October 2011.[33]
In May 2012, Citrix acquired Virtual Computer, maker of intelligent desktop virtualization. The technology is used in the company's XenClient Enterprise edition.[34] Citrix entered the mobile video and telecom markets in June 2012 when the company acquired ByteMobile.[35] Also in 2012, the company acquired Zenprise. Zenprise's Mobile application management (MAM) technology was released as XenMobile in February 2013.[36]
In 2007, the company opened a headquarters in Silicon Valley.[18] In 2008, the company changed the name of its Presentation Server product line to XenApp.[37] Also in 2008, Citrix announced an expanded alliance with Microsoft on desktop virtualization solutions.[18] On January 29, 2009, Citrix announced that 460 employee positions would be cut, comprising 10% of its workforce.[38] In August 2010, Citrix announced a partnership with Google to bring the company's products to Chrome OS devices.[39][40]
Citrix acquired Framehawk in January 2014 in order to use the company's technology to improve the delivery of virtual desktops and applications over wireless networks, including cellular, where speed and quality may be poor.[41] In May 2014, Citrix acquired Scalextreme[42] to bolster its cloud capabilities for its core business unit of XenDesktop and Xenapp such as auto scaling, patching and automation of complex deployments from the cloud.
On January 29, 2015, Citrix announced that 700 full-time and 200 contractor positions would be eliminated.[43] This constituted about 10% of its workforce. The cuts were expected to save between $90 and $100 million a year. Two hundred of the layoffs occurred in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where the company is headquartered.[44]
The company had 10,081 employees as of February 2015.[45] In December 2015, Citrix employed approximately 9,500 people, but noted that its November restructure was due to eliminate nearly 700 full-time jobs.[2]
On July 14, 2015, Citrix added full support for Windows 10 to its desktop virtualization products.[46]
Recent history[edit]
Citrix reported net income of $251.7 million in 2014, down from $339.5 million in 2013.[47] In July 2015, the company announced several changes to its board of directors, including Robert Calderoni's becoming executive chairman and adding Jesse Cohn as a senior partner of activist hedge fund Elliott Management.[48] That same month the company announced that president and CEO Mark Templeton would retire after a replacement was found,[49] and on October 21, the company named its executive chairman, Robert Calderoni, as interim president and CEO.[50]
In January 2016, Kirill Tatarinov, a former Microsoft executive, was named the president and CEO of Citrix and joined the company's board. Calderoni remained executive chairman of the board.[51]
In July 2016, as part of a deal with Boston-based SaaS company LogMeIn, Citrix announced it had spun off its GoTo product line, which included GoToMeeting, GoToWebinar, GoToWebcast, GoToTraining, GoToAssist and GoToMyPC, into a wholly owned subsidiary called GetGo.[52] In February 2017, Citrix completed a merger through which GetGo became a subsidiary of LogMeIn. The transaction was valued at approximately $1.8 billion.[53]
In July 2017, David Henshall replaced Tatarinov as the company's CEO.[5]

Citrix Systems, Inc. is an American multinational software company that provides server, application and desktop virtualization, networking, software as a service (SaaS), and cloud computing technologies. It was founded in Richardson, Texas in 1989 by Ed Iacobucci, who served as chairman until his departure in 2000.
The company began by developing remote access products for Microsoft operating systems. It licensed source code from Microsoft and has been in partnership with the company throughout its history. Citrix came to prominence in the 1990s as a leader in thin client technology, purpose built for accessing remote servers. The company had its first initial public offering in 1995 and, with few competitors, experienced large revenue increases between 1995 and 1999.
The company acquired Sequoia Software Corp. in 2001 and ExpertCity, a provider of remote desktop products, in 2003. Between 2005 and 2012, Citrix acquired more than a dozen other companies, allowing it to expand into server and desktop virtualization, as well as cloud, Infrastructure as a Service, and SaaS offerings. In 2014, Citrix acquired Framehawk and used its technology to improve the delivery of virtual desktops and applications over wireless networks. In 2016, as part of a USD$1.8 billion product deal with LogMeIn, Citrix spun off the GoTo product line into a new business entity, entitled GetGo. In 2017, Citrix completed the merger of GetGo with LogMeIn's products.
Citrix is based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and Santa Clara, California, with subsidiary operations in California and Massachusetts, and additional development centers in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, India, and the United Kingdom. It currently services around 330,000 organizations worldwide.[3] In 2014, the company was ranked 741 on the Fortune 1000. Citrix reported $3.28 billion in revenue and a net income of more than $300 million in 2015. In December 2015, Citrix employed approximately 9,500 people, but noted that its November restructure was due to eliminate nearly 700 full-time jobs. As of December 31, 2016 , Citrix had approximately 9,600 employees, including approximately 1,700 employees related to the GoTo Business.[4] David Henshall became the company's CEO in July 2017.[5]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Citrix was founded in Richardson, Texas in 1989 by former IBM developer Ed Iacobucci with $3 million in funding.[6] Following its initial setup and development, Iacobucci moved the company to his former home of Coral Springs, Florida.[6] The company's first employees were five other engineers from IBM that Iacobucci convinced to join his team. Iacobucci served as chairman of the company and Roger Roberts became the CEO of Citrix in 1990.[6][7][8] Citrix was originally named Citrus, but changed its name after an existing company claimed trademark rights.[9] The Citrix name is a portmanteau of Citrus and UNIX.[10]
The company's first product was Citrix Multiuser, an extension of OS/2 developed over two years. Citrix licensed the OS/2 source code from Microsoft,[6][7][11] and developed its own Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) protocol for Citrix Multiuser.[12] Multiuser allowed multiple users working on separate computers remote access to software on a server, even from computers not built to run OS/2.[11][13] Three days before the product launched in 1991, Microsoft announced they would be switching from OS/2 to Windows. The switch made Multiuser nearly unusable without significant changes to make it compatible with Windows or DOS. The company discussed closing in 1991, but investments from Intel, Microsoft and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers among others, allowed the company to work on a new version of Multiuser.[6][7]
Multi-Win version 2.0 was released in 1992. It was compatible with DOS applications and allowed up to five users.[14] In 1993, Citrix released a new remote applications server, WinView, which had the ability to run DOS and Windows applications.[15] By 1994, the company's yearly revenue equaled US$10 million.[6]
The company launched WinFrame, a multi-user operating system based on Microsoft’s Windows NT, in 1995.[6] The new product allowed up to 15 users and was the first thin client for Windows.[16][17]
Rise in popularity[edit]
Citrix had its initial public offering in December 1995.[18] The company's share price doubled from $15 to $30.[6] During the mid-1990s, Citrix became the leader of its growing industry with very few competitors, and the company's revenues doubled year over year between 1995 and 1999.[7]
In 1997, during negotiations to extend licenses of Windows NT 4.0 source code to Citrix, Microsoft stated it would develop its own competing software to WinFrame. Citrix stocks dropped 62 percent after the announcement.[13] Following weeks of discussions, Iacobucci was able to persuade Microsoft to agree to license Citrix technology for Windows NT Server 4.0, which resulted in Windows Terminal Server Edition in 1998.[7][8][19] This agreement allowed Citrix to keep its position in the marketplace and be NT 4.0 compatible.[13] Citrix also earned $75 million through the agreement, along with a royalty arrangement that was valued at approximately $100 million.[13][18]
Citrix released MetaFrame 1.0 in conjunction with Terminal Server Edition. Due to weaknesses in Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Terminal Server Edition worked best using the ICA protocol developed by Citrix and found in MetaFrame. This meant that Citrix technology was purchased and installed on most machines running Terminal Server Edition.[8][19]
In 1997, the company opened a new headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. It also opened offices in Sydney, London and Paris that same year.[18]
In 1998, Mark Templeton became the CEO of Citrix after serving as vice president of marketing.[18] Also in 1998, it licensed its ICA protocol to IBM and Key Tronics.[6] Citrix licensed its ICA protocol to Motorola for use in digital wireless handsets in 1999.[7]
During 1999, the thin-client model Citrix used became a software trend and the company's customers increased to 15 million.[6] Major clients included Sears, AT&T, and Chevron.[8][13] A sudden drop in stocks in 2000 led to Iacobucci leaving the company and CEO Mark Templeton being demoted to president and senior executive officer. Templeton was later reinstated in 2001.[18][20]
Expansion[edit]
In 2001 Citrix acquired the Sequoia Software Corp. for $185 million.[6] That same year it released MetaFrame XP, a new platform using MetaFrame technology.[21] This was later rebranded by Citrix as Presentation Server, in 2005.[22]
On July 9, 2002, Citrix announced a 10% job cut. At the time the company employed about 1,900 workers. After the announcement the stock hit a five-year low.[23]
Citrix acquired ExpertCity, a provider of remote desktop products, in December 2003 for $225 million in cash and stock. The acquisition was the largest for the company up to that date.[24] Through the acquisition, Citrix gained ExpertCity's existing products GoToMyPC and GoToAssist, and ExpertCity became the Citrix Online division of the company.[24][25] In 2004, the company introduced Citrix GoToMeeting.[18]
Between 2005 and 2012, the company acquired over a dozen companies that allowed them to expand in new markets. Citrix acquired acceleration hardware maker NetScaler in 2005, which allowed the company to offer optimized application delivery.[26] The company entered the server and desktop virtualization market with the purchase of XenSource in August 2007.[27] Citrix expanded cloud and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offerings in August 2010 with the acquisition of VMLogix.[28] In February 2011, Citrix entered the European Software as a Service (SaaS) market with the acquisition of Netviewer.[29][30]
The company became a leader in IaaS after the acquisition of Cloud.com, provider of cloud infrastructure for companies, in July 2011.[31] Citrix began offering VDI-in-a-box to small and medium businesses with the acquisition of Kaviza in May 2011.[32] The company acquired technology for cloud-based file sharing and storage through its purchase of ShareFile in October 2011.[33]
In May 2012, Citrix acquired Virtual Computer, maker of intelligent desktop virtualization. The technology is used in the company's XenClient Enterprise edition.[34] Citrix entered the mobile video and telecom markets in June 2012 when the company acquired ByteMobile.[35] Also in 2012, the company acquired Zenprise. Zenprise's Mobile application management (MAM) technology was released as XenMobile in February 2013.[36]
In 2007, the company opened a headquarters in Silicon Valley.[18] In 2008, the company changed the name of its Presentation Server product line to XenApp.[37] Also in 2008, Citrix announced an expanded alliance with Microsoft on desktop virtualization solutions.[18] On January 29, 2009, Citrix announced that 460 employee positions would be cut, comprising 10% of its workforce.[38] In August 2010, Citrix announced a partnership with Google to bring the company's products to Chrome OS devices.[39][40]
Citrix acquired Framehawk in January 2014 in order to use the company's technology to improve the delivery of virtual desktops and applications over wireless networks, including cellular, where speed and quality may be poor.[41] In May 2014, Citrix acquired Scalextreme[42] to bolster its cloud capabilities for its core business unit of XenDesktop and Xenapp such as auto scaling, patching and automation of complex deployments from the cloud.
On January 29, 2015, Citrix announced that 700 full-time and 200 contractor positions would be eliminated.[43] This constituted about 10% of its workforce. The cuts were expected to save between $90 and $100 million a year. Two hundred of the layoffs occurred in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where the company is headquartered.[44]
The company had 10,081 employees as of February 2015.[45] In December 2015, Citrix employed approximately 9,500 people, but noted that its November restructure was due to eliminate nearly 700 full-time jobs.[2]
On July 14, 2015, Citrix added full support for Windows 10 to its desktop virtualization products.[46]
Recent history[edit]
Citrix reported net income of $251.7 million in 2014, down from $339.5 million in 2013.[47] In July 2015, the company announced several changes to its board of directors, including Robert Calderoni's becoming executive chairman and adding Jesse Cohn as a senior partner of activist hedge fund Elliott Management.[48] That same month the company announced that president and CEO Mark Templeton would retire after a replacement was found,[49] and on October 21, the company named its executive chairman, Robert Calderoni, as interim president and CEO.[50]
In January 2016, Kirill Tatarinov, a former Microsoft executive, was named the president and CEO of Citrix and joined the company's board. Calderoni remained executive chairman of the board.[51]
In July 2016, as part of a deal with Boston-based SaaS company LogMeIn, Citrix announced it had spun off its GoTo product line, which included GoToMeeting, GoToWebinar, GoToWebcast, GoToTraining, GoToAssist and GoToMyPC, into a wholly owned subsidiary called GetGo.[52] In February 2017, Citrix completed a merger through which GetGo became a subsidiary of LogMeIn. The transaction was valued at approximately $1.8 billion.[53]
In July 2017, David Henshall replaced Tatarinov as the company's CEO.[5]

Citrix is organized into three units: Workspace Services, Delivery Network, and Mobility Apps.[59] Citrix licenses its services and products directly to clients, including IT professionals, SMEs, and through companies called value-added resellers that resell the products and services after adding additional features.
Citrix is publicly traded under the ticker symbol CTXS.[54] In 2014, the company ranked 741 on the Fortune 1000 and 1,793 on Forbes Global 2000.[54][60] Citrix’s revenue in 2015 equaled US$3.28 billion,[2] an increase from $3.14 billion in 2014 and $2.91 billion in 2013.[61]
Acquisitions[edit]
Main article: List of mergers and acquisitions by Citrix
Citrix has expanded and added new technologies and services through a number of mergers and acquisitions.[50] Its first acquisition was DataPac in 1997, which Citrix purchased in order to utilize DataPac's technology and its position in the Asia-Pacific region.[62][63][64] Other major acquisitions include ExpertCity in 2004, NetScaler in 2005, XenSource in 2007 and ShareFile in 2011. As of 2015, Citrix has acquired nearly 50 companies.[65]
Products[edit]
Citrix creates software that allows the individuals of an enterprise to work and collaborate remotely regardless of device or network. The main areas the company works in are desktop and apps; Desktop as a Service (DaaS); networking and cloud; and Software as a service (SaaS).[66][67]
Desktops and apps[edit]
Citrix offers a number of products related to desktop and application virtualization. These tools allow access to Windows desktops and applications independently of the machine they are actually on, and from any device with any operating system.[68] Citrix XenApp provides application virtualization (now integrated as part of XenDesktop), and Citrix XenDesktop, Citrix VDI-in-a-Box and XenClient all provide desktop virtualization.[69][70] The DesktopPlayer for Mac allows online and offline access to Windows virtual desktops from Macs.[71] Citrix Workspace Cloud is a platform for building and delivering desktops and applications from the cloud.[72] ShareFile allows companies and organizations to sync and share files.[73] XenMobile offers mobile app and device management, Citrix Receiver is client software that allows universal access to virtual applications and desktops, and AppDNA, software that provides application migration and management.[69]
Desktop as a Service (DaaS)[edit]
Citrix technology enables service providers to provide Desktop as a Service (DaaS) offerings to their customers, including business apps and desktops.[66] These products include: Worx Mobile Apps for secure email, browser, and document sharing;[74] and Citrix Workspace Suite for mobile workspaces.[75]
Networking and cloud[edit]
Citrix products related to cloud computing and networking include Citrix XenServer for server virtualization[70] [76] and its NetScaler brand of network appliances, including WAN optimization devices, Software-Defined WAN delivery equipment, Application Delivery Controllers (ADC), Gateways, and AppFirewall web application firewall.[67] The company also has ByteMobile Adaptive Traffic Management, which aims to optimize mobile video services through traffic management, policy control and caching, and ByteMobile Insight, which provides mobile data and subscriber analytics.[77][78]
Software as a Service (SaaS)[edit]
Citrix software as a service (SaaS) products are focused on collaboration and communications. The offerings include Podio, a cloud-based collaboration service, and OpenVoice, which provides audio conferencing.[70][73]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
The company's philanthropic activities include corporate giving—such as corporate donations of in-kind gifts—and employee match programs.[79][80] Citrix provides discounted and donated products to non-profits and other qualifying organizations through TechSoup.[81] In addition, Citrix employees are allowed to take two paid volunteer days each year and participate in the company's annual "Global Day of Impact"—an event that encourages Citrix employees to volunteer in their local communities.[82][83][84]
Near its Fort Lauderdale headquarters, Citrix has provided business training to non-profit teams. In particular, the company helped a local non-profit organization launch a computer on wheels to offer training to low-income neighborhoods. In 2007, the company connected a Broward County, Florida neighborhood with Agogo, Ghana through donated technology and training. Using the technology, the "Cyber Sister Cities" work together to sell African organic honey in the United States.[85] Furthermore, the company's Raleigh office began a program called "Project Code" in 2014, which leads youth from local Boys & Girls Clubs through coding exercises and teaches them about computer science.[86]
In addition to its philanthropic activities, Citrix has donated some of its open-source technology to non-profit software organizations to continue its development and gain more contributors. Citrix gave Cloudstack to the Apache Foundation in 2012 and Xen hypervisor to the Linux Foundation in 2013.[87][88]

Citrix Systems, Inc. is an American multinational software company that provides server, application and desktop virtualization, networking, software as a service (SaaS), and cloud computing technologies. It was founded in Richardson, Texas in 1989 by Ed Iacobucci, who served as chairman until his departure in 2000.
The company began by developing remote access products for Microsoft operating systems. It licensed source code from Microsoft and has been in partnership with the company throughout its history. Citrix came to prominence in the 1990s as a leader in thin client technology, purpose built for accessing remote servers. The company had its first initial public offering in 1995 and, with few competitors, experienced large revenue increases between 1995 and 1999.
The company acquired Sequoia Software Corp. in 2001 and ExpertCity, a provider of remote desktop products, in 2003. Between 2005 and 2012, Citrix acquired more than a dozen other companies, allowing it to expand into server and desktop virtualization, as well as cloud, Infrastructure as a Service, and SaaS offerings. In 2014, Citrix acquired Framehawk and used its technology to improve the delivery of virtual desktops and applications over wireless networks. In 2016, as part of a USD$1.8 billion product deal with LogMeIn, Citrix spun off the GoTo product line into a new business entity, entitled GetGo. In 2017, Citrix completed the merger of GetGo with LogMeIn's products.
Citrix is based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and Santa Clara, California, with subsidiary operations in California and Massachusetts, and additional development centers in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, India, and the United Kingdom. It currently services around 330,000 organizations worldwide.[3] In 2014, the company was ranked 741 on the Fortune 1000. Citrix reported $3.28 billion in revenue and a net income of more than $300 million in 2015. In December 2015, Citrix employed approximately 9,500 people, but noted that its November restructure was due to eliminate nearly 700 full-time jobs. As of December 31, 2016 , Citrix had approximately 9,600 employees, including approximately 1,700 employees related to the GoTo Business.[4] David Henshall became the company's CEO in July 2017.[5]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Citrix was founded in Richardson, Texas in 1989 by former IBM developer Ed Iacobucci with $3 million in funding.[6] Following its initial setup and development, Iacobucci moved the company to his former home of Coral Springs, Florida.[6] The company's first employees were five other engineers from IBM that Iacobucci convinced to join his team. Iacobucci served as chairman of the company and Roger Roberts became the CEO of Citrix in 1990.[6][7][8] Citrix was originally named Citrus, but changed its name after an existing company claimed trademark rights.[9] The Citrix name is a portmanteau of Citrus and UNIX.[10]
The company's first product was Citrix Multiuser, an extension of OS/2 developed over two years. Citrix licensed the OS/2 source code from Microsoft,[6][7][11] and developed its own Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) protocol for Citrix Multiuser.[12] Multiuser allowed multiple users working on separate computers remote access to software on a server, even from computers not built to run OS/2.[11][13] Three days before the product launched in 1991, Microsoft announced they would be switching from OS/2 to Windows. The switch made Multiuser nearly unusable without significant changes to make it compatible with Windows or DOS. The company discussed closing in 1991, but investments from Intel, Microsoft and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers among others, allowed the company to work on a new version of Multiuser.[6][7]
Multi-Win version 2.0 was released in 1992. It was compatible with DOS applications and allowed up to five users.[14] In 1993, Citrix released a new remote applications server, WinView, which had the ability to run DOS and Windows applications.[15] By 1994, the company's yearly revenue equaled US$10 million.[6]
The company launched WinFrame, a multi-user operating system based on Microsoft’s Windows NT, in 1995.[6] The new product allowed up to 15 users and was the first thin client for Windows.[16][17]
Rise in popularity[edit]
Citrix had its initial public offering in December 1995.[18] The company's share price doubled from $15 to $30.[6] During the mid-1990s, Citrix became the leader of its growing industry with very few competitors, and the company's revenues doubled year over year between 1995 and 1999.[7]
In 1997, during negotiations to extend licenses of Windows NT 4.0 source code to Citrix, Microsoft stated it would develop its own competing software to WinFrame. Citrix stocks dropped 62 percent after the announcement.[13] Following weeks of discussions, Iacobucci was able to persuade Microsoft to agree to license Citrix technology for Windows NT Server 4.0, which resulted in Windows Terminal Server Edition in 1998.[7][8][19] This agreement allowed Citrix to keep its position in the marketplace and be NT 4.0 compatible.[13] Citrix also earned $75 million through the agreement, along with a royalty arrangement that was valued at approximately $100 million.[13][18]
Citrix released MetaFrame 1.0 in conjunction with Terminal Server Edition. Due to weaknesses in Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Terminal Server Edition worked best using the ICA protocol developed by Citrix and found in MetaFrame. This meant that Citrix technology was purchased and installed on most machines running Terminal Server Edition.[8][19]
In 1997, the company opened a new headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. It also opened offices in Sydney, London and Paris that same year.[18]
In 1998, Mark Templeton became the CEO of Citrix after serving as vice president of marketing.[18] Also in 1998, it licensed its ICA protocol to IBM and Key Tronics.[6] Citrix licensed its ICA protocol to Motorola for use in digital wireless handsets in 1999.[7]
During 1999, the thin-client model Citrix used became a software trend and the company's customers increased to 15 million.[6] Major clients included Sears, AT&T, and Chevron.[8][13] A sudden drop in stocks in 2000 led to Iacobucci leaving the company and CEO Mark Templeton being demoted to president and senior executive officer. Templeton was later reinstated in 2001.[18][20]
Expansion[edit]
In 2001 Citrix acquired the Sequoia Software Corp. for $185 million.[6] That same year it released MetaFrame XP, a new platform using MetaFrame technology.[21] This was later rebranded by Citrix as Presentation Server, in 2005.[22]
On July 9, 2002, Citrix announced a 10% job cut. At the time the company employed about 1,900 workers. After the announcement the stock hit a five-year low.[23]
Citrix acquired ExpertCity, a provider of remote desktop products, in December 2003 for $225 million in cash and stock. The acquisition was the largest for the company up to that date.[24] Through the acquisition, Citrix gained ExpertCity's existing products GoToMyPC and GoToAssist, and ExpertCity became the Citrix Online division of the company.[24][25] In 2004, the company introduced Citrix GoToMeeting.[18]
Between 2005 and 2012, the company acquired over a dozen companies that allowed them to expand in new markets. Citrix acquired acceleration hardware maker NetScaler in 2005, which allowed the company to offer optimized application delivery.[26] The company entered the server and desktop virtualization market with the purchase of XenSource in August 2007.[27] Citrix expanded cloud and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offerings in August 2010 with the acquisition of VMLogix.[28] In February 2011, Citrix entered the European Software as a Service (SaaS) market with the acquisition of Netviewer.[29][30]
The company became a leader in IaaS after the acquisition of Cloud.com, provider of cloud infrastructure for companies, in July 2011.[31] Citrix began offering VDI-in-a-box to small and medium businesses with the acquisition of Kaviza in May 2011.[32] The company acquired technology for cloud-based file sharing and storage through its purchase of ShareFile in October 2011.[33]
In May 2012, Citrix acquired Virtual Computer, maker of intelligent desktop virtualization. The technology is used in the company's XenClient Enterprise edition.[34] Citrix entered the mobile video and telecom markets in June 2012 when the company acquired ByteMobile.[35] Also in 2012, the company acquired Zenprise. Zenprise's Mobile application management (MAM) technology was released as XenMobile in February 2013.[36]
In 2007, the company opened a headquarters in Silicon Valley.[18] In 2008, the company changed the name of its Presentation Server product line to XenApp.[37] Also in 2008, Citrix announced an expanded alliance with Microsoft on desktop virtualization solutions.[18] On January 29, 2009, Citrix announced that 460 employee positions would be cut, comprising 10% of its workforce.[38] In August 2010, Citrix announced a partnership with Google to bring the company's products to Chrome OS devices.[39][40]
Citrix acquired Framehawk in January 2014 in order to use the company's technology to improve the delivery of virtual desktops and applications over wireless networks, including cellular, where speed and quality may be poor.[41] In May 2014, Citrix acquired Scalextreme[42] to bolster its cloud capabilities for its core business unit of XenDesktop and Xenapp such as auto scaling, patching and automation of complex deployments from the cloud.
On January 29, 2015, Citrix announced that 700 full-time and 200 contractor positions would be eliminated.[43] This constituted about 10% of its workforce. The cuts were expected to save between $90 and $100 million a year. Two hundred of the layoffs occurred in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where the company is headquartered.[44]
The company had 10,081 employees as of February 2015.[45] In December 2015, Citrix employed approximately 9,500 people, but noted that its November restructure was due to eliminate nearly 700 full-time jobs.[2]
On July 14, 2015, Citrix added full support for Windows 10 to its desktop virtualization products.[46]
Recent history[edit]
Citrix reported net income of $251.7 million in 2014, down from $339.5 million in 2013.[47] In July 2015, the company announced several changes to its board of directors, including Robert Calderoni's becoming executive chairman and adding Jesse Cohn as a senior partner of activist hedge fund Elliott Management.[48] That same month the company announced that president and CEO Mark Templeton would retire after a replacement was found,[49] and on October 21, the company named its executive chairman, Robert Calderoni, as interim president and CEO.[50]
In January 2016, Kirill Tatarinov, a former Microsoft executive, was named the president and CEO of Citrix and joined the company's board. Calderoni remained executive chairman of the board.[51]
In July 2016, as part of a deal with Boston-based SaaS company LogMeIn, Citrix announced it had spun off its GoTo product line, which included GoToMeeting, GoToWebinar, GoToWebcast, GoToTraining, GoToAssist and GoToMyPC, into a wholly owned subsidiary called GetGo.[52] In February 2017, Citrix completed a merger through which GetGo became a subsidiary of LogMeIn. The transaction was valued at approximately $1.8 billion.[53]
In July 2017, David Henshall replaced Tatarinov as the company's CEO.[5]

These tools allow access to Windows desktops and applications independently of the machine they are actually on, and from any device with any operating system.[68] Citrix XenApp provides application virtualization (now integrated as part of XenDesktop), and Citrix XenDesktop, Citrix VDI-in-a-Box and XenClient all provide desktop virtualization.[69][70] The DesktopPlayer for Mac allows online and offline access to Windows virtual desktops from Macs.[71] Citrix Workspace Cloud is a platform for building and delivering desktops and applications from the cloud.[72] ShareFile allows companies and organizations to sync and share files.[73] XenMobile offers mobile app and device management, Citrix Receiver is client software that allows universal access to virtual applications and desktops, and AppDNA, software that provides application migration and management.[69]
Desktop as a Service (DaaS)[edit]
Citrix technology enables service providers to provide Desktop as a Service (DaaS) offerings to their customers, including business apps and desktops.[66] These products include: Worx Mobile Apps for secure email, browser, and document sharing;[74] and Citrix Workspace Suite for mobile workspaces.[75]
Networking and cloud[edit]
Citrix products related to cloud computing and networking include Citrix XenServer for server virtualization[70] [76] and its NetScaler brand of network appliances, including WAN optimization devices, Software-Defined WAN delivery equipment, Application Delivery Controllers (ADC), Gateways, and AppFirewall web application firewall.[67] The company also has ByteMobile Adaptive Traffic Management, which aims to optimize mobile video services through traffic management, policy control and caching, and ByteMobile Insight, which provides mobile data and subscriber analytics.[77][78]
Software as a Service (SaaS)[edit]
Citrix software as a service (SaaS) products are focused on collaboration and communications. The offerings include Podio, a cloud-based collaboration service, and OpenVoice, which provides audio conferencing.[70][73]
Corporate responsibility[edit]
The company's philanthropic activities include corporate giving—such as corporate donations of in-kind gifts—and employee match programs.[79][80] Citrix provides discounted and donated products to non-profits and other qualifying organizations through TechSoup.[81] In addition, Citrix employees are allowed to take two paid volunteer days each year and participate in the company's annual "Global Day of Impact"—an event that encourages Citrix employees to volunteer in their local communities.[82][83][84]
Near its Fort Lauderdale headquarters, Citrix has provided business training to non-profit teams. In particular, the company helped a local non-profit organization launch a computer on wheels to offer training to low-income neighborhoods. In 2007, the company connected a Broward County, Florida neighborhood with Agogo, Ghana through donated technology and training. Using the technology, the "Cyber Sister Cities" work together to sell African organic honey in the United States.[85] Furthermore, the company's Raleigh office began a program called "Project Code" in 2014, which leads youth from local Boys & Girls Clubs through coding exercises and teaches them about computer science.[86]
In addition to its philanthropic activities, Citrix has donated some of its open-source technology to non-profit software organizations to continue its development and gain more contributors. Citrix gave Cloudstack to the Apache Foundation in 2012 and Xen hypervisor to the Linux Foundation in 2013.[87][88]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
