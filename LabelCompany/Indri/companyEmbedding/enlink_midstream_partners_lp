Open Championship: Rory McIlroy 'ecstatic' after second-round 68



by Ollie Sutton | 
	  July  22, 2017 | 22:55	  









Rory McIlroy is confident he can put injury problems and a frustrating run of form behind him to mount a serious challenge for a fifth major title at this week's British Open.
If McIlroy had to be reminded, so did everyone else. As you may remember, he righted the ship with four back-nine birdies to shoot 71, and he didn't cool off this morning.Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland on the 18th hole during Day 2 of the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open Golf Championship at Portstewart Golf Club in Portstewart, Co Derry.From the moment McIlroy struck an immaculate three-wood shot off the first tee yesterday, it was clear that the good vibes had not gone AWOL overnight. Much like Thursday at the Open, iffy shots triggered harsh consequences."I don't know which is going to be harder, winning the Claret Jug again or going skydiving afterward because that thought scares me a little bit", the deadpan Swede said Tuesday. And I went with those today and it worked."That's all it takes to keep a round going, and to see those putts go in on ten and 11 gives me confidence going into the weekend".What was in McIlroy's head before that is a matter of some conjecture. A fourth missed cut in five tournaments beckoned.Consider this. McIlroy was plus-five after six holes of a 72-hole event.But the scolding from Fitzgerald found its intended target.Birdies on one, three and six helped him scale the leaderboard to move within the top 10 for his front nine.

					The Warner Bros . presentation at Hall H kicks off at 11:30 am and is moderated by Talking Dead's Chris Hardwick. An entire range of emotions (Cyborg = zen, Flash = imperious, Wonder Woman = Mona Lisa we-don't-know-what).
				"They're both huge rounds for very different reasons".We did say he would get back to his best, and are delighted he showed something close to the level of performance his fans - and McIlroy himself - expect, given his innate talent.If so, a lot of the credit goes to Fitzgerald. He then received an earful from caddie J.P. Fitzgerald on the sixth tee.McIlroy said: "I was a little indecisive out there but I finally got it going". So I kept a good, positive attitude, and it turned around for me, thankfully. And he knows what to say out there and what not to say."The long iron I hit into the 17th was nearly like a validation that you're fighting for it and you're mentally where you need to be".The 146th British Open at Royal Birkdale, which started Thursday on England's northwest coast, promises to be one of the most open Opens in years.With more rain and heavier winds in the forecast for Friday, McIlroy won't have much room for error.McIlroy came into this year's Open looking scarcely like the man who blitzed the field in this same tournament in 2014 at Royal Liverpool.And after finishing with a 68 McIlroy is thrilled to be where he is going into the weekend. Though he was just 1-over in the wind on the back nine in his second round, he didn't have a putt for birdie until the 17th hole and had to rely on his short game to finish off his round. That left him one over, six shots back.The American Rickie Fowler, ranked No. 10 in the world, said, "I love playing in the wind", and followed a decent 71 with a commendable 71.

Investors






Companies keep finding ways to unlock resources. We keep finding ways to move them.






In March 2014, Crosstex Energy and Devon Energy combined substantially all of Devon’s U.S. midstream assets with Crosstex’s assets to create EnLink Midstream Partners, LP, and EnLink Midstream, LLC, collectively “EnLink Midstream.” Together, we have formed one of the largest midstream businesses in the industry. Our increased scale and diversification allows us to capitalize on the significant opportunities in the midstream industry, and with Devon’s strong upstream sponsorship, EnLink Midstream is well positioned for stable long-term growth.
There are two ways to invest in EnLink Midstream: through the purchase of units in EnLink Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE: ENLK), a master limited partnership (MLP), or the purchase of shares in EnLink Midstream, LLC (NYSE: ENLC), the general partner. This business model provides institutions that are unable to make direct MLP investments with a way to participate in EnLink’s growth through common share ownership of the general partner.

Let’s Make Some Connections
As a leading midstream company, EnLink Midstream uses our resources and innovation to help connect energy producers with consuming markets. We operate pipelines and other assets that utilize road, rail, and water to transport natural gas, natural gas liquids, and crude oil across North America.
We own and operate storage and processing facilities, holding and preparing these natural resources for their end use. We transport them from the wellhead all the way to the companies that fuel automobiles and provide power to homes and businesses.
The sidebar links provide access to information about our pipeline service, informational postings, and standardized forms, as well as measurement information through our PGAS system.

Investors






Companies keep finding ways to unlock resources. We keep finding ways to move them.






In March 2014, Crosstex Energy and Devon Energy combined substantially all of Devon’s U.S. midstream assets with Crosstex’s assets to create EnLink Midstream Partners, LP, and EnLink Midstream, LLC, collectively “EnLink Midstream.” Together, we have formed one of the largest midstream businesses in the industry. Our increased scale and diversification allows us to capitalize on the significant opportunities in the midstream industry, and with Devon’s strong upstream sponsorship, EnLink Midstream is well positioned for stable long-term growth.
There are two ways to invest in EnLink Midstream: through the purchase of units in EnLink Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE: ENLK), a master limited partnership (MLP), or the purchase of shares in EnLink Midstream, LLC (NYSE: ENLC), the general partner. This business model provides institutions that are unable to make direct MLP investments with a way to participate in EnLink’s growth through common share ownership of the general partner.

 DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      The EnLink Midstream companies, EnLink Midstream Partners, LP
      (NYSE:ENLK) (the Partnership) and EnLink Midstream, LLC (NYSE:ENLC) (the
      General Partner) (together “EnLink”), today announced that the
      Partnership completed its previously announced acquisition of Coronado
      Midstream Holdings LLC (“Coronado”), which owns natural gas gathering
      and processing facilities in the Permian Basin, for approximately $600
      million, subject to certain adjustments.

      EnLink,” said Barry E. Davis, EnLink President and Chief Executive
      Officer. “We have identified and executed on strategic growth
      opportunities to expand our asset base in the region through over $1
      billion of capital invested since 2011. These assets come with an
      experienced management team that is highly respected and known for
      outstanding performance, and we welcome Coronado’s talented employees

EnLink Midstream Signs Definitive Agreement to Acquire Coronado Midstream

 DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
The EnLink Midstream companies, EnLink Midstream Partners, LP
(NYSE:ENLK) (the Partnership) and EnLink Midstream, LLC (NYSE:ENLC) (the
General Partner) (together “EnLink”), today announced that the
Partnership signed a definitive agreement to acquire Coronado Midstream
Holdings LLC (“Coronado”), which owns natural gas gathering and
processing facilities in the Permian Basin, for approximately $600
million, subject to certain adjustments.


Coronado operates three cryogenic gas processing plants and a gas
gathering system in the North Midland Basin including approximately 270
miles of gathering pipelines, 175 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of
processing capacity and 35,000 horsepower of compression. Construction
of an additional 100 MMcf/d of processing capacity and gathering system
expansions of the Coronado system are currently underway. Coronado's key
assets have been constructed within the past five years and the system
has current inlet volumes of approximately 100 MMcf/d. EnLink plans to
connect the Coronado system with its Bearkat system to create a
multi-county rich gas gathering and processing system to create
optimization opportunities for its customers and its product marketing
services.


The owners of Coronado will receive $240 million in cash, $180 million
of Partnership common units and $180 million of a new class of
Partnership common units, subject to certain adjustments. The
Partnership will be able to pay distributions on the new class of
Partnership common units in cash or in additional common units of such
new class, at the Partnership’s election. The new class of Partnership
common units will be entitled to receive distributions equal to those
paid on the Partnership common units currently outstanding. After five
quarters of distributions have been paid following the closing of the
transaction, or earlier at the Partnership’s election, the new class of
common units will convert into the same class of common units that are
currently outstanding.


The Coronado system is underpinned by long-term contracts, which include
the dedication of production from over 190,000 acres. Coronado’s key
producer customers include Reliance Energy, Inc. (Reliance), Diamondback
Energy, Inc. (Diamondback), and RSP Permian, Inc. (RSP Permian).
Reliance is currently the largest owner of Coronado, with affiliates of
both Diamondback and RSP Permian owning the remainder of Coronado.


“This transaction builds on EnLink’s growing midstream platform in West
Texas,” said
Barry E. Davis
, EnLink President and Chief Executive
Officer. “The Coronado assets are located in the core of the North
Midland Basin and are supported by the region’s most focused and active
producers. By combining Coronado with our recent LPC acquisition and our
existing footprint, we have the opportunity to create tremendous value
for our producer customers by linking our gas gathering, processing and
crude oil logistics operations to provide a full-service midstream
solution.”


“In just over four months, we have announced approximately $1 billion of
acquisitions, which is consistent with our growth strategy to expand our
platform in key producing areas,” Davis said. “EnLink is a strong
vehicle for sustainable growth, due in large part to our current
financial position, which allows us to effectively expand in times like
these.”


Economics in the North Midland Basin are among the most favorable of all
oil-producing regions in the United States. The region has seen a rapid
transition to horizontal drilling, with producers targeting the Lower
Spraberry, Wolfcamp B, and Wolfcamp D zones among other prospective
intervals. Recent well results from Coronado’s producer customers, as
well as other producers, indicate outstanding resource potential in the
area.


“We have assembled a strong acreage position in the North Midland Basin
that will continue to serve as a key driver of production growth for
many years,” said
Travis D. Stice
, Chief Executive Officer of
Diamondback and Viper Energy Partners. “We are excited about the
development potential for multiple horizontal targets within the area
that has and will continue to serve the Coronado system in the future.
We have been involved with Coronado since its formation and grown
together as business partners. We look forward to working together with
its new owners to support each other’s growth aspirations.”


“Reliance has been focused on expanding and de-risking its acreage
around the Coronado system since 2007,” said
Gary D. McKinney
, President
of Reliance. “We believe we are located in some of the best areas of the
Midland basin and we’re excited about our recent horizontal well results
in the region.”


“RSP Permian has built a premier acreage position in the Northern
Midland Basin that will continue to serve as a cornerstone to our strong
production growth and attractive rates of return,” said
Steve Gray
,
Chief Executive Officer of RSP Permian. “We have relied on Coronado
throughout our development and look forward to working with its new
owners in the future.”


EnLink expects the acquisition of Coronado to be neutral to
distributable cash flow per unit at both the Partnership and the General
Partner in the near-term given the current market environment
and taking into consideration the producers’ current drilling plans.
Over the next few years, EnLink expects increased activity around
Coronado’s system will generate significant accretion in distributable
cash flow per unit. EnLink expects its total investment will be
approximately seven to eight times Coronado’s adjusted EBITDA with the
timing dependent on the recovery of commodity prices and an increase in
producer activity, taking into consideration expected additional capital
investments of $400 million to $600 million. This does not include
synergies with EnLink’s existing Permian assets and the potential for
expansion of the combined systems by securing new customers or
additional dedicated acreage.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Please read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. For more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following information, please read the notes to the financial statements included in this report.  The historical financial statements included in this report reflect (1) for periods prior to March 7, 2014, the assets, liabilities and operations of EnLink Midstream Holdings, LP Predecessor (the "Predecessor"), the predecessor to EnLink Midstream Holdings, LP ("Midstream Holdings"), which is the historical predecessor of EnLink Midstream Partners, LP and (2) for periods on or after March 7, 2014, the results of operations of EnLink Midstream Partners, LP after giving effect to the Business Combination discussed under "Devon Energy Transaction" below . The Predecessor was comprised of all of the U.S. midstream assets and operations of Devon Energy Corporation ("Devon") prior to the Business Combination, including its 38.75% interest in Gulf Coast Fractionators ("GCF"). However, in connection with the Business Combination, only the Predecessor's systems serving the Barnett, Cana-Woodford and Arkoma-Woodford Shales in Texas and Oklahoma, as well as the economic burdens and benefits of the 38.75% interest in GCF, were contributed to Midstream Holdings, effective as of March 7, 2014.  All references in this section to the "Partnership", as well as the terms "our," "we," "us" and "its"(1) for periods prior to March 7, 2014 refer to the Predecessor and (2) for periods on or after March 7, 2014 refer to EnLink Midstream Partners, LP, together with its consolidated subsidiaries including EnLink Midstream Operating, LP (the "Operating Partnership") and EnLink Oklahoma Gas Processing, LP ("EnLink Oklahoma T.O.").EnLink Oklahoma T.O. is sometimes used herein to refer to EnLink Oklahoma Gas Processing, LP itself or EnLink Oklahoma Gas Processing, LP, together with its consolidated subsidiaries.  Overview  We are a Delaware limited partnership formed on July 12, 2002. We primarily focus on providing midstream energy services, including gathering, processing, transmission, fractionation, storage, condensate stabilization, brine services and marketing to producers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate. Our midstream energy asset network includes approximately 11,000 miles of pipelines, 20 natural gas processing plants, 7 fractionators, barge and rail terminals, product storage facilities, purchasing and marketing capabilities, brine disposal wells, a crude oil trucking fleet, and equity investments in certain private midstream companies. We manage and report our activities primarily according to the nature of activity and geography. We have five reportable segments, which include the:  � Texas Segment. The Texas segment includes our natural gas gathering, processing and transmission activities in north Texas and the Permian Basin in west Texas;  � Oklahoma Segment. The Oklahoma segment includes our natural gas gathering, processing and transmission activities in Cana-Woodford, Arkoma-Woodford, Northern Oklahoma Woodford, Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher Counties ("STACK"), South Central Oklahoma Oil Province ("SCOOP") and Central Northern Oklahoma Woodford ("CNOW") Shale areas;  � Louisiana Segment. The Louisiana segment includes our natural gas pipelines, natural gas processing plants, storage facilities and NGL assets located in Louisiana;  � Crude and Condensate Segment. The Crude and Condensate segment includes our Ohio River Valley ("ORV") crude oil, condensate and brine disposal activities in the Utica and Marcellus Shales, our condensate stabilization and natural gas compression stations in the Utica and Marcellus Shales, our crude oil operations in the Permian Basin and our crude oil activities associated with the Victoria Express Pipeline and related truck terminal and storage assets ("VEX") located in the Eagle Ford Shale; and  � Corporate Segment. The Corporate segment includes our unconsolidated affiliate investments in Howard Energy Partners ("HEP"), our ownership in the Cedar Cove JV in Oklahoma and our contractual right to the economic burdens and benefits associated with Devon's ownership interest in GCF in south Texas and our general partnership property and expenses.  Table of Contents  We manage our operations by focusing on gross operating margin because our business is generally to gather, process, transport or market natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate using our assets for a fee. We earn our fees through various contractual arrangements, which include stated fixed-fee contract arrangements or arrangements where we purchase and resell commodities in connection with providing the related service and earn a net margin as our fee. While our transactions vary in form, the essential element of each transaction is the use of our assets to transport a product or provide a processed product to an end-user at the tailgate of the plant, barge terminal or pipeline. We define gross operating margin as operating revenue minus cost of sales. Gross operating margin is a non-GAAP financial measure and is explained in greater detail under "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below. Approximately 97% of our gross operating margin was derived from fee-based services with no direct commodity exposure for the year ended December 31, 2016. We reflect revenue as "Product sales" and "Midstream services" on the consolidated statements of operations.  Our gross operating margins are determined primarily by the volumes of:  � natural gas gathered, transported, purchased and sold through our pipeline systems;  � natural gas processed at our processing facilities;  � NGLs handled at our fractionation facilities;  � crude oil and condensate handled at our crude terminals;  � crude oil and condensate gathered, transported, purchased and sold;  � brine disposed; and  � condensate stabilized.  We generate revenues from eight primary sources:  � gathering and transporting natural gas and NGLs on the pipeline systems we own;  � processing natural gas at our processing plants;  � fractionating and marketing recovered NGLs;  � providing compression services;  � providing crude oil and condensate gathering, transportation and terminal services;  � providing condensate stabilization services;  � providing brine disposal services; and  � providing gas, crude, and NGL storage.  We typically gather or transport gas owned by others through our facilities for a fee. We also buy natural gas from producers, plants or shippers at either a fixed discount to a market index or a percentage of the market index, and then transport and resell the natural gas at the same market index. The fixed discount difference to a market index represents the fee for using our assets. We attempt to execute substantially all purchases and sales concurrently, or we enter into a future delivery obligation, thereby establishing the basis for the fee we will receive for each natural gas transaction. Our gathering and transportation fee related to a percentage of the index price can be adversely affected by declines in the price of natural gas. We are also party to certain long-term gas sales commitments that we satisfy through supplies purchased under long-term gas purchase agreements. When we enter into those arrangements, our sales obligations generally match our purchase obligations. However, over time, the supplies that we have under contract may decline due to reduced drilling or other causes, and we may be required to satisfy the sales obligations by buying additional gas at prices that may exceed the prices received under the sales commitments. In our purchase/sale transactions, the resale price is generally based on the same index at which the gas was purchased.  On occasion, we have entered into certain purchase/sale transactions in which the purchase price is based on a production-area index and the sales price is based on a market-area index, and we capture the difference in the indices (also referred to as "basis spread"), less the transportation expenses from the two areas, as our fee. Changes in the basis spread can increase or decrease our margins or potentially result in losses. For example, we are a party to one contract associated with our north Texas operations with a term to 2019 to supply approximately 150,000 MMBtu/d of gas. We buy gas for this contract on several different production-area indices and sell the gas into a different market area index. We realize a cash loss on the delivery of gas under this contract each month based on current prices. The fair value of this performance obligation was recorded based on forecasted discounted cash obligations in excess of market prices under this gas delivery contract. As of December 31, 2016, the balance sheet reflects a liability of $44.8 million related  Table of Contents  to this performance obligation. Narrower basis spreads in recent periods have increased the losses on this contract, and greater losses on this contract could occur in future periods if these conditions persist or become worse.  We typically transport and fractionate or store NGLs owned by others for a fee based on the volume of NGLs transported and fractionated or stored. We also buy mixed NGLs from our suppliers at a fixed discount to market indices for the component NGLs with a deduction for our fractionation fee. We subsequently sell the fractionated NGL products based on the same index-based prices. The operating results of our NGL fractionation business are dependent upon the volume of mixed NGLs fractionated and the level of fractionation fees charged. With our fractionation business, we also have the opportunity for product upgrades for each of the discrete NGL products. The fees we earn on the product upgrade from this fractionation business are higher during periods with higher liquids prices.  We typically gather or transport crude oil and condensate owned by others by rail, truck, pipeline and barge facilities for a fee. We also buy crude oil and condensate from a producer at a fixed discount to a market index and then transport and resell the crude oil and condensate at the same market index. We execute substantially all purchases and sales concurrently, thereby establishing the fee we will receive for each crude oil and condensate transaction.  We realize gross operating margins from our processing services primarily through different contractual arrangements: processing margins ("margin"), percentage of liquids ("POL"), percentage of proceeds ("POP") or fixed-fee based. Under margin contract arrangements, our gross operating margins are higher during periods of high liquid prices relative to natural gas prices. Gross operating margin results under POL contracts are impacted only by the value of the liquids produced with margins higher during periods of higher liquids prices. Gross operating margin results under POP contracts are impacted only by the value of the natural gas and liquids produced with margins higher during periods of higher natural gas and liquids prices. Under fixed-fee based contracts, our gross operating margins are driven by throughput volume. See "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk-Commodity Price Risk."  Operating expenses are costs directly associated with the operations of a particular asset. Among the most significant of these costs are those associated with direct labor and supervision, property insurance, property taxes, repair and maintenance expenses, contract services and utilities. These costs are normally fairly stable across broad volume ranges and therefore do not normally increase or decrease significantly in the short term with increases or decreases in the volume of gas, liquids, crude oil and condensate moved through or by the asset.  Our general and administrative expenses are dictated by the terms of our partnership agreement. These expenses include the costs of employee, officer and director compensation and benefits properly allocable to us, fees, services and other transaction costs related to acquisitions, and all other expenses necessary or appropriate to the conduct of business and allocable to us. Our partnership agreement provides that our general partner determines the expenses that are allocable to us in any reasonable manner determined by our general partner at its sole discretion.  Recent Growth Developments  Acquisitions and Expansion  EnLink Oklahoma T.O. Acquisition and Expansion. On January 7, 2016, we and ENLC acquired an 84% and 16% interest, respectively, in EnLink Oklahoma T.O. for approximately $1.4 billion. The first installment of $1.02 billion for the acquisition was paid at closing. The second installment of $250.0 million was paid on January 6, 2017, and the final installment of $250.0 million is due no later than January 7, 2018. The installment payables are valued net of discount within the total purchase price.  The first installment consisted of approximately $1.02 billion and was funded by  Table of Contents  The EnLink Oklahoma T.O. assets serve gathering and processing needs in the growing STACK and CNOW plays in Oklahoma and are supported by long-term, fixed-fee contracts with acreage dedications that, at the time of acquisition, had a weighted-average term of approximately 15 years. The EnLink Oklahoma T.O. assets are strategically located in the core areas of the STACK and CNOW plays and include:  � Chisholm Plant. The Chisholm Plant, which serves the STACK play, is a cryogenic gas processing plant with a capacity of 120 MMcf/d. The plant is connected to a 350-mile, low- and high-pressure gathering system with compression facilities, including gathering pipelines and compression facilities completed by us during 2016.  During 2016, we commenced construction on a new cryogenic gas processing plant, referred to as Chisholm II, that will provide an additional 200 MMcf/d of processing capacity and will be tied to new and existing pipelines in the STACK and SCOOP play. Chisholm II is scheduled to be completed during the first quarter of 2017. The new capacity is supported by long-term contracts.  Additionally, we expect to commence construction on Chisholm III in April 2017. Chisholm III will provide an additional 200 MMcf/d of processing capacity and will be tied to new and existing pipelines in the STACK and SCOOP play. Construction is scheduled to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2017.  � Battle Ridge Plant. The Battle Ridge Plant is a cryogenic gas processing plant located in the CNOW play with a current capacity of 75 MMcf/d. The plant is connected to a 250-mile, low and high-pressure gathering system with compression facilities.  � Connecting Pipeline. A 42-mile, 16-inch high-pressure header pipeline with a total capacity of 150 MMcf/d was constructed to connect the Chisolm and Battle Ridge systems. The pipeline went into service in March 2016 and provides customers with additional operational flexibility.  Organic Growth  Greater Chickadee Crude Oil Gathering System. We have a new crude oil gathering system in Upton and Midland counties, Texas in the Permian Basin that we refer to as "Greater Chickadee." Greater Chickadee includes approximately 185 miles of high- and low-pressure pipelines that will transport crude oil volumes to several major market outlets and other key hub centers in the Midland, Texas area. Greater Chickadee also includes the construction of 50,000 Bbls of crude oil storage and a truck injection station to maximize shipping and delivery options for our producer customers. The initial phase of our Greater Chickadee transportation service began in November 2016. Additional construction is ongoing, and we expect full service capabilities in the first quarter of 2017.  Cedar Cove Joint Venture. On November 9, 2016, we formed the Cedar Cove JV with Kinder Morgan, Inc., consisting of gathering and compression assets in Blaine County, Oklahoma, located in the heart of the STACK play. The gathering system has a capacity of 25 MMcf/d with over 50,000 gross acres of dedications and ties into our existing Oklahoma assets. All gas gathered by the Cedar Cove JV will be processed at our central Oklahoma processing system. We committed to contribute $40.0 million in cash in exchange for 30% ownership of the Cedar Cove JV, and as of December 31, 2016, we have contributed $28.8 million. Thereafter, we and Kinder Morgan, Inc. will contribute additional capital in proportion to our respective ownership interests to fund operations.  Delaware Basin Joint Venture. On August 1, 2016, we formed the Delaware Basin JV with NGP to operate and expand our natural gas, natural gas liquids and crude oil midstream assets in the liquids-rich Delaware Basin. The Delaware Basin JV is owned 50.1% by us and 49.9% by NGP. We contributed approximately $221.0 million of existing assets, net of depreciation, to the Delaware Basin JV and committed an additional $285.0 million in capital to fund potential future development projects and potential acquisitions. NGP committed an aggregate of approximately $400.0 million of capital, including an initial contribution of $114.3 million, which the Delaware Basin JV distributed to us at the formation of the joint venture to reimburse us for capital spent to the date of formation on existing assets and ongoing projects. In addition to the initial contributions, we and NGP contributed $30.2 million and $30.1 million, respectively, to the Delaware Basin JV for the year ended December 31, 2016. As part of this agreement, NGP granted us call rights beginning in 2021 to acquire increasing portions of NGP's interest in the joint venture at a price based upon a predetermined valuation methodology.  Table of Contents  Lobo II Natural Gas Gathering and Processing Facility. In October 2016, we completed construction of a new cryogenic gas processing plant located in the Delaware Basin (our "Lobo II plant") with initial capacity of 60 MMcf/d. The Lobo II expansion also included the construction of a 75-mile gathering system located in Texas and New Mexico. Construction on the Texas portion of the gathering system was completed in October 2016, and the remaining New Mexico pipeline was completed in the first quarter of 2017. The Lobo II facilities are part of the Delaware Basin JV.  Riptide Processing Plant. In April 2016, we completed construction of the Riptide processing plant in the Permian Basin. The plant provides 100 MMcf/d of processing capacity and is tied to approximately 50 miles of new gathering pipeline, all of which is connected to our Midland Energy Gathering Area assets (the "MEGA system").  Ascension Joint Venture. We have formed a 50/50 joint venture named Ascension Pipeline Company, LLC (the "Ascension JV") with a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum Corporation ("Marathon Petroleum") to build a new 30-mile NGL pipeline connecting our existing Riverside fractionation and terminal complex to Marathon Petroleum's Garyville refinery located on the Mississippi River. We commenced construction of the pipeline during 2016 and will operate the pipeline upon completion, which is currently estimated to be during the second quarter of 2017. This bolt-on project to our Cajun-Sibon NGL system is supported by long-term, fee-based contracts with Marathon Petroleum.  Sale of Non-Core Assets  In December 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell our ownership interest in HEP for approximately $193.1 million, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. We expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an impairment loss of $20.1 million to reduce the carrying value of our investment to the expected sales price.  In December 2016, we sold the North Texas Pipeline (the "NTPL"), a 140-mile natural gas transportation pipeline, for $84.6 million. We maintain capacity on the NTPL at competitive rates and at levels sufficient to support current and expected operations. We recorded a loss related to the sale of $13.4 million.  Issuance of Senior Notes  On July 14, 2016, we issued $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.850% senior notes due 2026 (the "2026 Notes") at a price to the public of 99.859% of their face value. The 2026 Notes mature on July 15, 2026. Interest payments on the 2026 Notes are payable on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning January 15, 2017. Net proceeds of approximately $495.7 million were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and for general partnership purposes.  Issuance of Common Units  Equity Distribution Agreement. In November 2014, we entered into an equity distribution agreement (the "BMO EDA") with BMO Capital Markets Corp. and certain other sales agents to sell up to $350.0 million in aggregate gross sales of our common units from time to time through an "at the market" equity offering program. We may also sell common units to any sales agent as principal for the sales agent's own account at a price agreed upon at the time of sale. We have no obligation to sell any of the common units under the BMO EDA and may at any time suspend solicitation and offers under the BMO EDA.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold an aggregate of 10.0 million common units under the BMO EDA, generating proceeds of approximately $167.5 million (net of approximately $1.7 million of commissions). We used the net proceeds for general partnership purposes. As of December 31, 2016, approximately $147.8 million remains available to be issued under the BMO EDA.  Issuance of Preferred Units  On January 7, 2016, we issued an aggregate of 50,000,000 Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Units representing limited partner interests in our partnership (the "Preferred Units") to Enfield Holdings, L.P. ("Enfield") in a private placement (the "Private Placement") for a cash purchase price of $15.00 per Preferred Unit (the "Issue Price"), resulting in net proceeds of approximately $724.1 million after fees and deductions. Proceeds from the Private Placement were used to fund the EnLink Oklahoma T.O. acquisition.  Table of Contents  The Preferred Units are convertible into our common units on a one-for-one basis, subject to certain adjustments, at any time after the record date for the quarter ending June 30, 2017 (a) in full, at our option, if the volume weighted average price of a common unit over the 30-trading day period ending two trading days prior to the conversion date (the "Conversion VWAP") is greater than 150% of the Issue Price or (b) in full or in part, at Enfield's option. In addition, upon certain events involving a change of control of our general partner or the managing member of ENLC, all of the Preferred Units will automatically convert into a number of common units equal to the greater of (i) the number of common units into which the Preferred Units would then convert and (ii) the number of Preferred Units to be converted multiplied by an amount equal to (x) 140% of the Issue Price divided by (y) the Conversion VWAP.  Enfield receives quarterly distributions, subject to certain adjustments, equal to (x) during the quarter ending March 31, 2016 through the quarter ending June 30, 2017, an annual rate of 8.5% on the Issue Price payable in-kind in the form of additional Preferred Units and (y) thereafter, at an annual rate of 7.5% on the Issue Price payable in cash (the "Cash Distribution Component") plus an in-kind distribution equal to the greater of (A) an annual rate of 1.0% of the Issue Price and (B) an amount equal to (i) the excess, if any, of the distribution that would have been payable had the Preferred Units converted into common units over the Cash Distribution Component, divided by (ii) the Issue Price. Distributions on the Preferred Units for the three months ended March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30,2016, were paid-in kind through the issuance of 992,445, 1,083,589, and 1,106,616 Preferred Units on May 12, 2016, August 11, 2016, and November 10, 2016, respectively. A distribution on the Preferred Units was declared for the three months ended December 31, 2016, which will result in the issuance of 1,130,131 additional Preferred Units on February 13, 2016. Income was allocated to the Preferred Units in an amount equal to the quarterly distribution with respect to the period earned. For the year ended December 31, 2016, $69.9 million of income was allocated to the Preferred Units, respectively.  Acquisitions in 2014 and 2015:  � On November 1, 2014, we acquired, from affiliates of Chevron Corporation, Gulf Coast natural gas pipeline assets predominantly located in southern Louisiana, together with 100% of the voting interests in certain entities, for approximately $231.5 million.  � In 2014, we completed the drop down of certain equity interests in EnLink Appalachian Compression, LLC (formerly, E2 Appalachian Compression, LLC) and E2 Energy Services, LLC (collectively, "E2") from ENLC.  � On January 31, 2015, we acquired 100% of the voting equity interests of LPC Crude Oil Marketing LLC ("LPC"), which has crude oil gathering, transportation and marketing operations in the Permian Basin, for approximately $108.1 million.  � On March 16, 2015, we acquired 100% of the voting equity interests in Coronado Midstream Holdings LLC ("Coronado"), which owns natural gas gathering and processing facilities in the Permian Basin, for approximately $600.3 million.  � On October 1, 2015, we acquired 100% of the voting equity interests in a subsidiary of Matador Resources Company ("Matador"), which has gathering and processing assets operations in the Delaware Basin, for approximately $141.3 million.  � Prior to November 2015, we co-owned the Deadwood natural gas processing plant with a subsidiary of Apache Corporation ("Apache").
