As a boy in Iran








“Our family escaped Iran on the eve of the Iranian Revolution in 1978, when I was 9. We moved in with my uncle in Tarrytown. For the grown-ups, it was a difficult transition. The kids were able to party together, so it was fun.”








“Barry Diller was a client. He made a hostile offer for Paramount when he was at QVC, and I thought to myself, That’s the guy I want to work for.”








“We announced the deal to acquire Expedia, and before it closed, the Sept. 11 attacks happened. We had the opportunity to pull out. Barry said, ‘People are going to keep living and traveling, so we’re in.’ ”












“My wife and I got married on 12/12/12 in Las Vegas, and she was wearing a Slayer T-shirt. That tells you what kind of woman I’m lucky enough to be with. We have four kids.”








“We’re testing new Expedia functionality for Amazon’s Alexa. To be able to answer ‘I want to go to New York next weekend on a direct flight with two adjoining seats’ is a challenge and an opportunity.”










 


























Visiting London as a 4-year-old with his cousins, 1973








“My father had to go back to Iran to take care of his father when I was 13 and was detained for six years before returning. My mom was raising three kids without a dad.”








“I was a complete failure. The cost of streaming content was higher than any advertising dollars you could earn. The better you did, the more you lost.”











As the superhero Flash at an Expedia party, 2014








“What some Americans don’t appreciate is how strong the brand of the American dream is around the world. I’m an example of how powerful that product is. And now, our president is trying to pull it away from people of a certain origin and religious belief. I find that sad and very much against what our founders set out to build.”











With Diller at a conference, 2016

Expedia boss Dara Khosrowshahi on the new breed of disrupters

 Dara Khosrowshahi wants Expedia to be a real-time travel service powered by voice assistants © Matt Lutton 

When Dara Khosrowshahi first heard of the company now called Expedia, it was the turn of the millennium and the height of the dotcom bubble. He was working for IAC, the US media company, and eyeing Expedia because it was a big disrupter in the travel sector. One industry after another was upended by digital technology.
Some 17 years later, the roles are reversed. Expedia, now the biggest online travel agency in the US, is at risk of being disrupted — and Mr Khosrowshahi’s job is to prevent that. With the rise of the sharing economy and new threats from companies such as Airbnb, the way people travel is changing.
But Mr Khosrowshahi has been through difficult disruptions before. “The years that I have been here have not all been smooth sailing,” he says.
After he became chief executive in 2005, Expedia was hit by the financial crisis, then had to invest heavily in technology to compete with other travel search engines. “Desperation sometimes drives innovation,” he says, reflecting on that period.
Today, Expedia could hardly be accused of desperation — revenues were more than $9bn in the past 12 months, up 26 per cent from the previous year. The total number of rooms per night booked rose 12 per cent to reach 64m during the first quarter of the year. But it is still trying to stay one step ahead of the disrupters.
Mr Khosrowshahi, 48, has pursued that challenge with a combination of tech investment and acquisitions that reflect his background as a banker. Born in Iran and raised in New York State, he studied electrical engineering in college, and cut his teeth in finance at Allen & Co, the investment bank.
He joined Barry Diller’s IAC, a media conglomerate that bought a controlling stake in Expedia from Microsoft in 2001. The move was a shift from banking. “It was always finance first . . . For me, the biggest change has been that it’s product and technology first now,” he says.
Mr Khosrowshahi’s latest obsession is voice search, and he has several types of voice assistants at home. He imagines how one day voice search could replace the current system of ticking boxes and filling in airport codes on a website to book a plane ticket. “You are going to get into a world where people are going to ask questions . . . and we will be able to answer any question about travel,” he says, with a glow.
Passengers can only retrieve simple information, such as checking an itinerary or booking a car, from the Expedia voice app on Amazon’s Alexa. But in the long term, his goals lie beyond voice search: Mr Khosrowshahi wants Expedia to become a sort of real-time travel assistant, one that can call your Uber ride to the airport at the right time, have a car waiting when you land and choose your favourite room in a hotel. This project is in its infancy, but the bigger challenge is that other companies are working towards the same goals. Expedia also faces growing competition from some of the most well-known companies in Silicon Valley.
Priceline, its main rival for online hotel bookings and owner of Booking.com and OpenTable, is gathering data that allows it to offer users more personalised experiences. A bigger threat could come from Airbnb, the home-sharing company recently valued by investors at $30bn, which is more than the enterprise value of Expedia. Airbnb has ambitions to add car booking, ticket purchasing and concierge services to its app.
Mr Khosrowshahi has tried an offensive: two years ago, he bought Home-Away, the US vacation rental company that includes VRBO, a popular home-sharing site. HomeAway’s business has grown rapidly, with bookings up 50 per cent in the first quarter of this year. But integrating HomeAway’s room inventory with Expedia has not been easy.
“This alternative lodging is where independent hotels were 15 years ago,” Mr Khosrowshahi says. “We spent the past 15 years wiring up all these independent hotels, and we are just starting to do the same for alternative lodging.” Expedia owns a range of other brands, including Trivago, Orbitz, Travelocity, Kayak and Egencia, that supply it with large amounts of data about individual travel habits.
Another “existential threat”, as Mr Khosrowshahi puts it, comes from Google. “They are a competitor for the consumers’ hearts and minds when they have a travel question,” he says.
There is a twist to this rivalry, because Expedia is also one of Google’s biggest customers. Expedia will spend about $4bn this year on marketing, and much of that will be on Google ads to draw travellers to Expedia-owned sites.
The White House is a wild card for Expedia. Two-thirds of the company’s business is in the US, and the volatility of pronouncements from the Trump administration have had a dampening effect on business.
For Mr Khosrowshahi, who was born in Tehran but holds US citizenship, some of these decisions strike close to home, such as the executive order in January that banned arrivals from seven Muslim-majority countries. The ban was subsequently suspended by the judiciary, but the government’s legal battle continues.
“It is important to have safe borders, but at the same time we can’t forget what brought us here. This is an immigrant nation,” he says. “Anytime you introduce volatility, it is not good for business and not good for travel.”
Expedia has weathered this kind of political turmoil before. When IAC acquired its majority stake in the company in 2001, the deal was nearly called off because of the September 11 terrorist attacks. IAC chairman Mr Diller had the option to pull out under the “material adverse conditions” clause.
Mr Khosrowshahi recalls being in the room when the decision was made. “Barry looked up and said, ‘you know what, if there’s life, there’s travel, so it’s going to come back’ . . . so we stayed in the business and, thank God, we did.”
 Second opinion: The mentor 
Barry Diller, chairman of IAC, says Dara Khosrowshahi has thrived on being challenged without necessarily having the background to deliver.
“I think he is first rate, obviously,” says Mr Diller. “We gave him more responsibility than his experience dictated but we thought that he had the freshest, best approach.
“And it is a real example of quality of leadership that Expedia has grown throughout, and is now in as good a position as it has probably ever been.”

Early life[edit]
Hassan Khosrowshahi was born into a prominent industrial and merchant Khosroshahi family in Tehran in 1940. He was educated in Iran and England and obtained his degree in law and economics from the University of Tehran.
He joined his family company, the Minoo Industrial Group founded by his father Ali Khosrowshahi, in 1961. Minoo Industrial Group was a major manufacturer and distributor of food products, pharmaceutical and cosmetics with sales over US $350 million in 1978. Minoo Industrial Group produced products under its own brand names and under license for major international companies such as Beatrice Foods, Sandoz, United Biscuits, L'Oréal Group, Boots, and G. D. Searle & Company. In addition, the Khosrowshahi family, through various companies which they controlled, had been the exclusive distributors for Nestlé S.A. in Iran from 1954 until 1981.[1]
Career[edit]
The Khosrowshahi family immigrated to Canada following the Iranian Revolution. Hassan Khosrowshahi settled in Vancouver in 1981. He founded Persis Holdings in 1981, today the holding company for the Khosrowshahi family. Formerly known as Inwest Investments, the firm has made substantial investments in retail, real estate and pharmaceutical businesses in Canada and United States.
In 1982, Khosrowshahi founded Canadian electronics retailer, Future Shop. The chain expanded throughout western Canada and Ontario in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The chain later expanded further into Quebec and Atlantic Canada. By 2006, the chain was operating a total of 118 stores in all ten Canadian provinces. After an ill-fated attempt to expand into the United States, which lasted about a decade, all US locations closed in 1999. In March 2001, American-based Best Buy acquired Future Shop for C$580 million.
In April 2007, Khosrowshahi became chairman of The Fraser Institute’s board of trustees. Khosrowshahi is also a Member of the Executive Committee of the Business Council of British Columbia, and he sits on the board of the Leading Edge Endowment Fund.
Wealth[edit]
Khosrowshahi had an estimated net worth of $940 million in 2012.[2]
Personal life[edit]
Khosrowshahi is married to Nezhat Khosrowshahi, and they have two children.[3] In 2012 he received the Order of British Columbia for his entrepreneurial and philanthropist career; being an immigrant from Iran to Canada, he personifies the ‘great Canadian dream.’[4] In 2016, he was appointed into the Order of Canada with the grade of member, one of Canada's highest civilian honours.[5]

Searle & Company. In addition, the Khosrowshahi family, through various companies which they controlled, had been the exclusive distributors for Nestlé S.A. in Iran from 1954 until 1981.[1]
Career[edit]
The Khosrowshahi family immigrated to Canada following the Iranian Revolution. Hassan Khosrowshahi settled in Vancouver in 1981. He founded Persis Holdings in 1981, today the holding company for the Khosrowshahi family. Formerly known as Inwest Investments, the firm has made substantial investments in retail, real estate and pharmaceutical businesses in Canada and United States.
In 1982, Khosrowshahi founded Canadian electronics retailer, Future Shop. The chain expanded throughout western Canada and Ontario in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The chain later expanded further into Quebec and Atlantic Canada. By 2006, the chain was operating a total of 118 stores in all ten Canadian provinces. After an ill-fated attempt to expand into the United States, which lasted about a decade, all US locations closed in 1999. In March 2001, American-based Best Buy acquired Future Shop for C$580 million.
In April 2007, Khosrowshahi became chairman of The Fraser Institute’s board of trustees. Khosrowshahi is also a Member of the Executive Committee of the Business Council of British Columbia, and he sits on the board of the Leading Edge Endowment Fund.
Wealth[edit]
Khosrowshahi had an estimated net worth of $940 million in 2012.[2]
Personal life[edit]
Khosrowshahi is married to Nezhat Khosrowshahi, and they have two children.[3] In 2012 he received the Order of British Columbia for his entrepreneurial and philanthropist career; being an immigrant from Iran to Canada, he personifies the ‘great Canadian dream.’[4] In 2016, he was appointed into the Order of Canada with the grade of member, one of Canada's highest civilian honours.[5]

Talking Points: Dara Khosrowshahi




BY: Compiled and edited by Leslie D. Helm
 | FROM THE PRINT EDITION | 
June 2010
 








 
As CEO of Expedia, Dara
Khosrowshahi presides over the world’s largest online travel business with $3
billion in revenues in 2009 and a growing treasure trove of popular travel
sites including TripAdvisor, Hotwire and Hotels.com.
Coming to America: I came to the
States with my family in 1978 during the Iranian Revolution when I was 9. I
thought all those channels on cable TV were really cool. I didn’t notice that
we moved from a mansion to a little condo. We had the comfort of family and
food on the table. The U.S. is a welcoming place for people who didn’t grow up
here.
Maintaining an Iranian identity:
It was an ironic reversal. When we were in Iran, my parents wanted us to go to
college in the States. So, at the dinner table, they insisted we speak English.
We hated it. Then, in the States, our parents insisted we speak Farsi. We would
say, “Do we have to speak Farsi? Nobody speaks Farsi here.”
Switching careers from engineering
to investment banking: I had a great [engineering] training program in Kentucky
lined up, but my girlfriend lived in New York. Love won the day. I joined Allen
and Co. [an investment bank focused on media] as head of strategy and planning.
It set me off on my career. 
Acquisitions: I’ve done 20
transactions in the five years I’ve been running [Expedia]. I’ve learned three
lessons: First, keep it simple. When you need to put together a long argument
to justify it, then too many things have to go right to make it work and you will
probably have a failure. In real life, things always go wrong. Second,
management has to be great. Our most spectacular home run deal was TripAdvisor.
When we bought it [2004], it was going to do $10 million in cash flow and last
year, it did close to $200 million. Steve Kaufer, the founder, took it all the
way to where it is now. Third, go with your gut. There have been a couple of
deals where it seemed right intellectually but it didn’t feel right in my gut,
and I went forward with the deal and it was a disaster.  
The financial crisis: All of us
were pretty panicked. The first thing the board asked us when the crisis hit
was, “Is the company safe?” 
[Fortunately] we’ve always been really conservative in terms of having enough
cash to run the company. Once we could say the company was safe, we had the
luxury to act in a rational manner.
Emerging from recession: Last
year, when business demand cratered, hoteliers looked to leisure demand to take
up the slack. They put a lot of great deals out there. Last year was the best
time for a leisure traveler to buy in probably the last 20 years. [Consumers]
came to a lot of our sites and bought pretty aggressively. People put off
buying their cars but they didn’t put off going on vacation. That allowed us to
gain a lot of share.
On competition from Google and
Microsoft: Last year, we launched the “traveler first” initiative. It is pretty
simple. If we are making a decision about a new product or a new acquisition,
always think about what it means to the traveler first. Then think about the
profit and loss. Last year, for example, we cut booking fees to zero amid the
worst recession. We also got rid of change/cancellation fees. If we think about
the traveler first, if we up our game, we can avoid any potential disintermediation.
Travel is our lifeblood; we should do it better than anyone else. We have
plenty of capital. Frankly, we have no excuses.
Social networking: Our social
strategy is led by TripAdvisor. The site was founded on the basis of travelers
telling each other unvarnished, unedited opinions. Now we have
CruiseCritic.com, where people discuss the food and entertainment on cruises.
The amount of information is incredible. Users tend to put out a review and you
get viral adoption of products. 
Growth: Advertising is an
exploding revenue stream. It’s 12 percent of revenue and double that in
profits. We are by far the largest travel media company in the world. We see
incredible opportunities in the Asia-Pacific [region] and Latin America. They
are just getting started in internet commerce and travel is always a leading
category. Eighty percent of leisure travel [in Asia] used to happen over the
holidays. Now people are beginning to take vacations on other days. 
Expedia’s $320 million R&D
budgeT: We are a travel technology company. It’s really about bringing together
the travel skills and technology to make special things happen. It’s the value
we add to our consumers and it’s the value we add to our supply partners. It
will always be core to what we do. 
Challenges: The unknown is in
mobile with devices like the iPhone and iPad. People have been talking about
the mobile revolution for 10 years and now it’s happening. The danger is that
whenever you have a new platform, you have new businesses sprout up. Will there
be another Expedia that comes out of the mobile platform? We would like that
new company to be us, but frankly, it’s something I worry about. There are
people in the garage that have nothing to lose and everything to gain. You have
to watch very closely. And if we don’t build it, it’s something that we will
have to buy. 
Recruitment: It’s nice to be
hiring again. I recently had a conversation with an HR group about how many
recruiters we should be bringing in. Seattle is a good area to be hiring in.
The only problem is transportation. Our bus system is pretty good, but when you
have a city this size, you typically expect to have a better rail
infrastructure.

Dara Khosrowshahi (Persian: دارا خسروشاهی‎‎) is an Iranian American businessman and the CEO of Expedia, Inc. Khosrowshahi received a B.A. in electrical engineering from Brown University in 1991.[2][3]
Career[edit]
Dara Khosrowshahi has served as CEO of Expedia, Inc., since August 2005. Since that time, Expedia has extended its global presence to more than 60 countries worldwide through Expedia, Hotels.com, and Hotwire online booking brands, and the travel community sites of TripAdvisor Media Network. Ten years later, in 2015, Expedia awarded him $90 million worth of stock options as part of a long-term employment agreement, stating he would stay until 2020. [4]
Before joining Expedia, Khosrowshahi served as the CEO of IAC Travel. Khosrowshahi worked at Allen & Company from 1991 to 1998, and as its vice president from 1995 to 1998. He is also a board director for BET.com, Hotels.com and several other companies.
In February 2015, the New York Times Company announced Khosrowshahi as one of two new nominees for its board of directors. He will formally stand for election at the annual meeting of stockholders on May 6, 2015. Arthur Sulzberger, Jr., the publisher of the New York Times and chairman of The New York Times Company praised Khosrowshahi's "comprehensive digital and international experience, as well as significant financial expertise".[5]
Awards and recognition[edit]
In June 2013 Ernst & Young recognized Dara Khosrowshahi as a Pacific Northwest Entrepreneur of the Year award recipient.[6] He is among the U.S. State Department's "List of Prominent Iranian Americans".[7]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
