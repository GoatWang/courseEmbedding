Martin Luther King Jr. and Civil Rights Related Products

Martin Luther King, Jr. was born in Atlanta on Jan 15, 1929. He attended Morehouse College in Atlanta and also attended Pennsylvania and Boston University. He married Coretta Scott in 1953 and became the pastor at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama in 1954.King rose to national prominence in 1955 during the Montgomery Bus Boycott which led to the Supreme Court's decision that Alabama's segregation laws were unconstitutional. This was a major victory which led to more non-violent protests against injustice. Kings efforts eventually pressured Congress pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Both of which helped to dismantle the systematic racism and oppression within American society. King was awarded the Nobel Peace price in 1964. He was assassinated in 1968. On August 22, 2011 the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial was opened in Washington, D.C.

Introduction 

Martin Luther King Jr. (1929-1968) was a Baptist minister and social activist who played a key role in the American civil rights movement from the mid-1950s until his assassination in 1968. Inspired by advocates of nonviolence such as Mahatma Gandhi, King sought equality for African Americans, the economically disadvantaged and victims of injustice through peaceful protest. He was the driving force behind watershed events such as the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the March on Washington, which helped bring about such landmark legislation as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. King was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 and is remembered each year on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, a U.S. federal holiday since 1986.

 Martin Luther King Jr.: Early Years and Family       
The second child of Martin Luther King Sr. (1899-1984), a pastor, and Alberta Williams King (1904-1974), a former schoolteacher, Martin Luther King Jr. was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on January 15, 1929. Along with his older sister, the future Christine King Farris (born 1927), and younger brother, Alfred Daniel Williams King (1930-1969), he grew up in the city’s Sweet Auburn neighborhood, then home to some of the most prominent and prosperous African Americans in the country.

The final section of Martin Luther King Jr.’s eloquent and iconic “I Have a Dream” speech is believed to have been largely improvised.A gifted student, King attended segregated public schools and at the age of 15 was admitted to Morehouse College, the alma mater of both his father and maternal grandfather, where he studied medicine and law. Although he had not intended to follow in his father’s footsteps by joining the ministry, he changed his mind under the mentorship of Morehouse’s president, Dr. Benjamin Mays, an influential theologian and outspoken advocate for racial equality. After graduating in 1948, King entered Crozer Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania, where he earned a Bachelor of Divinity degree, won a prestigious fellowship and was elected president of his predominantly white senior class.
King then enrolled in a graduate program at Boston University, completing his coursework in 1953 and earning a doctorate in systematic theology two years later. While in Boston he met Coretta Scott (1927-2006), a young singer from Alabama who was studying at the New England Conservatory of Music. The couple wed in 1953 and settled in Montgomery, Alabama, where King became pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. They had four children: Yolanda Denise King (1955-2007), Martin Luther King III (born 1957), Dexter Scott King (born 1961) and Bernice Albertine King (born 1963).
 Martin Luther King Jr. and the Montgomery Bus Boycott       
The King family had been living in Montgomery for less than a year when the highly segregated city became the epicenter of the burgeoning struggle for civil rights in America, galvanized by the landmark Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka decision of 1954. On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks (1913-2005), secretary of the local National Association for the Advancement of Colored People chapter, refused to give up her seat to a white passenger on a Montgomery bus and was arrested. Activists coordinated a bus boycott that would continue for 381 days, placing a severe economic strain on the public transit system and downtown business owners. They chose Martin Luther King Jr. as the protest’s leader and official spokesman.
By the time the Supreme Court ruled segregated seating on public buses unconstitutional in November 1956, King, heavily influenced by Mahatma Gandhi (1869-1948) and the activist Bayard Rustin (1912-1987), had entered the national spotlight as an inspirational proponent of organized, nonviolent resistance. (He had also become a target for white supremacists, who firebombed his family home that January.) Emboldened by the boycott’s success, in 1957 he and other civil rights activists–most of them fellow ministers–founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), a group committed to achieving full equality for African Americans through nonviolence. (Its motto was “Not one hair of one head of one person should be harmed.”) He would remain at the helm of this influential organization until his death.
 King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference       
In his role as SCLC president, Martin Luther King Jr. traveled across the country and around the world, giving lectures on nonviolent protest and civil rights as well as meeting with religious figures, activists and political leaders. (During a month-long trip to India in 1959, he had the opportunity to meet family members and followers of Gandhi, the man he described in his autobiography as “the guiding light of our technique of nonviolent social change.”) King also authored several books and articles during this time.
In 1960 King and his family moved to Atlanta, his native city, where he joined his father as co-pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church. This new position did not stop King and his SCLC colleagues from becoming key players in many of the most significant civil rights battles of the 1960s. Their philosophy of nonviolence was put to a particularly severe test during the Birmingham campaign of 1963, in which activists used a boycott, sit-ins and marches to protest segregation, unfair hiring practices and other injustices in one of America’s most racially divided cities. Arrested for his involvement on April 12, King penned the civil rights manifesto known as the “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” an eloquent defense of civil disobedience addressed to a group of white clergymen who had criticized his tactics.
 King Marches for Freedom       
Later that year, Martin Luther King Jr. worked with a number of civil rights and religious groups to organize the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, a peaceful political rally designed to shed light on the injustices African Americans continued to face across the country. Held on August 28 and attended by some 200,000 to 300,000 participants, the event is widely regarded as a watershed moment in the history of the American civil rights movement and a factor in the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
The march culminated in King’s most famous address, known as the “I Have a Dream” speech, a spirited call for peace and equality that many consider a masterpiece of rhetoric. Standing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial–a monument to the president who a century earlier had brought down the institution of slavery in the United States—he shared his vision of a future in which “this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.'” The speech and march cemented King’s reputation at home and abroad; later that year he was named Man of the Year by TIME magazine and in 1964 became the youngest person ever awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
In the spring of 1965, King’s elevated profile drew international attention to the violence that erupted between white segregationists and peaceful demonstrators in Selma, Alabama, where the SCLC and Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) had organized a voter registration campaign. Captured on television, the brutal scene outraged many Americans and inspired supporters from across the country to gather in Selma and take part in a march to Montgomery led by King and supported by President Lyndon Johnson (1908-1973), who sent in federal troops to keep the peace. That August, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, which guaranteed the right to vote–first awarded by the 15th Amendment–to all African Americans.
 Martin Luther King Jr.’s Final Years and Assassination       
The events in Selma deepened a growing rift between Martin Luther King Jr. and young radicals who repudiated his nonviolent methods and commitment to working within the established political framework. As more militant black leaders such as Stokely Carmichael (1941-1998) rose to prominence, King broadened the scope of his activism to address issues such as the Vietnam War and poverty among Americans of all races. In 1967, King and the SCLC embarked on an ambitious program known as the Poor People’s Campaign, which was to include a massive march on the capital.
On the evening of April 4, 1968, King was fatally shot while standing on the balcony of a motel in Memphis, where he had traveled to support a sanitation workers’ strike. In the wake of his death, a wave of riots swept major cities across the country, while President Johnson declared a national day of mourning. James Earl Ray (1928-1998), an escaped convict and known racist, pleaded guilty to the murder and was sentenced to 99 years in prison. (He later recanted his confession and gained some unlikely advocates, including members of the King family, before his death in 1998.)
After years of campaigning by activists, members of Congress and Coretta Scott King, among others, in 1983 President Ronald Reagan (1911-2004) signed a bill creating a U.S. federal holiday in honor of King. Observed on the third Monday of January, it was first celebrated in 1986.

SynopsisMartin Luther King Jr. was born on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia. King, a Baptist minister and civil-rights activist, had a seismic impact on race relations in the United States, beginning in the mid-1950s. Among his many efforts, King headed the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Through his activism and inspirational speeches he played a pivotal role in ending the legal segregation of African-American citizens in the United States, as well as the creation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. King received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, among several other honors. He was assassinated in April 1968, and continues to be remembered as one of the most influential and inspirational African-American leaders in history.Early YearsBorn as Michael King Jr. on January 15, 1929, Martin Luther King Jr. was the middle child of Michael King Sr. and Alberta Williams King. The King and Williams families were rooted in rural Georgia. Martin Jr.'s grandfather, A.D. Williams, was a rural minister for years and then moved to Atlanta in 1893. He took over the small, struggling Ebenezer Baptist church with around 13 members and made it into a forceful congregation. He married Jennie Celeste Parks and they had one child that survived, Alberta. Michael King Sr. came from a sharecropper family in a poor farming community. He married Alberta in 1926 after an eight-year courtship. The newlyweds moved to A.D. Williams' home in Atlanta. Michael King Sr. stepped in as pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church upon the death of his father-in-law in 1931. He too became a successful minister, and adopted the name Martin Luther King Sr. in honor of the German Protestant religious leader Martin Luther. In due time, Michael Jr. would follow his father's lead and adopt the name himself.21Gallery21 Images Young Martin had an older sister, Willie Christine, and a younger brother, Alfred Daniel Williams King. The King children grew up in a secure and loving environment. Martin Sr. was more the disciplinarian, while his wife's gentleness easily balanced out the father's more strict hand. Though they undoubtedly tried, Martin Jr.’s parents couldn’t shield him completely from racism. Martin Luther King Sr. fought against racial prejudice, not just because his race suffered, but because he considered racism and segregation to be an affront to God's will. He strongly discouraged any sense of class superiority in his children which left a lasting impression on Martin Jr. Growing up in Atlanta, Georgia, Martin Luther King Jr. entered public school at age 5. In May, 1936 he was baptized, but the event made little impression on him. In May, 1941, Martin was 12 years old when is grandmother, Jennie, died of a heart attack. The event was traumatic for Martin, more so because he was out watching a parade against his parents' wishes when she died. Distraught at the news, young Martin jumped from a second story window at the family home, allegedly attempting suicide. King attended Booker T. Washington High School, where he was said to be a precocious student. He skipped both the ninth and eleventh grades, and entered Morehouse College in Atlanta at age 15, in 1944. He was a popular student, especially with his female classmates, but an unmotivated student who floated though his first two years. Although his family was deeply involved in the church and worship, young Martin questioned religion in general and felt uncomfortable with overly emotional displays of religious worship. This discomfort continued through much of his adolescence, initially leading him to decide against entering the ministry, much to his father's dismay. But in his junior year, Martin took a Bible class, renewed his faith and began to envision a career in the ministry. In the fall of his senior year, he told his father of his decision.Education and Spiritual GrowthIn 1948, Martin Luther King Jr. earned a sociology degree from Morehouse College and attended the liberal Crozer Theological Seminary in Chester, Pennsylvania. He thrived in all his studies, and was valedictorian of his class in 1951, and elected student body president. He also earned a fellowship for graduate study. But Martin also rebelled against his father’s more conservative influence by drinking beer and playing pool while at college. He became involved with a white woman and went through a difficult time before he could break off the affair. During his last year in seminary, Martin Luther King Jr. came under the guidance of Morehouse College President Benjamin E. Mays who influenced King’s spiritual development. Mays was an outspoken advocate for racial equality and encouraged King to view Christianity as a  potential force for social change. After being accepted at several colleges for his doctoral study, including Yale and Edinburgh in Scotland, King enrolled at Boston University. During the work on his doctorate, Martin Luther King Jr. met Coretta Scott, an aspiring singer and musician, at the New England Conservatory school in Boston. They were married in June 1953 and had four children, Yolanda, Martin Luther King III, Dexter Scott and Bernice. In 1954, while still working on his dissertation, King became pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church of Montgomery, Alabama. He completed his Ph.D. and earned his degree in 1955. King was only 25 years old.Montgomery Bus BoycottOn March 2, 1955, a 15-year-old girl refused to give up her seat to a white man on a Montgomery city bus in violation of local law. Claudette Colvin was arrested and taken to jail. At first, the local chapter of the NAACP felt they had an excellent test case to challenge Montgomery's segregated bus policy. But then it was revealed that she was pregnant and civil rights leaders feared this would scandalize the deeply religious black community and make Colvin (and, thus the group's efforts) less credible in the eyes of sympathetic whites. On December 1, 1955, they got another chance to make their case. That evening, 42-year-old Rosa Parks boarded the Cleveland Avenue bus to go home after an exhausting day at work. She sat in the first row of the "colored" section in the middle of the bus. As the bus traveled its route, all the seats in the white section filled up, then several more white passengers boarded the bus. The bus driver noted that there were several white men standing and demanded that Parks and several other African Americans give up their seats. Three other African American passengers reluctantly gave up their places, but Parks remained seated. The driver asked her again to give up her seat and again she refused. Parks was arrested and booked for violating the Montgomery City Code. At her trial a week later, in a 30-minute hearing, Parks was found guilty and fined $10 and assessed $4 court fee. On the night that Rosa Parks was arrested, E.D. Nixon, head of the local NAACP chapter met with Martin Luther King Jr. and other local civil rights leaders to plan a citywide bus boycott. King was elected to lead the boycott because he was young, well-trained with solid family connections and had professional standing. But he was also new to the community and had few enemies, so it was felt he would have strong credibility with the black community. In his first speech as the group's president, King declared, "We have no alternative but to protest. For many years we have shown an amazing patience. We have sometimes given our white brothers the feeling that we liked the way we were being treated. But we come here tonight to be saved from that patience that makes us patient with anything less than freedom and justice." Martin Luther King Jr.'s skillful rhetoric put a new energy into the civil rights struggle in Alabama. The bus boycott involved 382 days of walking to work, harassment, violence and intimidation for the Montgomery's African-American community. Both King's and E.D. Nixon's homes were attacked. But the African-American community also took legal action against the city ordinance arguing that it was unconstitutional based on the Supreme Court's "separate is never equal" decision in Brown v. Board of Education. After being defeated in several lower court rulings and suffering large financial losses, the city of Montgomery lifted the law mandating segregated public transportation.The Southern Christian Leadership ConferenceFlush with victory, African-American civil rights leaders  recognized the need for a national organization to help coordinate their  efforts. In January 1957, Martin Luther King Jr., Ralph Abernathy,  and 60 ministers and civil rights activists founded the Southern  Christian Leadership Conference to harness the moral authority  and organizing power of black churches. They would help conduct  non-violent protests to promote civil rights reform. King's  participation in the organization gave him a base of operation  throughout the South, as well as a national platform. The organization  felt the best place to start to give African Americans a voice was to  enfranchise them in the voting process. In February 1958, the SCLC  sponsored more than 20 mass meetings in key southern cities to register black  voters in the South. King met with religious and civil rights leaders  and lectured all over the country on race-related issues. In 1959, with the help of the American Friends Service Committee, and  inspired by Gandhi's success with non-violent activism, Martin Luther  King visited Gandhi's birthplace in India. The trip affected him in a  deeply profound way, increasing his commitment to America's civil rights  struggle. African-American civil rights activist Bayard Rustin, who had  studied Gandhi's teachings, became one of King's associates and  counseled him to dedicate himself to the principles of non-violence.  Rustin served as King's mentor and advisor throughout his early activism  and was the main organizer of the 1963 March on Washington. But Rustin  was also a controversial figure at the time, being a homosexual with alleged ties to the Communist Party, USA. Though his  counsel was invaluable to King, many of his other supporters urged him  to distance himself from Rustin. In February 1960, a group of African-American students began what  became known as the "sit-in" movement in Greensboro, North Carolina. The  students would sit at racially segregated lunch counters in the city's  stores. When asked to leave or sit in the colored section, they just  remained seated, subjecting themselves to verbal and sometimes physical  abuse. The movement quickly gained traction in several other cities. In  April 1960, the SCLC held a conference at Shaw University in Raleigh, North  Carolina with local sit-in leaders. Martin Luther King Jr. encouraged  students to continue to use nonviolent methods during their protests.  Out of this meeting, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee  formed and for a time, worked closely with the SCLC. By August of 1960,  the sit-ins had been successful in ending segregation at lunch counters  in 27 southern cities. By 1960, Martin Luther King Jr. was gaining national notoriety. He  returned to Atlanta to become co-pastor with his father at Ebenezer  Baptist Church, but also continued his civil rights efforts. On October  19, 1960, King and 75 students entered a local department store and  requested lunch-counter service but were denied. When they refused to  leave the counter area, King and 36 others were arrested. Realizing the  incident would hurt the city's reputation, Atlanta's mayor negotiated a  truce and charges were eventually dropped. But soon after, King was  imprisoned for violating his probation on a traffic conviction. The news  of his imprisonment entered the 1960 presidential campaign, when candidate John F. Kennedy made a phone call to Coretta Scott King. Kennedy  expressed his concern for King's harsh treatment for the  traffic ticket and  political pressure was quickly set in motion. King was soon released.'I Have a Dream'In the spring of 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. organized a demonstration  in downtown Birmingham, Alabama. Entire families attended. City police turned dogs and fire hoses on demonstrators. Martin Luther King was  jailed along with large numbers of his supporters, but the event drew  nationwide attention. However, King was personally criticized by black  and white clergy alike for taking risks and endangering the children who  attended the demonstration. From the jail in Birmingham, King  eloquently spelled out his theory of non-violence: "Nonviolent direct  action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a  community, which has constantly refused to negotiate, is forced to  confront the issue." By the end of the Birmingham campaign, Martin Luther King Jr. and his  supporters were making plans for a massive demonstration on the nation's  capital composed of multiple organizations, all asking for peaceful  change. On August 28, 1963, the historic March on Washington drew more  than 200,000 people in the shadow of the Lincoln Memorial. It was here  that King made his famous "I Have a Dream" speech, emphasizing his belief  that someday all men could be brothers."I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character."  — Martin Luther King, Jr. / "I Have A Dream" speech, August 28, 1963 The rising tide of civil rights agitation produced a strong effect on  public opinion. Many people in cities not experiencing racial tension  began to question the nation's Jim Crow laws and the near century second  class treatment of African-American citizens.  This resulted in the  passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 authorizing the federal  government to enforce desegregation of public accommodations and  outlawing discrimination in publicly owned facilities. This also led to  Martin Luther King receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. King's struggle continued throughout the 1960s.  Often, it seemed as though the pattern of progress was two steps forward and one step back. On March 7, 1965, a civil rights march, planned from Selma to Alabama's  capital in Montgomery, turned violent as police with nightsticks and  tear gas met the demonstrators as they tried to cross the Edmund Pettus  Bridge. King was not in the march, however the attack was televised  showing horrifying images of marchers being bloodied and severely  injured. Seventeen demonstrators were hospitalized in a day that would be called "Bloody Sunday." A second march was cancelled due to a restraining  order to prevent the march from taking place. A third march was planned  and this time King made sure he was part of it. Not wanting to alienate  southern judges by violating the restraining order, a different approach was  taken. On March 9, 1965, a procession of 2,500 marchers, both black and  white, set out once again to cross the Pettus Bridge and confronted  barricades and state troopers. Instead of forcing a confrontation, King led his followers to kneel in prayer and they then turned back. Alabama governor George Wallace continued to try to prevent another march, however, President Lyndon Johnson pledged his support and ordered U.S. Army troops and the Alabama National Guard to protect the protestors. On March 21, approximately 2,000 people began a march from Selma to the capitol in Montgomery. On March 25, the number of marchers, which had grown to an estimated 25,000, gathered in front of the state capitol where Dr. King delivered a televised speech. Five months after the historic peaceful protest, President Johnson signed  the 1965 Voting Rights Act.  From late 1965 through 1967, Martin Luther King  Jr. expanded his civil rights efforts into other larger American cities, including Chicago and Los Angeles. But he met with increasing criticism and  public challenges from young black power leaders. King's patient,  non-violent approach and appeal to white middle-class citizens alienated  many black militants who considered his methods too weak, too late and ineffective. To address  this criticism, King began making a link between discrimination and  poverty, and he began to speak out against the Vietnam War. He  felt that America's involvement in Vietnam was politically untenable and the  government's conduct in the war discriminatory to the poor. He sought to  broaden his base by forming a multi-race coalition to address economic  and unemployment problems of all disadvantaged people.Assassination and LegacyBy 1968, the years of demonstrations and confrontations were  beginning to wear on Martin Luther King Jr. He had grown tired of marches, going to jail, and living under the constant threat of death. He was  becoming discouraged at the slow progress of civil rights in America and  the increasing criticism from other African-American leaders. Plans were  in the works for another march on Washington to revive his movement and  bring attention to a widening range of issues. In the spring of 1968, a labor strike by Memphis sanitation workers drew King to one last crusade. On April 3, he gave his final and what proved to be an eerily prophetic  speech, “I’ve Been to the Mountaintop,” in which he told supporters at the Mason Temple in Memphis, "I've seen the promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight that we, as a people, will get to the promised land." The next day, while standing on a balcony outside his room at the Lorraine Motel, Martin Luther King Jr. was struck by a sniper's bullet. The shooter, a malcontent drifter and former convict named James Earl Ray, was eventually apprehended after a two-month, international manhunt. The killing sparked riots and demonstrations in more than 100 cities across the country. In 1969, Ray pleaded guilty to assassinating King and was sentenced to 99 years in prison. He died in prison on April 23, 1998.Martin Luther King Jr.'s life had a seismic impact on race relations in the United States. Years after his death, he is the most widely known African-American leader of his era. His life and work have been honored with a national holiday, schools and public buildings named after him, and a memorial on Independence Mall in Washington, D.C. But his life remains controversial as well. In the 1970s, FBI files, released under the Freedom of Information Act, revealed that he was under government surveillance, and suggested his involvement in adulterous relationships and communist influences. Over the years, extensive archival studies have led to a more balanced and comprehensive assessment of his life, portraying him as a complex figure: flawed, fallible and limited in his control over the mass movements with which he was associated, yet a visionary leader who was deeply committed to achieving social justice through nonviolent means.

Martin Luther King Jr. - Biography
Martin
  Luther King, Jr., (January 15, 1929-April 4, 1968) was born
  Michael Luther King, Jr., but later had his name changed to
  Martin. His grandfather began the family's long tenure as pastors
  of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, serving from 1914 to
  1931; his father has served from then until the present, and from
  1960 until his death Martin Luther acted as co-pastor. Martin
  Luther attended segregated public schools in Georgia, graduating
  from high school at the age of fifteen; he received the B. A.
  degree in 1948 from Morehouse College, a distinguished Negro
  institution of Atlanta from which both his father and grandfather
  had graduated. After three years of theological study at
  Crozer Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania where he was elected
  president of a predominantly white senior class, he was awarded
  the B.D. in 1951. With a fellowship won at Crozer, he enrolled in
  graduate studies at Boston University, completing his residence for the
  doctorate in 1953 and receiving the degree in 1955. In Boston he
  met and married Coretta Scott, a young woman of uncommon
  intellectual and artistic attainments. Two sons and two daughters
  were born into the family.

  In 1954, Martin Luther King became pastor of the Dexter
  Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama. Always a strong
  worker for civil rights for members of his race, King was, by
  this time, a member of the executive committee of the National
  Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the leading
  organization of its kind in the nation. He was ready, then, early
  in December, 1955, to accept the leadership of the first great
  Negro nonviolent demonstration of contemporary times in the
  United States, the bus boycott described by Gunnar Jahn in his
  presentation speech in honor of the laureate. The boycott lasted
  382 days. On December 21, 1956, after the Supreme Court of the
  United States had declared unconstitutional the laws requiring
  segregation on buses, Negroes and whites rode the buses as
  equals. During these days of boycott, King was arrested, his home
  was bombed, he was subjected to personal abuse, but at the same
  time he emerged as a Negro leader of the first rank.

  In 1957 he was elected president of the Southern Christian
  Leadership Conference, an organization formed to provide new
  leadership for the now burgeoning civil rights movement. The
  ideals for this organization he took from Christianity; its
  operational techniques from Gandhi. In the eleven-year period
  between 1957 and 1968, King traveled over six million miles and
  spoke over twenty-five hundred times, appearing wherever there
  was injustice, protest, and action; and meanwhile he wrote five
  books as well as numerous articles. In these years, he led a
  massive protest in Birmingham, Alabama, that caught the attention
  of the entire world, providing what he called a coalition of
  conscience. and inspiring his "Letter from a Birmingham Jail", a
  manifesto of the Negro revolution; he planned the drives in
  Alabama for the registration of Negroes as voters; he directed
  the peaceful march on Washington, D.C., of 250,000 people to whom
  he delivered his address, "l Have a Dream", he conferred with
  President John F. Kennedy and campaigned for President Lyndon B.
  Johnson; he was arrested upwards of twenty times and assaulted at
  least four times; he was awarded five honorary degrees; was named
  Man of the Year by Time magazine in 1963; and became not
  only the symbolic leader of American blacks but also a world
  figure.

  At the age of thirty-five, Martin Luther King, Jr., was the
  youngest man to have received the Nobel Peace Prize. When
  notified of his selection, he announced that he would turn over
  the prize money of $54,123 to the furtherance of the civil rights
  movement.

  On the evening of April 4, 1968, while standing on the balcony of
  his motel room in Memphis, Tennessee, where he was to lead a
  protest march in sympathy with striking garbage workers of that
  city, he was assassinated.
