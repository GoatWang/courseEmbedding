How do I choose a lawyer?Consider the following: 
Comfort Level - Are you comfortable telling the lawyer personal
information? Does the lawyer seem interested in solving your problem? 
Credentials - How long has the lawyer been in practice? Has
the lawyer worked on other cases similar to yours? 
Cost - How are the lawyer's fees structured - hourly or flat
fee? Can the lawyer estimate the cost of your case? 
City - Is the lawyer's office conveniently located?
Not sure what questions to ask a lawyer?Here are a few to get you started:

How long have you been in practice?
How many cases like mine have you handled?
How often do you settle cases out of court?
What are your fees and costs?
What are the next steps?

There may be tax and financial advantages to incorporation, but it can also increase your business licensing fees and decrease the amount of personal control you have in running your business. There are many legal consequences to incorporation, so it's a good idea to consult an attorney specializing in corporate law. A corporate attorney also represents shareholders unhappy with the actions of a corporation.Corporate and incorporation lawyers in cities near Washington, DCAlexandriaArlingtonFairfaxFalls ChurchGaithersburgHerndonHyattsvilleManassasRockvilleSilver SpringSpringfieldWoodbridgeSee all cities in Dist. of Columbia Washington, DC attorneys in related practice areasBusiness Attorneys Washington, DCLimited Liability Company (LLC) Lawyers Washington, DCPartnership Attorneys Washington, DCVenture Capital Attorneys Washington, DCSee all practice areas Washington, DC attorneys by top languagesSpanishFrenchMandarinSet LocationCity and stateCancelSave
