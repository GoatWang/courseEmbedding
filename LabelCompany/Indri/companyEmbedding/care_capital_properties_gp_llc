Committed to Strong Corporate Governance
Ethical business practices are the cornerstone of everything we do at Care Capital Properties. We believe that corporate governance means much more than accurate financial reporting and director independence. Integrity, accountability, transparency, effective oversight, and sound risk management serve as our guiding principles and will lead to superior long-term performance.
We recognize that a strong, independent board of directors plays a pivotal role in shaping the direction of our company and its culture. Our independent directors, who possess extensive experience in the healthcare, real estate, and financial services industries, make up more than 85% of our board. Under the leadership of our Non-Executive Chairman, Douglas Crocker II, these independent directors not only provide valuable guidance and oversight with respect to our financial and operating performance, corporate strategy, and risk management; they also ensure that we are held to exemplary legal and ethical standards.
Global Code of Ethics and Business Conduct
We expect our directors, officers, employees, and agents acting on our behalf to conduct themselves with integrity and in a way that protects our reputation for fairness and honesty. Accordingly, all such individuals must comply with our Global Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, which forms the core of our ethics and compliance program at Care Capital Properties.
We provide multiple ways for employees and other interested parties to report in good faith any concerns or complaints about perceived or potential misconduct, including concerns regarding our internal controls or our accounting or audit practices, by contacting our Compliance Investigator.
Guidelines on Governance and Committee Charters
Our Guidelines on Governance describe the key governance practices we follow to ensure sound risk management and effective oversight by our full board of directors. You can also read about our governance practices in the charters for our Audit and Compliance Committee, Compensation Committee, and Nominating and Governance Committee. Each of these committees exercises independent oversight related to the risks associated with the particular responsibilities of that committee.
We invite shareholders and other interested parties to communicate directly with our board by e-mailing bod@carecapitalproperties.com. You can also contact our Non-Executive Chairman or the independent members of our board as a group by e-mailing independentbod@carecapitalproperties.com.

    Our Strategy  


    Guided by our vision, mission, and values, we intend to grow with quality regional and local operators through focused investment in the post-acute healthcare real estate sector.  











    Driving Growth Opportunities  

Care Capital Properties is focused on investing with quality local and regional operators of skilled nursing facilities across the United States. We provide growth capital for this large, highly fragmented, consolidating industry by acquiring quality real estate and entering into long-term, triple-net leases with experienced operators. We generate cash flow growth externally through accretive investments and internally through our annual contractual rent increases and redevelopment of our existing assets. We maintain a portfolio diversified by operator and geography and support our growth with an investment grade rated balance sheet with strong cash flow and liquidity. 
Our strategy is guided by our vision, mission, and values: 
Our Vision
Be consistently recognized by employees, operators, and shareholders as an exceptional partner and investor in the healthcare real estate market.
Our Mission
Be exceptional investors—skilled in realizing opportunities that advance a high quality of care and deliver consistently superior returns.
Our Values
To always act with integrity, and promote transparency, fairness, and respectful treatment of others.
We are: Skilled. Focused. Invested.SM

“I have worked closely with the team from Care Capital Properties for the last three years. Throughout that time they have proven to be very supportive of the strategic direction of our company and have assisted us as we have grown by participating in financing of our buildings, remodeling of existing assets, and providing support and creativity as we considered transactions outside our current footprint. I have personally found the entire team to be a trusted, cooperative, problem-solving group that works through issues professionally with a focus on a positive outcome for all. They do the things they commit to, and that makes all the difference for us.”
John W. Morgan, CEO
Avamere Health Services

No amount of research is complete without a bird’s eye view of the financial data. Care Capital Properties, Inc. (CCP) currently trades with a market capitalization of $2.14 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been falling by -2.03 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company’s last quarterly report.

The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For CCP, the company currently has $82.29 Million of cash on the books, which is offset by $ current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $206.22 Million over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to hold steady in coming quarters. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 91.43% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors.

K-1 Info From Tax Package Support
As an FYI, for some who may not know, the Tax Package Support link above provides links to most companies that issue K-1s.  When you link to the specific company, there is generally a date posted as to when the K-1s will be available for the previous tax year (2013).  For example, Access Midstream has posted:
"2013 Tax Package information will be available on March 3, 2014."
You can download it to your computer as a .pdf file or print it out if you don't want to wait for the company to mail it to you, which is usually a couple days after it is available online.  After you do get it, if you think there has been an error in the calculations, you can call the toll-free number for clarification or a correction.  If you own units in a company that does not appear on the list you should be able to go to their website, click on the Investor page, and follow instructions from there.
 
For convenience, I cut & pasted the list below.
