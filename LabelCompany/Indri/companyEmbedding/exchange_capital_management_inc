A Simple Approach That Guides Client Engagement: Listen Hard, Talk Straight








Exchange Capital Management is an investment advisory firm comprised of experienced professionals whose primary responsibility is the safe and successful stewardship of each client's interests. As trusted advisors, we encourage responsible and sustainable savings and distribution plans as well as appropriate controls to implement estate planning objectives.
Exchange Capital Management builds customized financial plans based on portfolios consisting of individual stock and bond positions rather than mutual funds, whose management is outsourced -- with additional fees charged. We do our own research, and we make ourselves accessable to our clients, and directly accountable for the day-to-day investment decisions we make on their behalf. 

If you’ve ever suspected the so-called “answer” to your financial objectives was predetermined long before you ever walked into an advisor’s office…relax. We’re more interested in learning about what’s on your mind than what’s in your wallet.
As independent fee-only financial advisors, we are never compensated by sales commissions or product placement. Consequently, our professional team  is motivated to let you tell your story in your own words before offering our thoughts on a customized financial planning strategy based on your unique circumstances. Without conflicts of interest to unduly influence our recommendations, you can be confident the advice we deliver is always reliable.
Loyalty. Prudence. Objectivity. These are the requirements that legally define the fiduciary standard of care. But at Exchange Capital Management, it’s only a start. For us, your piece of mind is our measure of care.

What are analysts saying about American International Group stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about American International Group stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "AIG recently appointed its new CEO, who we believe will speed up turnaround activities at the company. The company has been taking up several measures like strategic divestitures, asset sales, increase in share buybacks, dividend hikes, personnel changes, cost control, reinsurance deals, and lowering of hedge fund investments in order to deliver better earnings result by curbing the probable volatilities. Though some of these efforts have paid off to some extent a lot more reforms are required for a turnaround. The company's commercial lines business has also been underperforming. Regulatory uncertainty and exposure to catastrophes are other headwinds. Shares of the company have underperformed its sector year to date." (7/6/2017)
2. Morgan Stanley analysts commented, "Duperreault's incentive compensation includes 1m stock options which will only be vested if AIG shares trade at $10-30 above ~$61 levels," the firm added. "We think this aligns well with shareholders' interest." (5/16/2017)
3. Wells Fargo & Company analysts commented, "We continue to believe the next catalyst will be the identification of the company’s new CEO. Interesting to us, AIG is holding its annual general meeting on June 28 (compared to May 11 last year) which to us indicates the company looking to have the next CEO in place ahead of that time.  Q1 earnings info. AIG plans to report earnings after the close on Wednesday, May 3 and is to host its conference call on Thursday, May 4 at 9am ET. The dial- in number is 800-347-6311; access code: 8737099." (4/20/2017)
4. UBS AG analysts commented, "We hosted meetings with AIG's CFO on Monday. With respect to the CEO search, the company expects to look externally, seeking someone with global company experience and P&C Insurance experience. The CFO does not expect any change to the company's strategy in 2017, with the new CEO focusing on the 2018 and beyond strategy. The CFO sees a break-up of the company as also unlikely as it would negatively affect the valuation of the DTA and eliminate the diversification benefit on capital. Commercial P&C improvement coming from 2016 actions, growth and Property Actions taken in 2016 (reinsurance, exiting underperforming lines, and taking rate) will provide 2pts of the improvement towards AIG's year-end 2017 target of a 62% run rate underlying loss ratio. The remainder (~2.7pts) will come from improvement in Property and Special Risks and growth in more profitable lines. In Property, a new rater is resulting in rate increases in E&S property, which will be a meaningful contributor to adjusted loss ratio improvement in 2017. 93% of the 4Q16 reserve charge came from AIG's Improve and Remediate buckets, particularly in commercial auto and medical malpractice, which are now reserved at the high end of the indicated range. We remain cautious on the shares given uncertainties We remain skeptical of AIG's ability to hit its adjusted A/Y loss ratio targets in Commercial P&C. We also see risks to the company achieving its $25bb capital management target by year-end 2017 given uncertainty around the CEO and long-term strategy, and the potential for an A.M. Best downgrade. We see limited upside for the shares in the near-term given the CEO uncertainty and achievability of financial targets. Our current SOTP valuation for AIG's shares is $64, roughly in line with the current share price. Our PT is based on 1.1x our 12-month forward estimate of BVPS x/AOCI & the DTA." (3/14/2017)
5. BMO Capital Markets analysts commented, "AIG's year-end results delivered several surprises to the market; however we were less surprised by management coming off their 60% loss ratio goal than we were the magnitude of the reserve charge given there was a large strengthening in 4Q15. As for underwriting, we had been skeptical of that 60% goal from the beginning and consequently were not incorporating it in our 2018 forecasts, limiting our EPS adjustments." (2/17/2017)

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
