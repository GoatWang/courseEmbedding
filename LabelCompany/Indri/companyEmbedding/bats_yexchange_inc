LOUISVILLE SLUGGER CUSTOM BATS - HELPFUL TIPS


The importance of double-checking your designs before you purchase
On the REVIEW & BUY screen, you will have a chance to review your design choices and make changes before you purchase. This is very important because a customized bat cannot be returned and your purchase is non-refundable. PLEASE MAKE SURE ALL INFORMATION IS CORRECT before you proceed to purchase.
Making changes before you purchase
If you want to make a correction or just change things up, you can do so before you purchase. While in the Review and Buy screen, just click any pencil icon and you'll be taken back to the customize and personalize screens to make your desired changes. Once you are satisfied, remember to review your changes carefully on the REVIEW AND BUY screen because a custom bat cannot be returned.
Our right to refuse personalizations that break our rules
	  				We reserve the right to refuse any requested personalizations that contain any of the following:
	  				
Inappropriate or vulgar words, even abbreviated vulgar words.
Names of Major League players OR Major League teams
NCAA licensed marks
Any other trademarked marks, words or phrases

All final decisions are at the sole discretion of Louisville Slugger. Customize responsibly!
Sharing your masterpiece
You're an artist. A visionary. Show your friends what you just created and reveal to them your true genius! You can share your bat on Facebook, Twitter or send it to all of your family and friends via email by clicking the appropriate icon on the REVIEW AND BUY screen. This is also a great way to send someone a "hint" for the holidays or your birthday, or just because you're awesome.
Add to Cart
You've double checked all of your customizations and personalizations and you're now ready to purchase! To begin, click the "Add to Cart" button from the Review and Buy screen. You will be directed to the cart where you will enter your personal details, payment option, billing and shipping information. Once your payment is accepted, your order will be sent to our factory where we'll start building your custom Louisville Slugger bat!

Louisville Slugger Custom Bats only ship within the United States. We are currently unable to accept or ship international or APO/FPO orders.
Security
Protecting your order information is our first concern. Louisville Slugger protects your Custom Bat order information by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, with a digital certificate provided by Network Solutions.

If approval cannot be obtained during checkout, you will be contacted either by phone or email and the problem will be indicated.

Start Preamble
        
        
        
        December 23, 2014
        I. Introduction
On October 30, 2014, BATS Exchange, Inc. (“BATS”), BATS Y-Exchange, Inc. (“BYX”), EDGA Exchange, Inc. (“EDGA”), and EDGX Exchange, Inc.; (“EDGX”) (collectively, the “Exchanges”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Act”) [1] 
           and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,[2] 

           proposed rule changes to establish a new market data product called the “BATS One Feed.” On November 13, 2014, each of the Exchanges filed an Amendment No. 1 to its proposed rule change. The proposed rule changes, each as amended by an Amendment No. 1, were published for comment in the Federal Register on November 20, 2014.[3] 
           On December 15, 2014, each of the Exchanges filed an Amendment No. 2 to its proposed rule change. On December 15, 2014, each of the Exchanges submitted a comment letter on its proposed rule change, each of which included a redline showing the changes made by their Amendments No. 2.[4] 
           No other comments on the proposed rule changes have been received. However, similar proposed rule changes were filed with the Commission by the Exchanges earlier this year and subsequently withdrawn; [5] 
           three Start Printed Page 78921comment letters were received in response to two of those proposed rule changes.[6] 
           The Commission is publishing this Notice and Order to solicit comment on the Amendments No. 2 and to approve each of the proposed rule changes, as modified by Amendments Nos. 1 and 2, on an accelerated basis.
II. Description of the Proposals
The Exchanges propose to establish a new market data product called the BATS One Feed, which would be offered by each of the Exchanges. The BATS One Feed would be a consolidated data feed based on market data derived from underlying data feeds offered by each of the Exchanges. Specifically, the Exchanges would use the following data feeds, which are also available to other vendors, to create the proposed BATS One Feed: the EdgeBook Depth feed for EDGX, the EdgeBook Depth feed for EDGA, the BYX PITCH Feed, and the BATS PITCH Feed. The Exchanges have represented that they will continue to make these individual underlying feeds available and that, as a result, the source of the market data they would use to create the proposed BATS One Feed would be the same as the source available to other vendors. As described more fully below, the BATS One Feed would be a data feed that disseminates, on a real-time basis, the aggregate best bid and offer (“BBO”) of all displayed orders for securities traded on the Exchanges and for which the Exchanges report quotes under the Consolidated Tape Association (“CTA”) Plan or the Nasdaq/UTP Plan. The BATS One Feed would also contain the individual last sale information for each of the Exchanges. In addition, the BATS One Feed would include messages from the Exchanges about trading on their markets. Finally, the BATS One Feed would contain an optional functionality that would enable recipients to elect to receive aggregated two-sided quotations from the Exchanges for up to five (5) price levels.
Description of the BATS One Feed
The BATS One Feed would contain the aggregate BBO of the Exchanges for all securities that are traded on the Exchanges and for which the Exchanges report quotes under the CTA Plan or the Nasdaq/UTP Plan. The aggregate BBO would include the total size of all orders at the BBO available on all Exchanges.[7] 
           The BATS One Feed would also disseminate last sale information for each of the individual Exchanges. The last sale information would include the price, size, time of execution, and the individual Exchange on which the trade was executed. The last sale message would also include the cumulative number of shares executed on all Exchanges for that trading day. The Exchanges have represented that they would disseminate the aggregate BBO of the Exchanges and last sale information through the BATS One Feed no earlier than each individual Exchange provides its BBO and last sale information to the processors under the CTA Plan or the Nasdaq/UTP Plan.
The BATS One Feed would also include Symbol Summary, Market Status, Retail Liquidity Identifier on behalf of BYX, Trading Status, and Trade Break messages. The Symbol Summary message would include the total executed volume across all of the Exchanges. The Market Status message would be disseminated to reflect a change in the status of one of the Exchanges. For example, the Market Status message would indicate whether one of the Exchanges is experiencing a systems issue or disruption and quotation or trade information from that market is not currently being disseminated via the BATS One Feed as part of the aggregated BBO. The Market Status message would also indicate when an Exchange is no longer experiencing a systems issue or disruption to properly reflect the status of the aggregated BBO.
The Retail Liquidity Identifier indicator message would be disseminated via the BATS One Feed on behalf of the BYX only pursuant to BYX's Retail Price Improvement (“RPI”) Program.[8] 

           The Retail Liquidity Identifier indicates when RPI interest priced at least $0.001 better than BYX's Protected Bid or Protected Offer for a particular security is available in the System. The Exchanges propose to disseminate the Retail Liquidity Indicator via the BATS One Feed in the same manner as it is currently disseminated through consolidated data streams (i.e., pursuant to the Consolidated Tape Association Plan/Consolidated Quotation Plan, or CTA/CQ, for Tape A and Tape B securities, and the Nasdaq UTP Plan for Tape C securities) as well as through proprietary BYX data feeds. The Retail Liquidity Identifier reflects the symbol and the side (buy or sell) of the RPI interest, but does not include the price or size of the RPI interest. In particular, like CQ and UTP quoting outputs, the BATS One Feed would include a field for codes related to the Retail Price Improvement Identifier. The codes indicate RPI interest that is priced better than BYX's Protected Bid or Protected Offer by at least the minimum level of price improvement as required by the Program.
The Trade Break message would indicate when an execution on one of the Exchanges has been broken in accordance with the individual Exchange's rules.[9] 
           The Trading Status message would indicate the current trading status of a security on each individual Exchange. For example, a Trading Status message would be sent when a short sale price restriction is in effect pursuant to Rule 201 of Regulation SHO (“Short Sale Circuit Breaker”),[10] 
           or the security is subject to a trading halt, suspension or pause declared by the listing market. A Trading Status message would be sent whenever a security's trading status changes.

Optional Functionality for Aggregate Depth of Book. The BATS One Feed would also offer an additional, optional functionality that would enable recipients to receive two-sided quotations from the Exchanges for five (5) price levels for all securities that are traded on the Exchanges. The option for Start Printed Page 78922receiving the BATS One Feed with this depth of book functionality is referred to as the “BATS One Premium Feed;” the option for receiving the BATS One Feed without this functionality is referred to as the “BATS One Summary Feed.” For each price level on one of the Exchanges, the BATS One Premium Feed option of the BATS One Feed would include a two-sided quote and the number of shares available to buy and sell at that particular price level.[11] 


Distribution of the BATS One Feed. The Exchanges represent that they have taken into consideration their affiliated relationships in the design of the BATS One Feed to assure that vendors would be able to offer a similar product on the same terms as the Exchanges, both from the perspective of latency and cost. The Exchanges have stated that they propose to offer the BATS One Feed voluntarily in response to demand from vendors and subscribers that are interested in receiving the aggregate BBO and last sale information from the Exchanges as part of a single data feed. The Exchanges assert that the BATS One Feed can be used by industry professionals and retail investors looking for a cost effective, easy-to-administer, high quality market data product with the characteristics of the BATS One Feed. The Exchanges also assert that the BATS One Feed would help protect a free and open market by providing vendors and subscribers additional choices in receiving this type of market data, thus promoting competition and innovation.
With respect to latency, the Exchanges have represented that the path for distribution by the Exchanges of BATS One Feed would not be faster than the path for distribution that would be used by a vendor to distribute an independently created a BATS One-like product. Accordingly, the Exchanges have stated, the proposed BATS One data feed is a data product that a competing vendor could create and sell without being in a disadvantaged position relative to the Exchange. In recognition that the Exchanges are the source of their own market data and affiliated with one another, the Exchanges have represented that the source of the market data they would use to create the proposed BATS One Feed is available to other vendors. Specifically, the Exchanges have represented that they would use the following data feeds to create the proposed BATS One Feed, each of which is available to other vendors: the EdgeBook Depth feed for EDGX, the EdgeBook Depth feed for EDGA, the BYX PITCH Feed, and the BATS PITCH Feed. The Exchanges have also represented that they will continue to make available these individual underlying feeds and that, as a result, the source of the market data they would use to create the proposed BATS One Feed is the same as the source available to competing vendors.
The Exchanges have also made the following representations regarding the latency of the BATS One Feed and any consolidated feed to be offered by a competing vendor. In order to create the BATS One Feed, the system creating and supporting the BATS One Feed would need to receive the individual data feeds from each Exchange and, in turn, aggregate and summarize that data to create the BATS One Feed and then distribute it to end users. This is the same process a competing vendor would undergo should it create a market data product similar to the BATS One Feed to distribute to its end users. In addition, a competing vendor could locate its servers in the same facilities as the system creating and supporting the BATS One Feed and could therefore receive the individual data feeds from each Exchange at the same time as the system creating and supporting the BATS One Feed. Thus, the Exchanges have stated that they would not have any unfair advantage over competing vendors with respect to obtaining data from the individual Exchanges, because the technology supporting the BATS One Feed would similarly need to obtain the underlying data feeds and because this connection would be on a level playing field with a competing vendor located at the same facility as the Exchanges. Likewise, the BATS One data feed would not have a speed advantage vis-à-vis competing vendors with respect to access to end user customers, whether those end users are also located in the same data center or not.
With regard to cost, the Exchanges have represented that they will file a separate rule filing with the Commission to establish fees for BATS One Feed and that these fees would be designed to ensure that vendors could compete with the Exchanges by creating a similar product. To ensure a vendor can compete with the Exchanges by creating the same product as the BATS One Feed and selling it to their clients, the Exchanges have also represented that they would charge their clients for the BATS One Feed an amount that is no less than the cost to a market data vendor to obtain all the underlying feeds, plus an amount to be determined that would reflect the value of the aggregation and consolidation function. Thus, the pricing for the BATS One Feed would enable a vendor to receive the underlying data feeds and offer a similar product on a competitive basis and with no pricing disadvantage relative to the Exchanges.
Implementation Date
The Exchanges have represented that they anticipate making the BATS One Feed available as soon as practicable after approval of the proposed rule changes by the Commission and the effectiveness of rule filings to establish the fees for the BATS One Feed.[12] 

III. Summary of Comments
As noted above, the Commission received three comment letters on previous versions of the proposed changes filed by some of the Exchanges.[13] 
           In their current proposals, the Exchanges have responded to the points raised by these commenters.
The three commenters generally oppose the proposed BATS One Feed. The Shatto Letter expressed general concerns about the transparency of order flow information to regulators. The Themis Letter expressed objections to the proposed BATS One Feed on the grounds that it would introduce a new proprietary data feed and expressed concerns generally about the complexity arising from the proliferation of new data technologies. In their response to the commenters, the Exchanges argued that the Themis Letter and Shatto Letter are not responsive to the issues raised in the proposal or are aimed at existing elements of U.S. market structure that have been previously approved by the Commission.
The SIFMA Letter primarily argues that the fees for the proposed BATS One Feed do not meet the requirements of the Act, including the requirement that such fees be “fair and reasonable” under section 11A(c)(1)(C) of the Act. SIFMA also contends that BATS has circumvented the requirement to receive Commission approval for this product by offering and marketing the BATS One Feed since August 1, 2014. In their response to the SIFMA Letter, the Exchanges noted that the thrust of the SIFMA Letter is aimed at the initially proposed fees, which have now been removed from the proposed rule changes and are to be filed with the Commission via separate rule filings. Start Printed Page 78923The Exchanges also noted that, while the SIFMA Letter correctly states that BATS has marketed the BATS One Feed since August 1, 2014, the SIFMA Letter incorrectly asserts that BATS has offered the BATS One Feed since that same date. The Exchanges have represented that all of their marketing materials have included statements that the BATS One Feed's implementation was pending to Commission approval, and at no point have the Exchanges offered the BATS One product for any use other than for testing and certification.
IV. Discussion and Commission Findings
After carefully considering the proposals and the comments submitted, the Commission finds that the proposed rule changes, as modified by Amendments Nos. 1 and 2, are consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to national securities exchanges.[14] 
           In particular, the Commission finds that the proposed rule changes are consistent with the requirements of section 11A(c)(1)(C) of the Act [15] 
           and with Rule 603(a)(2) of Regulation NMS thereunder,[16] 
           which requires that any national securities exchange, national securities association, broker, or dealer that distributes information with respect to quotations for or transactions in an NMS stock to a securities information processor, broker, dealer, or other persons shall do so on terms that are not unreasonably discriminatory. The Commission also finds that the proposed rule changes are consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act, which requires that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a free and open market and a national market system and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest, and section 6(b)(8) of the Act, which requires that the rules of an exchange not impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.[17] 

The Commission notes that, to create the BATS One Feed, the Exchanges would use underlying data feeds that belong to the Exchanges: the EdgeBook Depth feed for EDGX, the EdgeBook Depth feed for EDGA, the BYX PITCH Feed, and the BATS PITCH Feed. Accordingly, the Commission's review of the Exchanges' proposals has focused, in particular, on whether the proposals would result in affiliated exchanges—which are separate self-regulatory organizations under the Act—making their data products or services available to one another at terms (e.g., content, pricing, or latency) that are more favorable than those available to unaffiliated market participants.
The Exchanges have represented that the BATS One Feed would be created using underlying data feeds that are available for subscription by vendors. In recognition that the Exchanges are the source of their own market data and that they are affiliated with one another, the Exchanges have also represented that they will continue to make available all of the individual underlying feeds and that the source of the market data they would use to create the proposed BATS One Feed is the same as the source available to competing vendors.
With respect to latency, the Exchanges have represented that competing vendors could locate their servers in the same facilities as the system creating and supporting the BATS One Feed, and, therefore, could receive the underlying data feeds at the same time as the system creating and supporting the BATS One Feed. Therefore, the Exchanges have contended that, a competing vendor could obtain the underlying data feeds from the Exchanges on the same latency basis as the system that would be performing the aggregation and consolidation of the proposed BATS One Feed and could provide the same kind of product to its customers with the same latency they could achieve by purchasing the BATS One Feed from the Exchanges.[18] 
           The Exchanges have also represented that they have designed the BATS One Feed so that they would have no advantages over a competing vendor with respect to the speed of access to the underlying feeds.
With respect to pricing, although specific fees to be charged for the BATS One Feed are not part of the proposed rule changes, the Exchanges have represented that they will assess a fee that is at least equal to the aggregate cost of the underlying feeds (i.e., at least as much as the cost to a vendor of subscribing to each of the underlying data feeds), plus an additional amount (to be determined) that would reflect the value of the aggregation and consolidation function performed to create the BATS One Feed.[19] 

Based on the Exchange's representations with respect to the content, latency, and pricing of the BATS One Feed—which are central to the Commission's analysis of the proposal—the Commission finds that the Exchanges' proposals are consistent with the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to national securities exchanges. The Commission believes that these representations are designed to ensure that BATS, BYX, EDGA, and EDGX, which are separate self-regulatory organizations, do not, because of their relationship as affiliates, offer one another products or services on a more favorable basis than that available to other competing market participants.
For the foregoing reasons, the Commission finds that the proposed rule changes, as amended, are consistent with section 11A(c)(1)(C) of the Act and Rule 603(a)(2) of Regulation NMS Start Printed Page 78924thereunder,[20] 
           and sections 6(b)(5) and (b)(8) of the Act.[21] 

V. Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Changes, as Modified by Amendments No. 2
The Amendments No. 2 revised the proposed rule changes to: (i) Clarify how the BATS One Feed would be created, (ii) make additional clarifying statements with respect to the latency and cost of the BATS One Feed, and (iii) bring together the discussion of key aspects of the description of the proposal in the same section. Accordingly, the Commission does not believe that the Amendments No. 2 raises any novel regulatory issues and therefore finds that good cause exists to approve the proposals, as modified by Amendments Nos. 1 and 2, on an accelerated basis.
VI. Solicitation of Comments
Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing, including whether Amendments No. 2 to the proposed rule changes are consistent with the Act. Comments may be submitted by any of the following methods:

     Section 11A(c)(1)(C) of the Act requires, among other things, that no self-regulatory organization, member thereof, securities information processor, broker or dealer make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to collect, process, distribute, publish or prepare for distribution or publication any information with respect to quotations for or transactions in any security other than an exempted security in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission shall prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act to assure that all securities information processors may, for purposes of distribution and publication, obtain on fair and reasonable terms such information with respect to quotations for and transactions in such securities as is collected, processed, or prepared for distribution or publication by an exclusive processor of such information acting in such capacity. 15 U.S.C. 78k-1(c)(1)(C).

18.
     The Exchanges have represented that, in order to create the BATS One Feed, the system creating and supporting the BATS One Feed would need to receive the underlying data feeds from each Exchange and, in turn, aggregate and summarize that data to create the BATS One Feed and then distribute it to end users. The Exchanges have stated that this is the same process a competing vendor would undergo should it create a market data product similar to the BATS One Feed to distribute to its end users.

        Back to Citation
      


19.
     SIFMA has objected to the BATS One Feed primarily over concerns about fees for this product being “fair and reasonable,” consistent with section 11A(c)(1)(C) of the Act. The Commission notes, however, that the proposed rule changes do not contain proposed fees and that Exchanges have represented that they will not offer the BATS One Feed until the requisite fee filings under section 19(b) of the Act have been filed and are effective. The Commission will review any such filings when they have been submitted.
 SIFMA has also argued that BATS has circumvented the process of receiving Commission approval and has been actively offering and marketing the BATS One Feed for months. The Commission notes, however, that the Exchanges have represented that, although they have been marketing the BATS One Feed, all of their marketing materials have included statements that the BATS One Feed's implementation was pending to Commission approval and at no point have the Exchanges offered the BATS One product for any use other than for testing and certification.

The Exchange has designated the proposed rule change as one establishing or changing a member due, fee, or other charge imposed by the Exchange under Section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act [3] 
           and Rule 19b-4(f)(2) thereunder,[4] 
           which renders the proposed rule change effective upon filing with the Commission. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.
I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
The Exchange filed a proposal to amend the market data section of its fee schedule to: (i) Establish a Digital Media Enterprise Fee for the BATS One Feed; and (ii) make a non-substantive change to the description of the BATS One Feed Enterprise fee.
The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Exchange's Web site at www.batstrading.com, at the principal office of the Exchange, and at the Commission's Public Reference Room.
II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant parts of such statements.
A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
1. Purpose
The Exchange proposes to amend the market data section of its fee schedule to: (i) Establish a Digital Media Enterprise Fee for the BATS One Feed; and (ii) make a non-substantive change to the description of the BATS One Feed Enterprise fee.[5] 

The Commission recently approved a proposed rule change by the Exchange to establish a new market data product called the BATS One Feed [6] 

           as well as published proposed rule changes to Start Printed Page 17813establish related fees.[7] 
           The BATS One Feed is a data feed that disseminates, on a real-time basis, the aggregate best bid and offer (“BBO”) of all displayed orders for securities traded on BYX and its affiliated exchanges [8] 
           and for which the BATS Exchanges report quotes under the Consolidated Tape Association (“CTA”) Plan or the Nasdaq/UTP Plan.[9] 
           The BATS One Feed also contains the individual last sale information for the BATS Exchanges (collectively with the aggregate BBO, the “BATS One Summary Feed”). In addition, the BATS One Feed contains optional functionality which enables recipients to receive aggregated two-sided quotations from the BATS Exchanges for up to five (5) price levels (“BATS One Premium Feed”).
BATS One Digital Media Enterprise Fee
The Exchange proposes to amend its fee schedule to establish a Digital Media Enterprise Fee of $15,000 per month for the BATS One Summary Feed and $25,000 per month for the BATS One Premium Feed. As an alternative to User fees,[10] 
           a recipient firm may purchase a monthly Digital Media Enterprise license to receive the BATS One Feed from an External Distributor [11] 
           to distribute to an unlimited number of Professional and Non-Professional Users [12] 
           for viewing via television, Web sites, and mobile devices for informational and non-trading purposes only without having to account for the extent of access to the data or the report the number of Users to the Exchange. The Digital Media Enterprise Fee would be in addition to the Data Consolidation Fee.[13] 

Non-Substantive Change to the Description of the BATS One Enterprise Fee
The Exchange proposes a non-substantive change to the description of the BATS One Enterprise fee. The fee schedule currently states that, “[a]s an alternative to User fees, a recipient firm may purchase a monthly Enterprise Fee to receive the BATS One Feed from an External Distributor for an unlimited number of Professional and Non-Professional Users.” The Exchange proposes to amend this sentence in two ways. The first amendment is to state that a recipient firm may purchase a monthly Enterprise license, rather than Enterprise fee, as the term “license” is a more accurate description. The second is to specify that the recipient firm purchasing a monthly enterprise license does so to distribute the BATS One Feed to an unlimited number of Professional and Non-Professional Users.
2. Statutory Basis
BATS One Digital Media Enterprise Fee
The Exchange believes that the proposed Digital Media Enterprise Fee for the BATS One Feed is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act,[14] 
           in general, and Section 6(b)(4) of the Act,[15] 
           in particular, in that it provides for an equitable allocation of reasonable fees among recipients of the data and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination among customers, brokers, or dealers. The Exchange also believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 11(A) of the Act [16] 
           in that it supports (i) fair competition among brokers and dealers, among exchange markets, and between exchange markets and markets other than exchange markets and (ii) the availability to brokers, dealers, and investors of information with respect to quotations for and transactions in securities. Furthermore, the proposed rule change is consistent with Rule 603 of Regulation NMS,[17] 
           which provides that any national securities exchange that distributes information with respect to quotations for or transactions in an NMS stock do so on terms that are not unreasonably discriminatory. In adopting Regulation NMS, the Commission granted self-regulatory organizations and broker-dealers increased authority and flexibility to offer new and unique market data products to the public. It was believed that this authority would expand the amount of data available to consumers, and also spur innovation and competition for the provision of market data.
In addition, the proposed fee is equitable and not unfairly discriminatory because it will apply uniformly to market data vendors, television broadcasters, Web site and mobile service providers. The Exchange believes it is reasonable to establish a lower cost fee structure that is designed to facilitate broader media distribution of the BATS One Data Feed for informational purposes because it will benefit investors generally.
In establishing the Digital Media Enterprise Fee, the Exchange recognizes that there is demand for a more seamless and easier-to-administer data distribution mode that takes into account the expanded variety of media and communication devices that investors utilize today. The Exchange believes the Digital Media Enterprise Fee will be easy to administer because data recipients that purchase it would not be required to differentiate between Professional and Non-Professional Users, account for the extent of access Start Printed Page 17814to the data, or report the number of Users. This is a significant reduction on a recipient firm's administrative burdens and is a significant value to investors. For example, a television broadcaster could display the BATS One Feed data during market-related programming and on its Web site or allow viewers to view the data via their mobile devices, creating a more seamless distribution model that will allow investors more choice in how they receive and view market data, all without having to account for and/or measure who accesses the data and how often they do so.
The proposed Digital Media Enterprise Fee is equitable and reasonable because it will also enable recipient firms to more widely distribute data from the BATS One Feed to investors for informational purposes at a lower cost than is available today. For example, a recipient firm may purchase an Enterprise license in the amount of $50,000 per month for the BATS One Summary Feed and $100,000 per month for the BATS One Premium Feed to receive the BATS One Feed from an External Distributor for an unlimited number of Professional and Non-Professional Users, which is greater than the Digital Media Enterprise fee proposed herein. The Exchange also believes the amount of the Digital Enterprise [sic] is reasonable as compared to the existing Enterprise fees discussed above because the distribution of BATS One Feed data is limited to television, Web sites, and mobile devices for informational purposes only, while distribution of the BATS One Feed data pursuant to an Enterprise license contains no such limitation. The Exchange also believes that the proposed Digital Media Enterprise fee is equitable and reasonable because it is less than similar fees charged by other exchanges.[18] 

The Exchange has taken into consideration its affiliated relationship with BZX, EDGA, and EDGX in proposing the Digital Media Enterprise fee to assure that vendors would be able to offer a similar product on the same terms as the Exchange from a cost perspective. While the BATS Exchanges are the exclusive distributors of the individual data feeds from which certain data elements may be taken to create the BATS One Feed, they are not the exclusive distributors of the aggregated and consolidated information that comprises the BATS One Feed. As discussed in in [sic] the BATS One Fee Proposal,[19] 
           any entity may separately purchase the individual underlying products, and if they so choose, perform a similar aggregation and consolidation function that the Exchange performs in creating the BATS One Feed, and offer a data feed with the same information included in the BATS One Feed to sell and distribute it to its clients with no greater cost than the Exchange.
To enable such competition, the Exchange is offering the Digital Media Enterprise license for the BATS One Feed on terms that a subscriber of the underlying feeds could offer a competing product if it so chooses. The BATS One Feed is comprised of data included in EDGX Depth, EDGA Depth, BYX Depth, and BZX Depth.[20] 
           Currently, an External Distributor could create a competing product to the BATS One Premium Feed [21] 
           by purchasing each of these depth of book products from the individual BATS Exchanges and then performing its own aggregation and consolidation functions. The combined External Distributor fees for these individual data feeds of the BATS Exchanges is $12,500 per month.[22] 
           An External Distributor that seeks to create a competing product to the BATS One Summary Feed could instead subscribe to the following data feeds: EDGX Top, EDGX Last Sale, EDGA Top, EDGA Last Sale, BZX Top, BZX Last Sale, BYX Top, and BYX Last Sale,[23] 
           and then perform their own aggregation and consolidation function. The combined External Distributor fees for these individual data feeds of the BATS Exchanges is $5,000 per month.[24] 
           The Exchange proposes to charge a Digital Media Enterprise Fee ($15,000 per month for the BATS One Summary Feed and $25,000 per month for the BATS One Premium Feed, plus the $1,000 per month Data Consolidation fee) that exceeds the combined External Distributor fees for each of the individual feeds listed above to ensure that vendors could compete with the Exchange by creating the same product as the BATS One Feed to sell to their clients at no greater cost than the Exchange.
The decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in NetCoalition v. SEC, 615 F.3d 525 (D.C. Cir. 2010), upheld the Commission's reliance upon the existence of competitive market mechanisms to set reasonable and equitably allocated fees for proprietary market data.
In fact, the legislative history indicates that the Congress intended that the market system `evolve through the interplay of competitive forces as unnecessary regulatory restrictions are removed' and that the SEC wield its regulatory power `in those situations where competition may not be sufficient,' such as in the creation of a `consolidated transactional reporting system.'

Id. at 535 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 94-229 at 92 (1975), as reprinted in 1975 U.S.C.C.A.N. 323). The court agreed with the Commission's conclusion that “Congress intended that `competitive forces should dictate the services and practices that constitute the U.S. national market system for trading equity securities.' ” [25] 

As explained below in the Exchange's Statement on Burden on Competition, the Exchange believes that there is substantial evidence of competition in the marketplace for data and that the Commission can rely upon such evidence in concluding that the fees established in this filing are the product of competition and therefore satisfy the relevant statutory standards.[26] 

           In addition, the existence of alternatives to the BATS One Feed, including real-time consolidated data, free delayed consolidated data, and proprietary last sale data from other sources, as described below, further ensures that the Exchange cannot set unreasonable fees, or fees that are unreasonably Start Printed Page 17815discriminatory, when vendors and users can elect such alternatives.
As the NetCoalition decision noted, the Commission is not required to undertake a cost-of-service or ratemaking approach, and the Exchange incorporates by reference into this proposed rule change its affiliate's [sic] analysis of this topic in another rule filing.[27] 

For these reasons, the Exchange believes that the proposed fees are reasonable, equitable, and not unfairly discriminatory.
Non-Substantive Change to the Description of the BATS One Enterprise Fee
The Exchange believes that the proposed change to the BATS One Enterprise Fee is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act,[28] 
           in general, and Section 6(b)(4) of the Act,[29] 
           in particular, in that it provides for an equitable allocation of reasonable fees among recipients of the data and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination among customers, brokers, or dealers. The proposal to amend the description of the Enterprise fee within the fee schedule is equitable and reasonable because the changes are designed to clarify the fee schedule and avoid potential investor confusion. The proposed changes do not amend the amount or application of the BATS One Enterprise fee. The proposed changes are also non-discriminatory as they would apply to all recipient firms uniformly.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition
The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended.
BATS One Digital Media Enterprise Fee
The BATS One Feed Digital Media Enterprise fee will enhance competition because it provides investors with an alternative option for receiving market data and competes directly with similar market data products currently offered by the NYSE and Nasdaq.[30] 
           The Exchange notes that there is already actual competition for products similar to the BATS One Feed. The NYSE offers BQT which provides BBO and last sale information for the NYSE, NYSE Arca Equities, Inc. and NYSE MKT LLC.[31] 
           Nasdaq offers Nasdaq Basic, a filed market data product, and through its affiliate, offers NLS Plus which provides a unified view of last sale information similar to the BATS One Feed.[32] 
           The existence of these competing data products demonstrates that there is ample, existing competition for products such as the BATS One Feed and the fees associated by such products is constrained by competition.
In establishing the proposed fees, the Exchange considered the competitiveness of the market for proprietary data and all of the implications of that competition. The Exchange believes that it has considered all relevant factors in order to establish fair, reasonable, and not unreasonably discriminatory fees and an equitable allocation of fees among all Users. The existence of alternatives to the BATS One Feed, including the existing underlying feeds, consolidated data, and proprietary data from other sources, ensures that the Exchange cannot set unreasonable fees, or fees that are unreasonably discriminatory, when vendors and subscribers can elect these alternatives or choose not to purchase a specific proprietary data product if its cost to purchase is not justified by the returns any particular vendor or subscriber would achieve through the purchase.
Finally, although the BATS Exchanges are the exclusive distributors of the individual data feeds from which certain data elements would be taken to create the BATS One Feed, the Exchange is not the exclusive distributor of the aggregated and consolidated information that would compose the BATS One Feed. The Exchange has taken into consideration its affiliated relationship with BZX, EDGA, and EDGX in its design of the BATS One Feed to assure that vendors would be able to offer a similar product on the same terms as the Exchange from a cost perspective. While the BATS Exchanges are the exclusive distributors of the individual data feeds from which certain data elements may be taken to create the BATS One Feed, they are not the exclusive distributors of the aggregated and consolidated information that comprises the BATS One Feed. As discussed in in the BATS One Fee Proposal,[33] 
           any entity may separately purchase the individual underlying products, and if they so choose, perform a similar aggregation and consolidation function that the Exchange performs in creating the BATS One Feed, and offer a data feed with the same information included in the BATS One Feed to sell and distribute it to its clients with no greater cost than the Exchange.
To enable such competition, the amount of the proposed Digital Media Enterprise license compared to the cost of the individual data feeds from the BATS Exchanges would enable a vendor to receive the underlying data feeds and offer a similar product on a competitive basis and with no greater cost than the Exchange. The amount of the proposed Digital Media Enterprise license, coupled with the Data Consolidation Fee, is not lower than the cost to a vendor of receiving the underlying data feeds to create a competing product. Therefore, the amount of the proposed Digital Media Enterprise license the Exchange would charge clients for the BATS One Feed compared to the cost of the individual data feeds from the BATS Exchanges would enable a vendor to receive the underlying data feeds and offer a similar product on a competitive basis and with no greater cost than the Exchange.
Non-Substantive Change to the Description of the BATS One Enterprise Fee
The proposal to amend the description of the Enterprise fee within the fee schedule will not have any impact on completion [sic]. The proposed changes are designed to clarify the fee schedule and avoid potential investor confusion and do not amend the amount or application of the BATS One Enterprise fee.

LOUISVILLE SLUGGER CUSTOM BATS - HELPFUL TIPS


The importance of double-checking your designs before you purchase
On the REVIEW & BUY screen, you will have a chance to review your design choices and make changes before you purchase. This is very important because a customized bat cannot be returned and your purchase is non-refundable. PLEASE MAKE SURE ALL INFORMATION IS CORRECT before you proceed to purchase.
Making changes before you purchase
If you want to make a correction or just change things up, you can do so before you purchase. While in the Review and Buy screen, just click any pencil icon and you'll be taken back to the customize and personalize screens to make your desired changes. Once you are satisfied, remember to review your changes carefully on the REVIEW AND BUY screen because a custom bat cannot be returned.
Our right to refuse personalizations that break our rules
	  				We reserve the right to refuse any requested personalizations that contain any of the following:
	  				
Inappropriate or vulgar words, even abbreviated vulgar words.
Names of Major League players OR Major League teams
NCAA licensed marks
Any other trademarked marks, words or phrases

All final decisions are at the sole discretion of Louisville Slugger. Customize responsibly!
Sharing your masterpiece
You're an artist. A visionary. Show your friends what you just created and reveal to them your true genius! You can share your bat on Facebook, Twitter or send it to all of your family and friends via email by clicking the appropriate icon on the REVIEW AND BUY screen. This is also a great way to send someone a "hint" for the holidays or your birthday, or just because you're awesome.
Add to Cart
You've double checked all of your customizations and personalizations and you're now ready to purchase! To begin, click the "Add to Cart" button from the Review and Buy screen. You will be directed to the cart where you will enter your personal details, payment option, billing and shipping information. Once your payment is accepted, your order will be sent to our factory where we'll start building your custom Louisville Slugger bat!
Shipping
In most cases, Louisville Slugger Custom Bat products will be shipped within 4 weeks from purchase date. You will receive an email when your order has shipped. Louisville Slugger Custom Bat orders are shipped via UPS Ground. Shipping rates are provided during the checkout process.
Louisville Slugger Custom Bats only ship within the United States. We are currently unable to accept or ship international or APO/FPO orders.
Security
Protecting your order information is our first concern. Louisville Slugger protects your Custom Bat order information by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, with a digital certificate provided by Network Solutions.
SSL encrypts your order information to avoid the decoding of that information by anyone other than Louisville Slugger.
Payment Options
	  				For Louisville Slugger Custom Bat orders, we accept the following payment types:
	  				
American Express
MasterCard
Visa

Your credit card will be charged immediately upon placing your Louisville Slugger Custom Bat order. Look for an email when your order has been shipped.
If your credit card was declined while checking out
	  				Your credit card may not be approved for the following reasons:
	  				
The name on the credit card does not match the billing name given
The billing address given does not match the bank records

If approval cannot be obtained during checkout, you will be contacted either by phone or email and the problem will be indicated. You will then be given an opportunity to provide corrected information. So, please take care when entering all personal and credit card details during checkout, as erroneous information may delay your order.
Taxes
Louisville Slugger charges sales tax where required by law. If you are shipping to states where sales tax is charged, the appropriate charges will be added to your merchandise total and displayed in your Louisville Slugger Custom Bat order confirmation email.
Cancellations/Modifications

Warranty Information
