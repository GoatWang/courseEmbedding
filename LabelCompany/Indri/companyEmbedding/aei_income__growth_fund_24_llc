(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  This section contains "forward-looking statements" which represent management's expectations or beliefs concerning future events, including statements regarding anticipated application of cash, expected returns from rental income, growth in revenue, the sufficiency of cash to meet operating expenses, rates of distribution, and other matters. These, and other forward-looking statements, should be evaluated in the context of a number of factors that may affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations, including the following:  - Market and economic conditions which affect the value of the properties the Company owns and the cash from rental income such properties generate;  - the federal income tax consequences of rental income, deductions, gain on sales and other items and the effects of these consequences for Members;  - resolution by the Managing Members of conflicts with which they may be confronted;  - the success of the Managing Members of locating properties with favorable risk return characteristics;  - the effect of tenant defaults; and  - the condition of the industries in which the tenants of properties owned by the Company operate.  Page 10 of 18  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. (Continued)  Application of Critical Accounting Policies  The Company's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Preparing the financial statements requires management to use judgment in the application of these accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments will affect the reported amounts of the Company's assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and will affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. It is possible that the carrying amount of the Company's assets and liabilities, or the results of reported operations, will be affected if management's estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate.  Management of the Company evaluates the following accounting estimates on an ongoing basis, and has discussed the development and selection of these estimates and the management discussion and analysis disclosures regarding them with the managing member of the Company.  Allocation of Purchase Price of Acquired Properties  Upon acquisition of real properties, the Company records them in the financial statements at cost (not including acquisition expenses). The purchase price is allocated to tangible assets, consisting of land and building, and to identified intangible assets and liabilities, which may include the value of above market and below market leases and the value of in-place leases. The allocation of the purchase price is based upon the fair value of each component of the property. Although independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of fair value, in many cases these values will be based upon management's assessment of each property, the selling prices of comparable properties and the discounted value of cash flows from the asset.  The fair values of above market and below market in-place leases will be recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) an estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases measured over a period equal to the non-cancelable term of the lease including any bargain renewal periods. The above market and below market lease values will be capitalized as intangible lease assets or liabilities. Above market lease values will be amortized as an adjustment of rental income over the remaining term of the respective leases. Below market leases will be amortized as an adjustment of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases, including any bargain renewal periods. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts of above market and below market in-place lease values relating to that lease would be recorded as an adjustment to rental income.  Page 11 of 18  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. (Continued)  The fair values of in-place leases will include estimated direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant, and opportunity costs associated with lost rentals which are avoided by acquiring an in-place lease. Direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant may include commissions, tenant improvements, and other direct costs and are estimated, in part, by management's consideration of current market costs to execute a similar lease. These direct costs will be included in intangible lease assets on the balance sheet and will be amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases. The value of opportunity costs will be calculated using the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases over a market absorption period for a similar lease. These intangibles will be included in intangible lease assets on the balance sheet and will be amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts of in-place lease assets relating to that lease would be expensed.  The determination of the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired will require the use of significant assumptions with regard to the current market rental rates, rental growth rates, discount and capitalization rates, interest rates and other variables. If management's estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate, the result would be an inaccurate allocation of purchase price, which could impact the amount of reported net income.  Carrying Value of Properties  The carrying value of the properties is initially recorded at cost, not including acquisition expenses. The Company tests long-lived assets for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For properties the Company will hold and operate, management determines whether impairment has occurred by comparing the property's probability-weighted future undiscounted cash flows to its current carrying value. For properties held for sale, management determines whether impairment has occurred by comparing the property's estimated fair value less cost to sell to its current carrying value. If the carrying value is greater than the net realizable value, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the property to its net realizable value. Changes in these assumptions or analysis may cause material changes in the carrying value of the properties.  Allocation of Expenses  AEI Fund Management, Inc. allocates expenses to each of the funds they manage primarily on the basis of the number of hours devoted by their employees to each fund's affairs. They also allocate expenses at the end of each month that are not directly related to a fund's operations based upon the number of investors in the fund and the fund's capitalization relative to other funds they manage. The Company reimburses these expenses subject to detailed limitations contained in the Operating Agreement.  Page 12 of 18  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. (Continued)  Results of Operations  For the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company recognized rental income from continuing operations of $334,411 and $286,840, respectively. In 2013, rental income increased due to additional rent received from two property acquisitions in 2012. Based on the scheduled rent for the properties owned as of April 30, 2013, the Company expects to recognize rental income from continuing operations of approximately $1,347,000 in 2013.  For the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company incurred LLC administration expenses from affiliated parties of $50,825 and $52,715, respectively. These administration expenses include costs associated with the management of the properties, processing distributions, reporting requirements and communicating with the Limited Members. During the same periods, the Company incurred LLC administration and property management expenses from unrelated parties of $9,709 and $11,222, respectively. These expenses represent direct payments to third parties for legal and filing fees, direct administrative costs, outside audit costs, taxes, insurance and other property costs.  On May 19, 2010, as a result of the sale of the Johnny Carino's restaurant in Littleton, Colorado, the Company received a Note with a principal balance of $1,361,730 as a lease settlement payment from Fired Up, Inc., the parent company of the tenant and guarantor of the Lease. Based on a review of Fired Up's payment history during the first quarter of 2013 and continued monitoring of its financial condition, the Company recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts against the Note Receivable. As a result, a bad debt expense of $330,000 was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2012. At March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, the outstanding principal balance due on the Note, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, was $997,073 and $1,001,399, respectively.  For the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company recognized interest income of $23,886 and $25,711, respectively.  Upon complete disposal of a property or classification of a property as Real Estate Held for Sale, the Company includes the operating results and sale of the property in discontinued operations. In addition, the Company reclassifies the prior periods' operating results of the property to discontinued operations. For the three months ended March 31, 2012, the Company recognized income from discontinued operations of $523,170, representing rental income less property management expenses and depreciation of $54,431 and gain on disposal of real estate of $468,739.  During 2012, the Company sold its remaining 56.435% interest in the Jared Jewelry store in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 17 separate transactions, to unrelated third parties. The Company received total net sale proceeds of $2,633,165, which resulted in a net gain of $927,930. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of the interests sold was $2,054,307 and $349,072, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2012, the net gain was $468,739.  During the second and third quarters of 2012, the Company sold its 31.0% interest in the Fresenius Medical Center in Hiram, Georgia, in four separate transactions, to unrelated third parties. The Company received total net sale proceeds of $816,218, which resulted in a net gain of $139,405. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of the interests sold was $717,359 and $40,546, respectively.  Page 13 of 18  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. (Continued)  Management believes inflation has not significantly affected income from operations. Leases may contain rent increases, based on the increase in the Consumer Price Index over a specified period, which will result in an increase in rental income over the term of the leases. Inflation also may cause the real estate to appreciate in value. However, inflation and changing prices may have an adverse impact on the operating margins of the properties' tenants, which could impair their ability to pay rent and subsequently reduce the Net Cash Flow available for distributions.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  During the three months ended March 31, 2013, the Company's cash balances decreased $295,614 as a result of distributions paid to the Members in excess of cash generated from operating and investing activities. During the three months ended March 31, 2012, the Company's cash balances increased $1,450,652 as a result of cash generated from the sale of property and cash generated from operating activities in excess of distributions paid to the Members.  Net cash provided by operating activities decreased from $452,538 in 2012 to $312,367 in 2013 as a result of a decrease in total rental and interest income in 2013 and net timing differences in the collection of payments from the tenants and the payment of expenses, which were partially offset by a decrease in LLC administration and property management expenses in 2013.  The major components of the Company's cash flow from investing activities are investments in real estate and proceeds from the sale of real estate. During the three months ended March 31, 2012, the Company generated cash flow from the sale of real estate of $1,307,394. In subsequent periods, a portion of the cash generated from property sales was reinvested in additional real estate.  On May 14, 2012, the Company purchased a Family Dollar store in McDonough, Georgia for $1,640,500. The property is leased to Family Dollar Stores of Georgia, Inc., a subsidiary of Family Dollar Stores, Inc., under a Lease Agreement with a remaining primary term of 10.4 years (as of the date of purchase) and annual rent of $136,168.  On July 25, 2012, the Company purchased a 50% interest in a Coliseum Health urgent care clinic in Macon, Georgia for $967,500. The property is leased to Macon Healthcare, LLC under a Lease Agreement with a remaining primary term of 11.7 years and annual rent of $79,625 for the interest purchased. The remaining interest in the property was purchased by AEI Income & Growth Fund 25 LLC, an affiliate of the Company.  The Company's primary use of cash flow, other than investment in real estate, is distribution and redemption payments to Members. The Company declares its regular quarterly distributions before the end of each quarter and pays the distribution in the first week after the end of each quarter. The Company attempts to maintain a stable distribution rate from quarter to quarter. Redemption payments are paid to redeeming Members on a semi-annual basis.  Page 14 of 18  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. (Continued)  For the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company declared distributions of $309,278 and $491,098, respectively. Pursuant to the Operating Agreement, distributions of Net Cash Flow were allocated 97% to the Limited Members and 3% to the Managing Members. Distributions of Net Proceeds of Sale were allocated 99% to the Limited Members and 1% to the Managing Members. The Limited Members received distributions of $300,000 and $480,002 and the Managing Members received distributions of $9,278 and $11,096 for the periods, respectively. In March, September and December 2012, the Company declared special distributions of net sale proceeds of $181,818, $181,818 and $303,030, respectively, which resulted in higher distributions declared in 2012 and a higher distributions payable at December 31, 2012. The special distributions represented a return of capital of $7.37, $7.37 and $12.30 per LLC Unit, respectively. The Company anticipates the remaining net sale proceeds will either be reinvested in additional property or distributed to the Members in the future.  The Company may acquire Units from Limited Members who have tendered their Units to the Company. Such Units may be acquired at a discount. The Company will not be obligated to purchase in any year any number of Units that, when aggregated with all other transfers of Units that have occurred since the beginning of the same calendar year (excluding Permitted Transfers as defined in the Operating Agreement), would exceed 2% of the total number of Units outstanding on January 1 of such year. In no event shall the Company be obligated to purchase Units if, in the sole discretion of the Managing Member, such purchase would impair the capital or operation of the Company.  During the first three months of 2013, the Company did not redeem any Units from the Limited Members. On October 1, 2012, two Limited Members redeemed a total of  At March 31, 2013, the Company had entered into one formal contractual commitment to expend capital. In March 2013, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase a 27% interest in a PetSmart store in Gonzales, Louisiana for $842,400. The purchase is subject to contingencies, including completion of due diligence and title work, and may not be completed. The property is leased to PetSmart, Inc. under a Lease Agreement with a remaining primary term of 9.8 years and annual rent of $63,186 for the interest to be purchased. The remaining interest in the property is scheduled to be purchased by AEI Income & Growth Fund 25 LLC.  The continuing rent payments from the properties, together with cash generated from property sales, should be adequate to fund continuing distributions and meet other Company obligations on both a short-term and long-term basis.  Page 15 of 18  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS. (Continued)  The Economy and Market Conditions  The impact of conditions in the economy over the last few years, including the turmoil in the credit markets, has adversely affected many real estate investment funds. However, the absence of mortgage financing on the Company's properties eliminates the risks of foreclosure and debt-refinancing that can negatively impact the value and distributions of leveraged real estate investment funds. Nevertheless, a prolonged economic downturn may adversely affect the operations of the Company's tenants and their cash flows. If a tenant were to default on its lease obligations, the Company's income would decrease, its distributions would likely be reduced and the value of its properties might decline.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  As of March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, the Company had no material off-balance sheet arrangements that had or are reasonably likely to have current or future effects on its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.
