Morningstar Ratings1


as of 06/30/2017



Overall





3 Year





5 Year





10 Year







				Morningstar rated the Value Fund among 
1091,
1091,
936
and 
681
Large Value
funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable) 
ending 06/30/2017, respectively.


The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance 
figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The 
weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year 
rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating 
for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most 
weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is 
included in all three rating periods.
			

Performance Comparison
as of 
					
						06/30/2017
					
				







							This chart shows the value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund over the past 10 years or since its inception (for funds lacking 10-year records). The result is compared with benchmarks, which may include a broad-based market index and a peer group average or index. Market indexes do not include expenses, which are deducted from fund returns as well as mutual fund averages and indexes.
						
Benchmark Definitions



1 The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, 
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at 
least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation 
in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent 
performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating 
for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, 
and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of 
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating 
formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest 
impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

^ The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.

All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal.
*Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.
Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis. A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years. For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.
When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.
All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk. Please consult the funds’ prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds’ risks.

 About Us

Calvert is a recognized leader in Responsible Investing. Our mission is to deliver superior long-term performance to our clients and to enable them to achieve positive impact.
Calvert Research and Management traces its roots to Calvert Investments, which was founded in 1976 and was the first to launch a socially responsible mutual fund that avoided investment in companies that did business in apartheid-era South Africa. Today, the Calvert Funds are one of the largest and most diversified families of responsibly invested mutual funds, encompassing actively and passively managed strategies, U.S. and international equity strategies, fixed-income strategies, and asset allocation funds — all managed in accordance with the Calvert Principles for Responsible Investment.
Through the years, the Calvert Funds have stayed at the forefront of Responsible Investing, applying innovative investment strategies, groundbreaking research, shareholder advocacy programs and public policy initiatives. Today, we’re helping a new generation of investors see financial potential through the lens of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors.

NOTE A � SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
�
General: The Calvert World Values Fund, Inc. (the �Fund�) is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as an open-end management investment company.� The Fund operates as a series fund with three separate portfolios: International Equity, Capital Accumulation, and International Opportunities.� International Equity and International Opportunities are registered as diversified portfolios.� Capital Accumulation is registered as a non-diversified portfolio.� The operation of each series is accounted for separately.� International Equity offers Class A, Class B, Class C, Class I and Class Y shares. Capital Accumulation offers Class A, Class B, Class C, Class I and Class Y (effective January 31, 2011) shares.� International Opportunities offers Class
A, Class C, Class I and Class Y shares.� Class A shares are sold with a maximum front-end sales charge of 4.75%. Class B shares are sold without a front-end sales charge. With certain exceptions, the Fund will impose a deferred sales charge at the time of redemption, depending on how long investors have owned the shares. �Effective, March 1, 2010, Class B shares are no longer offered for purchase, except through reinvestment of dividends and/or distributions and through certain exchanges.� Class C shares are sold without a front-end sales charge. With certain exceptions, the Fund will impose a deferred sales charge on shares sold within one year of purchase. Class B and Class C shares have higher levels of expenses than Class A shares. Class I shares require a minimum account balance of $1,000,000. The $1 million minimum initial investment may be waived for certain institutional accounts, where it is believed to be in
the best interest of the Fund and its shareholders. Class I shares have no front-end or deferred sales charge and have lower levels of expenses than Class A shares.� Class Y shares are generally only available to wrap or similar fee-based programs offered by financial intermediaries that have entered into an agreement with the Fund�s Distributor to offer Class Y shares.� Class Y shares have no front-end or deferred sales charge and have lower levels of expenses than Class A shares.� Each class has different: (a) dividend rates, due to differences in Distribution Plan expenses and other class-specific expenses, (b) exchange privileges and (c) class-specific voting rights.
�
Security Valuation: Net asset value per share is determined every business day as of the close of the regular session of the New York Stock Exchange (generally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time). The Fund uses independent pricing services approved by the Board of Directors to value its investments wherever possible.� Investments for which market quotations are not available or deemed not reliable are fair valued in good faith under the direction of the Board of Directors.� In determining fair value, the Board considers all relevant qualitative and quantitative information available. These factors are subject to change over time and are reviewed periodically. The values assigned to fair value investments are based on available information and do not necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized. Further,
because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and the differences could be material. 
�
The following securities were fair valued in good faith under the direction of the Board of Directors as of December 31, 2011:

��
The Fund utilizes various methods to measure the fair value of its investments. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) establishes a disclosure hierarchy that categorizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to value assets and liabilities at measurement date. These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below:
�
Level 1 � quoted prices in active markets for identical securities
Level 2 � other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.)

�

�



�
Level 3 � significant unobservable inputs (including the Fund�s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments)
�
The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.
�
Changes in valuation techniques may result in transfers in or out of an investment�s assigned level within the hierarchy during the period.� Valuation techniques used to value the Fund's investments by major category are as follows. 
�
Equity securities, including restricted securities and venture capital securities, for which market quotations are readily available, are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price as reported by an independent pricing service on the primary market or exchange on which they are traded and are categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy. Foreign securities are valued based on quotations from the principle market in which such securities are normally traded. If events occur after the close of the principle market in which foreign securities are traded, and before the close of business of the Fund, that are expected to materially affect the value of those securities, then they are valued at their fair value taking these events into account. The Calvert World Values International Equity Fund and Calvert International
Opportunities Fund have retained a third party fair value pricing service to quantitatively analyze the price movement of its holdings on foreign exchanges and to automatically fair value if the variation from the prior day�s closing price exceeds specified parameters.� Such securities would be categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy in these circumstances. Utilizing this technique may result in transfers between Level 1 and Level 2.� For restricted securities and private placements where observable inputs are limited, assumptions about market activity and risk are used and are categorized as Level 3 in the hierarchy. 
�
Venture capital securities for which market quotations are not readily available are fair valued by the Fund�s Board of Directors and are categorized as Level 3 in the hierarchy.� Venture capital direct equity securities are generally valued using the most appropriate and applicable method to measure fair value in light of each company�s situation.� Methods may include market, income or cost approaches with discounts as appropriate based on assumptions of liquidation or exit risk. Examples of the market approach are subsequent rounds of financing, comparable transactions, and revenue times an industry multiple.� An example of the income approach is the discounted cash flow. Examples of the cost approach are replacement cost, salvage value, or net asset percentage. Venture capital limited partnership (LP) securities are valued at the fair value reported by the general partner of the partnership adjusted as
necessary to reflect subsequent capital calls and distributions and any other available information. In the absence of a reported LP unit value it may be estimated based on the Fund�s percentage equity in the partnership and/or other balance sheet information and portfolio value for the most recently available period reported by the general partner.� In some cases adjustments may be made to account for daily pricing of material public holdings within the partnership. Venture capital debt securities are valued based on assumptions of credit and market risk. For venture capital securities denominated in foreign currency, the fair value is marked to the daily exchange rate. 
Debt securities, including restricted securities, are valued based on evaluated prices received from independent pricing services or from dealers who make markets in such securities and are generally categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy. Short-term instruments of sufficient credit quality, with a maturity at issuance�of sixty days or less for which quotations are not readily available, are valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, and are categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy. 
When independent prices are unavailable or unreliable, debt securities may be valued utilizing pricing matrices which consider similar factors that would be used by independent pricing services. These are generally categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy but may be Level 3 depending on the circumstances. 
�
The following is a summary of the inputs used to value the Fund�s net assets as of December 31, 2011:

�
�
Restricted Securities: The Fund may invest in securities that are subject to legal or contractual
restrictions on resale. Generally, these securities may only be sold publicly upon registration under the Securities Act of 1933 or in transactions exempt from such registration. Information regarding restricted securities is included at the end of the Schedules of Investments.
�
Security Transactions and Net Investment Income: Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses are recorded on an identified cost basis and may include proceeds from litigation. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date or, in the case of dividends on certain foreign securities, as soon as the Fund is informed of the ex-dividend date. Distributions received on securities that represent a return of capital or capital gains are recorded as a reduction of cost of investments and/or as a realized gain. Interest income, which includes amortization of premium and accretion of discount on debt securities, is accrued as earned. Investment income and realized and unrealized gains and losses are allocated to separate classes of shares based upon the relative net assets of each
class. Expenses arising in connection with a class are charged directly to that class. Expenses common to the classes are allocated to each class in proportion to their relative net assets.� Withholding taxes on foreign dividends have been provided for in accordance with the Fund�s understanding of the applicable country�s tax rules and rates.
�
Foreign Currency Transactions: The Fund�s accounting records are maintained in U. S. dollars. For valuation of assets and liabilities on each date of net asset value determination, foreign denominations are translated into U.S. dollars using the current exchange rate. Security transactions, income and expenses are translated at the prevailing rate of exchange on the date of the event. The effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on securities and foreign currencies is included in the net realized and unrealized gain or
loss on securities and foreign currencies.
�
Distributions to Shareholders: Distributions to shareholders are recorded by the Fund on ex-dividend date. Dividends from net investment income and distributions from net realized capital gains, if any, are paid at least annually. Distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting principles; accordingly, periodic reclassifications are made within the Fund�s capital accounts to reflect income and gains available for distribution under income
tax regulations.
�
Estimates: The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
�
Redemption Fees: The Fund charges a 2% redemption fee on redemptions, including exchanges, made within 30 days of purchase in the same Fund (within seven days for Class I shares). The redemption fee is paid to the Class of the Fund from which the redemption is made, and is accounted for as an addition to paid-in capital.� The fee is intended to discourage market-timers by ensuring that short-term trading costs are borne by the investors making the transactions and not the shareholders already in the Fund.
�
Expense Offset Arrangement: The Fund has an arrangement with its custodian bank whereby the custodian�s fees may be paid indirectly by credits earned on the Fund�s cash on deposit with the bank. These credits are used to reduce the Fund�s expenses. Such a deposit arrangement may be an alternative to overnight investments.
�
Federal Income Taxes: No provision for federal income or excise tax is required since the Fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code and to distribute substantially all of its taxable earnings.
�

�

�



�
Management has analyzed the Fund�s tax positions taken for all open federal income tax years and has concluded that no provision for federal income tax is required in the Fund�s financial statements. A Fund�s federal tax return is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for a period of three years.
New Accounting Pronouncements:� In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (�FASB�) issued Accounting Standards Update (�ASU�) No. 2011-04, �Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs.�� ASU No. 2011-04 requires disclosure of the amounts of any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2, and the reasons for the transfers.� For Level 3 fair value measurements, ASU No. 2011-04 requires disclosure of quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used.� In addition for Level 3 fair value measurements, ASU No. 2011-04 requires a description of the valuation processes used by the reporting entity and ASU No. 2011-04 requires a narrative description of the sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in unobservable inputs if a change
in those inputs to a different amount might result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement.� ASU No. 2011-04 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011.� Management is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU No. 2011-04 will have on the Fund�s financial statements and related disclosures.

Capital losses may be used to offset future taxable capital gains until expiration. �Under the recently enacted Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010, the Funds will be permitted to carry forward capital losses incurred in taxable years beginning after December 22, 2010 for an unlimited period. Losses incurred during those future years will be required to be utilized prior to the losses incurred in pre-enactment taxable years. As a result of this ordering rule, pre-enactment capital loss carryforwards may more likely expire unused. �Also, post-enactment capital losses that are carried forward will retain their 
character as either short-term or long-term capital losses rather than being considered all short-term as under previous law.

Item 2. Controls and Procedures.
�
(a)������� The principal executive and financial officers concluded that the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the 1940 Act) are effective, based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by Rule 30a-3(b) under the 1940 Act and Rules 13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act, as of a date within 90 days of the filing date of this report.� This determination was based on the change to the registrant�s internal control over financial reporting described in Item 2(b) below made in response to a material
weakness comment from registrant�s independent public accounting firm in December 2011.
�
(b)������� There was a change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the 1940 Act) that occurred during the registrant's last fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting. �This change provides for (1) the remodeling and testing of the models used for all fixed income securities that are being priced under fair value procedures by the Advisor; (2) conducting of back-testing that reasonably supports the assumptions used in fair valuing the securities; (3) modifying the internal
compliance monitoring system to report the asset weighting of each fixed income security, providing the percentage of any security owned in an individual Fund and across the Fund complex; (4) implementing a manual control to monitor for and report to the internal pricing committee on any security where the primary and/or secondary pricing vendor has been overridden for more than a certain number of days, as specified in the Fund's procedures; and (5) enhanced escalation procedures to address any fair valuation concerns.
�
Item 3. Exhibits.
�
A separate certification for each principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the registrant as required by Rule 30a-2(a) under the 1940 Act (17 CFR 270.30a-2(a)).

Introduction to the Funds                                                       
Calvert Social Investment Fund ("CSIF") and Calvert World Values Fund ("CWVF")  
International Equity Fund (each a "Fund" and together, the "Funds") each seek   
to provide growth of capital or current income through investment in            
enterprises that make a significant contribution to society through their       
products and services and through the way they do business. See "Investment
Objectives and Policies." Investments are selected on the basis of their        
ability to contribute to the dual objectives of the Funds. Potential            
investments are first selected for financial soundness and then evaluated       
according to a particular Fund's social criteria.                               

Five different Portfolios are offered:                                          

CSIF Managed Growth Portfolio (a balanced fund)                               
CSIF Bond Portfolio                                                           
CSIF Equity Portfolio                                                         
CSIF Money Market Portfolio                                                   
CWVF International Equity Fund                                                

An investment in a Fund is neither insured nor guaranteed by the US             
Government. There can be no assurance that the CSIF Money Market Portfolio      
will be successful in maintaining a constant net asset value of $1.00 per       
share.                                                                          

About This Prospectus                                                           
Please read this Prospectus before investing. It is designed to provide you     
with information you ought to know before investing and to help you decide if   
the Funds' goals match your own. Keep this document for future reference.       

Statements of Additional Information for the Funds (dated January 31, 1998)     
have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are             
incorporated by reference. These free Statements are available upon request:    
800-368-2748.                                                                   

The SEC maintains a Web site at http://www.sec.gov that contains the            
Statements of Additional Information, material incorporated by reference, and   
other information regarding the Funds.                                          

THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE SECURITIES AND    
EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION, NOR HAS THE FEDERAL OR  
ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION PASSED ON THE ACCURACY OR ADEQUACY OF THIS      
PROSPECTUS. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.           
SHARES OF A FUND ARE NOT DEPOSITS OR OBLIGATIONS OF, OR GUARANTEED OR ENDORSED  
BY, ANY BANK, AND ARE NOT FEDERALLY INSURED BY THE FDIC, THE FEDERAL RESERVE    
BOARD, OR ANY OTHER AGENCY. WHEN INVESTORS SELL SHARES OF A FUND, THE VALUE     
MAY BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE AMOUNT ORIGINALLY PAID.                         

Purchase Information                                                            
CSIF Managed Growth and Equity Portfolios and CWVF International Equity Fund    
offer two classes of shares, each with different expense levels and sales       
charges. You may choose to purchase (i) Class A shares, with a sales charge     
imposed at the time you purchase the shares ("front-end sales charge"), or      
(ii) Class C shares which impose neither a front-end sales charge nor a         
contingent deferred sales charge. Class C shares are not available through all  
brokers. Class C shares have a higher level of expenses than Class A shares,    
including higher Rule 12b-1 fees. These alternatives permit you to choose the   
method of purchasing shares that is most beneficial to you, depending on the    
amount of the purchase, the length of time you expect to hold the shares, and   
other circumstances. CSIF Bond Portfolio only offers Class A shares with a      
front-end sales charge. See "Alternative Sales Options" for further details.    

To Open An Account                                                              
Call your broker, or complete and return the enclosed Account Application.      
Minimum investment is $1,000 for CSIF, and $2,000 for CWVF.                     

Highlights                                                                      

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES 

The Funds are designed to provide opportunities for investors seeking growth    
of capital or current income through investment in enterprises that make a      
significant contribution to society through their products and services and     
through the way they do business.                                               

CSIF Money Market Portfolio seeks to provide the highest level of current       
income, consistent with liquidity, safety and stability, through investment in  
money market instruments, including securities issued or guaranteed by          
agencies of the US Government and repurchase agreements with banks and brokers  
secured by such instruments, selected in accordance with the Fund's investment  
and social criteria. The Money Market Portfolio is designed for short-term      
cash management and for investors needing stability of principal. The Money     
Market Portfolio seeks to maintain a constant net asset value of $1.00 per      
share.                                                                          

CSIF Managed Growth Portfolio is a balanced fund which seeks to achieve a       
total return above the rate of inflation through an actively managed,           
diversified portfolio of common and preferred stocks, bonds and money market    
instruments which offer income and capital growth opportunity and which         
satisfy the investment and social concern criteria.                             

CSIF Bond Portfolio seeks to provide as high a level of current income as is    
consistent with prudent investment risk and preservation of capital through     
investment in bonds and other straight debt securities, selected pursuant to    
the Fund's investment and social criteria.                                      

CSIF Equity Portfolio seeks growth of capital through investment in the equity  
securities of issuers within industries perceived to offer opportunities for    
potential capital appreciation and which satisfy the Fund's investment and      
social criteria.                                                                

CWVF International Equity Fund seeks to achieve a high total return consistent  
with reasonable risk, by investing primarily in a globally diversified          
portfolio of equity securities.                                                 
There can be no assurance that the Funds will be successful in meeting their    
investment objectives. For a further description of the Funds and discussion    
of the Funds' investment techniques, see "Investment Objectives and Policies,"
"Investment Selection Process" and "Additional Investment Policies."

DIVERSIFICATION OF INVESTMENTS AND RISKS                                        

By pooling the investments of many investors with similar investment            
objectives, investors have an opportunity to benefit from a broadly             
diversified portfolio. For a discussion of the risks which may be associated    
with investments in repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, privately     
placed securities, non-investment grade debt securities, the securities of      
foreign issuers, and options and futures contracts, see "Additional Investment
Policies" and the Statements of Additional Information.

asset value next determined after a proper redemption request is received by    
the transfer agent. Investors may redeem shares by mail or by telephone,

The example, which is hypothetical, should not be considered a representation   
of past or future expenses. Actual expenses and return may be higher or lower   
than those shown.                                                               

Explanation of Table: The purpose of the table is to assist you in              
understanding the various costs and expenses that an investor may bear          
directly (shareholder transaction costs) or indirectly (annual fund operating   
expenses).                                                                      

1. Net Operating Expenses after reduction for fees paid indirectly were:        
CSIF Money Market - 0.87%             CSIF Equity, A - 1.20%                    
CSIF Managed Growth - A 1.12%         CSIF Equity, C - 2.30%                    
CSIF Managed Growth - C 2.27%         CWVF International Equity, A - 1.76%      
CSIF Bond - 1.15%                     CWVF International Equity, C - 2.76%      

Shareholder Transaction Costs                                                   
are charges you pay when you buy or sell shares. See "Reduced Sales Charges"    
at Exhibit A to see if you qualify for possible reductions in the sales         
charge. If you request a wire redemption of less than $1,000, you will be       
charged a $5 wire fee.                                                          

Annual Fund Operating Expenses                                                  
are based on historical expenses. Management fees for CSIF Bond have been       
restated to reflect a partial waiver of the fees, in effect until 2/29/2000.    
Management Fees are paid by each Fund to CAMCO for managing the Funds'          
investments and business affairs. Management fees include the Subadvisory fees  
paid by CAMCO to the Subadvisors, and, for CWVF International Equity Fund, the  
administrative fee paid by the Fund to Calvert Administrative Services          
Company, an affiliate of CAMCO. The Management Fees for the CSIF Equity         
Portfolio include a performance adjustment, which could cause the fee to be as  
high as 0.90% or as low as 0.50%, depending on the Equity Portfolio's           
performance. The Management fees for the CSIF Managed Growth Portfolio include  
a performance adjustment which could cause the fee to be as high as 0.85% or    
as low as 0.55%, depending on its performance. The Funds incur Other Expenses   
for maintaining shareholder records, furnishing shareholder statements and      
reports, and other services. Management Fees and Other Expenses have already    
been reflected in each Fund's yield or share price and are not charged          
directly to individual shareholder accounts.                                    

If CAMCO had not reimbursed or waived fees, the current Other Expenses and      
Total Fund Operating Expenses for the CSIF Money Market Portfolio would have    
been 0.50% and 1.00%, respectively.                                             

The Funds' Rule 12b-1 fees include an asset-based sales charge. Thus,           
long-term shareholders in a Fund may pay more in total sales charges than the   
economic equivalent of the maximum front-end sales charge permitted by rules    
of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the "NASD"). In        
addition to the compensation itemized above (sales charge and Rule 12b-1        
service and distribution fees), certain broker/dealers and/or their             
salespersons may receive compensation for the sale and distribution of the      
securities or for services to the Funds. See the Statements of Additional       
Information, "Method of Distribution."
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS                                                            

The following tables provide information about the financial history of each

portfolio investments.                                                          

CSIF Money Market Portfolio                                                     
The Money Market Portfolio seeks to provide the highest level of current        
income, consistent with liquidity, safety and security of capital, through      
investment in money market instruments, including repurchase agreements with    
recognized securities brokers and banks secured by such instruments, and        
reverse repurchase agreements, all selected in accordance with the Fund's       
investment and social criteria. The Money Market Portfolio attempts to          
maintain a constant net asset value of $1.00 per share.                         

The Money Market Portfolio invests only in high grade, short-term money market  
instruments which may include: obligations issued or guaranteed as to           
principal by the United States Government, its agencies and instrumentalities;  
US dollar-denominated certificates of deposit, time deposits and bankers'       
acceptances of US banks, generally banks with assets in excess of $1 billion;   
taxable municipal securities, including variable rate demand notes; and         
commercial paper (including participation interests in loans extended by banks  
to issuers of commercial paper) that at the date of investment is rated A-1 by  
Standard & Poor's Ratings Group ("S&P") or Prime-1 by Moody's Investors         
Service, Inc. ("Moody's"), or, if not rated, is of comparable quality.          

CSIF Managed Growth Portfolio                                                   
The Managed Growth Portfolio seeks to achieve a total return above the rate of  
inflation through an actively managed portfolio of stocks, bonds and money      
market instruments (including repurchase agreements secured by such             
instruments) selected with a concern for the investment and social impact of    
each investment. It is not the policy of the Managed Growth Portfolio to take   
risks to obtain speculatively or aggressively high returns. The portfolio is a  
"balanced" portfolio, and intends to invest approximately 55% to 60% of its     
assets in equities and 40% to 45% in fixed income securities. See "Portfolio
Managers" for more information. Generally, equity investments are selected by   
the subadvisors, subject to direction and control by CAMCO and the CSIF Board   
of Trustees. CAMCO manages the Portfolio's fixed-income assets and determines   
the mix for the Managed Growth Portfolio depending upon its view of market      
conditions and the economic outlook.                                            

CSIF Managed Growth Portfolio may purchase both common and preferred stock.     
The Portfolio normally invests in bonds which are considered investment-grade,  
including bonds which are direct or indirect obligations of the US Government,  
or which at the date of investment are rated AAA, AA, A, or BBB by S&P or Aaa,  
Aa, A, or Baa by Moody's. The Portfolio may purchase lower-rated obligations    
(those rated below BBB, which are considered noninvestment-grade securities)    
but no more than 20% of its assets may be invested in obligations rated lower   
than B. The Portfolio may purchase, without limitation, bonds which are         
unrated but of comparable quality to bonds rated B or better as determined by   
CAMCO under the supervision of the CSIF Board of Trustees. The Managed Growth   
Portfolio does not currently hold or intend to invest more than 5% of its net   
assets in noninvestment-grade securities. See the Statement of Additional       
Information ("SAI") for additional information concerning bond ratings.         

CSIF Bond Portfolio                                                             
The Bond Portfolio seeks to provide as high a level of current income as is     
consistent with prudent investment risk and preservation of capital through     
investment in bonds and other straight debt securities, including taxable       
municipal securities, selected pursuant to the Fund's investment and social     
criteria. The Bond Portfolio is neither speculative nor conservative in its     
investment policies and will take reasonable risks in seeking to achieve its    
investment objective of current income and preservation of capital. Debt        
securities may be long-term, intermediate-term, short-term, or any combination  
thereof, depending on the Advisors' evaluation of current and anticipated       
market patterns and trends; the Advisors expect that the Bond Portfolio's       
average weighted maturity will range between 5 and 20 years. The value of the   
Portfolio will vary inversely with changes in interest rates.                   

In seeking to achieve these objectives, it is anticipated that under normal     
conditions the Bond Portfolio will invest at least 65% of the value of its net  
assets in publicly-traded straight debt securities which have an investment     
grade rating of A or above as determined by a nationally recognized rating      
service such as S&P or Moody's, or if unrated, determined to be of comparable   
quality. The Portfolio may also invest in obligations issued or guaranteed by   
the US Government or its agencies or instrumentalities, or in cash and cash     
equivalents. Up to 20% of the Bond Portfolio's total assets may be invested in  
straight debt securities which are not rated within the four highest grades,    
in convertible debt securities, convertible preferred and preferred stocks, or  
other securities. The Bond Portfolio does not currently hold or intend to       
invest more than 5% (approximately) of its net assets in noninvestment-grade    
securities. See the SAI for additional information concerning bond ratings.     

CSIF Equity Portfolio                                                           
The Equity Portfolio seeks growth of capital through investment in the equity   
securities of issuers within industries perceived to offer opportunities for    
potential capital appreciation and which satisfy the Fund's investment and      
social criteria. The Equity Portfolio is neither speculative nor conservative   
in its investment policies and will take reasonable risks in seeking to         
achieve its investment objective of growth of capital.                          

CSIF Equity Portfolio normally invests at least 80% of the value of its net     
assets in equity securities. Such securities include common stocks,             
convertible securities and preferred stocks. For liquidity purposes or pending  
the investment of the proceeds of the sale of its shares, this Portfolio may    
invest up to 20% of the value of its assets in money market instruments,        
including: obligations of the US Government, its agencies and                   
instrumentalities; certificates of deposit of banks, generally, those having    
total assets of at least one billion dollars; and commercial paper or other     
corporate notes of investment grade quality. Such securities may be purchases   
subject to repurchase agreements with recognized securities brokers and banks.  
If the Equity Portfolio has assumed a temporary defensive posture, there is no  
limitation on the percentage of its assets which may be invested in money       
market instruments. The Equity Portfolio does not currently hold or intend to   
invest more than 5% of its net assets in noninvestment-grade debt securities.   

ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT POLICIES 

Calvert Social Investment Fund                                                  
As a matter of fundamental investment policy which cannot be changed without    
shareholder approval, no more than 25% of the value of a Portfolio's assets     
may be invested in any one industry, no more than 5% of a Portfolio's assets    
may be invested in any one company, nor may a Portfolio, or CSIF in the         
aggregate, purchase more than 10% of the voting securities of any issuer.       

CSIF Managed Growth, Bond and Equity Portfolios each can use various            
techniques to increase or decrease its exposure to changing security prices,    
interest rates, or other factors that affect security values. These techniques  
may involve derivative transactions such as buying and selling options and      
futures contracts and leveraged notes, entering into swap agreements, and       
purchasing indexed securities. The Portfolios can use these practices either    
as substitution or as protection against an adverse move in the Portfolios to   
adjust the risk and return characteristics of the Portfolios. If the Advisor    
and/or Subadvisor judges market conditions incorrectly or employs a strategy    
that does not correlate well with a Portfolio's investments, or if the          
counterparty to the transaction does not perform as promised, these techniques  
could result in a loss. These techniques may increase the volatility of a       
Portfolio and may involve a small investment of cash relative to the magnitude  
of the risk assumed. Any instruments determined to be illiquid are subject to   
the Portfolios' 15% restriction on illiquid securities. See the CSIF SAI for    
more detail about these strategies.                                             

CSIF may engage in repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements. In  
a repurchase agreement, the Portfolio buys a security subject to the right and  
obligation to sell it back at a higher price. In order to minimize any risk     
involved, the Portfolio engages in such transactions only with recognized       
securities brokers determined by the Advisor to present a minimal credit risk.  
Repurchase agreements are fully collateralized and always have a maturity of    
less than one year. In a reverse repurchase agreement, the Portfolio sells a    
security subject to the right and obligation to buy it back at a higher price.  
The Portfolio then invests the proceeds from the transaction in another         
obligation in which it is authorized to invest. For reverse repurchase          
agreements, the Portfolio maintains liquid assets equal in value to the         
repurchase price in a segregated account.                                       

Each CSIF Portfolio may borrow money from banks (and pledge its assets to       
secure such borrowing) for temporary or emergency purposes, but not for         
leverage. Such borrowing may not exceed 10% of the value of that Portfolio's    
total assets.                                                                   

The Managed Growth and Bond Portfolio's fixed-income investment strategies      
caused them to have a relatively high portfolio turnover compared to other      
portfolios. A portfolio with high turnover may incur higher transaction costs,  
such as custodian and settlement fees. During fiscal 1997, brokerage            
commission expenses remained relatively level even though turnover increased    
significantly, since the fixed income investments are traded on a spread,       
rather than a commission basis.                                                 

CSIF has adopted the following operating (i.e., non-fundamental) investment     
policies which may be changed by the Board of Trustees without shareholder      
approval:                                                                       
CSIF Managed Growth, Bond, and Equity Portfolios may not purchase or hold       
illiquid securities if more than 15% of the value of that Portfolio's net       
assets would be invested in such securities. CSIF Money Market illiquid         
securities limitation is 10% of net assets.                                     

Each CSIF Portfolio may invest up to 25% of its assets in the securities of     
foreign issuers. The Portfolios may purchase foreign securities directly, on    
foreign markets, or those represented by American Depositary Receipts           
("ADRs"), or other receipts evidencing ownership of foreign securities, such as 
International Depository Receipts and Global Depositary Receipts. ADRs are US   
dollar-denominated and traded in the US on exchanges or over the counter.       
Foreign securities may involve additional risks, including currency             
fluctuations, risks relating to political or economic conditions, and the       
potentially less stringent investor protection and disclosure standards of      
foreign markets. These factors could make foreign investments, especially       
those in developing countries, less liquid and more volatile. In addition, the  
costs of foreign investing, including withholding taxes, brokerage commissions  
and custodial costs are generally higher than for US investments. By investing  
in ADRs rather than directly in foreign issuers' stock, the Portfolios may      
avoid some currency and some liquidity risks. The information available for     
ADRs is subject to the more uniform and more exacting accounting, auditing and  
financial reporting standards of the domestic market or exchange on which they  
are traded. The Money Market Portfolio may purchase only high quality US        
dollar-denominated instruments.                                                 

CWVF International Equity Fund                                                  
CWVF International Equity seeks to provide a high total return consistent with  
reasonable risk by investing primarily in a globally diversified portfolio of   
equity securities. All investments are screened for financial and social        
criteria. There is, of course, no assurance that the Fund will be successful    
in meeting its objective.                                                       

Under normal circumstances, International Equity will invest at least 65% of    
its assets in equity securities. International Equity will invest primarily in  
common stocks of established foreign companies believed by the Subadvisor to    
have potential for capital growth, income or both. Companies are considered     
established if their securities are traded on a recognized stock exchange.      
However, International Equity may invest in any other type of security          
including, but not limited to, convertible securities, preferred stocks,        
bonds, notes and other debt securities of companies, (including Euro-currency   
instruments and securities) or of any international agency (such as the Asian   
Development Bank or Inter-American Development Bank) or obligations of          
domestic or foreign governments and their political subdivisions, and in        
foreign currency transactions. International Equity may invest in American or   
European Depositary Receipts ("ADRs" or "EDRs"). See the Statement of           
Additional Information. International Equity may establish and maintain         
reserves for temporary defensive purposes or to enable it to take advantage of  
buying opportunities. Its reserves may be invested in domestic as well as       
foreign short-term money market instruments including, but not limited to, US   
and foreign government and agency obligations, and obligations of               
supranational entities, certificates of deposit, bankers' acceptances, time     
deposits, commercial paper, short-term corporate debt securities and            
repurchase agreements. Any money market instruments will be rated at least      
A-2/P-2 or better by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization    
such as Standard and Poor's or Moody's, or, if unrated, determined by the       
Advisor or Subadvisor to be of equivalent credit quality. CWVF International    
Equity may also engage in certain options transactions, and enter into futures  
contracts and related options for hedging purposes.                             

Under normal circumstances, CWVF International Equity will invest at least 65%  
of its assets in the securities of issuers in no less than three countries,     
other than the USA. CWVF International Equity makes investments in various      
countries. Under normal circumstances, International Equity may, from time to   
time, have more than 25% of its assets invested in any major industrial or      
developed country which in the view of the Subadvisor poses no unique           
investment risk. The Subadvisor considers an investment in a given foreign      
country to have "no unique investment risk" if International Equity's           
investment in that country is not disproportionate to the relative size of the  
country's market versus the Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe-Far     
East-Asia (EFEA) or World Index or other comparable index, and if the capital   
markets in that country are mature, and of sufficient liquidity and depth.      
Under exceptional economic or market conditions, International Equity may       
invest substantially all of its assets in only one or two countries, or in US   
government obligations. As an operating policy, CWVF International Equity will  
limit its investment in securities of US issuers, excluding Special Equities    
and High Social Impact Investments, to 5% of its net assets.                    

In determining the appropriate distribution of investments among various        
countries and geographic regions, the Subadvisor ordinarily will consider the   
following factors: prospects for relative economic growth among foreign         
countries; expected levels of inflation; relative price levels of the various   
capital markets; government policies influencing business conditions; the       
outlook for currency relationships and the range of individual investment       
opportunities available to the global investor. International Equity may        
invest up to 30% of its net assets in developing countries, which involve       
exposure to economic structures that are generally less diverse and mature      
than in the United States, and to political systems which may be less stable.   
A country is considered to be a developing country if it is not included in     
the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index.                           

CWVF International Equity may may invest up to 35% of its net assets in debt    
securities excluding money market instruments. Of this, at least 30% will be    
of the highest credit quality available (rated AAA or Aaa by Standard & Poor's  
("S&P") or Moody's, respectively, or if not rated by S&P or Moody's, then       
determined by the Subadvisor to be of equivalent credit quality). The           
remaining 5% of Fund assets that may be invested in debt securities may be      
rated lower than AAA, although the Subadvisor does not intended to purchase     
any bonds rated lower than AAA unless the instrument provides an opportunity    
to invest in an attractive company in which an equity investment is not         
currently available or desirable. All fixed income instruments are subject to   
interest-rate risk; that is, when market interest rates rise, the current       
principal value of a bond will decline.                                         

CWVF International Equity may write covered call options and purchase call and  
put options on securities and security indices, and may write secured put       
options and enter into option transactions on foreign currency. It may also     
engage in transactions in financial futures contract and related options for    
hedging purposes, and invest in warrants, stock rights and repurchase           
agreements. These investment techniques and the related risks are described in  
more detail in the Statement of Additional Information.                         

Options on foreign currencies will be covered by securities denominated in      
that currency. Options on securities indices will be covered by securities      
that substantially replicate the movement of the index. CWVF International      
Equity may not write options on more than 50% of its total assets. Management   
presently intends to cease writing options in and as long as 25% of such total  
assets are subject to outstanding options contracts. CWVF International Equity  
may invest up to an aggregate of 5% of its total assets in exchange-traded or   
over-the-counter call and put options on securities and securities indices and  
foreign currencies. Purchases of such options may be made for the purpose of    
hedging against changes in the market value of the underlying securities or     
foreign currencies.                                                             

Lending portfolio securities                                                    
CWVF International Equity may lend its portfolio securities to member firms of  
the New York Stock Exchange and commercial banks with assets of one billion     
dollars or more, provided the value of the securities loaned will not exceed    
10% of assets. Any such loans must be secured continuously in the form of cash  
or cash equivalents such as US Treasury bills; the amount of the collateral     
must on a current basis equal or exceed the market value of the loaned          
securities, and CWVF International Equity must be able to terminate such loans  
upon notice at any time. International Equity will exercise its right to        
terminate a securities loan in order to preserve its right to vote upon         
matters of importance affecting holders of the securities.                      

The advantage of such loans is that CWVF International Equity continues to      
receive the equivalent of the interest earned or dividends paid by the issuers  
on the loaned securities while at the same time earning interest on the cash    
or equivalent collateral.                                                       

Securities loans are usually made to broker/dealers and other financial         
institutions to facilitate their delivery of such securities. As with any       
extension of credit, there may be risks of delay in recovery and possibly loss  
of rights in the loaned securities should the borrower of the loaned            
securities fail financially. However, International Equity will make loans of   
its portfolio securities only to those firms the Advisor or Subadvisor deems    
creditworthy and only on such terms the Advisor or Subadvisor believes should   
compensate for such risk. On termination of the loan the borrower is obligated  
to return the securities. International Equity will realize any gain or loss    
in the market value of the securities during the loan period and may pay        
reasonable custodial fees in connection with the loan.                          

International Equity Fund's investment objective and those policies set forth   
as fundamental investment restrictions may not be changed without shareholder   
approval.                                                                       

Risk Factors - CWVF International Equity                                        
An investment in International Equity is subject to various risks.              
International Equity's use of certain investment techniques, such as foreign    
currency options, involves special risks. See "Investment Techniques and        
Related Risks."                                                                 

There are substantial and different risks involved in investing in foreign      
securities. You should consider these risks carefully. For example, there is    
generally less publicly available information about foreign companies than is   
available about companies in the US Foreign companies are not subject to        
uniform audit and financial reporting standards, practices and requirements     
comparable to those in the US.                                                  

Foreign securities involve currency risks. The US dollar value of a foreign     
security tends to decrease when the value of the dollar rises against the       
foreign currency in which the security is denominated and tends to increase     
when the value of the dollar falls against such currency. Fluctuations in       
exchange rates may also affect the earning power and asset value of the         
foreign entity issuing the security. Dividend and interest payments may be      
returned to the country of origin, based on the exchange rate at the time of    
disbursement, and restrictions on capital flows may be imposed. Losses and      
other expenses may be incurred in converting between various currencies in      
connection with purchases and sales of foreign securities.                      

Foreign stock markets are generally not as developed or efficient as those in   
the US. In most foreign markets volume and liquidity are less than in the US    
and, at times, volatility of price can be greater than that in the US. Fixed    
commissions on foreign stock exchanges are generally higher than the            
negotiated commissions on US exchanges. There is generally less government      
supervision and regulation of foreign stock exchanges, brokers and companies    
than in the US.                                                                 

There is also the possibility of adverse changes in investment or exchange      
control regulations, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, limitations on     
the removal of funds or other assets, political or social instability, or       
diplomatic developments which could adversely affect investments, assets or     
securities transactions of International Equity in some foreign countries.      
CWVF International Equity is not aware of any investment or exchange control    
regulations which might substantially impair the operations of CWVF             
International Equity as described, although this could change at any time.      

The dividends and interest payable on certain of International Equity's         
foreign securities may be subject to foreign withholding taxes, thus reducing   
the net amount available for distribution to International Equity               
shareholders. The expense ratio of CWVF International Equity can be expected    
to be higher than those of investment companies investing only in domestic      
securities since the costs of operations are higher.                            

INVESTMENT SELECTION PROCESS 

Investments are selected on the basis of their ability to contribute to the     
dual objectives of financial soundness and social criteria.                     

Potential investments for a Fund are first screened for financial soundness     
and then evaluated according to that Fund's social criteria. To the greatest    
extent possible, investments are made in companies exhibiting unusual,          
positive accomplishments with respect to one or more of the criteria.           
Companies must meet the Fund's minimum standards for all its criteria.          

With respect to government securities, CSIF invests primarily in debt           
obligations issued or guaranteed by agencies or instrumentalities of the US     
Government whose purposes further or are compatible with CSIF's social          
criteria, such as obligations of the Student Loan Marketing Association,        
rather than general obligations of the US Government, such as Treasury          
securities.                                                                     

Although each Fund's social criteria and consideration tend to limit the        
availability of investment opportunities more than is customary with other      
investment companies, CAMCO and the Subadvisors of the Funds believe there are  
sufficient investment opportunities to permit full investment among issuers     
which satisfy each Fund's investment and social objectives.                     

The selection of an organization for investment by a Portfolio does not         
constitute endorsement or validation by each Fund, nor does the exclusion of    
an organization necessarily reflect failure to satisfy each Fund's social       
criteria. Investors in each Fund are invited to send a brief description of     
companies they believe might be suitable for investment.                        

All Investments are selected with a concern for the social impact of each       
investment                                                                      

Calvert Social Investment Fund                                                  
Calvert Social Investment Fund invests in accordance with its philosophy that   
long-term rewards to investors will come from those organizations whose         
products, services, and methods enhance the human condition and the             
traditional American values of individual initiative, equality of opportunity   
and cooperative effort.                                                         

CSIF has developed the following criteria for the selection of organizations    
in which it invests. CSIF recognizes, however, that these criteria represent    
standards of behavior which few, if any, organizations totally satisfy and      
that, as a matter of practice, evaluation of a particular organization in the   
context of these criteria will involve subjective judgment by CAMCO and CSIF's  
Subadvisors.                                                                    
   Given these considerations, CSIF seeks to invest in a producer or
service provider which:                                                         

1.       Delivers safe products and services in ways which sustain our natural  
environment. For example, CSIF looks for companies that produce energy from     
renewable resources, while avoiding consistent polluters.                       

2.       Is managed with participation throughout the organization in defining  
and achieving objectives. For example, CSIF looks for companies that offer      
employee stock ownership or profit-sharing plans.                               

3.       Negotiates fairly with its workers, provides an environment            
supportive of their wellness, does not discriminate on the basis of race,       
gender, religion, age, disability, ethnic origin, or sexual orientation, does   
not consistently violate regulations of the Equal Employment Opportunity        
Commission, and provides opportunities for women, disadvantaged minorities,     
and others for whom equal opportunities have often been denied. For example,    
CSIF considers both unionized and non-union firms with good labor relations.    

4.       Fosters awareness of a commitment to human goals, such as creativity,  
productivity, self-respect and responsibility, within the organization and the  
world, and continually recreates a context within which these goals can be      
realized. For example, CSIF looks for companies with an above average           
commitment to community affairs and charitable giving.                          

CSIF will not invest in an issuer which the Advisors determine to be            
significantly engaged in:                                                       

1.       The production of nuclear energy or the manufacture of equipment to    
produce nuclear energy.                                                         

2.       Business activities in support of repressive regimes.                  

3.       The manufacture of weapon systems.                                     

CSIF will not, as a matter of operating policy which may be changed without     
the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares, invest in an issuer       
primarily engaged in the manufacture of alcoholic beverages or tobacco          
products, or the operation of gambling casinos.                                 

CSIF believes that social and technological change will continue to transform   
America and the world into the next century. Those enterprises which exhibit a  
social awareness measured in terms of the above attributes and considerations   
should be better prepared to meet future societal needs for goods and           
services. By responding to social concerns, these enterprises should maintain   
flexibility and further social goals. In so doing they should not only avoid    
the liability that may be incurred when a product or service is determined to   
have a negative social impact or has outlived its usefulness, but also be       
better positioned to develop opportunities to make a profitable contribution    
to society. These enterprises should be ready to respond to external demands    
and ensure that over the longer term they will be viable to provide a positive  
return to both investors and society as a whole.                                

Calvert World Values International Equity Fund                                  
CWVF International Equity carefully reviews company policies and behavior       
regarding social issues important to global quality of life.                    

CWVF International Equity currently observes the following operating policies   
which may be changed by its Board of Directors without shareholder approval:    

1.       It actively seeks to invest in companies that achieve excellence in    
both financial return and environmental soundness, selecting issuers that take  
positive steps toward preserving and enhancing our natural environment through  
their operations and products, and avoiding companies with poor environmental   
records;                                                                        

2.       CWVF International Equity seeks to invest in companies with positive   
labor practices. We consider the International Labor Organization's basic       
conventions on worker rights as a guideline for our labor criteria.             
International Equity avoids investing in companies that demonstrate a pattern   
of engaging in forced, compulsory, or child labor. In addition, we seek to      
invest in companies that hire and promote women and ethnic minorities; respect  
the right to form unions; comply, at a minimum, with domestic hour and wage     
laws; and provide good health and safety standards;                             

3.       International Equity will not invest in issuers which the Advisor or   
Subadvisor ascertains contribute to human rights abuses in other countries;     

4.       It will not invest in producers of nuclear power or nuclear weapons,   
or companies with more than 10% of revenues derived from the production or      
sale of weapons systems; and                                                    

5.       It will not invest in companies which derive more than 10% of          
revenues from the production of alcohol or tobacco products, and actively       
seeks to invest in companies whose products or services improve the quality of  
or access to health care, including public health and preventative medicine.    

CWVF International Equity believes that there are long-term benefits inherent   
in an investment philosophy that demonstrates concern for the environment,      
human rights, economic priorities, and international relations. Those           
enterprises which exhibit a social awareness measured in terms of the above     
attributes and considerations should be better prepared to meet future          
societal needs for goods and services. By responding to social concerns, these  
enterprises should not only avoid the liability that may be incurred when a     
product or service is determined to have a negative social impact or has        
outlived its usefulness, but also be better positioned to develop               
opportunities to make a profitable contribution to society. CWVF International  
Equity believes these enterprises should be ready to respond to external        
demands and ensure that over the longer term they will be viable to provide a   
positive return to both investors and society as a whole.                       

The spirit of Calvert World Values International Equity Fund's social vision    
is similar to Calvert Social Investment Fund, but the application of the        
social analysis is significantly different. International investing brings      
unique challenges in terms of corporate disclosure, regulatory structures,      
environmental standards, and differing national and cultural priorities. Due    
to these factors, the CWVF social investment standards are less stringent than  
those of CSIF. CWVF may invest in companies that operate in countries with      
poor human rights records if we believe the companies are making a positive     
contribution.                                                                   

Special Equities and Private Placements - CSIF and International Equity         
Due to the particular social objective of the Funds, opportunities may exist    
to promote especially promising approaches to social goals through privately    
placed investments. The Special Equities Committee of each Fund's Board         
identifies, evaluates, and selects certain of these investments, subject to     
ratification by the Boards. The private placement investments undertaken by     
the Funds, if any, may be subject to a high degree of risk. Such investments    
may involve relatively small and untried enterprises that have been selected    
in the first instance because of some attractive social objectives or policies. 

Many private placement investments have no readily available market and may     
therefore be considered illiquid. Investments in private placements and other   
securities for which market quotations are not readily available are valued     
under the direction and control of the Boards.                                  

High Social Impact Investments - CSIF and International Equity                  
Each Portfolio may invest a small portion of its respective assets in           
investments in securities that offer a rate of return below the then            
prevailing market rate and that present attractive opportunities for            
furthering the Fund's social criteria ("High Social Impact Investments"); such  
High Social Impact investments must be less than 1% of the applicable CSIF      
Portfolio's assets, and less than 3% of CWVF International Equity's assets.     
Such securities are typically illiquid and unrated and generally considered     
noninvestment-grade debt securities which involve a greater risk of default or  
price decline than investment-grade securities. Through diversification and     
credit analysis and limited maturity, investment risk can be reduced, although  
there can be no assurance that losses will not occur. The High Social Impact    
Investments Committee of the Boards identifies, evaluates, selects and values   
these investments, subject to ratification by the Boards.                       

YIELD AND TOTAL RETURN 

The Portfolios may advertise different types of yield and total return          
performance, which is calculated separately for each class. All performance     
figures are based on historical earnings and are not intended to indicate       
future performance. Further information about each Portfolio's performance is   
contained in its Annual Report to Shareholders, which may be obtained without   
charge.                                                                         

CSIF Money Market Portfolio                                                     
The Money Market Portfolio may advertise "yield" and "effective yield." The     
"yield" refers to the actual income generated by an investment over a           
particular base period, stated in the advertisement. If the base period is      
less than one year, the yield will be "annualized." That is, the amount of      
income generated by the investment during the base period is assumed to be      
generated over a one-year period and is shown as a percentage of the            
investment. The "effective yield" is calculated like yield, but assumes         
reinvestment of earned income. The effective yield will be slightly higher      
than the yield because of the compounding effect of this assumed reinvestment.  

CSIF Bond Portfolio                                                             
Yield measures the Bond Portfolio's current investment performance, that is,    
the rate of income on its portfolio investments divided by the share price.     
Yield is computed by annualizing the result of dividing the net investment      
income per share over a 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share   
on the last day of that period. Yields are calculated according to accounting   
methods that are standardized for all stock and bond funds.                     

CSIF Managed Growth, Bond, Equity and CWVF International Equity Portfolios      
Total return differs from yield in that yield figures measure only the income   
component of a Portfolio's investments, while total return includes not only    
the effect of income dividends but also any change in net asset value, or       
principal amount, during the stated period. The total return of a class shows   
its overall change in value, including changes in share price and assuming all  
of its dividends and capital gain distributions are reinvested. A cumulative    
total return reflects the performance of the class over a stated period of      
time. An average annual total return reflects the hypothetical annual           
compounded return that would have produced the same cumulative total return if  
the performance had been constant over the entire period. Because average       
annual returns tend to smooth out variations in the returns, you should         
recognize that they are not the same as actual year-by-year results. Both       
types of total return for Class A shares usually will include the effect of     
paying the front-end sales charge. Of course, total returns will be higher if   
sales charges are not taken into account. Quotations of "return without         
maximum sales charge" do not reflect deduction of the sales charge. You should  
consider these figures only if you qualify for a reduced sales charge, or for   
purposes of comparison with comparable figures which also do not reflect sales  
charges, such as mutual fund averages compiled by Lipper Analytical Services,   
Inc.                                                                            

Fund MANAGEMENT                                                                 

Each Fund is not required to hold annual shareholder meetings, but special      
meetings may be called for certain purposes such as electing Trustees or        
Directors, changing fundamental policies, or approving a management contract.   
As a shareholder, you receive one vote for each share you own, except that      
matters affecting classes differently, such as Distribution Plans, will be      
voted on separately by the affected class(es).                                  

Calvert Social Investment Fund                                                  
The Board of Trustees supervises CSIF's activities and reviews its contracts    
with companies that                                                             
provide it with services. CSIF is an open-end diversified management            
investment company, organized as a Massachusetts business trust on December     
14, 1981.

CSIF Managed Growth Portfolio                                                   
The Managed Growth Portfolio is managed by multiple investment subadvisors.     
With the multi-manager approach, there will be several investment strategies    
in place at any given time in order to help the Portfolio pursue its            
investment objectives. The Managed Growth Portfolio may employ "growth          
managers," who generally concentrate on stocks that have demonstrated, or are   
expected to produce, earnings growth rates significantly greater than the       
market as a whole, as well as "value managers," who tend to make stock          
selections on the basis of perceived relative value as determined by a defined  
model in a bottom-up approach.                                                  

CAMCO manages the fixed-income portion of the Portfolio and has retained NCM

management of all Calvert portfolios for CAMCO. Mr. Martini has over 19 years   
of experience in the securities industry and has been the head of the asset

Brown Capital Management, Inc. of 809 Cathedral Street, Baltimore, Maryland,    
has managed part of the equity portion of the Managed Growth Portfolio since    
September 30, 1996. Brown Capital Management, Inc. believes that capital can    
be enhanced in times of opportunity and preserved in times of adversity         
without timing the market. The firm uses a bottom-up approach that              
incorporates growth-adjusted price earnings. Stocks purchased are generally     
undervalued and have momentum, have earnings-per-share growth rates greater     
than the market, are more profitable than the market, and have relatively low   
price-earnings ratios. The firm concentrates on mid-/large-cap growth stocks.   

Asset management by Brown Capital Management, Inc. is by a team headed by       
Eddie C. Brown. Eddie C. Brown, Portfolio Manager, is founder and President of

Calvert Social Investment Fund Advisory Fees                                    

CAMCO receives a fee based on a percentage of CSIF's assets, and for the        
Managed Growth and Equity Portfolios only, a performance (+ or -) fee as well.  
From this, CAMCO pays the Subadvisors where applicable.                         

For its services during fiscal year 1997, CAMCO was entitled to and did         
receive, pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, 0.50% of the Money      
Market Portfolio's average daily net assets. It also received 0.59% of the      
Bond Portfolio's, 0.55% of the Equity Portfolio's (after performance            
adjustment), and 0.60% of the Managed Growth Portfolio's (after performance     
adjustment) average daily net assets as investment advisory fees. With respect  
to the Bond Portfolio for the period March 1, 1997 to February 29, 2000, the    
Advisor has voluntarily agreed to limit its investment advisory fee to 0.55%    
of the Bond Portfolio's average daily net assets.                               

Investment selections for the fixed-income assets of the CSIF Managed Growth    
Portfolio are made by CAMCO. The Subadvisors make the investment selections     
for the remaining assets. Subadvisory fees are paid by CAMCO and are equal to   
a base fee of 0.25% of the Managed Growth Portfolio's average daily net         
assets, plus or minus a performance fee as set forth in the table above.        
Payment (or subtraction) of a Performance Fee is conditioned on (1) the         
performance of the Portfolio as a whole having exceeded (or trailed) The        
Lipper Balanced Fund Index ("Fund Index") during the Performance Period; and    
(2) payment of the Performance Fee not causing the Portfolio's performance to   
fall below the Fund Index.                                                      

The Investment Advisory Agreement between CSIF and CAMCO, with respect to the   
Managed Growth Portfolio, provides that CAMCO is entitled to a base annual fee  
("Base Fee"), payable monthly, of 0.70% of the Portfolio's average daily net    
assets. CAMCO may earn (or have its base fee reduced by) a performance          
adjustment ("Performance Fee") based on the extent to which performance of the  
Managed Growth Portfolio exceeds or trails the Relevant Index. The Relevant     
Indices are as follows:                                                         

CAMCO:                     Lehman Aggregate Bond Index        
NCM:                       Russell 3000

CWVF International Equity Fund Advisory Fees                                    

The Investment Advisory Agreement between CWVF International Equity Fund and    
CAMCO provides that CAMCO is entitled to an annual fee, payable monthly, of     
1.00% of International Equity's average daily net assets. For the year ended    
September 30, 1997, CAMCO received fees of 1.00% of the average daily net       
assets. CAMCO may, in its discretion, defer its fees or assume International    
Equity's operating expenses. The Investment Advisory Agreement provides that    
CAMCO may later, to the extent permitted by law, recapture any fees it          
deferred, or expenses it assumed during the two prior years. During the 1997    
fiscal year, CAMCO did not recapture fees.                                      

The Investment Subadvisory Agreement between CAMCO and Murray Johnstone         
provides that Murray Johnstone is entitled to a subadvisory fee of 0.45% of     
CWVF International Equity Fund's average daily net assets it manages. Murray    
Johnstone's fee is paid by CAMCO, not CWVF. Murray Johnstone also receives a    
0.05% fee, paid by CAMCO (not CWVF) for its assistance with the distribution    
of CWVF International Equity Fund.

Alternative Sales Options                                                       
CSIF Managed Growth, CSIF Equity, and CWVF International Equity each offer two  
classes of shares:                                                              
Class A Shares - Front-End Load Option                                          
Class A shares are sold with a front-end sales charge at the time of purchase.  
Class A shares are not subject to a sales charge when they are redeemed.        

Class C shares - Level Load Option                                              
Class C shares are sold without a sales charge at the time of purchase or       
redemption.                                                                     

Class C shares have higher expenses.                                            
Each Portfolio bears some of the costs of selling its shares under              
Distribution Plans adopted with respect to its Class A and Class C shares       
pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act. Payments under the Class A           
Distribution Plan are limited to 0.35% annually of the average daily net asset  
value of Class A shares, while payments under the Class C Distribution Plan     
are 1.00% of the average daily net asset value of Class C shares.               

Considerations for deciding which class of shares to buy.                       
Income distributions for Class A shares will probably be higher than those for  
Class C shares, as a result of the distribution expenses described above. (See  
also "Yield and Total Return.") You should consider Class A shares if you       
qualify for a reduced sales charge under Class A or if you plan to hold the     
shares for several years. Class C shares are not available for investments of   
$1 million or more.

     *CDI  reserves  the right to recoup any  portion of the amount  paid to the
dealer if the investor  redeems some or all shares  within  twelve months of the
time of purchase.                                                               

CSIF Managed Growth, Bond and Equity Portfolios, and CWVF International Equity: 

Front-end sales charges on shares may be reduced or eliminated in certain       
cases. See Exhibit A to this prospectus.                                        
The sales charge is paid to CDI, which in turn normally reallows a portion to   
your broker/dealer. Upon written notice to brokers with whom it has dealer      
agreements, CDI may reallow up to the full applicable sales charge. Brokers to  
whom 90% or more of the entire sales charge is reallowed may be deemed to be    
underwriters under the Securities Act of 1933.                                  

In addition to any sales charge reallowance, your broker/dealer, or other       
financial service firm through which your account is held, currently will be    
paid periodic service fees at an annual rate of up to 0.25% of the average      
daily net asset value of Class A shares of CSIF Managed Growth and Equity or    
CWVF International Equity Portfolios and on shares of the Bond Portfolio held   
in accounts maintained by that firm.                                            

Class A Distribution Plan                                                       

CSIF and CWVF have adopted a Distribution Plan with respect to Class A shares   
(the "Class A Distribution Plan"), which provides for payments at a maximum     
annual rate of 0.35% (0.25% for the CSIF Money Market Portfolio) of the         
average daily net asset value of Class A shares, to pay expenses associated     
with the distribution and servicing of Class A shares. Amounts paid by the      
Funds to CDI under the Class A Distribution Plan are used to pay to brokers     
and others, including CDI salespersons who service accounts, service fees at    
an annual rate of up to 0.25% of the average daily net asset value of Class A   
shares, and to pay CDI for its marketing and distribution expenses, including,  
but not limited to, preparation of advertising and sales literature and the     
printing and mailing of prospectuses to prospective investors. For the fiscal   
year ended September 30, 1997, the Managed Growth, Bond, and Equity Portfolios  
of CSIF paid Class A Distribution Plan expenses of 0.24%, 0.20%, and 0.23% of   
average net assets, respectively. CSIF Money Market Portfolio did not pay any   
Distribution Plan expenses in fiscal 1997. For the same period, CWVF            
International Equity paid Class A Distribution Plan expenses of 0.25% of        
average net assets.                                                             

Class C Shares                                                                  
CSIF Managed Growth and Equity Portfolios and CWVF International Equity         
Class C shares are not available through all brokers. Class C shares are        
offered at net asset value, without a front-end sales charge or a contingent    
deferred sales charge. Class C expenses are higher than those of Class A.       

Class C Distribution Plan                                                       

CSIF and CWVF have adopted a Distribution Plan with respect to Class C shares   
(the "Class C Distribution Plan"), which provides for payments at an annual     
rate of up to 1.00% of the average daily net asset value of Class C shares, to  
pay expenses of the distribution and servicing of Class C shares. Amounts paid  
by each Fund under the Class C Distribution Plan are currently used by CDI to   
pay brokers and other selling firms quarterly compensation at an annual rate    
of up to 0.75%, plus a service fee as described above under "Class A
Distribution Plan," of up to 0.25%, of the average daily net asset value of     
each share sold by such others. For the 1997 fiscal year, the Class C           
Distribution Plan expenses for CSIF Managed Growth and Equity Portfolios and    
CWVF International Equity were 1.00% of average net assets for each.            

Each of the Distribution Plans may be terminated at any time by vote of the     
Independent Trustees/Directors or by vote of a majority of the outstanding      
voting shares of the affected class. Brokers or others may receive different    
levels of compensation depending on which class of shares they sell. Payments   
pursuant to a Distribution Plan are included in the operating expenses of the   
class.                                                                          

Arrangements with Broker/Dealers and Others                                     

CDI may also pay additional concessions, including non-cash promotional         
incentives, such as merchandise or trips, to brokers employing registered       
representatives who have sold or are expected to sell a minimum dollar amount   
of shares of the Funds and/or shares of other Funds underwritten by CDI. CDI    
may make expense reimbursements for special training of a broker's registered   
representatives, advertising or equipment, or to defray the expenses of sales   
contests. All such payments will be in compliance with NASD rules.

*Please allow sufficient time for Calvert Group to process your initial         
request for this service, normally 10 business days. The maximum transaction    
amount is $300,000, and your purchase request must be received by 4:00 p.m.     
Eastern time.                                                                   

NET ASSET VALUE 

CSIF Money Market Portfolio shares are sold without a sales charge.             
Money Market Portfolio: The price of one share is its "net asset value," or     
"NAV." NAV is computed by adding the value of the Portfolio's investments plus  
cash and other assets, deducting liabilities and then dividing the result by    
the number of shares outstanding. The securities are valued according to the    
"amortized cost" method, which is intended to stabilize the NAV at $1.00 per    
share.                                                                          

CSIF Managed Growth, Bond, and Equity Portfolios, and CWVF International        
Equity Fund: Net asset value, or "NAV" refers to the worth of one share. NAV    
is computed by adding the value of all portfolio holdings, plus other assets,   
deducting liabilities and then dividing the result by the number of shares      
outstanding. For Portfolios with more than one class of shares, the NAVs of     
each class will vary daily depending on the number of shares outstanding for    
each class.                                                                     

Portfolio securities and other assets are valued based on market quotations,    
except that securities maturing within 60 days are valued at amortized cost.    
If quotations are not available, securities are valued by a method that the     
particular Fund's Board of Trustees/Directors believes accurately reflects      
fair value.                                                                     

The NAV is calculated at the close of each business day, which coincides with   
the closing of the regular session of the New York Stock Exchange (normally     
4:00 p.m. Eastern time). Each Fund is open for business each day the New York   
Stock Exchange is open. All purchases will be confirmed and credited to your    
account in full and fractional shares (rounded to the nearest 1/1000 of a       
share). The CSIF Money Market Portfolio may send monthly statements in lieu of  
immediate confirmations of purchases and redemptions.                           

WHEN YOUR ACCOUNT WILL BE CREDITED                                              

Before you buy shares, please read the following information to make sure your  
investment is accepted and credited properly.                                   

All of your purchases must be made in US dollars and checks must be drawn on    
US banks. No cash will be accepted. The Funds reserve the right to suspend the  
offering of shares for a period of time or to reject any specific purchase      
order. If your check is not paid, your purchase will be canceled and you will   
be charged a $10 fee plus costs incurred by the Funds. When you purchase by     
check or with Calvert Money Controller, those funds will be on hold for up to   
10 business days from the date of receipt. During that period, the proceeds of  
redemptions against those funds will be held until the transfer agent is        
reasonably satisfied that the purchase payment has been collected. Drafts       
written on the CSIF Money Market Portfolio against such funds will be returned  
for uncollected funds. To avoid this collection period, you can wire federal    
funds from your bank, which may charge you a fee. As a convenience, check       
purchases can be received at Calvert's offices for overnight mail delivery to   
the transfer agent and will be credited the next business day, or upon          
receipt. Any check purchase received without an investment slip may cause       
delayed crediting.                                                              

CSIF Money Market Portfolio                                                     
Your purchase will be processed at the net asset value calculated after your    
order is received and accepted. If your wire purchase is received by 5:00 p.m.  
Eastern time, your account will begin earning dividends on the next business    
day. Exchanges begin earning dividends the next business day after the          
exchange request is received by mail or telephone. Purchases received by check  
will begin earning dividends the next business day after they are processed to  
the account.                                                                    

CSIF Managed Growth, Bond, and Equity Portfolios and CWVF International Equity  
Your purchase will be processed at the next offering price based on the next    
net asset value calculated for the applicable shares after your order is        
received and accepted.                                                          

Certain financial institutions or broker/dealers which have entered into a      
sales agreement with the Distributor may enter confirmed purchase orders on     
behalf of customers by phone, with payment to follow within a certain number    
of days of the order as specified by the program. If payment is not received    
in the time specified, the financial institution could be held liable for       
resulting fees or losses.                                                       

EXCHANGES                                                                       

Each exchange represents the sale of shares of one Portfolio and the purchase   
of shares of another. Therefore, you could realize a taxable gain or loss on    
the transaction.                                                                

If your investment goals change, the Calvert Group of Funds has a variety of    
investment alternatives that includes common stock funds, tax-exempt and        
corporate bond funds, and money market funds. The exchange privilege is a       
convenient way to buy shares in other Calvert Group Funds in order to respond   
to changes in your goals or in market conditions. Before you make an exchange   
from a Fund or Portfolio, please note the following:                            

    Call your broker or a Calvert representative for information and a
prospectus for any of Calvert's other Funds registered in your state. Read the  
prospectus of the Fund or Portfolio into which you want to exchange for         
relevant information, including class offerings.                                

 Complete and sign an application for an account in that Fund or
Portfolio, taking care to register your new account in the same name and        
taxpayer identification number as your existing Calvert account(s). Exchange    
instructions may then be given by telephone if telephone redemptions have been  
authorized and the shares are not in certificate form.                          

       You may exchange shares on which you have already paid a sales charge
at Calvert Group and shares acquired by reinvestment of dividends or            
distributions into another fund at no additional charge. You may exchange       
Class C shares for shares of another fund, but you will have to pay the         
front-end sales charge, if applicable.                                          

  Shareholders (and those managing multiple accounts) who make two
purchases and two exchange redemptions of shares of the same Portfolio during   
any 6-month period will be given written notice that they may be prohibited     
from making additional investments. This policy does not prohibit a             
shareholder from redeeming shares of any Fund, and does not apply to trades     
solely among money market funds.                                                

  For purposes of the exchange privilege, the Funds are related to
Summit Cash Reserves Fund by investment and investor services. The Funds        
reserve the right to terminate or modify the exchange privilege in the future   
upon 60 days' written notice.

yields, account balances, and, by telephone only, authorize certain             
transactions.                                                                   

Calvert Money Controller                                                        
Calvert Money Controller eliminates the delay of mailing a check or the         
expense of wiring funds. You can request this free service on your application. 

This service allows you to authorize electronic transfers of money to purchase  
or sell shares. You use Calvert Money Controller like an "electronic check" to  
move money ($50 to $300,000) between your bank account and your Calvert Group   
account with one phone call. Allow one or two business days after the call for  
the transfer to take place; for money recently invested, allow normal check     
clearing time (up to 10 business days) before redemption proceeds are sent to   
your bank. You may also arrange systematic monthly or quarterly investments     
(minimum $50) into your Calvert Group account. After you give us proper         
authorization, your bank account will be debited to purchase shares. A debit    
entry will appear on your bank statement. If you would like to make             
arrangements for systematic monthly or quarterly redemptions from your Calvert  
Group account, call your broker or Calvert for more information.                

Telephone Transactions                                                          
Calvert may record all telephone calls.                                         

If you have telephone transaction privileges, you may purchase, redeem, or      
exchange shares, wire funds and use Calvert Money Controller by telephone. You  
automatically have telephone privileges unless you elect otherwise. The Funds,  
the transfer agent, the shareholder servicing agent, and their affiliates are   
not liable for acting in good faith on telephone instructions relating to your  
account, so long as they follow reasonable procedures to determine that the     
telephone instructions are genuine. Such procedures may include recording the   
telephone calls and requiring some form of personal identification. You should  
verify the accuracy of telephone transactions immediately upon receipt of your  
confirmation statement.                                                         

Optional Services                                                               
Complete the account application for the easiest way to establish services.     

The easiest way to establish optional services on your Calvert Group account    
is to select the options you desire when you complete your account              
application. If you wish to add other options later, you may have to provide    
us with additional information and a signature guarantee. Please call your      
broker or Calvert Investor Relations at 800-368-2745 for further assistance.    
For our mutual protection, we may require a signature guarantee on certain      
written transaction requests. A signature guarantee verifies the authenticity   
of your signature, and may be obtained from any bank, savings and loan          
association, credit union, trust company, broker/dealer firm or member of a     
domestic stock exchange. A signature guarantee cannot be provided by a notary   
public.                                                                         

Householding of General Mailings                                                
Householding reduces expenses while saving paper and postage expense.           

If you have multiple accounts with Calvert, you may receive combined mailings   
of some shareholder information, such as statements, confirmations,             
prospectuses, semi-annual and annual reports. Please contact Calvert Investor   
Relations at 800-368-2745 to receive additional copies of information.          

Special Services and Charges                                                    
The Funds pay for shareholder services but not for special services that are    
required by a few shareholders, such as a request for a historical transcript   
of an account. You may be required to pay a research fee for these special      
services.                                                                       

If you are purchasing shares of a Fund through a program of services offered    
by a broker/dealer or financial institution, you should read the program        
materials in conjunction with this Prospectus. Certain features may be          
modified in these programs, and administrative charges may be imposed by the    
broker/dealer or financial institution for the services rendered.

SELLING YOUR SHARES                                                             

You may redeem all or a portion of your shares on any business day. Your        
shares will be redeemed at the next net asset value calculated after your       
redemption request is received and accepted. See below for specific             
requirements necessary to make sure your redemption request is acceptable.      
Remember that the Funds may hold payment on the redemption of your shares       
until reasonably satisfied that investments made by check or by Calvert Money   
Controller have been collected (normally up to 10 business days).               

Redemption Requirements To Remember                                             
To ensure acceptance of your redemption request, please follow the procedures   
described here and below.                                                       
Once your shares are redeemed, the proceeds will normally be sent to you on     
the next business day, but if making immediate payment could adversely affect   
the Funds, it may take up to seven (7) days. Calvert Money Controller           
redemptions generally will be credited to your bank account on the second       
business day after your phone call. When the New York Stock Exchange is closed  
(or when trading is restricted) for any reason other than its customary         
weekend or holiday closings, or under any emergency circumstances as            
determined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, redemptions may be        
suspended or payment dates postponed.                                           

CSIF Money Market Portfolio                                                     
If you sell shares by telephone or written request, you will receive dividends  
through the date the request is received and processed. If you write a draft    
to sell shares, the shares will earn dividends until the draft is presented to  
the Portfolio to be paid.                                                       

Minimum account balance is $1,000 per Portfolio.                                
Please maintain a balance in each of your accounts of at least $1,000. If the   
balance in your CSIF Money Market account falls below the $1,000 minimum        
during a month, a $3 fee will be charged to your account. This fee is paid to   
the portfolio to offset the generally higher costs of small dollar accounts.    
Accounts in other portfolios which have a balance of less than $1,000 may be    
closed and the proceeds mailed to the address of record. You will be given a    
notice that your account is below the minimum and closed after 30 days if the   
balance is not brought up to the required minimum amount.                       

HOW TO SELL YOUR SHARES 

Draftwriting (CSIF Money Market Portfolio only)                                 
You may redeem shares in your CSIF Money Market Portfolio account by writing a  
draft for at least $250. If you complete and return the signature card for      
Draftwriting, the Portfolio will mail bank drafts to you, printed with your     
name and address. Generally, there is no charge to you for the maintenance of   
this service or the clearance of drafts, but CSIF Money Market will charge a    
service fee for drafts returned for insufficient funds. CSIF Money Market will  
charge $25 for any stop payment on drafts. As a service to shareholders,        
shares may be automatically transferred between your Calvert accounts to cover  
drafts you have written. The signature of only one authorized signer is         
required to honor a draft.

You must meet the minimum investment requirement of the other Calvert Group     
Fund or Portfolio. You can only exchange between accounts with identical        
names, addresses and taxpayer identification number, unless previously          
authorized with a signature-guaranteed letter.                                  

Systematic Check Redemptions                                                    
If you maintain an account with $10,000 or more, you may have up to two (2)     
redemption checks sent to you on the 15th of each month, simply by sending a    
letter with all the information, including your account number, and the dollar  
amount ($100 minimum). If you would like a regular check mailed to another      
person or place, your letter must be signature guaranteed.                      

Through your Broker                                                             
If your account is held in your broker's name ("street name"), you should       
contact your broker directly to transfer, exchange or redeem shares.            

DIVIDENDS AND TAXES                                                             

Each year, the Funds distribute substantially all of the net investment income  
to shareholders.                                                                

Dividends from CSIF Money Market Portfolio's net investment income are accrued  
daily and paid monthly. The CSIF Managed Growth Portfolio pays dividends        
quarterly, CSIF Bond Portfolio pays dividends monthly, and CSIF Equity          
Portfolio and CWVF International Equity Fund pay dividends annually. Net        
investment income consists of interest income, net short-term capital gains,    
if any, and dividends declared and paid on investments, less expenses.          
Distributions of net short-term capital gains (treated as dividends for tax     
purposes) and net long-term capital gains, if any, are normally paid once a     
year; however, the Funds do not anticipate making any such distributions        
unless available capital loss carryovers have been used or have expired.        
Dividend and distribution payments will vary between classes; dividend          
payments are anticipated to be generally higher for Class A shares.             

Dividend payment options (available monthly or quarterly)                       
Dividends and any distributions are automatically reinvested in the same        
Portfolio at net asset value (no sales charge), unless you elect to have the    
dividends of $10 or more paid in cash (by check or by Calvert Money             
Controller). Dividends and distributions from any Calvert Group Fund or         
Portfolio may be automatically invested in an identically registered account    
with the same account number in any other Calvert Group Fund at net asset       
value. If reinvested in the same Fund account, new shares will be purchased at  
net asset value on the reinvestment date, which is generally 1 to 3 days prior  
to the payment date. You must notify the Funds in writing to change your        
payment options. If you elect to have dividends and/or distributions paid in    
cash, and the US Postal Service cannot deliver the check, or if it remains      
uncashed for six months, it, as well as future dividends and distributions,     
will be reinvested in additional shares. No dividends will accrue on amounts    
represented by uncashed distribution or redemption checks.                      

"Buying a Dividend"                                                             
At the time of purchase, the share price of each class of CSIF Managed Growth,  
Bond, and Equity Portfolios and CWVF International Equity Fund may reflect      
undistributed income, capital gains or unrealized appreciation of securities.   
Any income or capital gains from these amounts which are later distributed to   
you are fully taxable. On the record date for a distribution, share value is    
reduced by the amount of the distribution. If you buy shares just before the    
record date ("buying a dividend") you will pay the full price for the shares    
and then receive a portion of the price back as a taxable distribution.         

Federal Taxes                                                                   
In January, each Portfolio will mail you Form 1099-DIV indicating the federal   
tax status of dividends and any capital gain distributions paid to you during   
the past year. Generally, dividends and distributions are taxable in the year   
they are paid. However, any dividends and distributions paid in January but     
declared during the prior three months are taxable in the year declared.        
Dividends and distributions are taxable to you regardless of whether they are   
taken in cash or reinvested. Dividends, including short-term capital gains,     
are taxable as ordinary income. Distributions from long-term capital gains are  
taxable as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have owned       
shares.                                                                         

CSIF Managed Growth, Bond, and Equity Portfolios and CWVF International Equity  
You may realize a capital gain or loss when you sell or exchange shares. This   
capital gain or loss will be short- or long-term, depending on how long you     
have owned the shares which were sold. In January, the Portfolios will mail     
you Form 1099-B indicating the total amount of all sales, including exchanges.  
You should keep your annual year-end account statements to determine the cost   
(basis) of the shares to report on your tax returns.                            

Other Tax Information                                                           
In addition to federal taxes, you may be subject to state or local taxes on     
your investment, depending on the laws in your area. You will be notified to    
the extent, if any, that dividends reflect interest received from US            
government securities. Such dividends may be exempt from certain state income   
taxes.                                                                          

Taxpayer Identification Number                                                  
If we do not have your correct Social Security or Taxpayer Identification       
Number ("TIN") and a signed certified application or Form W-9, Federal law      
requires us to withhold 31% of your dividends, and possibly 31% of certain      
redemptions. In addition, you may be subject to a fine. You will also be        
prohibited from opening another account by exchange. If this TIN information    
is not received within 60 days after your account is established, your account  
may be redeemed (closed) at the current NAV on the date of redemption. Calvert  
Group reserves the right to reject any new account or any purchase order for    
failure to supply a certified TIN.                                              

EXHIBIT A 
REDUCED SALES CHARGES (CLASS A ONLY)                                            

You may qualify for a reduced sales charge through several purchase plans       
available. You must notify the Funds at the time of purchase to take advantage  
of the reduced sales charge.                                                    
Right of Accumulation                                                           
The sales charge breakpoints are calculated by taking into account not only     
the dollar amount of a new purchase of shares, but also the higher of cost or   
current value of shares previously purchased in Calvert Group Funds that        
impose sales charges. This automatically applies to your account for each new   
purchase.                                                                       

Letter of Intent                                                                
If you plan to purchase $50,000 or more of Fund shares over the next 13         
months, your sales charge may be reduced through a "Letter of Intent." You pay  
the lower sales charge applicable to the total amount you plan to invest over   
the 13-month period, excluding any money market fund purchases. Part of your    
shares will be held in escrow, so that if you do not invest the amount          
indicated, you will have to pay the sales charge applicable to the smaller      
investment actually made. For more information, see the SAI.                    

Group Purchases                                                                 
If you are a member of a qualified group, you may purchase shares at the        
reduced sales charge applicable to the group taken as a whole. The sales        
charge is calculated by taking into account not only the dollar amount of the   
shares you purchase, but also the higher of cost or current value of shares     
previously purchased and currently held by other members of your group.         

A "qualified group" is one which:                                               
1.       has been in existence for more than six months,                        
2.       has a purpose other than acquiring shares at a discount, and           
3.       satisfies uniform criteria which enable CDI and brokers offering       
shares to realize economies of scale in distributing such shares.               

A qualified group must have more than 10 members, must be available to arrange  
for group meetings between representatives of CDI or brokers distributing       
shares, must agree to include sales and other materials related to the Funds    
in its publications and mailings to members at reduced or no cost to CDI or     
brokers.                                                                        

Pension plans may not qualify participants for group purchases; however, such   
plans may qualify for reduced sales charges under a separate provision (see     
below). Members of a group are not eligible for a Letter of Intent.             

Retirement Plans Under Section 457, Section 403(b)(7), or Section 401(k)        
There is no sales charge on shares purchased for the benefit of a retirement    
plan under section 457 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended         
("Code"), or for a plan qualifying under section 403(b)(7) of the Code if, at   
the time of purchase, Calvert Group has been notified in writing that the       
403(b)(7) plan has at least 200 eligible employees. Furthermore, there is no    
sales charge on shares purchased for the benefit of a retirement plan           
qualifying under section 401(k) of the Code if, at the time of such purchase,   
the 401(k) plan administrator has notified Calvert Group in writing that a)     
its 401(k) plan has at least 200 eligible employees; or b) the cost or current  
value of shares the plan has in Calvert Group of Funds (except money market     
funds) is at least $1 million.                                                  

Neither the Funds, nor CDI, nor any affiliate thereof will reimburse a plan or  
participant for any sales charges paid prior to receipt of such written         
communication and confirmation by Calvert Group. Plan administrators should     
send requests for the waiver of sales charges based on the above conditions     
to: Calvert Group Retirement Plans, 4550 Montgomery Avenue, Suite 1000N,        
Bethesda, Maryland 20814.                                                       

Other Circumstances                                                             
There is no sales charge on shares of any fund or portfolio of the Calvert      
Group of Funds sold to (i) current or retired Directors, Trustees, or Officers  
of the Calvert Group of Funds, employees of Calvert Group, Ltd. and its         
affiliates, or their family members; (ii) CSIF Advisory Council Members,        
directors, officers, and employees of any subadvisor for the Calvert Group of   
Funds, employees of broker/dealers distributing the Fund's shares and           
immediate family members of the Council, subadvisor, or broker/dealer; (iii)    
Purchases made through a Registered Investment Advisor, (iv) Trust departments  
of banks or savings institutions for trust clients of such bank or              
institution, (v) Purchases through a broker maintaining an omnibus account      
with the fund or portfolio, provided the purchases are made by (a) investment   
advisors or financial planners placing trades for their own accounts (or the    
accounts of their clients) and who charge a management, consulting, or other    
fee for their services; or (b) clients of such investment advisors or           
financial planners who place trades for their own accounts if such accounts     
are linked to the master account of such investment advisor or financial        
planner on the books and records of the broker or agent; or (c) retirement and  
deferred compensation plans and trusts, including, but not limited to, those    
defined in section 401(a) or section 403(b) of the I.R.C., and "rabbi trusts."  

Established Accounts                                                            
Shares of the CSIF Managed Growth Portfolio may be sold at net asset value to   
you if your account was established on or before July 17, 1986.                 

Dividends and Capital Gain Distributions from other Calvert Group Funds         
You may prearrange to have your dividends and capital gain distributions from   
another Calvert Group Fund automatically invested in another account with no    
additional sales charge.                                                        

Purchases made at net asset value ("NAV")                                       
Except for money market funds, if you make a purchase at NAV, you may exchange  
that amount to another fund at no additional sales charge.                      

Reinstatement Privilege                                                         
If you redeem shares and then within 30 days decide to reinvest in the same     
Fund or Portfolio, you may do so at the net asset value next computed after     
the reinvestment order is received, without a sales charge. You may use the     
reinstatement privilege only once. The Funds reserve the right to modify or     
eliminate this privilege.

This Statement of Additional Information is not a prospectus. 
Investors should read the Statement of Additional Information in conjunction    
with the Fund's Prospectus dated January 31, 1998, which may be obtained free

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE                                                            

 Calvert World Values Fund, Inc., International Equity Fund (the
'Fund') seeks to achieve a high total return consistent with reasonable risk,   
by investing primarily in a globally diversified portfolio of equity            
securities. To the extent possible, investments are made in enterprises that    
make a significant contribution to our global society through their products    
and services and through the way they do business.                              

Foreign Securities                                                              
Additional costs may be incurred which are related to any     
international investment, since foreign brokerage commissions and the           
custodial costs associated with maintaining foreign portfolio securities are    
generally higher than in the United States. Fee expense may also be incurred    
on currency exchanges when the Fund changes investments from one country to     
another or converts foreign securities holdings into U.S. dollars. Foreign      
companies and foreign investment practices are not subject to uniform           
accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and practices or         
regulatory requirements comparable to those applicable to United States         
companies. There may be less public information available about foreign         
companies.                                                                      
       United States Government policies have at times, in the past, through
imposition of interest equalization taxes and other restrictions, discouraged   
United States investors from making certain investments abroad. They may be     
reinstituted from time to time as a means of fostering a favorable United       
States balance of payments. In addition, foreign countries may impose           
withholding and taxes on dividends and interest. See 'Risk Factors' in the      
Prospectus.                                                                     

American and European Depositary Receipts                                       
Many foreign securities are represented by American Depositary
Receipts ('ADRs'), or other receipts evidencing ownership of foreign            
securities, such as International Depositary Receipts and Global Depositary     
Receipts. ADRs are U.S. dollar-denominated and are traded in the U.S. on        
exchanges or over the counter. ADRs do not eliminate all the risk inherent in   
investing in the securities of foreign issuers. However, by investing in ADRs   
rather than directly in foreign issuers' stock, the Fund may avoid some         
currency risks and liquidity risks during the settlement period for either      
purchases or sales. The information available for ADRs is subject to the more   
uniform and more exacting accounting, auditing and financial reporting          
standards of the domestic market or exchange on which they are traded. In       
general, there is a large, liquid market in the U.S. for many ADRs. The Fund    
may also invest in European Depositary Receipts ("EDRs"), which are receipts    
evidencing an arrangement with a European bank similar to that for ADRs and     
are designed for use in the European securities markets. EDRs are not           
necessarily denominated in the currency of the underlying security.             

Credit Quality                                                                  
  The Fund invests only in investment grade bonds. As has been the
industry practice, this determination of credit quality is made at the time     
the Fund acquires the bond. However, because it is possible that subsequent     
downgrades could occur, if a bond held by the Fund is later downgraded, the     
Fund's Subadvisor, under the supervision of the Fund's Board of Directors,      
will consider whether it is in the best interest of the Fund's shareholders to  
hold or to dispose of the bond. Among the criteria that may be considered by    
the Subadvisor and the Board are the probability that the bonds will be able    
to make scheduled interest and principal payments in the future, the extent to  
which any devaluation of the bond has already been reflected in the Fund net    
asset value, and the total percentage, if any, of bonds currently rated below   
investment grade held by the Fund.                                              
     Non-investment grade securities have moderate to poor protection of
principal and interest payments and have speculative characteristics. They      
involve greater risk of default or price declines due to changes in the         
issuer's creditworthiness than investment-grade debt securities. Because the    
market for lower-rated securities may be thinner and less active than for       
higher-rated securities, there may be market price volatility for these         
securities and limited liquidity in the resale market. Market prices for these  
securities may decline significantly in periods of general economic difficulty  
or rising interest rates.                                                       

Options and Futures Contracts                                                   
      The Fund may purchase put and call options and engage in the writing
of covered call options and secured put options on securities which meet the    
Fund's social criteria, and employ a variety of other investment techniques.    
Specifically, the Fund may engage in the purchase and sale of stock index       
future contracts, foreign currency futures contracts, interest rate futures     
contracts, and options on such futures, as described more fully below. Such     
investment policies and techniques may involve a greater degree of risk than    
those inherent in more conservative investment approaches.                      
  The Fund will engage in such transactions only to hedge existing
positions. It will not engage in such transactions for the purposes of          
speculation or leverage.                                                        
  The Fund will not engage in such options or futures transactions
unless it receives any necessary regulatory approvals permitting it to engage   
in such transactions. The Fund may write 'covered options' on securities in     
standard contracts traded on national or foreign securities exchanges, or in    
individually negotiated contracts traded over-the-counter. It may write such    
options in order to receive the premiums from options that expire and to seek   
net gains from closing purchase transactions with respect to such options.      

Purchasing Call and Put Options, Warrants and Stock Rights                      
      The Fund may purchase put options. By buying a put, the Fund has the
right to sell the security at the exercise price, thus limiting its risk of     
loss through a decline in the market value of the security until the put        
expires. The amount of any appreciation in the value of the underlying          
security will be partially offset by the amount of the premium paid for the     
put option and any related transaction costs. Prior to its expiration, a put    
option may be sold in a closing sale transaction and any profit or loss from    
the sale will depend on whether the amount received is more or less than the    
premium paid for the put option plus the related transaction costs.             
      The Fund may purchase call options. Such transactions may be entered
into in order to limit the risk of a substantial increase in the market price   
of the security which the Fund intends to purchase. Prior to its expiration, a  
call option may be sold in a closing sale transaction. Any profit or loss from  
such a sale will depend on whether the amount received is more or less than     
the premium paid for the call option plus the related transaction costs.        
   A call option on a security, security index or a foreign currency
gives the purchaser of the option, in return for the premium paid to the        
writer (seller), the right to buy the underlying security, index or foreign     
currency at the exercise price at any time during the option period. Upon       
exercise by the purchaser, the writer of a call option on an individual         
security or foreign currency has the obligation to sell the underlying          
security or currency at the exercise price. A call option on a securities       
index is similar to a call option on an individual security, except that the    
value of the option depends on the weighted value of the group of securities    
comprising the index and all settlements are to be made in cash. A call option  
may be terminated by the writer (seller) by entering into a closing purchase    
transaction in which it purchases an option of the same series as the option    
previously written.                                                             
       A put option on a security, security index, or foreign currency gives
the purchaser of the option, in return for the premium paid to the writer       
(seller), the right to sell the underlying security, index, or foreign          
currency at the exercise price at any time during the option period.            
The Fund may sell a call option or a put option which it has  
previously purchased prior to the purchase (in the case of a call) or the sale  
(in the case of a put) of the underlying security or foreign currency. Any      
such sale would result in a net gain or loss depending on whether the amount    
received on the sale is more or less than the premium and other transaction     
costs paid on the call or put which is sold. Purchasing a call or put option    
involves the risk that the Fund may lose the premium it paid plus transaction   
costs.                                                                          
   Warrants and stock rights are almost identical to call options in
their nature, use and effect except that they are issued by the issuer of the   
underlying security rather than an option writer, and they generally have       
longer expiration dates than call options. The Fund may invest up to 5% of its  
net assets in warrants and stock rights, but no more than 2% of its net assets  
in warrants and stock rights not listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the   
American Stock Exchange.                                                        

Covered Options. The Fund may write covered options on equity and debt          
securities and indices. This means that, in the case of call options, so long   
as the Fund is obligated as the writer of a call option, it will own the        
underlying security subject to the option and, in the case of put options, it   
will, through its custodian, deposit and maintain either cash or securities     
with a market value equal to or greater than the exercise price of the option.  
    When the Fund writes a covered call option, it gives the purchaser
the right to purchase the security at the call option price at any time during  
the life of the option. As the writer of the option, it receives a premium,     
less a commission, and in exchange foregoes the opportunity to profit from any  
increase in the market value of the security exceeding the call option price.   
The premium serves to mitigate the effect of any depreciation in the market     
value of the security. Writing covered call options can increase the income of  
the Fund and thus reduce declines in the net asset value per share of the Fund  
if securities covered by such options decline in value. Exercise of a call      
option by the purchaser, however, will cause the Fund to forego future          
appreciation of the securities covered by the option.                           
     When the Fund writes a secured put option, it will gain a profit in
the amount of the premium, less a commission, so long as the price of the       
underlying security remains above the exercise price. However, the Fund         
remains obligated to purchase the underlying security from the buyer of the     
put option (usually in the event the price of the security funds falls below    
the exercise price) at any time during the option period. If the price of the   
underlying security falls below the exercise price, the Fund may realize a      
loss in the amount of the difference between the exercise price and the sale    
price of the security, less the premium received.                               
 The Fund may purchase securities which may be covered with call
options solely on the basis of considerations consistent with the investment    
objectives and policies of the Fund. The Fund's turnover may increase through   
the exercise of a call option; this will generally occur if the market value    
of a 'covered' security increases and the Fund has not entered into a closing   
purchase transaction.                                                           
       To preserve the Fund's status as a regulated investment company under
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, it is the Fund's policy to limit     
any gains on put or call options and other securities held less than three      
months to less than 30% of the Fund's annual gross income.                      
   Risks Related to Options Transactions. The Fund can close out its
respective positions in exchange-traded options only on an exchange which       
provides a secondary market in such options. Although it intends to acquire     
and write only such exchange-traded options for which an active secondary       
market appears to exist, there can be no assurance that such a market will      
exist for any particular option contract at any particular time. This might     
prevent the Fund from closing an option position, which could impair its        
ability to hedge effectively. The inability to close out a call position may    
have an adverse effect on liquidity because the Fund may be required to hold    
the securities underlying the option until the option expires or is exercised.  

Over-the-Counter ("OTC") Options. OTC options differ from exchange-traded       
options in several respects. They are transacted directly with dealers and not  
with a clearing corporation, and there is a risk of non-performance by the      
dealer. However, the premium is paid in advance by the dealer. OTC options are  
available for a greater variety of securities and foreign currencies, and in a  
wider range of expiration dates and exercise prices than exchange-traded        
options. Since there is no exchange, pricing is normally done by reference to   
information from a market maker, which information is carefully monitored or    
caused to be monitored by the Subadvisor and verified in appropriate cases.     
A writer or purchaser of a put or call option can terminate it
voluntarily only by entering into a closing transaction. In the case of OTC     
options, there can be no assurance that a continuous liquid secondary market    
will exist for any particular option at any specific time. Consequently, the    
Fund may be able to realize the value of an OTC option it has purchased only    
by exercising it or entering into a closing sale transaction with the dealer    
that issued it. Similarly, when the Fund writes an OTC option, it generally     
can close out that option prior to its expiration only by entering into a       
closing purchase transaction with the dealer to which it originally wrote the   
option. If a covered call option writer cannot effect a closing transaction,    
it cannot sell the underlying security or foreign currency until the option     
expires or the option is exercised. Therefore, the writer of a covered OTC      
call option may not be able to sell an underlying security even though it       
might otherwise be advantageous to do so. Likewise, the writer of a secured     
OTC put option may be unable to sell the securities pledged to secure the put   
for other investment purposes while it is obligated as a put writer.            
Similarly, a purchaser of an OTC put or call option might also find it          
difficult to terminate its position on a timely basis in the absence of a       
secondary market.                                                               
      The Fund understands the position of the staff of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the 'SEC') to be that purchased OTC options and the        
assets used as 'cover' for written OTC options are illiquid securities. The     
Fund has adopted procedures for engaging in OTC options transactions for the    
purpose of reducing any potential adverse effect of such transactions upon the  
liquidity of the Fund.                                                          

Futures Transactions. The Fund may purchase and sell futures contracts          
('futures contracts') but only when, in the judgment of the Subadvisor, such a  
position acts as a hedge against market changes which would adversely affect    
the securities held by the Fund. These futures contracts may include, but are   
not limited to, market index futures contracts and futures contracts based on   
U.S. Government obligations.                                                    
   A futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy and
sell a security on a future date which has the effect of establishing the       
current price for the security. Although futures contracts by their terms       
require actual delivery and acceptance of securities, in most cases the         
contracts are closed out before the settlement date without the making or       
taking of delivery of securities. Upon buying or selling a futures contract,    
the Fund deposits initial margin with its custodian, and thereafter daily       
payments of maintenance margin are made to and from the executing broker.       
Payments of maintenance margin reflect changes in the value of the futures      
contract, with the Fund being obligated to make such payments if its futures    
position becomes less valuable and entitled to receive such payments if its     
positions become more valuable.                                                 
     The Fund may only invest in futures contracts to hedge its existing
investment positions and not for income enhancement, speculation or leverage    
purposes. Although some of the securities underlying the futures contract may   
not necessarily meet the Fund's social criteria, any such hedge position taken  
by the Fund will not constitute a direct ownership interest in the underlying   
securities.                                                                     
    Futures contracts have been designed by boards of trade which have
been designated 'contracts markets' by the Commodity Futures Trading            
Commission ('CFTC'). As a registered investment company, the Fund is eligible   
for exclusion from the CFTC's definition of 'commodity pool operator,' meaning  
that it may invest in futures contracts under specified conditions without      
registering with the CFTC. Among these conditions are requirements that to the  
extent that the Fund enters into future contracts and options on futures        
positions that are not for bona fide hedging purposes (as defined by the        
CFTC), the aggregate initial margin and premiums on these positions (excluding  
the amount by which options are 'in-the-money') may not exceed 5% of the        
Fund's net assets.                                                              

Options on Futures Contracts. The Fund may purchase and write put or call       
options and sell call options on futures contracts in which it could otherwise  
invest and which are traded on a U.S. exchange or board of trade. It may also   
enter into closing transactions with respect to such options to terminate an    
existing position; that is, to sell a put option already owned and to buy a     
call option to close a position where the Fund has already sold a               
corresponding call option.                                                      
       The Fund may only invest in options on futures contracts to hedge its
existing investment positions and not for income enhancement, speculation or    
leverage purposes. Although some of the securities underlying the futures       
contract underlying the option may not necessarily meet the Fund's social       
criteria, any such hedge position taken by the Fund will not constitute a       
direct ownership interest in the underlying securities.                         
   An option on a futures contract gives the purchaser the right, in
return for the premium paid, to assume a position in a futures contract - a     
long position if the option is a call and a short position if the option is a   
put - at a specified exercise price at any time during the period of the        
option. The Fund will pay a premium for such options purchased or sold. In      
connection with such options bought or sold, the Fund will make initial margin  
deposits and make or receive maintenance margin payments which reflect changes  
in the market value of such options. This arrangement is similar to the margin  
arrangements applicable to futures contracts described above.                   

Put Options on Futures Contracts. The purchase of put options on futures        
contracts is analogous to the sale of futures contracts and is used to protect  
the portfolio against the risk of declining prices. The Fund may purchase put   
options and sell put options on futures contracts it already owns. The Fund     
will only engage in the purchase of put options and the sale of covered put     
options on market index futures for hedging purposes.                           

Call Options on Futures Contracts. The sale of call options on futures          
contracts is analogous to the sale of futures contracts and is used to protect  
the portfolio against the risk of declining prices. The purchase of call        
options on futures contracts is analogous to the purchase of a futures          
contract. The Fund may only buy call options to close an existing position      
where the Fund has already sold a corresponding call option, or for a cash      
hedge. The Fund will only engage in the sale of call options and the purchase   
of call options to cover for hedging purposes.                                  

Writing Call Options on Futures Contracts. The writing of call options on       
futures contracts constitutes a partial hedge against declining prices of the   
securities deliverable upon exercise of the futures contract. If the futures    
contract price at expiration is below the exercise price, the Fund will retain  
the full amount of the option premium which provides a partial hedge against    
any decline that may have occurred in the Fund's securities holdings.           

Risks of Options and Futures Contracts. If the Fund has sold futures or takes   
options positions to hedge its portfolio against decline in the market and the  
market later advances, it may suffer a loss on the futures contracts or         
options which it would not have experienced if it had not hedged. Correlation   
is also imperfect between movements in the prices of futures contracts and      
movements in prices of the securities which are the subject of the hedge. Thus  
the price of the futures contract or option may move more than or less than     
the price of the securities being hedged. Where the Fund has sold futures or    
taken options positions to hedge against decline in the market, the market may  
advance and the value of the securities held in the Fund may decline. If this   
were to occur, the Fund might lose money on the futures contracts or options    
and also experience a decline in the value of its portfolio securities.         
However, although this might occur for a brief period or to a slight degree,    
the value of a diversified portfolio will tend to move in the direction of the  
market generally.                                                               
       The Fund can close out futures positions only on an exchange or board
of trade which provides a secondary market in such futures. Although the Fund   
intends to purchase or sell only such futures for which an active secondary     
market appears to exist, there can be no assurance that such a market will      
exist for any particular futures contract at any particular time. This might    
prevent the Fund from closing a futures position, which could require the Fund  
to make daily cash payments with respect to its position in the event of        
adverse price movements.                                                        
     Options on futures transactions bear several risks apart from those
inherent in options transactions generally. The Fund's ability to close out     
its options positions in futures contracts will depend upon whether an active   
secondary market for such options develops and is in existence at the time the  
Fund seeks to close its positions. There can be no assurance that such a        
market will develop or exist. Therefore, the Fund might be required to          
exercise the options to realize any profit.                                     

Closing out a Futures Position -- Risks. The Fund may close out its position    
in a futures contract or an option on a futures contract only by entering into  
an offsetting transaction on the exchange on which the position was             
established and only if there is a liquid secondary market for the futures      
contract. If it is not possible to close a futures position entered into by     
the Fund, the Fund could be required to make continuing daily cash payments of  
variation margin in the event of adverse price movements. In such situations,   
if the Fund has insufficient cash, it may have to sell portfolio securities to  
meet daily margin requirements at a time when it would be disadvantageous to    
do so. The inability to close futures or options positions could have an        
adverse effect on the Fund's ability to hedge effectively. There is also risk   
of loss by the Fund of margin deposits in the event of bankruptcy of a broker   
with whom the Fund has an open position in a futures contract. The success of   
a hedging strategy depends on the Subadvisor's ability to predict the           
direction of interest rates and other economic factors. The correlation is      
imperfect between movements in the prices of futures or options contracts, and  
the movements of prices of the securities which are subject to the hedge. If    
the Fund used a futures or options contract to hedge against a decline in the   
market, and the market later advances (or vice-versa), the Fund may suffer a    
greater loss than if it had not hedged.                                         

Foreign Currency Transactions. Forward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts. A   
forward foreign currency exchange contract involves an obligation to purchase   
or sell a specific currency at a future date, which may be any fixed number of  
days ('Term') from the date of the contract agreed upon by the parties, at a    
price set at the time of the contract. These contracts are traded directly      
between currency traders (usually large commercial banks) and their customers.  
       The Fund will not enter into such forward contracts or maintain a net
exposure in such contracts where it would be obligated to deliver an amount of  
foreign currency in excess of the value of its portfolio securities and other   
assets denominated in that currency. The Subadvisor believes that it is         
important to have the flexibility to enter into such forward contracts when it  
determines that to do so is in the Fund's best interests.                       
  Foreign Currency Options. A foreign currency option provides the
option buyer with the right to buy or sell a stated amount of foreign currency  
at the exercise price at a specified date or during the option period. A call   
option gives its owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy the currency,  
while a put option gives its owner the right, but not the obligation, to sell   
the currency. The option seller (writer) is obligated to fulfill the terms of   
the option sold if it is exercised. However, either seller or buyer may close   
its position during the option period for such options any time prior to        
expiration.                                                                     
A call rises in value if the underlying currency appreciates. 
Conversely, a put rises in value if the underlying currency depreciates. While  
purchasing a foreign currency option can protect the Fund against an adverse    
movement in the value of a foreign currency, it does not limit the gain which   
might result from a favorable movement in the value of such currency. For       
example, if the Fund was holding securities denominated in an appreciating      
foreign currency and had purchased a foreign currency put to hedge against a    
decline in the value of the currency, it would not have to exercise its put.    
Similarly, if the Fund had entered into a contract to purchase a security       
denominated in a foreign currency and had purchased a foreign currency call to  
hedge against a rise in the value of the currency but instead the currency had  
depreciated in value between the date of purchase and the settlement date, it   
would not have to exercise its call but could acquire in the spot market the    
amount of foreign currency needed for settlement.                               
 Foreign Currency Futures Transactions. The Fund may use foreign
currency futures contracts and options on such futures contracts. Through the   
purchase or sale of such contracts, it may be able to achieve many of the same  
objectives attainable through the use of foreign currency forward contracts,    
but more effectively and possibly at a lower cost.                              
      Unlike forward foreign currency exchange contracts, foreign currency
futures contracts and options on foreign currency futures contracts are         
standardized as to amount and delivery period and are traded on boards of       
trade and commodities exchanges. It is anticipated that such contracts may      
provide greater liquidity and lower cost than forward foreign currency          
exchange contracts.                                                             
     The value of the Fund's assets as measured in United States dollars
may be affected favorably or unfavorably by changes in foreign currency         
exchange rates and exchange control regulations, and the Fund may incur costs   
in connection with conversions between various currencies. The Fund will        
conduct its foreign currency exchange transactions either on a spot (i.e.,      
cash) basis at the spot rate prevailing in the foreign currency exchange        
market, or through forward contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies. A  
forward foreign currency exchange contract involves an obligation to purchase   
or sell a specific currency at a future date, which may be any fixed number of  
days from the date of the contract agreed upon by the parties, at a price set   
at the time of the contract. These contracts are traded directly between        
currency traders (usually large commercial banks) and their customers.          
    When the Fund enters into a contract for the purchase or sale of a
security denominated in a foreign currency, it may want to establish the        
United States dollar cost or proceeds, as the case may be. By entering into a   
forward contract in United States dollars for the purchase or sale of the       
amount of foreign currency involved in the underlying security transaction,     
the Fund is able to protect itself against a possible loss between trade and    
settlement dates resulting from an adverse change in the relationship between   
the United States dollar and such foreign currency. However, this tends to      
limit potential gains which might result from a positive change in such         
currency relationships. The Fund may also hedge its foreign currency exchange   
rate risk by engaging in currency financial futures and options transactions.   
    When the Advisor or the Subadvisor believes that the currency of a
particular foreign country may suffer a substantial decline against the United  
States dollar, it may enter into a forward contract to sell an amount of        
foreign currency approximating the value of some or all of the Fund's           
portfolio securities denominated in such foreign currency. The forecasting of   
short-term currency market movement is extremely difficult and whether such a   
short-term hedging strategy will be successful is highly uncertain.             
  It is impossible to forecast with precision the market values of
portfolio securities at the expiration of a contract. Accordingly, it may be    
necessary for the Fund to purchase additional currency on the spot market (and  
bear the expense of such purchase) if the market value of the security is less  
than the amount of foreign currency the Fund is obligated to deliver when a     
decision is made to sell the security and make delivery of the foreign          
currency in settlement of a forward contract. Conversely, it may be necessary   
to sell on the spot market some of the foreign currency received upon the sale  
of the portfolio security if its market value exceeds the amount of foreign     
currency the Fund is obligated to deliver.                                      
If the Fund retains the portfolio security and engages in an  
offsetting transaction, it will incur a gain or a loss (as described below) to  
the extent that there has been movement in forward contract prices. If the      
Fund engages in an offsetting transaction, it may subsequently enter into a     
new forward contract to sell the foreign currency. Should forward prices        
decline during the period between the Fund entering into a forward contract     
for the sale of a foreign currency and the date it enters into an offsetting    
contract for the purchase of the foreign currency, it would realize gains to    
the extent the price of the currency it has agreed to sell exceeds the price    
of the currency it has agreed to purchase. Should forward prices increase, the  
Fund would suffer a loss to the extent the price of the currency it has agreed  
to purchase exceeds the price of the currency it has agreed to sell. Although   
such contracts tend to minimize the risk of loss due to a decline in the value  
of the hedged currency, they also tend to limit any potential gain which might  
result should the value of such currency increase. The Fund may have to         
convert its holdings of foreign currencies into United States dollars from      
time to time. Although foreign exchange dealers do not charge a fee for         
conversion, they do realize a profit based on the difference (the "spread")     
between the prices at which they are buying and selling various currencies.     
   The subadvisor may occasionally invest in the debt instruments of
foreign sovereign governments. These may include short-term treasury bills,     
notes and long-term bonds, and will only be considered for investment by the    
Fund if they have the full guarantee of the government in question. The         
subadvisor will not invest in foreign government securities with a rating by    
Moody's Investor Services lower than Aa2.                                       

INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS                                                         

Fundamental Investment Restrictions                                             
   The Fund has adopted the following investment restrictions which,
together with the foregoing investment objectives and fundamental policies of   
the Fund, cannot be changed without the approval of the holders of a majority   
of the outstanding shares of the Fund. As defined in the Investment Company     
Act of 1940, this means the lesser of the vote of (a) 67% of the shares of the  
Fund at a meeting where more than 50% of the outstanding shares are present in  
person or by proxy or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund.  
The Fund may not:                                                               

1.       With respect to 75% of its assets, purchase          
securities of any issuer (other than obligations of, or       
guaranteed by, the United States Government, its agencies or  
instrumentalities) if, as a result, more than 5% of the       
value of its total assets would be invested in securities of  
that issuer.                                                  
2.       Concentrate 25% or more of the value of its assets   
in any one industry; provided, however, that there is no      
limitation with respect to investments in obligations issued  
or guaranteed by the United States Government or its          
agencies and instrumentalities, and repurchase agreements     
secured thereby.                                              
3.       Purchase more than 10% of the outstanding voting     
securities of any issuer.                                     
4.       Make loans other than through the purchase of money  
market instruments and repurchase agreements or by the        
purchase of bonds, debentures or other debt securities. The   
purchase by the Fund of all or a portion of an issue of       
publicly or privately distributed debt obligations in         
accordance with its investment objective, policies and        
restrictions, shall not constitute the making of a loan.      
5.       Underwrite the securities of other issuers, except   
to the extent that in connection with the disposition of its  
portfolio securities, the Fund may be deemed to be an         
underwriter.                                                  
6.       Purchase from or sell to any of the Fund's officers  
or Directors, or firms of which any of them are members, any  
securities (other than capital stock of the Fund), but such   
persons or firms may act as brokers for the Fund for          
customary commissions.                                        
7.       Borrow money, except from banks for temporary or     
emergency purposes and then only in an amount up to 10% of    
the value of the Fund's total assets; provided, however,      
that outstanding borrowings permitted by this section do not  
exceed 33 1/3% of the Fund's total assets. In order to        
secure any permitted borrowings under this section, the Fund  
may pledge, mortgage or hypothecate its assets.               
8.       Make short sales of securities or purchase any       
securities on margin except that the Fund may obtain such     
short-term credits as may be necessary for the clearance of   
purchases and sales of securities. The deposit or payment by  
the Fund of initial or maintenance margin in connection with  
financial futures contracts or related options transactions   
is not considered the purchase of a security on margin.       
9.       Write, purchase or sell puts, calls or combinations  
thereof except that the Fund may (a) write exchange-traded    
covered call options on portfolio securities and enter into   
closing purchase transactions with respect to such options,   
and the Fund may write exchange-traded covered call options   
on foreign currencies and secured put options on securities   
and foreign currencies and write covered call and secured     
put options on securities and foreign currencies traded over  
the counter, and enter into closing purchase transactions     
with respect to such options, (b) purchase exchange-traded    
call options and put options and purchase call and put        
options traded over the counter, provided that the premiums   
on all outstanding call and put options do not exceed 5% of   
its total assets, and enter into closing sale transaction     
with respect to such options, and (c) engage in financial     
futures contracts and related options transactions, provided  
that the sum of the initial margin deposits on the Fund's     
existing futures and related options positions and the        
premiums paid for related options would not exceed 5% of its  
total assets.                                                 
10.      Invest for the purpose of exercising control or      
management of another issuer.                                 
11.      Invest in commodities, commodities futures           
contracts, or real estate, although it may invest in          
securities which are secured by real estate or real estate    
mortgages and securities of issuers which invest or deal in   
commodities, commodity futures, real estate or real estate    
mortgages and provided that it may purchase or sell stock     
index futures, foreign currency futures, interest rate        
futures and options thereon.                                  
12.      The Fund may invest in the shares of other           
investment companies as permitted by the 1940 Act or other    
applicable law; or in connection with a nonqualified          
deferred compensation plan adopted by the Board of            
Directors, as long as there is no duplication of advisory     
fees.                                                         

Non-Fundamental Investment Restrictions                                         
      The Fund has adopted the following operating (i.e., non-fundamental)
investment policies and restrictions which may be changed by the Board of       
Directors without shareholder approval. The Fund may not:                       
13.      Purchase illiquid securities if more than 15% of     
the value of that Fund's net assets would be invested in      
such securities. The Fund may buy and sell securities         
outside the U.S. that are not registered with the SEC or      
marketable in the U.S.                                        
      14.      As an operating policy, excluding special equities and High
  Social Impact Investments, the Fund will limit its investment in
securities of U.S. issuers to 5% of the Fund's net assets.    

For purposes of the Fund's concentration policy contained in  
restriction (2), above, the Fund intends to comply with the SEC staff position  
that securities issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by any        
single foreign government are considered to be securities of issuers in the     
same industry.                                                                  

   Any investment restriction which involves a maximum percentage of
securities or assets shall not be considered to be violated unless an excess    
over the applicable percentage occurs immediately after an acquisition of       
securities or utilization of assets and results therefrom.                      

INVESTMENT SELECTION PROCESS 

       Investments in the Fund are selected on the basis of their ability to
contribute to the dual objective of the Fund. The Subadvisor uses its best      
efforts to select investments for the Fund that satisfy the Fund's investment   
and social criteria to the greatest practical extent. The Subadvisor has        
developed a number of techniques for evaluating the performance of issuers in   
each of these areas. The primary sources of information are reports published   
by the issuers themselves, the reports of public agencies, and the reports of   
groups which monitor performance in particular areas. These sources of          
information are sometimes augmented with direct interviews or written           
questionnaires addressed to the issuers. It should be recognized, however,      
that there are few generally accepted measures by which achievement in these    
areas can be readily distinguished; therefore, the development of suitable      
measurement techniques is largely within the discretion and judgment of the     
Advisors of the Fund.                                                           
In making investment selections, the Subadvisor determines and
evaluates the appropriate portfolio composition on the basis of asset prices    
and the perceived consequences and probabilities of various economic outcomes   
that the Subadvisor deems possible. The Subadvisor then evaluates numerous      
individual securities as candidates to fulfill the Fund's investment objective  
and policies. Securities remain candidates for inclusion in the Fund only if    
their prices and other characteristics indicate that they have the potential    
to perform in a way that is representative of their class of securities under   
the different economic outcomes considered more probable by the Subadvisor.     
     Candidates for inclusion in any particular class of assets are then
examined according to the social criteria. The Subadvisor classifies the        
issuers into three categories of suitability under the social criteria. In the  
first category are those issuers which exhibit unusual positive accomplishment  
with respect to some of the criteria and do not fail to meet minimum standards  
with respect to the remaining criteria. To the greatest extent possible,        
investment selections are made from this group. In the second category are      
those issuers which meet minimum standards with respect to all the criteria     
but do not exhibit outstanding accomplishment with respect to any criterion.    
This category includes issuers which may lack an affirmative record of          
accomplishment in these areas but which are not known by the Subadvisor to      
violate any of the social criteria. The third category under the social         
criteria consists of issuers which flagrantly violate, or have violated, one    
or more of those values, for example, a company which repeatedly engages in     
unfair labor practices. The Fund will not knowingly purchase the securities of  
issuers in this third category.                                                 
      It should be noted that the Fund's social criteria tend to limit the
availability of investment opportunities more than is customary with other      
investment companies. The Advisors of the Fund, however, believe that within    
the first and second categories there are sufficient investment opportunities   
to permit full investment among issuers which satisfy the Fund's social         
investment objective.                                                           

DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS, AND TAXES                                             

       The Fund declares and pays dividends from net investment income on an
annual basis. Distributions of realized net capital gains, if any, are          
normally paid once a year; however, the Fund does not intend to make any such   
distributions unless available capital loss carryovers, if any, have been used  
or have expired. Dividends and distributions paid may differ among the classes. 
Generally, dividends (including short-term capital gains) and 
distributions are taxable to the shareholder in the year they are paid.         
However, any dividends and distributions paid in January but declared during    
the prior three months are taxable in the year declared.                        
   Investors should note that the Internal Revenue Code ('Code') may
require investors to exclude the initial sales charge, if any, paid on the      
purchase of Fund shares from the tax basis of those shares if the shares are    
exchanged for shares of another Calvert Group Fund within 90 days of purchase.  
This requirement applies only to the extent that the payment of the original    
sales charge on the shares of the Fund causes a reduction in the sales charge   
otherwise payable on the shares of the Calvert Group Fund acquired in the       
exchange, and investors may treat sales charges excluded from the basis of the  
original shares as incurred to acquire the new shares.                          
    The Fund is required to withhold 31% of any long-term capital gain
dividends and 31% of each redemption transaction occurring in the Fund if: (a)  
the shareholder's social security number or other taxpayer identification       
number ('TIN') is not provided, or an obviously incorrect TIN is provided; (b)  
the shareholder does not certify under penalties of perjury that the TIN        
provided is the shareholder's correct TIN and that the shareholder is not       
subject to backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) of the Code because   
of underreporting (however, failure to provide certification as to the          
application of section 3406(a)(1)(C) will result only in backup withholding on  
capital gain dividends, not on redemptions); or (c) the Fund is notified by     
the Internal Revenue Service that the TIN provided by the shareholder is        
incorrect or that there has been underreporting of interest or dividends by     
the shareholder. Affected shareholders will receive statements at least         
annually specifying the amount withheld.                                        
    The Fund is required to report to the Internal Revenue Service the
following information with respect to each redemption transaction: (a) the      
shareholder's name, address, account number and taxpayer identification         
number; (b) the total dollar value of the redemptions; and (c) the Fund's       
identifying CUSIP number.                                                       
 Certain shareholders are exempt from the backup withholding and
broker reporting requirements. Exempt shareholders include: corporations;       
financial institutions; tax-exempt organizations; individual retirement plans;  
the U.S., a State, the District of Columbia, a U.S. possession, a foreign       
government, an international organization, or any political subdivision,        
agency or instrumentality of any of the foregoing; U.S. registered commodities  
or securities dealers; real estate investment trusts; registered investment     
companies; bank common trust funds; certain charitable trusts; foreign central  
banks of issue. Non-resident aliens, certain foreign partnerships and foreign   
corporations are generally not subject to either requirement but may instead    
be subject to withholding under sections 1441 or 1442 of the Internal Revenue   
Code. Shareholders claiming exemption from backup withholding and broker        
reporting should call or write the Fund for further information.                

NET ASSET VALUE 

       The public offering price of the shares of the Fund is the respective
net asset value per share (plus, for Class A shares, the applicable sales       
charge). The net asset values fluctuates based on the respective market value   
of the Fund's investments. The net asset value per share for each class is      
determined every business day at the close of the regular session of the New    
York Stock Exchange (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) and at such other times   
as may be necessary or appropriate. The Fund does not determine net asset       
value on certain national holidays or other days on which the New York Stock    
Exchange is closed: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Day, Presidents' Day,    
Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, and   
Christmas Day. The Fund's net asset value per share is determined by dividing   
total net assets (the value of its assets net of liabilities, including         
accrued expenses and fees) by the number of shares outstanding for that class.  
  The assets of the Fund are valued as follows: (a) securities for
which market quotations are readily available are valued at the most recent     
closing price, mean between bid and asked price, or yield equivalent as         
obtained from one or more market makers for such securities; (b) securities     
maturing within 60 days may be valued at cost, plus or minus any amortized      
discount or premium, unless the Board of Directors determines such method not   
to be appropriate under the circumstances; and (c) all other securities and     
assets for which market quotations are not readily available will be fairly     
valued by the Advisor in good faith under the supervision of the Board of       
Directors. Securities primarily traded on foreign securities exchanges are      
generally valued at the preceding closing values on their respective exchanges  
where primarily traded. Equity options are valued at the last sale price        
unless the bid price is higher or the asked price is lower, in which event      
such bid or asked price is used. Exchange traded fixed income options are       
valued at the last sale price unless there is no sale price, in which event     
current prices provided by market makers are used. Over-the-counter fixed       
income options are valued based upon current prices provided by market makers.  
Financial futures are valued at the settlement price established each day by    
the board of trade or exchange on which they are traded. Because of the need    
to obtain prices as of the close of trading on various exchanges throughout     
the world, the calculation of the Fund's net asset value does not take place    
for contemporaneously with the determination of the prices of U.S. portfolio    
securities. For purposes of determining the net asset value all assets and      
liabilities initially expressed in foreign currency values will be converted    
into United States dollar values at the mean between the bid and offered        
quotations of such currencies against United States dollars at last quoted by   
any recognized dealer. If an event were to occur after the value of an          
investment was so established but before the net asset value per share was      
determined which was likely to materially change the net asset value, then the  
instrument would be valued using fair value consideration by the Directors or   
their delegates.

CALCULATION OF TOTAL RETURN                                                     

   The Fund may advertise 'total return.' Total return is calculated
separately for each class. Total return is computed by taking the total number  
of shares purchased by a hypothetical $1,000 investment after deducting any     
applicable sales charge, adding all additional shares purchased within the      
period with reinvested dividends and distributions, calculating the value of    
those shares at the end of the period, and dividing the result by the initial   
$1,000 investment. For periods of more than one year, the cumulative total      
return is then adjusted for the number of years, taking compounding into        
account, to calculate average annual total return during that period.           
Total return is computed according to the following formula:  

P(1 + T)n = ERV                                                                 

where P = a hypothetical initial payment of $1,000; T = total return; n =       
number of years; and ERV = the ending redeemable value of a hypothetical        
$1,000 payment made at the beginning of the period.                             
      Total return is historical in nature and is not intended to indicate
future performance. All total return quotations reflect the deduction of the    
maximum sales charge, except quotations of 'return without maximum load,'       
which do not deduct sales charge. Total returns for the Fund's shares for the   
periods indicated are as follows:

(June 29, 1992, for Class A and March 1, 1994, for Class C.)                    

      Total return, like net asset value per share, fluctuates in response
to changes in market conditions. It should not be considered an indication of   
future return.                                                                  

PURCHASE AND REDEMPTION OF SHARES                                               

     Investments in the Fund made by mail, bank wire or electronic funds
transfer, or through the Fund's branch offices, Calvert Distributors, Inc., or  
other brokers participating in the distribution of Fund shares, are credited    
to a shareholder's account at the public offering price which is the net asset  
value next determined after receipt by the Fund, Calvert Distributors, Inc.,    
or the Fund's custodian bank or lockbox facility, plus the applicable sales     
charge as set forth in the Fund's Prospectus.                                   
    All purchases of the Fund shares will be confirmed and credited to
shareholder accounts in full and fractional shares (rounded to the nearest      
1/1000th of a share). Share certificates will not be issued unless requested    
in writing by the investor. No charge will be made for share certificate        
requests. No certificates will be issued for fractional shares. A service fee   
of $10.00, plus any costs incurred by the Fund, will be charged investors       
whose purchase checks are returned for insufficient funds.                      
       Telephone redemption requests are processed upon the date of receipt,
if received prior to 4:00 p.m. Redemption proceeds are normally transmitted or  
mailed the next business day, although payment by check of redemption proceeds  
shares may take up to five business days; however, telephone redemption         
requests which would require the redemption of shares purchased by check or     
electronic funds transfer within the previous 10 business days may not be       
honored. The Fund reserves the right to modify the telephone redemption         
privilege.                                                                      
      Amounts redeemed by telephone may be mailed by check to the investor
to the address of record without charge. Amounts of more than $50 and less      
than $300,000 may be transferred electronically at no charge to the investor.   
Amounts of $l,000 or more will be transmitted by wire without charge by the     
Fund to the investor's account at a domestic bank or savings association that   
is a member of the Federal Reserve System or to a correspondent bank. A charge  
of $5 is imposed on wire transfers of less than $1,000. If the institution is   
not a Federal Reserve System member, failure of immediate notification to that  
institution by the correspondent bank could result in a delay in crediting the  
funds to the investor's account at the institution.                             
    To change redemption instructions already given, shareholders must
send a notice to the Fund, with a voided copy of a check for the bank wiring    
instructions to be added. If a voided check does not accompany the request,     
then the request must be signature guaranteed by a commercial bank, trust       
company, savings association or member firm of any national securities          
exchange. Other documentation may be required from corporations, fiduciaries    
and institutional investors.                                                    
     The Fund's redemption check normally will be mailed to the investor
on the next business day following the date of receipt by the Fund of a         
written redemption request. If the investor so instructs in such written        
redemption request, the check will be mailed or the redemption proceeds wired   
or transferred electronically to a preauthorized account at the investor's      
bank or savings association.                                                    
 The right of redemption may be suspended or the date of payment
postponed for any period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed     
(other than customary weekend and holiday closings), when trading on the New    
York Stock Exchange is restricted, or an emergency exists, as determined by     
the Commission, or if the Commission has ordered such a suspension for the      
protection of shareholders. Redemption proceeds are normally mailed, wired or   
transferred electronically the next business day but in no event later than     
seven days after a proper redemption request has been received, unless          
redemptions have been suspended or postponed as described above.                
      Redemption proceeds are normally paid in cash. However, the Fund has
the right to redeem shares in assets other than cash for redemption amounts     
exceeding, in any 90-day period, $250,000 or 1% of the net asset value of the   
Fund, whichever is less.                                                        

REDUCED SALES CHARGES (CLASS A)                                                 

      The Fund imposes reduced sales charges for Class A shares in certain
situations in which the Principal Underwriter and the dealers selling Fund      
shares may expect to realize significant economies of scale with respect to     
such sales. Generally, sales costs do not increase in proportion to the dollar  
amount of the shares sold; the per-dollar transaction cost for a sale to an     
investor of shares worth, say, $5,000 is generally much higher than the         
per-dollar cost for a sale of shares worth $1,000,000. Thus, the applicable     
sales charge declines as a percentage of the dollar amount of shares sold as    
the dollar amount increases.                                                    
     When a shareholder agrees to make purchases of shares over a period
of time totaling a certain dollar amount pursuant to a Letter of Intent, the    
Underwriter and selling dealers can expect to realize the economies of scale    
applicable to that stated goal amount. Thus, the Fund imposes the sales charge  
applicable to the goal amount. Similarly, the Underwriter and selling dealers   
also experience cost savings when dealing with existing Fund shareholders,      
enabling the Fund to afford existing shareholders the Right of Accumulation.    
The Underwriter and selling dealers can also expect to realize economies of     
scale when making sales to the members of certain qualified groups which agree  
to facilitate distribution of Fund shares to their members. For shareholders    
who intend to invest at least $50,000, a Letter of Intent is included in the    
Appendix to this Statement of Additional Information. See 'Exhibit A - Reduced  
Sales Charges' in the Prospectus.

     The Fund or its affiliates may provide information such as, but not
limited to, the economy, investment climate, investment principles,             
sociological conditions and political ambiance. Discussion may include          
hypothetical scenarios or lists of relevant factors designed to aid the         
investor in determining whether the Fund is compatible with the investor's      
goals. The Fund may list portfolio holdings or give examples or securities      
that may have been considered for inclusion in the Portfolio, whether held or   
not.                                                                            
    The Fund or its affiliates may supply comparative performance data
and rankings from independent sources such as Donoghue's Money Fund Report,     
Bank Rate Monitor, Money, Forbes, Lipper Analytical Services, Inc., CDA         
Investment Technologies, Inc., Wiesenberger Investment Companies Service,       
Russell 2000/Small Stock Index, Mutual Fund Values Morningstar Ratings, Mutual  
Fund Forecaster, Barron's, The Wall Street Journal, and Schabacker Investment   
Management, Inc., including other socially responsible investment companies,    
and unmanaged market indices such as Morgan Stanley Capital International       
World Index or Europe-Far East-Asia Index. Such averages generally do not       
reflect any front- or back-end sales charges that may be charged by Funds in    
that grouping. The Fund may also cite to any source, whether in print or        
on-line, such as Bloomberg, in order to acknowledge origin of information. The  
Fund may compare itself or its portfolio holdings to other investments,         
whether or not issued or regulated by the securities industry, including, but   
not limited to, certificates of deposit and Treasury notes. The Fund, its       
Advisor, and its affiliates reserve the right to update performance rankings    
as new rankings become available.

   The address of directors and officers, unless otherwise noted, is
4550 Montgomery Avenue, Bethesda, Maryland 20814. Directors and officers as a   
group own less than one percent of the total outstanding shares of the Fund.    
Directors marked with a * above are 'interested persons' of the Fund under the  
Investment Company Act of 1940.                                                 
 Messrs. Guffey and Silby serve on the Fund's High Social Impact
Investments Committee which assists the Fund in identifying, evaluating, and    
selecting investments in securities that offer a rate of return below the       
then-prevailing market rate and that present attractive opportunities for       
furthering the Fund's social criteria. Messrs. Guffey, Silby, and Roy serve on  
the Fund's Special Equities Committee which assists the Fund in identifying,    
evaluating, and selecting appropriate private placement investment              
opportunities for the Fund that are not high social impact investments.         
   During fiscal 1997, Directors of the Fund not affiliated with the
Fund's Advisor were paid aggregate fees and expenses of $81,321.                
  Directors of the Fund not affiliated with the Fund's Advisor may
elect to defer receipt of all or a percentage of their fees and invest them in  
any fund in the Calvert Family of Funds through the Trustees Deferred           
Compensation Plan (shown as 'Pension or Retirement Benefits Accrued as part of  
Fund Expenses,' below). Deferral of the fees is designed to maintain the        
parties in the same position as if the fees were paid on a current basis.       
Management believes this will have a negligible effect on the Fund's assets,    
liabilities, net assets, and net income per share, and will ensure that there   
is no duplication of advisory fees.

INVESTMENT ADVISOR AND SUBADVISOR                                               

    The Fund's Investment Advisor is Calvert Asset Management Company,
Inc., 4550 Montgomery Avenue, 1000N, Bethesda, Maryland 20814, a subsidiary of  
Calvert Group Ltd., which is a subsidiary of Acacia Mutual Life Insurance       
Company of Washington, D.C. ('Acacia Mutual').                                  
    The Advisory Contract between the Fund and the Advisor was entered
into on May 21, 1992, and will remain in effect indefinitely, provided          
continuance is approved at least annually by the vote of the holders of a       
majority of the outstanding shares of the Fund or by the Board of Directors of  
the Fund; and further provided that such continuance is also approved annually  
by the vote of a majority of the trustees of the Fund who are not parties to    
the Contract or interested persons of parties to the Contract or interested     
persons of such parties, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of  
voting on such approval. The Contract may be terminated without penalty by      
either party upon 60 days' prior written notice; it automatically terminates    
in the event of its assignment.                                                 
   Under the Contract, the Advisor provides investment advice to the
Fund and oversees its day-to-day operations, subject to direction and control   
by the Fund's Board of Directors. For its services, the Advisor receives        
an annual fee of 1.00% of the Fund's average daily net assets up to $250        
million, 0.975% of the next $250 million, and 0.925% on assets in excess of     
$500 million. The Advisor may voluntarily defer its fees or assume expenses of  
the Fund. During fiscal year 1995, no fees were waived and the Advisor          
received fees of $1,871,430. During fiscal years 1996 and 1997, no fees were    
waived and the Advisor received fees of $1,971,329 and $2,134,708,              
respectively. The Advisor may recapture from (charge to) the Fund for such      
expenses incurred through December 31, 1993, provided that such recapture       
would not cause the Fund's aggregate expenses to exceed an annual expense       
limit of 2.00%, and that such recapture shall be made to the Advisor only from  
the two-year period from January 1, 1994, through December 31, 1995. The        
Advisor may voluntarily agree to further defer its fees or assume Fund          
expenses from January 1, 1994, through December 31, 1994, ('Additional          
Deferral/Assumption Period'). If so, the Advisor may recapture from (charge     
to) the Fund for any such expenses incurred during the Additional               
Deferral/Assumption Period, provided that such recapture would not cause the    
Fund's aggregate expenses to exceed an annual expense limit of 2.00%, and that  
such recapture shall be made to the Advisor only from the two-year period from  
January 1, 1995 through December 31, 1996. Each year's current advisory fees    
(incurred in that year) will be paid in full before any recapture for a prior   
year is applied. Recapture then will be applied beginning with the most recent  
year first. For the 1994 fiscal period, the Advisor recaptured $45,532 of fees  
it had deferred in 1992 from Class A Shares. No fees were recaptured during     
1995, 1996, or 1997.                                                            
The Fund's Subadvisor is Murray Johnstone International, Ltd. 
('Subadvisor' or 'Murray Johnstone'). Pursuant to an Investment Subadvisory     
Agreement with the Advisor, the Subadvisor determines investment selections     
for the Fund. For its services, the Subadvisor receives an annual fee from the  
Advisor of 0.45% of the Fund's average daily net assets under management by     
the Subadvisor up to $250 million, 0.425% on the next $250 million, and 0.40%   
on assets in excess of $500 million.                                            
Through 85 years experience in investment management, Murray  
Johnstone has developed a wealth of expertise in international markets and has  
grown into one of the largest independent investment manager in Scotland.       
Founded in 1907 and headquartered in Glasgow, Murray Johnstone has evolved      
into a diversified group with offices on three continents and over $6 billion   
under management. In 1989, responding to growing investment opportunities,      
Murray Johnstone International Limited was registered as an investment advisor  
with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. They have U.S.       
offices in Chicago and Minneapolis.                                             
      Calvert Administrative Services Company ('CASC', an affiliate of the
Advisor, has been retained by the Fund to provide certain administrative        
services necessary to the conduct of its affairs, including the preparation of  
regulatory filings and shareholder reports, the daily determination of its net  
asset value per share and dividends, and the maintenance of its portfolio and   
general accounting records. For providing such services, CASC receives an       
annual fee from the Fund of 0.10% of the Fund's average daily net assets, with  
a minimum annual fee of $40,000. For fiscal years 1995, 1996, and 1997, CASC    
received $187,143, $197,133, and $213,471, respectively, in administrative      
fees.                                                                           
The Advisor provides the Fund with investment supervision and 
management, administrative services, office space, furnishes executive and      
other personnel to the Fund, and may pay Fund advertising and promotional       
expenses. The Advisor reserves the right to compensate broker-dealers in        
consideration of their promotional or administrative services. The Fund pays    
all other administrative and operating expenses, including: custodial,          
registrar, dividend disbursing and transfer agency fees; federal and state      
securities registration fees; salaries, fees and expenses of directors,         
executive officers and employees of the Fund, who are not 'affiliated persons'  
of the Advisor or the Subadvisor within the meaning of the Investment Company   
Act of 1940; insurance premiums; trade association dues; legal and audit fees;  
interest, taxes and other business fees; expenses of printing and mailing       
reports, notices, prospectuses, and proxy material to shareholders; annual      
shareholders' meeting expenses; and brokerage commissions and other costs       
associated with the purchase and sale of portfolio securities.                  

METHOD OF DISTRIBUTION 

   The Fund has entered into an agreement with Calvert Distributors,
Inc. ('CDI') whereby CDI, acting as principal underwriter for the Fund, makes   
a continuous offering of the Fund's securities on a 'best efforts' basis.       
Under the terms of the agreement, CDI is entitled to receive reimbursement of   
distribution expenses pursuant to the Distribution Plan. For fiscal years       
1995, 1996, and 1997, CDI received distribution fees of $454,763, $476,884,     
and $514,711, respectively, under the Class A Distribution Plan. Of the Class   
A distribution expenses paid in fiscal 1997, $430,509 was used to compensate    
dealers for their share distribution promotional services, and the remainder    
partially financed advertising. CDI also receives the portion of the sales      
charge in excess of the dealer reallowance. For 1995, 1996, and 1997, CDI       
received net sales charges of $163,702, $157,897, and $141,844, respectively.   
      Pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the
Fund has adopted Distribution Plans (the 'Plans') which permits the Fund to     
pay certain expenses associated with the distribution of its shares. Such       
expenses may not exceed, on an annual basis, 0.35% of the Fund's Class A        
average daily net assets. Expenses under the Fund's Class C Plan may not        
exceed, on an annual basis, 1.00% of the average daily net assets of Class C.   
In 1995, Class C Distribution expenses were $52,378. 1996, Class C              
Distribution expenses were $63,792, and $75,866 in fiscal 1997. Fiscal year     
1997 Class C Distribution Plan expenses were used entirely to compensate        
dealers distributing shares and to compensate the underwriter.                  
The Fund's Distribution Plans were approved by the Board of   
Directors, including the Directors who are not 'interested persons' of the      
Fund (as that term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940) and who    
have no direct or indirect financial interest in the operation of the Plans or  
in any agreements related to the Plans. The selection and nomination of the     
Directors who are not interested persons of the Fund is committed to the        
discretion of such disinterested Directors. In establishing the Plans, the      
Directors considered various factors including the amount of the distribution   
expenses. The Directors determined that there is a reasonable likelihood that   
the Plans will benefit the Fund and its shareholders.                           
The Plans may be terminated by vote of a majority of the      
non-interested Directors who have no direct or indirect financial interest in   
the Plans, or by vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Fund. Any  
change in the Plans that would materially increase the distribution cost to     
the Fund requires approval of the shareholders of the affected class;           
otherwise, the Plans may be amended by the Directors, including a majority of   
the non-interested Directors as described above. The Plans will continue in     
effect for successive one-year terms provided that such continuance is          
specifically approved by (i) the vote of a majority of the Directors who are    
not parties to the Plans or interested persons of any such party and who have   
no direct or indirect financial interest in the Plans, and (ii) the vote of a   
majority of the entire Board of Directors.                                      
      Apart from the Plans, the Advisor and CDI, at their own expense, may
incur costs and pay expenses associated with the distribution of shares of the  
Fund.                                                                           
       Certain broker-dealers, and/or other persons may receive compensation
from the investment advisor, underwriter, or their affiliates for the sale and  
distribution of the securities or for services to the Fund. Such compensation   
may include additional compensation based on assets held through that firm      
beyond the regularly scheduled rates, and finder's fee payments to firms whose  
representatives are responsible for soliciting a new account where the          
accountholder does not choose to purchase through that firm.                    

TRANSFER AND SHAREHOLDER SERVICING AGENTS                                       

  National Financial Data Services, Inc. ('NFDS'), a subsidiary of
State Street Bank & Trust, has been retained by the Fund to act as transfer     
agent and dividend disbursing agent. These responsibilities include:            
responding to certain shareholder inquiries and instructions, crediting and     
debiting shareholder accounts for purchases and redemptions of Fund shares and  
confirming such transactions, and daily updating of shareholder accounts to     
reflect declaration and payment of dividends.                                   
    Calvert Shareholder Services, Inc., a subsidiary of Calvert Group,
Ltd., and Acacia Mutual, has been retained by the Fund to act as shareholder    
servicing agent. Shareholder servicing responsibilities include responding to   
shareholder inquiries and instructions concerning their accounts, entering any  
telephoned purchases or redemptions into the NFDS system, maintenance of        
broker-dealer data, and preparing and distributing statements to shareholders   
regarding their accounts. Calvert Shareholder Services, Inc. was the sole       
transfer agent prior to January 1, 1998.                                        
 For these services, NFDS and Calvert Shareholder Services, Inc.
receive a total fee of $14.00 per shareholder account and $1.60 per             
shareholder transaction.                                                        

PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS                                                          

     Fund transactions are undertaken on the basis of their desirability
from an investment standpoint. Investment decisions and the choice of brokers   
and dealers are made by the Fund's Advisor and Subadvisor under the direction   
and supervision of the Fund's Board of Directors.                               
    Broker-dealers who execute portfolio transactions on behalf of the
Fund are selected on the basis of their professional capability and the value   
and quality of their services. The Fund may pay brokerage commissions to        
broker-dealers who provide the Fund with statistical, research, or other        
information and services. Although any statistical research or other            
information and services provided by such broker-dealers may be useful to the   
Advisor and the Subadvisor, the dollar value of such information and services   
is generally indeterminable, and its availability or receipt does not serve to  
materially reduce the Advisor's or Subadvisor's normal research activities or   
expenses. During fiscal year 1995, 1996, and 1997, no commissions were paid to  
any officer or director of the Fund, or to any of their affiliates. During      
fiscal years 1996 and 1997, aggregate brokerage commissions paid to             
broker-dealers were $1,155,171 and $749,049, respectively.                      
    The Advisor and Subadvisor may also execute portfolio transactions
with or through broker-dealers who have sold shares of the Fund. However, such  
sales will not be a qualifying or disqualifying factor in a broker-dealer's     
selection nor will the selection of any broker-dealer be based on the volume    
of Fund shares sold.                                                            
   Depending upon market conditions, portfolio turnover, generally defined
as the lesser of annual sales or purchases of portfolio securities divided by   
the average monthly value of the Fund's portfolio securities (excluding from    
both the numerator and the denominator all securities whose maturities or       
expiration dates as of the date of acquisition are one year or less),           
expressed as a percentage, is under normal circumstances expected to be         
approximately 85%. For the 1996 and 1997 fiscal years, the portfolio turnover   
rates of the Fund were 96% and 58%, respectively.                               

INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS AND CUSTODIANS                                          

       Coopers & Lybrand, L.L.P. has been selected by the Board of Directors
to serve as independent auditors for fiscal year 1998. State Street Bank &      
Trust Company, N.A., 225 Franklin Street, Boston, MA 02110, serves as           
custodian of the Fund's investments. First National Bank of Maryland, 25 South  
Charles Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21203 also serves as custodian of certain   
of the Fund's cash assets. The custodians have no part in deciding the Fund's   
investment policies or the choice of securities that are to be purchased or     
sold for the Fund.                                                              

GENERAL INFORMATION                                                             

  The Fund was organized as a Maryland Corporation on February 14,
1992. The other series of the Fund is the Calvert Capital Accumulation Fund.    
       Each share represents an equal proportionate interest with each other
share and is entitled to such dividends and distributions out of the income     
belonging to such class as declared by the Board. The Fund offers two separate  
classes of shares: Class A and Class C. Each class represents interests in the  
same portfolio of investments but, as further described in the prospectus,      
each class is subject to differing sales charges and expenses, which            
differences will result in differing net asset values and distributions. Upon   
any liquidation of the Fund, shareholders of each class are entitled to share   
pro rata in the net assets belonging to that series available for distribution. 
   The Fund will send its shareholders confirmations of purchase and

CORPORATE BOND AND COMMERCIAL PAPER RATINGS                                     

Corporate Bonds:                                                                
Description of Moody's Investors Service Inc.'s/Standard & Poor's bond ratings: 
 Aaa/AAA: Best quality. These bonds carry the smallest degree of
investment risk and are generally referred to as 'gilt edge.' Interest          
payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable margin and      
principal is secure. This rating indicates an extremely strong capacity to pay  
principal and interest.                                                         
      Aa/AA: Bonds rated AA also qualify as high-quality debt obligations.
Capacity to pay principal and interest is very strong, and in the majority of   
instances they differ from AAA issues only in small degree. They are rated      
lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as  
in Aaa securities, fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater         
amplitude, or there may be other elements present which make long-term risks    
appear somewhat larger than in Aaa securities.                                  
 A/A: Upper-medium grade obligations. Factors giving security to
principal and interest are considered adequate, but elements may be present     
which make the bond somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of         
circumstances and economic conditions.                                          
       Baa/BBB: Medium grade obligations; adequate capacity to pay principal
and interest. Whereas they normally exhibit adequate protection parameters,     
adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead   
to a weakened capacity to pay principal and interest for bonds in this          
category than for bonds in the A category.                                      
Ba/BB, B/B, Caa/CCC, Ca/CC: Debt rated in these categories is 
regarded as predominantly speculative with respect to capacity to pay interest  
and repay principal. There may be some large uncertainties and major risk       
exposure to adverse conditions. The higher the degree of speculation, the       
lower the rating.                                                               
C/C: This rating is only for no-interest income bonds.        
D: Debt in default; payment of interest and/or principal is in
arrears.                                                                        

Commercial Paper:                                                               
MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE, INC.:                              
     The Prime rating is the highest commercial paper rating assigned by
Moody's. Among the factors considered by Moody's in assigning ratings are the   
following: (1) evaluation of the management of the issuer; (2) economic         
evaluation of the issuer's industry or industries and an appraisal of           
speculative-type risks which may be inherent in certain areas; (3) evaluation   
of the issuer's products in relation to competition and customer acceptance;    
(4) liquidity; (5) amount and quality of long-term debt; (6) trend of earnings  
over a period of ten years; (7) financial strength of a parent company and the  
relationships which exist with the issuer; and (8) recognition by management    
of obligations which may be present or may arise as a result of public          
interest questions and preparations to meet such obligations. Issuers within    
this Prime category may be given ratings 1, 2, or 3, depending on the relative  
strengths of these factors.                                                     

STANDARD & POOR'S CORPORATION:                                
 Commercial paper rated A by Standard & Poor's has the following
characteristics: (i) liquidity ratios are adequate to meet cash requirements;   
(ii) long-term senior debt rating should be A or better, although in some       
cases BBB credits may be allowed if other factors outweigh the BBB; (iii) the   
issuer should have access to at least two additional channels of borrowing;     
(iv) basic earnings and cash flow should have an upward trend with allowances   
made for unusual circumstances; and (v) typically the issuer's industry should  
be well established and the issuer should have a strong position within its     
industry and the reliability and quality of management should be unquestioned.  
Issuers rated A are further referred to by use of numbers 1, 2 and 3 to denote  
the relative strength within this highest classification.                       

LETTER OF INTENT 

Date                                                                            

Calvert Distributors, Inc.                                                      
4550 Montgomery Avenue                                                          
Bethesda, MD 20814                                                              

Ladies and Gentlemen:                                                           

       By signing this Letter of Intent, or affirmatively marking the Letter
of Intent option on my Fund Account Application Form, I agree to be bound by    
the terms and conditions applicable to Letters of Intent appearing in the       
Prospectus and the Statement of Additional Information for the Fund and the     
provisions described below as they may be amended from time to time by the      
Fund. Such amendments will apply automatically to existing Letters of Intent.   

    I intend to invest in the shares of:_____________________ (Fund or
Portfolio name) during the thirteen (13) month period from the date of my       
first purchase pursuant to this Letter (which cannot be more than ninety (90)   
days prior to the date of this Letter or my Fund Account Application Form,      
whichever is applicable), an aggregate amount (excluding any reinvestments of   
distributions) of at least fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) which, together     
with my current holdings of the Fund (at public offering price on date of this  
Letter or my Fund Account Application Form, whichever is applicable), will      
equal or exceed the amount checked below:                                       

__ $50,000 __ $100,000 __ $250,000 __ $500,000 __ $1,000,000  

   Subject to the conditions specified below, including the terms of
escrow, to which I hereby agree, each purchase occurring after the date of      
this Letter will be made at the public offering price applicable to a single    
transaction of the dollar amount specified above, as described in the Fund's    
prospectus. 'Fund' in this Letter of Intent shall refer to the Fund or          
Portfolio, as the case may be. No portion of the sales charge imposed on        
purchases made prior to the date of this Letter will be refunded.               

   I am making no commitment to purchase shares, but if my purchases
within thirteen months from the date of my first purchase do not aggregate the  
minimum amount specified above, I will pay the increased amount of sales        
charges prescribed in the terms of escrow described below. I understand that    
4.75% of the minimum dollar amount specified above will be held in escrow in    
the form of shares (computed to the nearest full share). These shares will be   
held subject to the terms of escrow described below.                            

   From the initial purchase (or subsequent purchases if necessary),
4.75% of the dollar amount specified in this Letter shall be held in escrow in  
shares of the Fund by the Fund's transfer agent. For example, if the minimum    
amount specified under the Letter is $50,000, the escrow shall be shares        
valued in the amount of $2,375 (computed at the public offering price adjusted  
for a $50,000 purchase). All dividends and any capital gains distribution on    
the escrowed shares will be credited to my account.                             

If the total minimum investment specified under the Letter is 
completed within a thirteen month period, escrowed shares will be promptly      
released to me. However, shares disposed of prior to completion of the          
purchase requirement under the Letter will be deducted from the amount          
required to complete the investment commitment.                                 

     Upon expiration of this Letter, the total purchases pursuant to the
Letter are less than the amount specified in the Letter as the intended         
aggregate purchases, Calvert Distributors, Inc. ('CDI') will bill me for an     
amount equal to the difference between the lower load I paid and the dollar     
amount of sales charges which I would have paid if the total amount purchased   
had been made at a single time. If not paid by the investor within 20 days,     
CDI will debit the difference from my account. Full shares, if any, remaining   
in escrow after the aforementioned adjustment will be released and, upon        
request, remitted to me.                                                        

       I irrevocably constitute and appoint CDI as my attorney-in-fact, with
full power of substitution, to surrender for redemption any or all escrowed     
shares on the books of the Fund. This power of attorney is coupled with an      
interest.                                                                       

       The commission allowed by CDI to the broker-dealer named herein shall
be at the rate applicable to the minimum amount of my specified intended        
purchases.                                                                      

The Letter may be revised upward by me at any time during the 
thirteen-month period, and such a revision will be treated as a new Letter,     
except that the thirteen-month period during which the purchase must be made    
will remain unchanged and there will be no retroactive reduction of the sales   
charges paid on prior purchases.                                                

     In determining the total amount of purchases made hereunder, shares
disposed of prior to termination of this Letter will be deducted. My            
broker-dealer shall refer to this Letter of Intent in placing any future        
purchase orders for me while this Letter is in effect.                          

Dealer                                                                          

By

directors, employees, and agents shall be indemnified by Registrant             
against liabilities and expenses incurred by such persons in connection         
with actions, suits, or proceedings arising out of their offices or             
duties of employment, except that no indemnification can be made to             
such a person if he has been adjudged liable of willful misfeasance, bad        
faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of his duties. In the            
absence of such an adjudication, the determination of eligibility for           
indemnification shall be made by independent counsel in a written               
opinion or by the vote of a majority of a quorum of directors who are           
neither "interested persons" of Registrant, as that term is defined in          
Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, nor parties to          
the proceeding.                                                                 

Registrant may purchase and maintain liability insurance on   
behalf of any officer, director, employee or agent against any                  
liabilities arising from such status. In this regard, Registrant                
maintains a Directors & Officers (Partners) Liability Insurance Policy          
with Chubb Group of Insurance Companies, 15 Mountain View Road, Warren,         
New Jersey 07061, providing Registrant with $5 million in directors             
and officers errors and omissions liability coverage, plus $3 million in        
excess directors and officers liability coverage for the independent            
directors only. Registrant also maintains an $8 million Investment              
Company Blanket Bond (fidelity coverage) issued by ICI Mutual Insurance         
Company, P.O. Box 730, Burlington, Vermont 05402.

	Example




	This example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The example assumes that:

	•






	your investment has a 5% return each year;
















	•






	the Fund’s operating expenses remain the same; and
















	•






	any Calvert expense limitation is in effect for the period indicated in the fee table above.

	$1,500

















	Portfolio Turnover




	The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (“turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the “Example”, affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund’s portfolio turnover rate was


	 51% of its portfolio’s average value.

	INVESTMENTS, RISKS AND PERFORMANCE







	Principal Investment Strategies




	The Fund invests primarily in common and preferred stocks of non-U.S. small-cap to mid-cap companies, which the Fund defines as companies whose market capitalization falls within the range of the Morgan Stanley Capital International (“MSCI”) Europe, Australasia and Far East (“EAFE”) Small-Mid (“SMID”) Index at the time of investment. As of

	December 31, 2015, the market capitalization of the MSCI EAFE SMID companies ranged from $54 million to $43.9 billion with a weighted average level of $5.6 billion.






	The Fund invests no more than 10% of its net assets in U.S. companies (excluding High Social Impact and Special Equities investments). See “Special Investment Programs” in this Prospectus.






	The Fund primarily holds stocks of companies in developed countries but as an internationally diverse fund, it may invest in any geographic region of the world (at least three different countries) if a Subadvisor deems the company attractive. The stock selection process of each Subadvisor does not utilize a predetermined geographic allocation, and each Subadvisor primarily uses a bottom-up approach focused on fundamental analysis of stocks of individual companies across all geographic regions. The Advisor attempts to control the portfolio’s risk level and maximize the Fund’s return potential relative to the MSCI EAFE SMID benchmark by balancing the risks and opportunities between the portion of the portfolio managed by each Subadvisor. The Advisor may shift allocations between the Subadvisors depending on market conditions, the Subadvisors’ respective style biases, and performance opportunities. The Fund may invest up to 20% of its assets in securities of issuers in emerging market countries. The securities in which the Fund invests are often denominated and traded in foreign currencies.






	The Fund may enter into foreign currency derivatives (including forward currency contracts and currency futures contracts) to hedge foreign currency exposure.




	The Fund may invest in American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”), which may be sponsored or unsponsored, and Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”).




	Attractive companies are identified through a combination of valuation and growth metrics that seeks to identify companies with a sustainable competitive advantage. Stocks chosen for the Fund combine growth and value characteristics or offer the opportunity to buy growth at a reasonable price.






	Responsible Investing


	.


	The Fund seeks to invest in companies and other enterprises that demonstrate positive environmental, social and governance performance as they address corporate responsibility and sustainability challenges. Calvert believes that there are long-term benefits in an investment philosophy that attaches material weight to the environment, workplace relations, human rights, Indigenous Peoples’ rights, community relations, product safety and impact, and corporate governance and business ethics. Calvert also believes that managing risks and opportunities related to these issues can contribute positively to company performance as well as to investment




	 




	performance over time. The Fund has sustainable and socially responsible investment criteria that reflect specific types of companies in which the Fund seeks to invest and seeks to avoid investing.






	Investments are selected for financial soundness and evaluated according to the Fund’s sustainable and socially responsible investment criteria. Investments must be consistent with the Fund’s current investment criteria, including financial, sustainability and social responsibility factors, the application of which is in the economic interest of the Fund and its shareholders.






	Principal Risks




	You could lose money on your investment in the Fund, or the Fund could underperform, because of the risks described below. An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.






	Management Risk.




	Individual investments of the Fund may not perform as expected, and the Fund’s portfolio management practices may not achieve the desired result. The Advisor’s allocation of Fund assets between the portion of the portfolio managed by each Subadvisor may cause the Fund to underperform.






	Stock Market Risk.




	The market prices of stocks held by the Fund may fall.






	Common Stock Risk.


	Although common stocks have a history of long-term growth in value, their prices fluctuate based on changes in a company’s financial condition, on overall market and economic conditions, and on investors’ perception of a company’s well-being.






	Preferred Stock Risk.


	The market value of preferred stock generally decreases when interest rates rise and is affected by the issuer’s ability to make payments on the preferred stock.






	Foreign Securities Risk.




	Investing in foreign securities involves additional risks relating to political, social, and economic developments abroad. Other risks result from differences between regulations that apply to U.S. and foreign issuers and markets, and the potential for foreign markets to be less liquid and more volatile than U.S. markets. Foreign securities include ADRs and GDRs. Unsponsored ADRs involve additional risks because U.S. reporting requirements do not apply and the issuing bank will recover shareholder distribution costs from movement of share prices and payment of dividends.






	Foreign Currency Risk.




	Securities that trade or are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to a foreign currency, the U.S. dollar value of an investment denominated in that currency will typically fall. GDRs can involve direct currency risk since, unlike ADRs, they may not be U.S. dollar-denominated. ADRs indirectly bear currency risk because they represent an interest in securities that are not denominated in U.S. dollars.






	Foreign Currency Hedge and Derivatives Risk.


	Transactions in foreign currency and foreign currency derivatives in connection














	2


	        SUMMARY PROSPECTUS JANUARY 31, 2016












	with the purchase and sale of investments in foreign markets may result in foreign currency exposure and the potential for losses due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates without regard to the quality or performance of the investment itself. The use of foreign currency and foreign currency derivatives may also prevent the Fund from realizing profits on favorable movements in exchange rates. In addition, the value of a foreign currency derivative may not correlate to the value of the underlying foreign currency to the extent expected. Derivative instruments are subject to a number of risks, including the risk of changes in the market price of the underlying asset, credit risk with respect to the counterparty, and liquidity risk. The Fund’s use of certain derivatives may also have a leveraging effect, which may increase the volatility of and reduce the Fund’s returns or result in a loss that exceeds the value of the assets allocated to establish and maintain a position in the derivative instrument.






	Emerging Markets Risk.




	The risks of investing in emerging market securities are greater than those of investing in securities of developed foreign countries. These risks include volatile currency exchange rates, periods of high inflation, increased risk of default, greater social, economic and political uncertainty and instability, less governmental supervision and regulation of securities markets, weaker auditing and financial reporting standards, lack of liquidity in the markets, and the significantly smaller market capitalizations of emerging market issuers.






	Small-Cap and Mid-Cap Company Risk.




	Prices of small-cap and mid-cap stocks can be more volatile than those of larger, more established companies. Small-cap and mid-cap companies are more likely to have more limited product lines, fewer capital resources and less depth of management than larger companies.






	Growth Company Risk.




	Prices of growth company securities may fall more than the overall equity markets due to changing economic, political or market conditions or disappointing growth company earnings results. Growth stocks also generally lack the dividends of some value stocks that can cushion stock prices in a falling market.






	Value Stock Risk.


	Value stocks may perform differently from the stock market as a whole.  The price of a value stock may take an unexpectedly long time to reflect the portfolio manager’s calculation of a stock’s intrinsic value or may not appreciate as anticipated. The value-oriented investing approach may fall out of favor with investors from time to time, and during those periods the Fund may underperform other funds using different investment approaches.






	Multi-Manager Risk.




	While the Advisor monitors the overall management of the Fund, the Subadvisors make investment decisions independently from each other. It is possible that the Subadvisors’ investment styles may not always be complementary, which could affect the performance and transaction costs of the Fund.




	Responsible Investing Risk


	.


	Investing primarily in securities that meet certain sustainable and socially responsible investment criteria carries the risk that, under certain market conditions, the Fund may underperform funds that do not utilize such criteria when selecting investments. The application of responsible




	 




	investment criteria may affect the Fund’s exposure to certain sectors or types of investments and may impact the Fund’s relative investment performance depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. A company’s ESG performance or the Advisor’s assessment of a company’s ESG performance may change over time, which could cause the Fund to temporarily hold securities that do not comply with the Fund’s responsible investment principles. In evaluating a company, the Advisor is dependent upon information and data that may be incomplete, inaccurate or unavailable, which could cause the Advisor to incorrectly assess a company’s ESG performance. Successful application of the Fund’s responsible investment strategy will depend on the Advisor’s skill in properly identifying and analyzing material ESG issues.






	Performance




	The following bar chart and table show the Fund’s annual returns and its long-term performance, which give some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund. The bar chart shows how the performance of the Class A shares has varied from year to year. The table compares the Fund’s performance over time with that of a benchmark and a performance average of similar mutual funds. The performance reflected in the bar chart and table assumes the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions, if any.






	The Fund’s past performance (before and after taxes) does not necessarily indicate how the Fund will perform in the future. For updated performance information, visit www.calvert.com.






	Performance results for Class C shares prior to July 31, 2007


	(the Class C shares’ inception date) reflect the performance of Class A shares at net asset value. Actual Class C share performance would have been lower than Class A share performance because Class C has higher class-specific expenses than Class A.


	  Performance results for Class Y shares prior to October 31, 2008


	(the Class Y shares’ inception date) reflect the performance of Class A shares at net asset value. Actual Class Y share performance would have been higher than Class A share performance because Class Y has lower class-specific expenses than Class A.






	The return for each of the Fund’s other Classes of shares will differ from the Class A returns shown in the bar chart, depending upon the expenses of that Class. The bar chart does not reflect any sales charge that you may be required to pay upon purchase or redemption of the Fund’s shares. Any sales charge will reduce your return.

	The average total return table shows the Fund’s returns with the maximum sales charge deducted, and no sales charge has been applied to the indices used for comparison in the table.






	After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates, and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on your tax situation and may differ from those shown. The after-tax returns shown are not relevant to you if you hold your Fund shares through a tax-deferred arrangement such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. The return after taxes on distributions and sale of Fund shares may be higher than the return before taxes because the calculation assumes that shareholders receive a tax benefit for capital losses incurred on the sale of their shares.




	After-tax returns are shown only for Class A shares; after-tax returns for other Classes will vary.

Morningstar Ratings1


as of 06/30/2017



Overall





3 Year





5 Year





10 Year







				Morningstar rated the Value Fund among 
1091,
1091,
936
and 
681
Large Value
funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable) 
ending 06/30/2017, respectively.


The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance 
figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The 
weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year 
rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating 
for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most 
weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is 
included in all three rating periods.
			

Performance Comparison
as of 
					
						06/30/2017
					
				







							This chart shows the value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund over the past 10 years or since its inception (for funds lacking 10-year records). The result is compared with benchmarks, which may include a broad-based market index and a peer group average or index. Market indexes do not include expenses, which are deducted from fund returns as well as mutual fund averages and indexes.
						
Benchmark Definitions



1 The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, 
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at 
least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation 
in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent 
performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating 
for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, 
and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of 
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating 
formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest 
impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal.
*Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.
Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis. A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years. For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.
When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.
All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk. Please consult the funds’ prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds’ risks.
