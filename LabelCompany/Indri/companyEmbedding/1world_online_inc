Antitrust Statement



1WorldSync Antitrust Compliance Policy
The fundamental purpose of 1WorldSync is to provide product data management and data synchronization solutions and services based on GS1 Standards. In certain instances, 1WorldSync may assemble a representative cross-section of its users and supply chain leaders to work closely with 1WorldSync in the development and voluntary individual company adoption and implementation of GS1 Standards, or user-driven business processes and requirements, to improve data exchange efficiencies and complexities, improve product information quality, and support the development of product data management systems of the future (“1WorldSync Community Activities”) 1WorldSync Community Activities are intended to improve competition and facilitate competitive practices. Adherence to this Antitrust Compliance Policy will facilitate that purpose.
It is the policy and practice of 1WorldSync to conduct all of its meetings and activities in strict compliance with applicable federal and state laws. Because participants 1WorldSync Community Activities are often competitors, it is particularly important to comply fully with federal and state antitrust laws. These laws seek to preserve and promote competition and to deter anticompetitive conduct.
Participants in 1WorldSync Community Activities are committed both to strict compliance with the antitrust laws and to the avoidance of any appearance of improper or anticompetitive conduct. Counsel for 1WorldSync will: review agendas, key action items, handouts, and slide presentations in advance of all Committee Activities; review meeting minutes in advance of distribution; and be present, as requested, to monitor meetings that might give rise to competitive concerns. Individual companies are strongly urged to consult with their own counsel for legal advice concerning documents a company wishes to disseminate, presentations made by company officials, and other pertinent issues.
Violations of the antitrust laws can result in serious penalties for both companies and individuals. These penalties include treble damage awards, heavy fines, and injunctions. Individuals may be subject to imprisonment. It is, therefore, incumbent upon everyone participating in 1WorldSync Community activities to avoid subject areas and discussions which might be construed as anticompetitive.
Participants in 1WorldSync Community Activities or anyone making presentations should read and abide by the following rules:

There should be no discussion of prices, one’s own or those of a competitor, or of any factors which might affect prices such as discounts or margins, and terms and conditions of sale.
There should be no discussion of profits, profit margins or cost data of one’s own, or those of a competitor.
There should be no discussion that might lead to any agreement to raise, lower or hold present or future price levels.
There should be no discussions regarding allocation of territories, markets, or customers.
There should be no discussions regarding restrictions upon production, boycotts or refusals to deal.
There should be no discussions regarding selection, rejection, or termination of customers or suppliers.
There should be no discussion or conduct at social events incidental to meetings that would not be proper at the meetings themselves.
All discussions during meetings must be limited to agenda items that counsel has reviewed and approved.

If a subject with any anti-competitive implication or appearance is raised at any meeting, persons attending the meeting should object and request that the subject be dropped.

SAN JOSE, Calif. and MUMBAI, India, Dec. 21, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- 1World Online and Brand Capital, the strategic investment arm of Bennett Coleman & Co Ltd, commonly known as The Times Group, announced a strategic investment of US $4.9M into 1World Online, the industry leading shared Intelligence platform based out of San Jose, California USA. The investment will be used to drive traffic to showcase 1World's online tools in the Indian market, which is expected to be one of the largest digital online markets by the end of 2018, second only to China. 








1World polls, quizzes, and other monetizable Interactive Media Units (IMU) are currently deployed on The Economic Times (http://economictimes.indiatimes.com) and Huffington Post in India (http://www.huffingtonpost.in), with IMU deployment on many more Times Group properties coming soon. 1World will use the investment to expand the reach of 1World online and provide a platform to digital publishers & brands in India to offer live online polls and quizzes, using the 1World tools to thereby increase monetizable traffic to the digital properties. These noteworthy daily results allow for a powerful and cyclical content-generation system known as "News About the News." 
To support 1World activities in India, 1World has set up a team in India launching India's Knowledge Hub, at 1worldonline.in. India's Knowledge Hub aggregates the insights gathered from the various online websites within the 1World family of websites, providing a valuable venue for Indians— living in India and abroad—to learn What Do People Really Think™. 
"We are really excited to partner with 1World, and we value this partnership as Brand Capital expands its presence globally with an objective of assisting more global companies to launch in India using the Brand Capital solution," said Mr. Sivakumar Sundaram, CEO, Brand Capital. "The key benefits of this corporate relationship will be better insights for our readers, better understanding of our audience, and increased engagement leading to better ad monetization. One of the things we really found impressive with the 1World platform was its support of 30 languages, including eight India languages." 
"India has become the crown jewel in our international strategy," said Alex Fedosseev, CEO of 1World Online. "As our namesake hints, our plan has always been to create and nurture an international network of publisher partners. Working with The Times Group means we have the best foothold in the India market one could hope for— I feel confident the early success we've had in India so far will blossom as we expand in India." 
About Brand Capital 
Brand Capital is a strategic investment division of the Times Group that works with the entrepreneur eco- system. The Company's branding expertise and intellectual capital helps entrepreneurs with the intricacies of the advertising business, to plan and build effective corporate branding strategies that lead to growth and enterprise value creation. The innovative idea was to leverage the brand building power of the Times Group's advertising properties to build value for emerging start-ups and high growth companies. While companies can acquire funding for growth and working capital, brand building investments rarely attract interest from the funding community. This is especially true for brands which are new category creators – because the brand investment in such cases needs to be large and sustainable, compared to the hard asset investments. Brand Capital now partners with more than 650 investee companies across sectors as wide as Retail, FMCG, Consumer Durables, Realty, Digital and Mobile, Financial & Consumer Services and several more. Since the inception of this business a decade ago, the Company has helped build several iconic brands in India and its invested value today is close to $3.0 billion. 
About 1World Online 
1World Online has developed and maintains a Consumer Intelligence Platform providing simple but effective engagement applications, unique-engaging content, ongoing market research, and insightful end- user analytics for customers who tap into the Platform. 1World is headquartered in Silicon Valley and has offices in San Jose, CA, Boston, MA, India, Mexico, Europe, Japan, Ukraine, Singapore, and soon China.
