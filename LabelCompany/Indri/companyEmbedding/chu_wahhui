PepsiCo has signed a deal that confirms it as the strategic beverage supplier for all Burger King’s (BK’s) restaurants across China, via franchise bottler Pepsi Beverage Business (PBB).
 


 
PBB is a subsidiary of Tingyi-Asahi Beverages (TAB) in China, and PepsiCo said that the partnership was designed to create new growth opportunities for all three companies across China.The deal spans several beverage brands from PepsiCo’s portfolio, including Pepsi-Cola (China’s best-selling cola), 7UP, Mirinda, Lipton and Tropicana. Burger King began selling PepsiCo beverages earlier this month.PepsiCo said that it had a successful business relationship with BK in other markets, including the US, Latin America, Russia, and Turkey, but that this was the first time it was partnering the firm in China."As one of the best global chains of fast-food brands, BK is deeply honored to move into a strategic partnership with PepsiCo and PBB in China," Li Xiao, president of BK (Shanghai) Foods Company, said.“For dozens of years, PepsiCo and TAB have been committed to taking root in China and paying back to society. Through such cooperation, we hope to further improve the long-term prospects of our business in the Chinese market,” he added."We will continue to provide Chinese consumers with more and better choices of BK products and endeavor to meet their demands for variety, quality and safety-guaranteed food products.”Wah-Hui Chu, chairman of Pepsi Beverages, said, "There's huge potential to be tapped in China's food and beverage market. We’re excited that Pepsi and BK are now joining hands and drawing on each other's strengths in pursuit of win-win cooperation. “The fans of BK will now also get the opportunity to experience a variety of popular PepsiCo beverage products, including Pepsi-Cola, the leading cola brand in China. We look forward to deepening our cooperation with BK stores and providing a wide range of beverage choices and memorable experiences for consumers in China."
