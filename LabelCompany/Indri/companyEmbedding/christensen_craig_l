Job Details
               CLAMP was established as a missions ministry of Great Hope Baptist Church. We are established to assist domestic and international pastors and missionaries with the arduous and very intensive, logistical process of "construction. CLAMP seeks to supply the knowledgeable labor, an intricate supply of tools needed for the construction process, and the necessary support network to missionaries serving in the US or on the field. This task in itself can be very time consuming for church-planting missionaries. The goal of CLAMP is to expedite the process of construction, saving precious time and money for the Lord's work. The missionary church-planter will be better able to focus his time, gifts, and resources on evangelism, discipleship, and church planting. CLAMP exists to glorify our Lord by strengthening the hands of missionaries for the work God has called them to do. Understanding that the ministry of planting churches is more than bricks and mortar, we also realize that buildings are a necessary means for accomplishing the ministry. CLAMP seeks to co-labor with the missionary to lighten his burden in order that a great work might be accomplished for the glory of God.

Biography[edit]
Christensen was born in Salt Lake City, Utah to Sheron Glen Christensen and Colleen Cloward. The family moved to Concord, California, when Christensen was 11 years old. He was an All-American football player in high school and went on to play center for Brigham Young University (BYU) — playing both before and after his two-year service in the Chile Santiago South Mission of the LDS Church, where William R. Bradford, of the First Quorum of the Seventy, was his mission president.
Christensen was engaged to Debora Bliss Jones three weeks after returning from his mission in 1977, and the couple was married in the Salt Lake Temple three months later.[1] They are the parents of four children.
After graduating with a degree in accounting from BYU in 1979, Christensen worked for an accounting firm in California for two years and then attended the University of Washington where he received an MBA. Christensen subsequently moved his family back to Utah, where he bought his first company in 1990. He worked as a real estate developer and franchised automobile dealer. He also taught business and religion classes at BYU.[2]
In the LDS Church, Christensen has served as a high councilor, bishop, temple ordinance worker, counselor in a MTC branch presidency, and area seventy. He served as president of the Mexico Mexico City East Mission from 1995 to 1998. He was called as a general authority on October 5, 2002, serving as a member of the Second Quorum of the Seventy until being transferred to the First Quorum of the Seventy in April 2008.[1] As a general authority, he has served as president of the church's Mexico South Area (2003–07) and in the Priesthood Department, including as Executive Director (2010–12). Christensen became a member of the church's seven-man Presidency of the Seventy on August 1, 2012.
