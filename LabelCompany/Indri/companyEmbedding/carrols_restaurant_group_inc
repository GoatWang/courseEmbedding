Carrols Restaurant Group is an American franchisee company and is the largest Burger King franchisee in the world; Carrols owns and operates over 750 Burger King locations across 20 U.S. states.
The company used to own the restaurant chains Pollo Tropical, Taco Cabana, and Carrols. The original Carrols chain ceased operations in the United States in the mid-1970s. The last unaffiliated Carrols Restaurants existed in Finland. The chain was eventually bought out by another Finnish fast-food chain, Hesburger. In 2012, Hesburger announced that the brand Carrols would be discontinued; the last Carrols (in Oulunkylä) was renamed Hesburger on May 29.

History[edit]
An offshoot of the Tastee-Freez company, it was named for the daughter of Tastee-Freez co-owner Leo Marantz, Carol.[5][6]
Herb Slotnick bought the franchise rights for the New York area and started opening restaurants in the Syracuse, New York area in the early 1960s. They expanded over the years throughout New York State. During the 1960s, a yellow slug character served as Carrols' first mascot, replaced in 1974 by a young blonde boy wearing a tweed suit and a Fedora hat.
Most Carrols restaurant locations were converted to Burger King franchises in 1975, with less profitable stores shuttered. After the conversion, the Carrols brand was only found overseas in Finland, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia and Russia, except for a single franchisee-owned store in Batavia, New York which operated under the Carrols name into the 1980s before closing.
The Finnish group Carrols opened up several locations in St. Petersburg, Russia in the mid-to-late 1990s. In 1998 it opened its first operation in Moscow located at 'then' the new Ohotni Riad Mall. Because of the Financial Crisis of 1998, the operations did not generate enough sales for Carrols, and by 2000 all Carrols outlets in Russia were closed.
The Finnish restaurant company Hesburger started to buy out the last existing Carrol's locations in Helsinki, Finland in the mid-2000s.
On December 9, 2005, Carrols Holdings and Mimi's Café was filed for offerings.[7]
In February 2011 the company announced it was divesting itself of its two Spanish-themed chains, Taco Cabana and Pollo Tropical, in a spin-off aimed at helping the company focus on its core Burger King operations.[8] The sale of the two chains, collectively called the Fiesta Restaurant Group, was completed in May 2012.[9]
Burger King[edit]
In June 2012, Carrols acquired 278 Burger King locations from Burger King for approximately $150 million. In exchange, the Burger King parent, Burger King Corporation took a 28.9% stake in the company. The transaction involved a line of credit that would be used by Carrols to renovate more than 450 of its stores.[9]
Carrols restaurant menu[edit]
During the 1970s, Carrols tried their hand at serving fried chicken; its attempt, fried in oil under pressure, was advertised as "Carrols Crunchy Country Chicken—I can't say it, and I work here". Carrols also formed an agreement with Good Humor to sell several of its ice cream novelty bars.
The flagship sandwich in Carrols' original menu was the Club Burger. Like the Big Mac at McDonald's, it also had two all-beef patties, a special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles and onions, served on a sesame-seeded, triple-decker hamburger bun. The Club Burger also had a tomato slice, and its special sauce is known as Crisbo Royale Sauce. In the early-to-mid-1970s, there was no tomato slice, and the sauce was a French dressing variant called Royal Dressing. The roll was sliced into three parts: crown, center and heel. The sandwich was assembled in a paper collar with the crown having the pickle, lettuce and royal dressing followed by a patty (as I recall topped with onions), center bun section, another patty and a slice of American cheese and finally the heel which had ketchup. The fish sandwich at Carrols was the Sea Filet. This was a fish fillet that was deep fried placed on a steamed roll dressed with tartar sauce, lettuce and salt. They also rolled out the Brute, their own version of Burger King's Whopper. Carrols' Roast Beef Hero piled microwave heated slices of deli roast beef inside a bolillio roll with a dripping of au jus sauce. When introduced, the meat was sliced in the restaurant from roasts. Later the roast beef came in pre-packaged single serving units, served in carton. Carrols' Toasted Cheese (aka TC) had two yellow American cheese slices criss-crossing on both the top and bottom sides of a hamburger bun (cut surfaces to the outside), which was pressed with a spatula as it cooked on the grill. The TC sold for ten cents in 1970.
Theaters[edit]
Beginning in the early 1970s, Carrols owned and operated the CinemaNational movie theater chain, until their sale to Mid-States Theaters and USA Cinemas in the early and mid-1980s. The theaters were concentrated in central New York State, but there were locations as far away as Wisconsin, Idaho and California. The chain consisted mostly of large single-screen locations that had been purchased from companies like Kallet, Hallmark and Dipson Theaters, along with new locations that were built by Slotnick. CinemaNational also built some triple-screen multiplex locations in sites like the Penn-Can Mall in Cicero, New York, and the Fayetteville Mall in Fayetteville.

Carrols Restaurant Group is an American franchisee company and is the largest Burger King franchisee in the world; Carrols owns and operates over 750 Burger King locations across 20 U.S. states.
The company used to own the restaurant chains Pollo Tropical, Taco Cabana, and Carrols. The original Carrols chain ceased operations in the United States in the mid-1970s. The last unaffiliated Carrols Restaurants existed in Finland. The chain was eventually bought out by another Finnish fast-food chain, Hesburger. In 2012, Hesburger announced that the brand Carrols would be discontinued; the last Carrols (in Oulunkylä) was renamed Hesburger on May 29.

History[edit]
An offshoot of the Tastee-Freez company, it was named for the daughter of Tastee-Freez co-owner Leo Marantz, Carol.[5][6]
Herb Slotnick bought the franchise rights for the New York area and started opening restaurants in the Syracuse, New York area in the early 1960s. They expanded over the years throughout New York State. During the 1960s, a yellow slug character served as Carrols' first mascot, replaced in 1974 by a young blonde boy wearing a tweed suit and a Fedora hat.
Most Carrols restaurant locations were converted to Burger King franchises in 1975, with less profitable stores shuttered. After the conversion, the Carrols brand was only found overseas in Finland, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia and Russia, except for a single franchisee-owned store in Batavia, New York which operated under the Carrols name into the 1980s before closing.
The Finnish group Carrols opened up several locations in St. Petersburg, Russia in the mid-to-late 1990s. In 1998 it opened its first operation in Moscow located at 'then' the new Ohotni Riad Mall. Because of the Financial Crisis of 1998, the operations did not generate enough sales for Carrols, and by 2000 all Carrols outlets in Russia were closed.
The Finnish restaurant company Hesburger started to buy out the last existing Carrol's locations in Helsinki, Finland in the mid-2000s.
On December 9, 2005, Carrols Holdings and Mimi's Café was filed for offerings.[7]
In February 2011 the company announced it was divesting itself of its two Spanish-themed chains, Taco Cabana and Pollo Tropical, in a spin-off aimed at helping the company focus on its core Burger King operations.[8] The sale of the two chains, collectively called the Fiesta Restaurant Group, was completed in May 2012.[9]
Burger King[edit]
In June 2012, Carrols acquired 278 Burger King locations from Burger King for approximately $150 million. In exchange, the Burger King parent, Burger King Corporation took a 28.9% stake in the company. The transaction involved a line of credit that would be used by Carrols to renovate more than 450 of its stores.[9]
Carrols restaurant menu[edit]
During the 1970s, Carrols tried their hand at serving fried chicken; its attempt, fried in oil under pressure, was advertised as "Carrols Crunchy Country Chicken—I can't say it, and I work here". Carrols also formed an agreement with Good Humor to sell several of its ice cream novelty bars.
The flagship sandwich in Carrols' original menu was the Club Burger. Like the Big Mac at McDonald's, it also had two all-beef patties, a special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles and onions, served on a sesame-seeded, triple-decker hamburger bun. The Club Burger also had a tomato slice, and its special sauce is known as Crisbo Royale Sauce. In the early-to-mid-1970s, there was no tomato slice, and the sauce was a French dressing variant called Royal Dressing. The roll was sliced into three parts: crown, center and heel. The sandwich was assembled in a paper collar with the crown having the pickle, lettuce and royal dressing followed by a patty (as I recall topped with onions), center bun section, another patty and a slice of American cheese and finally the heel which had ketchup. The fish sandwich at Carrols was the Sea Filet. This was a fish fillet that was deep fried placed on a steamed roll dressed with tartar sauce, lettuce and salt. They also rolled out the Brute, their own version of Burger King's Whopper. Carrols' Roast Beef Hero piled microwave heated slices of deli roast beef inside a bolillio roll with a dripping of au jus sauce. When introduced, the meat was sliced in the restaurant from roasts. Later the roast beef came in pre-packaged single serving units, served in carton. Carrols' Toasted Cheese (aka TC) had two yellow American cheese slices criss-crossing on both the top and bottom sides of a hamburger bun (cut surfaces to the outside), which was pressed with a spatula as it cooked on the grill. The TC sold for ten cents in 1970.
Theaters[edit]
Beginning in the early 1970s, Carrols owned and operated the CinemaNational movie theater chain, until their sale to Mid-States Theaters and USA Cinemas in the early and mid-1980s. The theaters were concentrated in central New York State, but there were locations as far away as Wisconsin, Idaho and California. The chain consisted mostly of large single-screen locations that had been purchased from companies like Kallet, Hallmark and Dipson Theaters, along with new locations that were built by Slotnick. CinemaNational also built some triple-screen multiplex locations in sites like the Penn-Can Mall in Cicero, New York, and the Fayetteville Mall in Fayetteville.

Carrols Restaurant Group, Inc. Serves Up a Strong Quarter
After a solid 2016, the Burger King franchisee looks forward to new acquisition and development opportunities in the year ahead.











                Steve Symington
            

                (TMFSymington)



            
            Mar 3, 2017 at 7:00AM
            
            





Carrols Restaurant Group, Inc.  (NASDAQ:TAST) announced reasonably solid fourth-quarter 2016 results Thursday morning, but shares of the country's largest Burger King franchisee fell 3.8% as the market chewed on the news.
Let's take a closer look at what drove Carrols Restaurant Group's business as the year came to a close, as well as what investors can expect from the company going forward.

DATA SOURCE: CARROLS RESTAURANT GROUP, INC. 
What happened with Carrols Restaurant Group this quarter?

Last year's fourth quarter had an additional operating week, which added an estimated $16 million to restaurant sales. Sales grew 13% on a comparable 13-week basis.
The significant growth in reported net income was primarily due to a $30.4 million reversal of the valuation allowance previously established against net deferred income tax assets. On an adjusted (non-GAAP) basis, net income was $2.0 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, down from $6.5 million, or $0.14 per share in the same year-ago period. 
Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization was $20.4 million, down from $23.7 million in last year's fourth quarter. The extra week in 2015 contributed roughly $4.0 million to adjusted EBITDA.
Comparable restaurant sales (on a 13-week) basis grew 3.2%.
On Feb. 28, 2017, Carrols completed its acquisition of 43 additional Burger King restaurants in and around Cincinnati -- on top of the 56 locations it acquired in all of 2016 -- bringing its total Burger King restaurants to 790.






What management had to say
According to Carrols Restaurant Group CEO Daniel Accordino:

We were pleased to have been generally in line with our 2016 outlook for restaurant sales, comparable restaurant sales and Adjusted EBITDA, especially when considering the highly competitive and promotional environment that existed throughout the year. Adjusted EBITDA margin also improved for the year due primarily to lower commodity costs, namely ground beef, and from ongoing improvements to margins at our acquired restaurants. We posted a solid 3.2% comparable restaurant sales increase for the fourth quarter on top of the prior year period increase of 5.1%. Burger King's promotional strategy continued to effectively focus on products that appeal to premium and value-driven customers while driving increases in both customer traffic and average check.

Looking forward 
Accordino also pointed out that after remodeling 85 locations and rebuilding or relocating eight restaurants last year, more than 70% of Carrols' restaurants featured its refreshed 20/20 design image at the end of 2016. In 2017, however, the company plans to scale back its remodeling efforts and total capital expenditures, which should result in higher free cash flow that can be used for future strategic acquisitions and planned new restaurant development.
In the meantime, Carrols expects total restaurant sales in 2017 to be in the range of $1.02 billion to $1.07 billion, assuming comparable-restaurant sales growth of 2% to 4%. Trending toward the bottom line, that should translate to adjusted EBITDA of $90 million to $100 million. Carrols also expects to open seven to 15 new restaurants this year, including two relocations, while closing 20 to 25 existing restaurants.
To be fair, those planned closures will almost certainly come from a pool of underperforming locations, thereby improving Carrols' financial profile. And with higher free cash flow potentially opening the door for new acquisitions -- something today's difficult restaurant environment can provide at often attractive prices -- Carrols Restaurant Group could easily end next year with an even larger restaurant base. Carrols' also enjoys significant built-in sales- and profit-driving advantages given both its scale and the outperformance of the Burger King brand relative to its other fast-food industry peers.
So while the market's initial tepid response to this report may not indicate as much, I think long-term investors should be happy with where Carrols Restaurant Group stands today.

Slow Hiring, 16-Year Low Jobless Rate Shifts Fed Outlook
The U.S. economy added 138,000 jobs in May, far less than expected with downward revisions for prior months. The unemployment fell to a 16-year low of 4.3%, the Labor Department reported on Friday, as fewer people searched for work. The data don't change expectations for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in on June 14, but markets no longer expect a subsequent hike in 2017.

Companies like Jack in the Box (JACK), AutoZone (AZO) and Union Pacific (UNP) are among companies reporting accelerating wage pressures in recent months, while American Airlines (AAL) and

Carrols Restaurant Group, Inc. Reports Financial Results for the 
      First Quarter 2017






May 09, 2017 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SYRACUSE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Carrols Restaurant Group, Inc. (“Carrols” or the “Company”) 
      (Nasdaq:TAST) today announced financial results for the first quarter 
      2017 ended April 2, 2017.
    

Highlights for first quarter of 2017 versus first quarter of 2016 
      include:



        Restaurant sales increased 7.8% to $239.9 million from $222.5 million 
        in the first quarter of 2016, including $37.7 million in sales from 
        the 154 BURGER KING® restaurants acquired from 2015 to 2017(1);
      

        Comparable restaurant sales decreased 0.6% compared to a 5.7% increase 
        in the prior year period;
      

        Adjusted EBITDA(2) was $13.9 million compared to $18.5 
        million in the prior year period;
      

        Net loss was $5.6 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, compared to net 
        income of $2.1 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, in the prior year 
        period.
      

        Adjusted net loss(2) was $4.8 million, or $0.14 per diluted 
        share, compared to adjusted net income of $2.3 million, or $0.05 per 
        diluted share, in the prior year period.
      


(1) “Acquired restaurants” refer to those restaurants acquired 
      from 2015 through 2017. “Legacy restaurants” include all of the 
      Company’s other restaurants including restaurants acquired before 2015.


(2) Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-level EBITDA and Adjusted net 
      income (loss) are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to the definitions 
      and reconciliation of these measures to net income (loss) or to income 
      (loss) from operations in the tables at the end of this release.


      At the end of the first quarter of 2017, Carrols owned and operated 788 
      BURGER KING® restaurants.
    

      Daniel T. Accordino, the Company's Chief Executive Officer said, “Total 
      restaurant sales increased 7.8% in the first quarter of 2017 reflecting 
      our acquisition of 99 restaurants since the beginning of last year. As 
      expected however, we had a modest decrease in comparable restaurant 
      sales as we cycled past our strongest 2016 quarterly comparison, a 5.7% 
      increase. Lower Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin reflected 
      continuing pressure on wage rates, modestly higher commodity costs along 
      with increased promotions and discounting which accelerated over the 
      course of the past year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was further impacted by 
      lower margins at the restaurants we have acquired, fixed costs 
      deleveraging from lower comparable restaurant sales along with the 
      seasonable impact of lower average sales volumes.”
    

      Accordino continued, “We expect that comparable restaurant sales should 
      improve as comparisons ease for the balance of the year and as we gain 
      traction from recent product launches and promotions. In fact, so far in 
      the second quarter, comparable restaurant sales are trending positively 
      in the mid-single digit range. We also expect to see greater traction as 
      we progress with our integration of recent acquisitions, including the 
      43 restaurants that we acquired in the Cincinnati market in late 
      February. We have, however, modestly adjusted our 2017 outlook after 
      considering our first quarter results and anticipated cost trends for 
      the remainder of the year including slightly higher commodity costs.”
    

First Quarter 2017 Financial Results


      Restaurant sales increased 7.8% to $239.9 million in the first quarter 
      of 2017 compared to $222.5 million in the first quarter of 2016. 
      Restaurant sales included $37.7 million in sales from the 154 BURGER 
      KING® restaurants acquired from 2015 to 2017 and a comparable restaurant 
      sales decrease of 0.6%.
    

      The comparable restaurant sales decrease included a 0.6% decrease at 
      legacy restaurants and a 0.8% decrease at comparable acquired 
      restaurants (primarily the 2015 acquisitions). Average check increased 
      2.6% while customer traffic decreased 3.2% from the prior year period.
    

      Restaurant-Level EBITDA was $27.9 million in the first quarter of 2017, 
      which included a $3.6 million contribution from the acquired 
      restaurants, compared to Restaurant-Level EBITDA of $30.7 million in the 
      first quarter of 2016. Restaurant-Level EBITDA margin was 11.6% of 
      restaurant sales and decreased 219 basis points from the prior year 
      period.
    

      General and administrative expenses were $15.6 million in the first 
      quarter of 2017 compared to $13.2 million in the first quarter of 2016. 
      As a percentage of restaurant sales, general and administrative expenses 
      increased 56 basis points to 6.5% compared to the prior year period.
    

      Adjusted EBITDA was $13.9 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared 
      to $18.5 million in the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin 
      decreased 252 basis points to 5.8% of restaurant sales.
    

      Loss from operations was $1.4 million in the first quarter of 2017 
      compared to income from operations of $6.7 million in the prior year 
      period.
    

      Interest expense increased slightly to $4.8 million in the first quarter 
      of 2017 from $4.5 million in the same period last year.
    

      Net loss was $5.6 million for the first quarter of 2017, or $0.16 per 
      diluted share, compared to net income of $2.1 million, or $0.05 per 
      diluted share, in the prior year period.
    

      Net loss in the first quarter of 2017 included $0.5 million of 
      impairment and other lease charges and $0.7 million of acquisition 
      expenses. For the same period last year, net income included $0.2 
      million of impairment and other lease charges, $0.4 million of 
      acquisition expenses and a $0.5 million gain from a partial 
      condemnation. Because the Company had a net deferred income tax asset 
      valuation allowance prior to the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company did 
      not record any income tax expense in the first quarter of 2016.
    

      Adjusted net loss was $4.8 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, compared 
      to adjusted net income of $2.3 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, in 
      the prior year period. For comparability, Adjusted net income for the 
      first quarter of 2016 reflects a normalized provision for income taxes 
      as if the valuation allowance had been reversed prior to 2016.
    

Full Year 2017 Outlook


      The Company is providing the following updated guidance for 2017. As a 
      reminder, while the Company may acquire additional BURGER KING® 
      restaurants in 2017, this guidance does not include any impact from such 
      potential future transactions:
    


        Total restaurant sales of $1.03 billion to $1.06 billion (previously 
        $1.02 billion to $1.07 billion), including a comparable restaurant 
        sales increase of 2% to 3% (previously 2% to 4%);
      

        Commodity cost increases of 1% to 3% including a 2% to 4% increase in 
        beef costs (previously 0% to 2% with a modest decrease in beef costs);
      

        General and administrative expenses (excluding stock compensation and 
        acquisition costs) of $54 million to $56 million;
      

        Adjusted EBITDA of $90 million to $95 million (previously $90 million 
        to $100 million);
      

        Capital expenditures of approximately $65 million to $85 million 
        (previously $55 million to $75 million) which includes remodeling a 
        total of 28 to 32 restaurants (previously 20 to 25), the rebuilding of 
        6 to 8 restaurants (previously 5 to 7) and the construction of 10 to 
        15 new restaurants (previously 7 to 15) including 2 or 3 relocations 
        of existing restaurants. Capital expenditures also include $10 million 
        to $12 million for non-recurring investments in new kitchen production 
        and product holding systems, new training systems and certain POS 
        system upgrades;
      

        The closing of 15 to 20 existing restaurants (previously 20 to 25) of 
        which 9 had been closed as of April 2, 2017; and
      

        An effective income tax rate of 18% to 20% (previously 20% to 25%).
      


      The Company has not reconciled guidance for Adjusted EBITDA to the 
      corresponding GAAP financial measure because it does not provide 
      guidance for net income or for the various reconciling items. The 
      Company is unable to provide guidance for these reconciling items since 
      certain items that impact net income are outside of the Company’s 
      control or cannot be reasonably predicted.

      (a) For 2017 we have modified our groupings of restaurants for reporting 
      and analysis purposes. Acquired restaurants represent the 154 
      restaurants acquired in 16 acquisitions from 2015 through 2017. Legacy 
      restaurants represent all other restaurants including restaurants 
      acquired before 2015.
    

      (b) Restaurants are generally included in comparable restaurant sales 
      after they have been open or acquired for 12 months. The calculation of 
      changes in comparable restaurant sales is based on the comparable 
      13-week period.
    

      (c) Average weekly sales per restaurant are derived by dividing 
      restaurant sales for the comparable 13-week period by the average number 
      of restaurants operating during such period.
    

      (d) EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Restaurant-Level 
      EBITDA, Restaurant-Level EBITDA margin and Adjusted net income (loss) 
      are non-GAAP financial measures and may not necessarily be comparable to 
      other similarly titled captions of other companies due to differences in 
      methods of calculation. Refer to the Company's reconciliation of net 
      income (loss) to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income (loss), 
      and to the Company's reconciliation of income (loss) from operations to 
      Restaurant-Level EBITDA for further detail. Both Adjusted EBITDA margin 
      and Restaurant-Level EBITDA margin are calculated as a percentage of 
      restaurant sales for the respective group of restaurants. Adjusted 
      diluted net income (loss) per share is calculated based on Adjusted net 
      income (loss) and reflects the dilutive impact of shares, where 
      applicable, based on Adjusted net income (loss).
    

      (e) Long-term debt (including current portion and excluding deferred 
      financing costs) at April 2, 2017 included $200,000 of the Company's 8% 
      Senior Secured Second Lien Notes, $37,500 of outstanding revolving 
      borrowings under the Company's senior credit facility, $1,203 of lease 
      financing obligations and $6,738 of capital lease obligations. Long-term 
      debt (including current portion and excluding deferred financing costs) 
      at January 1, 2017 included $200,000 of the Company's 8% Senior Secured 
      Second Lien Notes, $13,500 of outstanding revolving borrowings under the 
      Company's senior credit facility, $3,020 of lease financing obligations 
      and $7,039 of capital lease obligations.

      (a) Within our press release, we make reference to EBITDA, Adjusted 
      EBITDA, Restaurant-Level EBITDA and Adjusted net income (loss) which are 
      non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA represents net income (loss) before 
      benefit for income taxes, interest expense and depreciation and 
      amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as adjusted to exclude 
      impairment and other lease charges, acquisition costs, stock-based 
      compensation expense and other non-recurring income or expense. 
      Restaurant-Level EBITDA represents income (loss) from operations as 
      adjusted to exclude general and administrative expenses, depreciation 
      and amortization, impairment and other lease charges and other income. 
      Adjusted net income (loss)represents net income (loss) as adjusted to 
      exclude impairment and other lease charges, acquisition costs and other 
      non-recurring income or expense.
    

      We are presenting Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-Level EBITDA and Adjusted 
      net income (loss) because we believe that they provide a more meaningful 
      comparison than EBITDA and net income (loss) of the Company's core 
      business operating results, as well as with those of other similar 
      companies. Additionally, we present Restaurant-Level EBITDA because it 
      excludes the impact of general and administrative expenses and other 
      income, all of which are non-recurring at the restaurant level. 
      Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-Level EBITDA and 
      Adjusted net income (loss), when viewed with the Company's results of 
      operations in accordance with GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations 
      in the table above, provide useful information about operating 
      performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional 
      information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of 
      the Company's core business without regard to potential distortions. 
      Additionally, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA and 
      Restaurant-Level EBITDA permit investors to gain an understanding of the 
      factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which 
      capital investments are made and debt is serviced.
    

      However, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-Level EBITDA and Adjusted 
      net income (loss) are not measures of financial performance or liquidity 
      under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as alternatives to 
      net income (loss), income (loss) from operations or cash flow from 
      operating activities as indicators of operating performance or 
      liquidity. Also, these measures may not be comparable to similarly 
      titled captions of other companies. The tables above provide 
      reconciliations between net income (loss) and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA 
      and Adjusted net income (loss) and between income (loss) from operations 
      and Restaurant-Level EBITDA.
    

      (b) Acquisition costs for the periods presented include primarily legal 
      and professional fees incurred in connection with restaurant 
      acquisitions, which were included in general and administrative expense.
    

      (c) The income tax effect related to the adjustments for impairment and 
      other lease charges, acquisition costs and gain on partial condemnation 
      during the periods presented was calculated using an effective income 
      tax rate of 38%.
    

      (d) Prior to the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company recognized a 
      valuation allowance on all of its net deferred income tax assets. This 
      valuation allowance was reversed in the fourth quarter of 2016. For 
      comparability, when presenting Adjusted net income (loss), this 
      adjustment reflects the benefit that would have been realized from 
      deferred income tax assets during the three months ended April 3, 2016 
      if such valuation allowance on net deferred income tax assets had been 
      reversed prior to 2016.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
