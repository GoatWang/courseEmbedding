Top critical reviewSee all 2 critical reviews› 3.0 out of 5 starsBritish Humor is Ridiculous, but I Love It!ByKevin Alphonsoon January 28, 2000Sometimes, I just don't get British humor. My English relatives love the jokes of their countryman -- sometimes I simply don't get it. But, the jokes here are universal. There are many scenes which are made up of very embarrassing, but very funny, everyday scenarios. The story is about Travel  bookstore ownder William Thacker, played by Hugh Grant, who lives in  London, England's posh, expensive, and very high class Notting Hill  district. One day, he meets and falls in love with lovely American actress  Anna Scott, in one of the best scenes of the film. (It involves a cup of  orange juice, apricots soaked in honey, and "raisins" -- remember  that word for one of the film's BEST lines!And Richard Curtis knows how  to write dialogue -- this man can think up some really funny one-liners!  Some of the supporting characters were off-the-wall (but not written  spaztically -- a good thing). If you enjoyed the movie, check it out. It's  worth the cash.

No, not that guy, not Hugh, but Richard Curtis.  And Tim McInnerny. I liked the movie, of course--otherwise I wouldn't have  bothered reading the screenplay--but the screenplay was better than the  movie. Edited-out scenes, alternate storylines, a very funny afterword,  lovely pictures. Plus the book's printed on just the most wonderful paper.  I'm a sucker for good paper.0Comment|

        An enormously rich wine, flamboyant in blackberries, cherries, Dr. Pepper cola, sweet cured meat, anise, and black pepper flavors that sink in deep and last long into the finish. An unusual blend of Malbec, Merlot and Syrah, it's powerful in tannins and bone dry. Grill up your best steak and enjoy.

                                K&L Notes
                            

                            The "Richard Dinner Vineyards" Sonoma Red from Rocky Hill is a propietary blend consisting of 39.4% Malbec, 39.4% Merlot, and 21.2% Syrah. Situated on Sonoma Mountain's northeastern face, Rocky Hill is a family-owned and managed farm and ranch, first established in 1959. The Richard Dinner Vineyards were planted in the early 1980's. These special soils, composed of high-draining volcanic rock (mixed with river sediment and clay loam) are naturally farmed using a combination of organic and sustainable methods.

                Yes, I know you have never heard of this wine. That's precisely why we wanted to let you know about it. This beautiful red from Sonoma Mountain is lush and dynamic with loads of blue and red fruit fruit, smoked meat, cedar, pepper and cola. It's a blend of Malbec, Merlot and Syrah, and it will be a wine that you won't forget.  The kind of wine that will be very well known in the next five years.  Jump on the bandwagon now before it gets too crowded.

                Love this blend. Hard to find, but rewarding once found.

United States


 - When people consider domestic wine, they normally think about the state of California. The fine viticultural Region within California, including the Napa Valley, Sonoma, Santa Cruz Mountains, Mendocino and Santa Barbara, are capable of growing grapes of world-class quality. But there's plenty of fabulous wine coming from other states, too. Oregon, Washington and New York are also causing eyebrows (and glassware) to be raised around the world.  Click for a list of bestselling items from the United States.                        



                            Sub-Region:
                        

California


 - With the explosive growth that California's wine industry has seen the past several years, it's easy to view winemaking and grape growing in the Golden State as a recent phenomenon.  And while it's true that California's viticultural history is brief compared to several European countries, this state's roots date back well over 200 years.  Due to the enormous response to California wine within the United States and worldwide, there are thousands of excellent and diverse wines being produced within the state each year.  For our entire selection of California wines, please visit this link.                        



                            Specific Appellation:
                        

Sonoma County


 - Second in fame only to Napa, this "other" valley offers just about every climate and topography imaginable. From its cool and fog-enshrouded coastal regions on the far west, to the sprawling Alexander Valley on the boarder of Napa and the many little dips and peaks in between, Sonoma has been a vital wine-grape-growing region since the mid 1800s. Important sub-AVAs include Chalk Hill (known for chardonnay and sauvignon blanc), Dry Creek Valley (where zin is king) Knights Valley (largely cabernet land), Russian River Valley and Sonoma Coast (both celebrated pinot and chardonnay zones).
