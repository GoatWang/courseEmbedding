Item Description: Talon Books,Canada, Canada, 2002. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Language: English . Brand New Book. Colin Browne s exciting new work Ground Water received a glowing review in The Georgia Straight (June 6-13, 2002 issue). In all map making, one begins with the representation of ground and water, and what grows or is constructed on these representations is rendered by a series of conventional symbols-the elements of topography. This book of poems is an investigation of the elements of the spiritual topography of the 20th century, and a close examination of the conventional symbology passed on to the poet/map-maker by his ancestors-his father and mother, his grandparents, his aunts and uncles. It is a paralysing inheritance which is rendered here-an entire century, not begun with the war to end all wars, but a century through which that great calamity of mechanized and mass-produced misunderstandings was perpetually reproduced. These ancestors have abetted suffering they could never have imagined. Accessories to crimes against whole populations that made possible their pleasures and their grace, they re humiliated and ashamed, mortified by themselves, by their indignity and complicity. Incapable of reversing the inhumanity of what they have created, they have left the traces of their deeds on the landscape, fragments of correspondence for their sons and daughters to decipher. Within this wilderness of the 20th century, the green flame of life continually presents itself in these poems as an emergency-an emergence, a coming-out, a flower, a bloom of identity, shape and form, requiring immediate attention and action, asserting itself as mimesis, and constituting a disruption of the conventional representations of the symbolic.

JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREI Had An Interesting French Artist To See Me This Summer: Emily Carr And Wolfgang Paalen In British Columbiaby Browne, Colin"I Had an Interesting French Artist to See Me This Summer: Emily Carr and Wolfgang Paalen in British Columbia" brings together new research concerning the French/Austrian artist Wolfgang Paalen (19051959), and the great Canadian modernist, Emily Carr (18711945), both of whom dedicated their most productive years to what Paalen called the direct visualization of the forces which move our body and mind. Accompanying an exhibition at the Vancouver Art Gallery scheduled for July 1 to November 13, 2016, the catalog will tell the story of how both artists met in Victoria, British Columbia, in 1939, and how the creative vision of each one expanded in reaction to the landscape and the monumental art of the Northwest Coast First Nations. The catalog will present an essay by the scholar Colin Browne, ancillary archival materials, as well as full color reproductions of both early and late works by both artists as they moved toward their transcendent visions. With objects assembled from public and private collections internationally, this first pairing of these two modernist painters is being organized by the Vancouver Art Gallery, and curated by Colin Browne."Collections, Catalogs, Exhibitions, European, CanadianCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.
