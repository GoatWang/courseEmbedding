        Enviro Voraxial Technology, Inc.

Stock Symbol: EVTN
 EVTN is a Fort Lauderdale, Florida based CleanTech company that developed and manufactures the Voraxial® Separator, arguably the world's most efficient, high volume, bulk fluid and fluid/solid separation technology.        The Voraxial®  performs separation without a pressure   drop.

 Applications include, but are not limited to: oil spill cleanup, waste-to-energy, onshore and offshore dispersed water separation, frac water, stormwater, refinery wastewater cleanup and bio-fuels. The separation market encompasses many series of multi-billion dollar segments, spread  globally across many industries and applications. EVTN's Voraxial® separation   systems have completed projects with many of the world's top industrial companies, including ConocoPhillips, Cameco, Repsol, US Navy and Transocean. 

EVTN was originally founded as a high precision aerospace manufacturer that   built the gyro platforms for the Hubble Space Telescope as well as missile and   satellite components.  EVTN re-invested its profits along with equity investors (that include two European Intuitions) toward the development of the Voraxial®  Separator. The Voraxial® is now successfully commercialized and is   the exclusive focus of EVTN's business. EVTN owns significant intellectual property surrounding   the Voraxial® and has new innovations under development to enhance its   potentially market dominant technology.

More about EVTN:    Enviro Voraxial Technology, Inc. has its roots deep in the precision aerospace and defense industry.  In the 1980's, Alberto Di Bella (above) served as the founder and President of Florida Precision Aerospace, a Florida corporation based out of Deerfield Beach. In its prime, Florida Precision Aerospace employed a very large staff and was responsible for precision machining for numerous industries including defense contracting, aerospace, automotive and healthcare. In the early 90's, as the defense budget scaled back, Mr. Di Bella downsized the company and focused on smaller high gross margin jobs in the aerospace industry.  Projects include the gyroscope housing for the Hubble Space Telescope, gear shift systems and beryllium manufacturing.
In the 1990’s, Mr. Di Bella assisted in the designing and prototype development of the patented Voraxial® Separator. In 1996, Florida Precision Aerospace acquired Idaho Silver, a public company, and changed its name to Enviro Voraxial Technology, Inc. The company continues to operate as Enviro Voraxial Technology and its subsidiary, Florida Precision Aerospace, for reason of defense qualification procedures. 
 
  From a 2012 Interview with CEO John Di Bella, "Our 	technology fills a void in one of the largest market sectors in the world, 	which is the ability to separate contaminants from a large volume of liquids 	with less space, energy and weight. This increases productivity and 	significantly reduces costs for our customers. "

  "Our customers include some of 	the largest companies in the world… If you extrapolate this out twelve to 	twenty-four months from now, there is no reason why we are not generating 4 	to 8 times what we generated last year. That is exciting!" - John A. DiBella Entire interview here: scroll down on this page or pdf

Enviro Voraxial Technology, Inc. (Stock Symbol: EVTN) is the developer and manufacturer of the Voraxial® Separator, arguably the world’s most efficient, high volume, bulk fluid and fluid/solid separation technology.  EVTN has developed and patented the Voraxial® Separator; a revolutionary and proprietary technology that efficiently separates large volumes of solids and liquids with different specific gravities.  The Voraxial® Separator acts as an in-line, continuous flow separator that can conduct high volume liquid/liquid, liquid/solid or liquid/liquid/solid separation.  The Voraxial performs separation without a pressure drop.
The Voraxial can efficiently handle fluctuations in flow rate and oil concentrations without any adjustments, allowing for ease of installation and operation.  This superior separation is achieved in real-time, and in much greater volumes, with a more compact and energy efficient machine than any product on the market today.

 Voraxial® Separator vs. Hydrocyclone, Centrifuge
The Voraxial® Separator is  superior to  hydrocyclones and centrifuges and outperforms both in key oil/water  separator applications.

A hydrocyclone's inherent limitation is its requirement for a pressure drop to  conduct separation. There is no pressure drop with the Voraxial®.

Further, a hydrocyclone cannot perform 3-way separation.  
In order to accomplish this with hydrocyclone or centrifuge-type units, two separate units are required - one hydrocyclone for solids removal and another for oil removal.
 
A single Voraxial®, with its patented vortex separation, however, can easily and efficiently achieve 3-way separation in one single pass.

Efficient, high volume separator-technology for liquid/liquid, solid/liquid, solid/liquid/liquid or gas. The Voraxial® Separator's wastewater treatment process with vortex separation is proven to be a return on investment, on average, in 12 months. 

        No Pressure Drop
The Voraxial® is a unique, patented, in-line,  separator that provides a cost effective method to efficiently separate large volumes of solids, liquids and gases of different specific gravities and without the need of a pressure drop.
Small Foot Print
The Voraxial® provides highly efficient separation in wastewater treatment of all types while requiring less space, energy and weight than conventional separators processing the same volume.
Ease of Use
        The Voraxial® can efficiently handle fluctuations in flow rate and oil concentrations without any adjustments, allowing for ease of installation and operation in use at wastewater treatment plants, oil rigs or food processing facilities.  There is only one moving part on the Voraxial®, allowing for very little costly downtime in the event of maintenance or repair. 
        High Volume/Energy Efficient
Superior separation is achieved in real-time, and in much greater volumes, with a more compact and energy efficient machine than any product on the market today. 

 
High Volume Separator
        Scalable Voraxial® Models


1000 Separator – 1-5 GPM
        2000 Separator – 20-60 GPM
        4000 Separator – 100-500 GPM
        8000 Separator – 1000-5000 GPM

Solid/liquid/liquid separation


Additional Wastewater Treatment Benefits with the Voraxial® Separator

High performance vortex separation over a wide concentration range with no adjusting necessary.
Operates with low or high inlet pressure.
Low shear impeller – oils are not emulsified.
Non-clogging – open impeller.
Variable speeds to optimize separation.

Company IntroServicesKey ContactsAbout CompanyEfficient, high volume separator-technology for liquid/liquid, solid/liquid, solid/liquid/liquid or gas. The Voraxial® Separator's wastewater treatment process with vortex separation is proven to be a return on investment, on average, in 12 months.The Voraxial® is a unique, patented, in-line, separator that provides a cost effective method to efficiently separate large volumes of solids, liquids and gases of different specific gravities and without the need of a pressure drop.The Voraxial® provides highly efficient separation in wastewater treatment of all types while requiring less space, energy and weight than conventional separators processing the same volume.The Voraxial® can efficiently handle fluctuations in flow rate and oil concentrations without any adjustments, allowing for ease of installation and operation in use at wastewater treatment plants, oil rigs or food processing facilities. There is only one moving part on the Voraxial®, allowing for very little costly downtime in the event of maintenance or repair.Superior separation is achieved in real-time, and in much greater volumes, with a more compact and energy efficient machine than any product on the market today.Company NameEnviro Voraxialtechnology, INCBusiness CategoryOil & GasAddress821 NW 57th Place Fort33309 LauderdaleFloridaUnited StatesPresidentNAYear EstablishedNAEmployeesNAMembershipsNAHours of OperationNACompany ServicesOil & Gas Produced Water SolutionOil Spill Cleanup

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

 Voraxial® Separator vs. Hydrocyclone, Centrifuge
The Voraxial® Separator is  superior to  hydrocyclones and centrifuges and outperforms both in key oil/water  separator applications.

A hydrocyclone's inherent limitation is its requirement for a pressure drop to  conduct separation. There is no pressure drop with the Voraxial®.

Further, a hydrocyclone cannot perform 3-way separation.  
In order to accomplish this with hydrocyclone or centrifuge-type units, two separate units are required - one hydrocyclone for solids removal and another for oil removal.
 
A single Voraxial®, with its patented vortex separation, however, can easily and efficiently achieve 3-way separation in one single pass.

Efficient, high volume separator-technology for liquid/liquid, solid/liquid, solid/liquid/liquid or gas. The Voraxial® Separator's wastewater treatment process with vortex separation is proven to be a return on investment, on average, in 12 months. 

        No Pressure Drop
The Voraxial® is a unique, patented, in-line,  separator that provides a cost effective method to efficiently separate large volumes of solids, liquids and gases of different specific gravities and without the need of a pressure drop.
Small Foot Print
The Voraxial® provides highly efficient separation in wastewater treatment of all types while requiring less space, energy and weight than conventional separators processing the same volume.
Ease of Use
        The Voraxial® can efficiently handle fluctuations in flow rate and oil concentrations without any adjustments, allowing for ease of installation and operation in use at wastewater treatment plants, oil rigs or food processing facilities.  There is only one moving part on the Voraxial®, allowing for very little costly downtime in the event of maintenance or repair. 
        High Volume/Energy Efficient
Superior separation is achieved in real-time, and in much greater volumes, with a more compact and energy efficient machine than any product on the market today.
