How to Store Liquid-in-Glass Thermomters



CultureTemp Warming Plate



NEW EcoTensil® Spoon








How to Store Liquid-in-Glass Thermomters
            The way you store liquid-in-glass thermometers matters! Prevent separation by storing thermometers vertically in a rack, or at a 15° or greater angle in a thermometer tray. If your thermometer separates in storage or transit, reuniting the liquid is possible! Watch our video to see the different techniques        






CultureTemp Warming Plate
            Keep Cells Viable with the CultureTemp 37° Warming Plate        






NEW EcoTensil® Spoon
EcoTensil® Disposable Paper Sampling Spoon. Coated to stand up to powders, gels, and semi-solids, they are disposable and use 50-90% less material and space than the same amount of plastic spoons.

Prices for our services vary and can increase depending on the stylist, difficulty of the service and the time spent with the client. Exact quotes can only be given upon consultation. Please contact our wedding party coordinator at the location of your choice for more information. They will be your individual contact from the booking of the party through the wedding date.

Wedding Policies

— Art + Science requires a practice appointment for all hair services for brides at least one week prior to the wedding day.
— We also require a credit card to reserve all wedding appointments. Please allow 48 hours for all cancellations. If appointments are not cancelled within 48 hours, or an appointment is missed there will be a full charge.
 
Hair Models
Our salon has an intensive training program for men’s and women’s cut and color that requires hair models for every class on Monday at our Wicker Park location. Models are needed for around 1-2 hours from 11am to 5pm depending on the apprentice and their curriculum. All cuts for models are $5 for men’s cuts, $10 for women’s cuts and all colors for models are $20 (to cover a product charge).
If you are interested in being a model, please look for weekly postings from our apprentices on salonapprentice.com and contact the apprentice directly. We are unable to book apprentice appointments through the front desk at this time. For more information on our education program please check out our careers page.

“Not only did I fall in love with this work — the complete experience was second
                                to none! The artist did a fantastic job of packaging the artworks so it arrived safely,
                                which it did in less time than expected!”

“Not only did I fall in love with this work — the complete experience was second
                                to none! The artist did a fantastic job of packaging the artworks so it arrived safely,
                                which it did in less time than expected!”
