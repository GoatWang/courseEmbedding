Please see your applicable Wells Fargo account agreement and card terms and conditions for information on liability for unauthorized transactions. 2. 10 or more purchases/payments with your Wells Fargo Debit Card each fee period required to avoid the $10 Everyday Checking account monthly service fee. - Included: Debit card purchases include PIN, signature, online and phone purchases that post during the fee period. Debit card payments include one-time and recurring payments of bills made with your debit card that post during the fee period. - Not Included: Any transaction at an ATM (Wells Fargo or non-Wells Fargo) and ACH (Automated Clearing House) transactions. Debit card purchases and debit card payments must post during the fee period to be counted toward the total of 10 or more. The dates of your fee period are located in the “Monthly service fee summary” section of your statement. Transactions received after the applicable cut-off time or on a non-business day (Saturday, Sunday and federal holidays) are posted on the next business day. 3. A qualifying direct deposit is a direct deposit of your salary, pension, Social Security, or other regular monthly income electronically deposited to this checking account by your employer or an outside agency. Transfers from one account to another, or deposits made at a banking location or ATM, do not qualify as a direct deposit. 4. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the bonus interest rate on all eligible savings accounts, and discounts or fee waivers on other products and services will discontinue and revert to the Bank's then- current applicable rate or fee.  For bonus interest rates on time accounts, this change will occur upon renewal. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the remaining unlinked Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking or Wells Fargo Prime Checking account will be converted to another checking product or closed. 5.

To learn which accounts qualify for the discount, please consult a Wells Fargo banker. 6.

Checking Services

        Discover the personal checking accounts and the features and benefits that come with each BancorpSouth checking account service.  No matter where you are in life, BancorpSouth checking services are right where you are.
    





My Way Checking





You choose to live life your way, so choose the checking account that lets you pick the services and perks you want.




Heritage Checking





The Golden Years are a unique time in your life, so it is fitting that we have a checking account especially designed for seniors aged 62 plus.




Debit Card





Spending money is an everyday occurrence, but a debit card through BancorpSouth removes the burden of keeping up with loose cash or carrying around checkbooks.





Performance Checking





We know how hard you work for your money, so choose the checking account that puts your money to work. 




Student Checking





As a student, you have a lot on your mind but not a lot in your wallet. Student Checking makes banking easier and more affordable for you.













Interest Plus Checking





With Interest Plus Checking, you can earn interest on your money and earn higher rates on higher tiers of balances. 




Second Chance Checking Account





A special checking account for those individuals who may not have a perfect check writing history.




Overdraft Protection





Sometimes things don’t go as planned, and overdrawing your checking account just happens. We understand and that's why we offer overdraft protection.

BANCORPSOUTH CUSTOMER AGREEMENT AND DISCLOSURE STATEMENT FOR ONLINE BANKING SERVICES

I. INTRODUCTION
This BancorpSouth Customer Agreement for Online Banking Services (this “Agreement”) sets forth the rights and duties between the customer (“you” and “your”) and BancorpSouth (“we”, “our” and “us”) in connection with our online electronic banking services (the “Services”), the terms and conditions on which the Services will be provided and important information about electronic fund transfer services which is required by law.
1.1 Amendments
You agree that BancorpSouth reserves the right to change the terms and conditions of this Agreement as required by law or bank policy. Unless otherwise required by law, BancorpSouth may amend this Agreement without prior notice to you. If BancorpSouth chooses to notify you of an amendment or are required to do so by law, BancorpSouth may ask you to agree to an amended version of this Agreement electronically, or mail or deliver a separate notice, statement message or electronic message to you at the last address it has on file for you.
1.2 Governing Law
This agreement will be governed by the law of the state provided in the Account Agreement unless provided differently herein.


II. ELECTRONIC FUND TRANSFER DISCLOSURE TO CONSUMERS
2.1 Types of Transactions

View account balance information for your linked BancorpSouth accounts
Make one-time or recurring transfers between your accounts
Transfer funds between your BancorpSouth accounts and external accounts
Enroll in Bill Pay
Pay other people through Personal Payments (Popmoney Service)
Review transaction history for your accounts
View monthly statements for your registered accounts
Export account information into your personal financial management software program
Manage your finances online (BudgetWi$e)
Enroll in Mobile Banking

If you have more than one account with us, some of these Services may not be available for each account. Every calendar day is a processing day except that Saturday, Sunday and Monday are treated as a single processing day, with the processing occurring on Monday, unless the Monday is a legal holiday, in which case the processing occurs on the next Business Day. In all cases, you agree to be responsible for all transfers authorized by you from which you receive benefit.
                
2.2 Preauthorized Automatic Debits
You may authorize third parties to debit or make withdrawals from your account. This is usually done for the purpose of paying recurring monthly bills such as insurance premiums; however you must sign a written authorization with each party who will be making such withdrawals to receive this service.
2.3 Fees for Electronic Transfers
The amounts of the various fees mentioned in this Agreement which are charged by us are set forth in the Account Information Statement which you received when you opened your account and as thereafter amended from time to time. You may view the current Account Information Statement on our website or visit your nearest BancorpSouth branch or call us or write to us at the phone number or address set forth in Section 2.5 below to request a copy.
                

                When you are enrolled in the Services, your account may be charged a monthly fee regardless of whether you use the Services. When you are enrolled in Bill Pay, your Billing Account may be charged an additional monthly fee, regardless of whether you use Bill Pay. Upon written request, copies of documentary evidence of transactions made through the Services are available for income tax and other purposes at a reasonable cost. We will not charge you for documentation obtained in connection with a good faith assertion of error in connection with a transaction.
                
2.4 Customer’s Liability
If you give someone your Online Banking credentials (security code, user ID or password), you have authorized that person to use the Services and you are responsible for all transactions that person performs while using your Services. All transactions that person performs, even those you did not intend or want performed, are authorized transactions. If you notify us that the person is no longer authorized, then only the transactions that person performs after the time you notify us are considered unauthorized. Transactions that you or someone acting with you initiates with fraudulent intentions are also authorized transactions. 
                
                Generally, contact us AT ONCE if you believe your security code, user ID or password have been lost, stolen, or if you believe that an electronic fund transfer has been made without your permission. Call us promptly at the phone number in Section 2.5 below to report any unauthorized activity or access. Immediate contact via telephone is the best way to limit your potential loss. You could lose all the money in your account (plus your maximum overdraft line of credit, if you have one). If you tell us within 2 Business Days after you learn of the loss or theft of your security code, user ID or password, you can lose no more than $50.00 if someone used your security code, user ID or password, without your permission. If you do NOT tell us within 2 Business Days after you learn of the loss or theft of security code, user ID or password, and we can prove we could have stopped someone from using your security code, user ID or password, without your permission if you had told us, you could lose as much as $500.
                  
                UNAUTHORIZED USE DISCOVERED FROM STATEMENTS. Also, if your statement shows transfers that you did not make, including those made by security code, user ID, password, or other means, tell us at once. If you do not tell us within 60 days after the statement was provided to you, you may not get back any money you lost after the 60 days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had told us in time. If a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay) kept you from telling us, we will extend the time periods. If you believe your security code, user ID or password has been lost or stolen, call us or write to us at the phone number or address set forth in Section 2.5 below. You should also call us or write to us at the phone number or address set forth in Section 2.5 below if you believe a transfer has been made in any other way without your permission.
                
2.5 In Case of Errors or Questions About your Electronic Transfers
Telephone or write us at the telephone number or address shown below as soon as you  can, if you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about a transfer listed on your statement or receipt.

Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you  can why you believe it is in error or why you need more information.
Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.

                We will determine whether an error occurred within 10 Business Days after we hear from you and we will correct any error promptly. If we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to do this, we will credit your account within 10 Business Days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 Business Days, we may not credit your account.
                
                For errors involving new accounts, point-of-sale, or foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to 90 days to investigate your complaint or question. For new accounts, we may take up to 20 days to credit your account for the amount you think is in error.
                
                We will tell you the results within three Business Days after completing our investigation. If we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation. You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.
                
2.6 Business Days
For purposes of this disclosure, our Business Days are Monday through Friday. Federal Reserve Bank holidays are not included.
2.7 Confidentiality
We will disclose information to third parties about your account or the transfers you make:

Where it is necessary for completing transactions;
Where it is necessary for activating additional services;
In order to verify the existence and condition of your account to a third party, such as a  credit bureau or Biller;
In order to comply with a governmental agency or court orders; or,
If you give us your written permission. 

2.8 Documentation of Transfers
In most instances you will receive a confirmation number when you make a transaction through Online Banking.

Preauthorized Automatic Credits—If you have arranged to have direct deposits made to your account at least every 60 days from the same person or company, you can check your account through the Services or you can call us at 1-888-797-7711 to find out  whether or not the deposit has been made.
Periodic Statements—You will get a monthly account statement unless there are no electronic transfers in a particular month. In any case, you will get the statement at least quarterly.

2.9 Customer’s Right with Respect to Preauthorized Payments
Right to Stop Payment and Procedures for Doing So. If you have told us in advance to make regular payments out of your account, you can stop any of these payments. Here’s how:
                
                Call us at the telephone number referred to in Section 2.5 above or write us at the address indicated in  Section 2.5 above in time for us to receive your request three Business Days or more before the payment is scheduled to be made. If you call, we may also require you to put your request in writing and get it to us within 14 days after you call. We will charge you a fee for each stop payment order you give. The amount of the fee is set forth in the Account Information Statement, as amended from time to time. See Section 2.3 above for how to obtain the current Account Information Statement.
                

Notice of Varying Amount - If these regular payments may vary in amount, the person you are going to pay is required to tell you ten days before each payment when it will be made and how much it will be. You may choose instead to get this notice only when the payment would differ by more than a certain amount from the previous payment, or when the amount would fall outside certain limits that you may set.
Liability for Failure to Stop Payment of Preauthorized Transfers - If you order us to stop one of these payments three Business Days or more before the transfer is scheduled, and we do not do so, we will be liable for your losses or damages.

2.10 Bank’s Liability for Failure to Make Transfers
If we do not complete a transfer to or from your account on time or in the correct amount according to our agreement with you, we will be liable for your losses or damages. However there are some exceptions. We will not be liable, for instance:

If through no fault of ours, you do not have enough money in your account to make the transfer.
If the transfer would go over the credit limit on your overdraft line.
If the Services were not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transfer.
If there are any errors in the information you provide necessary to process the transfer or you do not follow procedures required to make the transfer.
                    
If we have reason to believe your Login Credentials have been compromised or a transaction has not been properly authorized or authenticated, or is fraudulent, erroneous or illegal.
If you have exceeded any transfer frequency or amount limitations.
If making a transfer would cause us to violate any law, rule, or regulation to which we are subject.
If circumstances beyond our control (such as a fire or flood) prevented the transfer, despite reasonable precautions that we have taken.
If your telephone, device, Internet Service provider, telephone line, modem or any computer software or hardware fails to perform or if there are technical or editorial errors or omissions contained in any instructions pertaining to the services or your computer software or hardware.

There may be other exceptions stated in our agreement with you, or as otherwise provided by applicable law.
2.11 Periodic Statements
You will get a monthly electronic account statement for your checking account. You will also get a monthly electronic account statement for your savings account unless there are no transfers in a particular month. In any case, you will get the statement for your savings account at least quarterly. Your checking account and savings account statement may be combined.
2.12 Acts and Omissions of Others
Except for our responsibility explained in this disclosure, we are not responsible for the acts or omissions of others.


III. GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR ONLINE BANKING SERVICES
3.1 Scope of Services
You authorize us to provide you the Services through such third-party servicers as we may select from time to time via our website (currently, www.bancorpsouth.com). You may use the Services to:
Access bank account information and make such other online banking transactions as are more fully described on the website.
We reserve the right to modify the scope of the Services at any time. 
                
3.2 Use of the Services
The Services will not work unless you use them properly. You accept responsibility for making sure that you understand how to use the Services before you actually do so, and then that you always use the Services in accordance with the online instructions posted on the website. You also accept responsibility for making sure that you know how to properly use your computer equipment, your Internet browser software, and any personal financial management software which you use. We may change or upgrade the Services or the appearance, operation or address of the website from time to time. In the event of such changes or upgrades, you are responsible for making sure that you understand how to use the Services as changed or upgraded. We will not be liable to you for any losses caused by your failure to properly use the Services or your computer equipment, including but not limited to, losses resulting from malicious software or codes resident on your computer equipment or caused through remote access of your computer equipment by unauthorized third parties who steal your security code.
3.3 Limitation on Frequency and Number of Transactions
There are no limits set for how often or how many times in a given period you may make transactions through the Services. We reserve the right to establish limitations in the future.
3.4 Limitation on Dollar Amount for Transactions
You may not make any single transfer over $1 million or payment transaction through the Services that exceeds $99,999.99. Also, if the From account you have selected is tied to a home equity line of credit account secured by Texas homestead property, then the minimum transfer allowed is $4,000.00.
3.5 Your Account
You agree to maintain one or more checking accounts with us from which you will make the payment transactions initiated through the Services. You agree to keep a balance in your account sufficient to cover all payment transactions and all fees for which you are responsible in connection with the Services. We will not be liable to you for any losses caused by the closing of your account, any levy or execution upon your account, or by your failure to keep sufficient funds in your account.
3.6 Payment Dates and Business Days
For each transaction you initiate through the Services, you agree to designate the payment date on which you desire funds to be delivered to your targeted merchant. The payment date must be a Business Day. A Business Day is any day Monday through Friday which is not a Federal Reserve Bank holiday. You agree that if you designate a payment date which is not a Business Day for a one-time payment, then the payment date will be the previous Business Day. You acknowledge that recurring payments which fall on a non-Business Day will post the next Business Day. You acknowledge it is essential that the payment date be before the merchant’s due date. You further acknowledge that, since the time for processing your transactions varies according to merchant, it is essential that you become familiar with the payment processing time for each merchant you desire to pay and to allow a sufficient number of Business Days between the date you input the transaction and the payment date. We will not be liable to you for any losses caused by your improper designation of a payment date or by your failure to allow a sufficient number of Business Days between the date you input the transaction and the payment date.
3.7 Processing Methods
To facilitate delivery of funds, you authorize us and anyone acting for us, including our third-party servicers, to choose whatever method for processing your transaction which we, in our sole discretion, deem to be the most effective. Subject to your proper use of the Services, we will deliver funds to your targeted merchant as close as reasonably possible to the payment date designated.
3.8 Confirmation Numbers
We will provide you with a confirmation number for each transaction which you properly initiate through the Services. If you do not receive a confirmation number, it may mean that something is wrong with the transaction. We will not be liable to you in connection with any transaction or attempted transaction for which you do not receive a confirmation number.
3.9 Security Precautions
You agree to read all notices posted on the website regarding security, before you actually use the Services. By using the Services, you agree to the sufficiency of the security precautions as described on the website. The main security devices guarding your use of the Services are the security code feature of the Services (currently, a combination of your User ID and a personal identification number) and protecting your computer equipment from malicious software and codes. You agree to keep your security code secret. You agree to change your personal identification number at least once every 90 days. You agree to keep your security codes secure and to run up-to-date anti-virus software. We will not be liable for any losses resulting from use of your security code by unauthorized persons as a result of your failure to abide by the security precautions described in this section. For your protection, sign off after every Online Banking session and close your browser to ensure confidentiality.
3.10 Charges for the Services
You agree to pay for the Services in accordance with the Online Banking fees outlined in the Account Information Statement that can be found on the website and described below. We may amend the fees from time to time as outlined and notified through the Account Information Statement. You authorize us to automatically charge any account you have enrolled in the Services or any other account you have with us for all fees you incur in connection with the Services. In the future, we may add to or enhance the features of the Services. By using such added or enhanced features, you agree to pay for them in accordance with the fees outlined in the Account Information Statement.
3.11 Suspension of the Services
If you use the Services improperly, we may suspend your use of the Services without prior notice to you. In the event of such suspension, you will remain responsible for all transactions which you have initiated through the Services prior to such suspension and for all other fees incurred in connection with the Services. You acknowledge that suspension of your use of the Services does not cancel or suspend transactions which are then outstanding.
3.12 Modification or Amendment of the Services
This Agreement, applicable fees and service charges may be modified or amended by us from time to time. In such event, we will provide notice to you. Any use by you of the Services after we provide you a notice of change will constitute your agreement to such change. Further, we may, from time to time, revise or update the applications, products, functions, and/or related material which may render all such prior versions obsolete. Consequently, we reserve the right to terminate this Agreement as to all such prior versions of the applications, products, functions and/or related material and limit access to only our most recent revisions and updates. In addition, you agree to receive all legally required notification via electronic means.
3.13 Termination of the Services
We may terminate your use of the Services, in whole or in part, at any time and for any reason, including non-use, without prior notice to you. You may cancel your use of the Services upon thirty (30) days prior notice to us by calling 1-888-797-7711 or by writing to us at BancorpSouth Customer Service, 2910 W Jackson St., Tupelo, MS 38801. Provide your account number with any verbal or written request. You will remain responsible for all payment transactions which you have initiated through the Services prior to such cancellation and for all other fees incurred in connection with the Services. You acknowledge that cancellation of your use of the Services does not cancel payment transactions which are then outstanding.
3.14 Other Terms and Conditions
This Agreement, any online instructions pertaining to the Services, and our fees may be changed or amended only by us. We will notify you of any such change or amendment. Your use of the Services following your receipt of such notice will constitute your acceptance of and agreement to the change or amendment. If you fail to pay any amount owed to us when due, then you agree to additionally pay us interest on such amount at the rate of 1.5% per month, or the maximum allowable by law, whichever is less. If we retain an attorney to collect any amounts owing by you, then you agree to pay all costs and expenses incurred in collecting such amounts, including a reasonable attorney’s fee. This Agreement supersedes any prior agreement or representations made by us in connection with the Services. The operation of your account is governed by a separate Deposit Account Terms and Conditions (the “Account Agreement”); a copy of which was furnished to you at the time you opened your account. The Account Agreement is a part of this Agreement, and its terms and conditions apply to the use of your account in connection with the Services. If this Agreement and the Account Agreement conflict on any matter, then this Agreement controls as to such matter.
                    
                You may not assign this Agreement to any other party. We may assign or delegate certain of our rights and responsibilities regarding the Services to independent contractors or other third parties.
                
                We shall not be deemed to have waived any of our rights or remedies unless such waiver is in writing and signed by us. No delay or omission on our part in exercising any rights or remedies shall operate as a waiver of such rights or remedies or any other rights or remedies. A waiver on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar or waiver of any rights or remedies on future occasions.
                
                IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS (EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE INSTALLATION, USE, OR MAINTENANCE OF THE SERVICES OR ANY SOFTWARE APPLICATION OR HARDWARE IN CONNECTION THEREWITH.
                


IV. GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR BILL PAY SERVICE
4.1 Definitions
“Bill Pay” means the bill payment service offered by us, through CheckFree Services Corporation.
“Biller” is the person or entity to which you wish a bill payment to be directed or is the person or entity from which you receive electronic bills, as the case may be.
“Payment Instruction” is the information provided by you through Bill Pay for a bill payment to be made to the Biller (such as, but not limited to, Biller name, Biller account number, and Scheduled Payment Date).
“Payment Account” is the checking account from which bill payments will be debited.
“Billing Account” is the checking account from which all Bill Pay fees will be automatically debited.
“Business Day” is every Monday through Friday, excluding Federal Reserve Bank holidays.
“Scheduled Payment Date” is the day you want your Biller to receive your bill payment and is also the day your Payment Account will be debited, unless the Scheduled Payment Date falls on a non-Business Day in which case it will be considered to be the previous Business Day.
“Due Date” is the date reflected on your Biller statement for which the payment is due; it is not the late date or grace period.
“Scheduled Payment” is a payment that has been scheduled through Bill Pay but has not begun processing.
4.2 Payment Scheduling
The earliest possible Scheduled Payment Date for each Biller (typically four (4) or fewer Business Days from the current date) will be designated within the Service when you are scheduling the payment. Therefore, the Service will not permit you to select a Scheduled Payment Date less than the earliest possible Scheduled Payment Date designated for each Biller. When scheduling payments you must select a Scheduled Payment Date that is no later than the actual Due Date reflected on your Biller statement unless the Due Date falls on a non-Business Day. If the actual Due Date falls on a non-Business Day, you must select a Scheduled Payment Date that is at least one (1) Business Day before the actual Due Date. Scheduled Payment Dates must be prior to any late date or grace period. If a payment is eligible to be processed as either an expedited payment (same day) or by overnight check, this option will be presented at the time of the Bill Pay request. Expedited payment and Overnight Check payments will be subject to fees as listed in the Account Information Statement.
4.3 Delayed Payment
Due to delays in handling and posting payments by Billers or financial institutions, some payments may take longer to be credited to the Biller’s account. You will not be responsible for late payment related charges up to $50.00 should a payment post after its Due Date as long as the payment was scheduled in accordance with the requirements of the “Payment Scheduling” section above.
4.4 Payment Authorization and Payment Remittance
By providing us with names and account information of Billers to whom you wish to direct payments, you authorize us to follow the Payment Instructions that we receive through the payment system. In order to process payments more efficiently and effectively, you agree that we may edit or alter payment data or data formats in accordance with Biller directives.
                
                When we receive a Payment Instruction, you authorize us to debit your Payment Account and remit funds on your behalf so that the funds arrive as close as reasonably possible to the Scheduled Payment Date designated by you. If we remit payment to a Biller by mail in the form of a check and if the mail is returned by the postal service undelivered or if any Biller refuses or returns any payment, we will credit your Payment Account with the amount of such payment.
                
                We will use our best efforts to make all your payments properly. However, we shall incur no liability and the provisions of the Delayed Payment section above shall not apply if we are unable to complete any payments initiated by you because of the existence of any one or more of the following circumstances:
                

If your Payment Account does not contain sufficient funds to complete the transaction;
If Bill Pay or any payment processing center is not working properly and you know or have been advised by us about the malfunction before you execute the transaction;
You have not provided the correct Payment Account information, or the correct name, address, phone number, or account information for the Biller; and/or,
Circumstances beyond our control (such as, but not limited to, fire, flood, or interference from an outside force) prevent the proper execution of the transaction.

Provided none of the foregoing exceptions are applicable, if we cause an incorrect amount of funds to be removed from your Payment Account or cause funds from your Payment Account to be directed to a Biller which does not comply with your Payment Instructions, we will be responsible for returning the improperly transferred funds to your Payment Account, and, if applicable, for any late payment charges.
4.5 Payment Methods
We reserve the right to select the method by which to remit funds on your behalf to your Biller. These payment methods may include, but may not be limited to, an electronic payment (the funds are electronically removed from your Payment Account and sent electronically to the Biller), a check (funds remitted to the Biller by mail in the form of a check are deducted from your Payment Account when the check is presented for payment) or an electronic-to-check payment (the funds for the payment are electronically debited from your Payment Account, transferred to CheckFree and CheckFree mails payment by check to the Biller).
                
4.6 Payment Cancellation Requests
You may cancel or edit any Scheduled Payment (including recurring payments) by following the directions within the Service. There is no charge for canceling or editing a Scheduled Payment. Once Bill Pay has begun processing a payment it cannot be cancelled or edited, in such cases a stop payment request is the only way to cancel this Payment (see the next section).
4.7 Stop Payment Requests
Our ability to process a stop payment request will depend on the payment method and whether or not a check has cleared. We may also not have a reasonable opportunity to act on stop payment requests after a payment has been processed. If you desire to stop a payment that has already been processed, you must contact us by calling 1-888-797-7711. Although we will make every effort to accommodate your request, we will have no liability for failing to do so. We may also require you to present your request in writing within fourteen (14) days. The charge for each stop payment request will be the current charge for such service as set forth in the Account Information Statement which is applicable to your Payment account.
4.8 Prohibited Payments
Payments to Billers outside of the United States or its territories are prohibited.
4.9 Government Payments
In some instances, tax payments, payment to government entities and court ordered payments may be scheduled through Bill Pay; however such payments are discouraged and must be scheduled at your own risk. In no event will we be liable for any claims or damages resulting from your scheduling of these types of payments. The provisions of the Delayed Payment section above shall not apply to these types of payments. We will have no obligation to research or resolve any claim resulting from these payments. You agree that all research and resolution for any misapplied, misposted or misdirected payments will be your sole responsibility.

The availability of your MRDC transaction may also be subject to factors such as creditworthiness, the length and extent of your relationship with us, transaction and experience information and such other factors we deem relevant, at our sole discretion.
8.6 Deposit Account(s)
All Checks captured and transmitted to the Bank by you and accepted by the Bank shall be deposited to your account as selected in Mobile Banking at the time of the mobile remote deposit request.

8.11 Deposit
You acknowledge and agree that neither mere remote deposit transaction submission of a Check to the Bank nor the Bank’s acknowledgment of receipt of such transaction submission shall constitute deposit of any such Check.  Instead, no Check remote deposit transaction submitted to the Bank shall be deemed to be deposited with the Bank until the file containing such image has been imported, captured, and balanced by the Bank on the Bank’s image processing system.  All deposits made by you pursuant to this Agreement are deemed made at Tupelo, Mississippi, and are governed by the separate terms and conditions governing the Deposit Account(s) identified in Section 8.6 above, as such terms and conditions may be amended by the Bank from time to time.
8.12 Retention, Safeguarding and Destruction of Checks
You shall retain the originals of all Checks which you capture as images and transmit to the Bank for not less than 60 days and shall make such originals available to the Bank on demand.  During the time that you retain the originals of Checks, you shall use care to protect such originals from unauthorized access in order to guard against theft and further negotiation, depositing, presentment for payment or imaging.  At such time when you determine to no longer retain the originals of such Checks (whether at the end of the minimum retention period set forth above or any longer period), you shall destroy such Checks by a process which ensures that such Checks are rendered no longer readable or capable of reconstruction and which ensures that the safeguards set out above are observed in the destruction process.

IX. GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR EXTERNAL TRANSFERS
In these terms, some provisions apply to "you" as the party using the Service to initiate funds transfers. Some provisions apply to "you" as the party approving a request to transfer funds from or to you. In both cases, you agree to the applicable provisions of these terms. "We", "us" and "our" refer to the financial institution that initiates the funds transfers services (the "Financial Institution"). The Financial Institution uses as its agent, Fiserv Solutions, Inc., and other financial intermediaries (collectively, the "Service Provider") to accomplish funds transfers.
9.1 Description of Service
This Service allows you to initiate or authorize funds transfers between accounts or people you have designated using the Funds Transfer Service (an "ACH Transfer"). By clicking the "Confirm" button you authorize us as the financial institution to (i) accomplish this transfer through the Automated Clearing House ("ACH") and (ii) to use the Service Provider as our agent for this purpose. 
              You understand that the Financial Institution and its Service Provider may originate more than one ACH entry (for example, a paired credit and debit entry) to accomplish the transfer you are requesting or authorizing.  These ACH entries may be originated in any sequence (for example, a credit may be provided to you in advance of settlement on a paired debit entry against your account).  You authorize us or our Service Provider to resubmit debit entries against your account as needed to fulfill the ACH Transfer you have requested.  If this is a recurring ACH Transfer, this authorization will continue in full force and effect until such time as you cancel the recurring ACH Transfer as provided below. 
9.2 Terms of Service
The sections below also apply to anyone using the Service, whether to send or to receive funds:

You represent that you are at least eighteen (18) years old, a resident of the United States and have a valid email address.  You represent that you are the owner of the applicable debit and/or credit accounts and have the right to access, use, and authorize us and our agents to initiate ACH entries to debit or credit such accounts in the amount you have specified. 
You agree to comply with the National Automated Clearing House Association ("NACHA") rules when as the Originator (as defined under NACHA rules) you initiate funds ACH Transfers to or from your accounts or accounts of another person.  You authorize the Service Provider to be an Originator and to use an Originating Depository Financial Institution ("ODFI") (as defined under NACHA rules) chosen by it where appropriate to process your request to the Financial Institution. 
If you are requesting funds be transferred from an account held by another person to an account you have with us, you authorize us and our Service Provider to send an email or SMS text message on your behalf requesting him or her to authorize the funds transfer to you. 
You accept our appointment of the Service Provider as our agent to electronically process your funds transfers on our behalf as you have instructed, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein. You understand and agree that the Service Provider is not acting as a fiduciary, trustee or money transmitter, or providing escrow service, with respect to your funds, but only acting as the Financial Institution's processor.
You agree to use the Service for legal purposes only and not in violation of any U.S. or foreign laws, including but not limited to, laws and regulations designed to prevent money laundering or the transfer of funds to or from persons or organizations whose accounts are blocked under regulations promulgated by the U.S. Treasury Department, such as sanction laws administered by the Office of Foreign Asset Control.  You agree that if we suspect or believe a transaction is unlawful or even suspicious, we may block the transaction and take any other action we deem to be reasonable.  This includes acting to prevent violations of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 ("UIGEA") and these Terms of Service.  If you are a non-consumer, you certify that you are not now engaged, and will not use the Service, in any activity or business that is unlawful under the UIGEA.  You agree not to use the Service in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the Service or interfere with any other parties use and enjoyment of the Service. 
If you will be using an account at another financial institution to initiate ACH Transfers using this Funds Transfer Service, you authorize us and our Service Provider to make small deposits and/or withdrawals to the target account to confirm your control of that account (and to reverse these after the test is completed).  The withdrawal amount(s) will never be greater than the deposit amount(s). You agree to verify online the amounts of such deposits and/or withdrawals.  We will not transfer the funds in this case until verification is made, and neither we nor our Service Provider shall have any liability to you for failure to initiate the funds transfer you have requested due to your failure to complete the authorization process. Notwithstanding the foregoing, some accounts you have at another financial institution may be used without this verification process. 
We and our Service Provider will process your funds transfer request based on the information you provide.  Any errors in the information (including incorrect or inconsistent account names, account numbers or ABA routing numbers) that you provide to us are your responsibility.  We and our Service Provider are not required to investigate discrepancies between account numbers and names on the account, and you agree that we and our Service Provider are not responsible for investigating such discrepancies and may execute an ACH Transfer using account number information only, even if the name and the account number do not match.  You agree to use a browser or mobile application that at a minimum provides a level of security equivalent to 128-bit RC4 encryption when accessing or using the Service to initiate or approve ACH Transfers. 
If an account of yours has a joint account holder, you represent and warrant that each joint account holder has consented to the ACH Transfer(s), whether sending funds or receiving funds.
You may not be able to cancel or revoke an ACH Transfer once you have submitted or approved it since processing begins immediately or soon after your approval is received by us.  For your rights in placing a stop payment on your account, refer to the specific account disclosures provided to you by your financial institution.  You may stop payment of a recurring ACH transfer orally or in writing at least three Business Days before the scheduled date of the transfer.  If processing has not begun, you may be allowed to cancel or delete ACH transfers from the "Activity" tab; ACH Transfers with a status of pending may be cancelled; recurring ACH Transfers may be deleted prior to submission of the next transfer. 
All accounts must be located in the U.S. No International transactions are supported.
The typical time to transfer funds with us using the ACH network is three to five Business Days (that is, days we are open but excluding bank holidays and weekends).  If we permit you to initiate an expedited transfer, this time may be reduced to one to two Business Days.  However specific transaction times may vary, and neither we nor our Service Provider guarantee any specific turnaround time to complete your funds transfer.  You should check your accounts to see your ACH Transfers.  If you are sending funds, you should check with the intended recipient of the funds to confirm the status of the funds.  If a transfer is eligible to be processed as an expedited transfer, this option will be presented at the time of the transfer request.  External transfers, both standard and expedited, will be subject to fees as listed in the Account Information Statement.
You agree that credits to your account are provisional and subject to return or reversal if we or our Service Provider receives returns or reversals from the ACH or if we must otherwise reverse an ACH Transfer (including for failure to receive final payment).  After we have received final payment on ACH credits, these deposits are referred to as collected items.  We also reserve the right to refuse to process or to return all or any funds transferred. 
We or our Service Provider, in our sole and absolute discretion, have the right to reject, reverse, or cancel any ACH Transfer you initiate, and/or restrict or condition your ability to use the Service, at any time for any reason or no reason, including but not limited to (a) insufficient funds in an account being debited; (b) suspicious activity; (c) order of any law enforcement agency or other legal process; (d) inability to verify information you or others provide or are asked to provide; (e) providing us with false or inaccurate information; (f) hacking, tampering or impacting the Service functionality, availability or security; (g) using the Service for unlawful purposes (as determined by us in good faith, but without the need for inquiry); or (h) failing to cooperate with any information request. 
In consideration of the agreement by us and our Service Provider to act upon your request to make transfers of funds in the manner provided for in these Terms of Service:

If any fees, fines or other sanctions, or damages or loss, are incurred or suffered by us or our Service Provider in connection with your use of the Service, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless us and the Service Provider. 
The Service, information, data, features and all content on this website are offered and made available on an "as is," "as available," basis.  In no event shall we or our Service Provider be liable to you (and, if you are a nonconsumer, your company, employees, agents, third parties, associates, or partners), or to anyone else for any consequential, incidental, special, punitive, or indirect damages of any kind whatsoever, including without limitation those resulting from loss or impairment of use, data, or profits, that you or anyone else may incur relating to your use or access to this site, or the use or access hereto by anyone else, even if we have been advised of the possibility of any such damages. 
You expressly waive any and all claims you may have or assert against us or our Service Provider relating directly or indirectly to accessing or using or reliance upon any such information or data by you or anyone else. 
The term "damages" as used herein includes, without limitation, any and all liability, loss, damage, injury, claim, founded or unfounded, expense, fee of any kind, including, attorney’s or accountant’s fees. 
Note: If you are a consumer, the foregoing is limited to the extent that it may conflict with any non-waivable rights you may have under applicable law.

10.6 Information Relied Upon by BancorpSouth
You acknowledge and agree that BancorpSouth is relying upon the information you provide in originating a Popmoney Service transfer on your behalf.  Any errors in the information, including incorrect or inconsistent recipient names, email addresses, mobile phone numbers or account numbers or the recipient's financial institution's ABA number or name, as well as providing incorrect information in connection with transfer from other persons to your account are your responsibility.  You understand and agree that if Popmoney Service transfer instructions identify an account by name and account number, the relevant financial institution may execute those instructions by reference to the account number only, even if such number does not correspond to the name.  You understand that financial institutions holding the account may not investigate discrepancies between names and numbers.  In addition, you agree that BancorpSouth has no responsibility to investigate discrepancies between names and account numbers.
10.7 Limited Power of Attorney
In connection with any request to transfer funds using the Popmoney Service, you hereby give to BancorpSouth a limited power of attorney and appoint BancorpSouth as your true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent, with full power of substitution and resubstitution, for BancorpSouth and in its name, place and stead, in any and all capacities, to originate deposits into or withdrawals from your accounts, with full power and authority to do and perform each and every act and thing requisite and necessary to be done in connection with effecting such funds transfers, verifying the content and authenticity of any Popmoney Service transfer instruction, complying with all applicable security procedures applicable to such transfers, as fully to all intents and purposes as you might or could in person.  Once BancorpSouth has actual knowledge that you wish to cease using the Popmoney Service as provided in this Agreement or as otherwise permitted in this Agreement and has a reasonable opportunity to act on such knowledge and to complete any pending transfers, this limited power of attorney shall be deemed revoked; provided, however, that any act done by BancorpSouth in good faith before it has actual knowledge of termination by you and a reasonable opportunity to act on such knowledge shall be deemed to be authorized by you.  You understand and agree that at all times your relationship with the financial institution (other than BancorpSouth) that maintains an account to which you are requesting a transfer or from which a transfer to BancorpSouth is being requested is independent of BancorpSouth and your use of the Popmoney Service.  You shall not hold BancorpSouth responsible for any acts or omissions by the financial institution maintaining such an account, including without limitation any modification, interruption or discontinuance of it.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WHEN BANCORPSOUTH ORIGINATES A REQUEST FOR A TRANSFER USING THE POPMONEY SERVICE, BANCORPSOUTH IS ACTING AS YOUR AGENT.  YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS BANCORPSOUTH AS YOUR AGENT UNDER THIS LIMITED POWER OF ATTORNEY AS MORE FULLY DESCRIBED BELOW.
10.8 Security Procedures
You agree that BancorpSouth will initiate a request from you to send money using the Popmoney Service only after you access your Eligible BancorpSouth Account(s) through Online Banking using your verified Login Credentials.  You further agree to provide any additional password or passcode that may be assigned to or selected by you that is required in connection with a request to transfer funds using the Popmoney Service.  BancorpSouth shall not be liable for any delay in processing your Popmoney Service transfer request if you fail to comply with this security procedure (or any other that may be established by BancorpSouth from time to time).  You acknowledge and agree that BancorpSouth has established commercially-reasonable security procedures for the Popmoney Service.  You understand that the security procedure is designed to authenticate your identity before accepting a request for a Popmoney Service transfer and not to detect errors in the content of your instruction. 
10.9 Processing Popmoney Transfer Requests
You understand and agree that when you request an immediate transfer of funds from an Eligible BancorpSouth Account using the Popmoney Service, the processing of the transfer will begin and the debiting of your Eligible BancorpSouth Account will occur, as early as the day of your request. However, the funds will be transferred into the recipient's account no earlier than the third Business Day after you have made the request.  If you request a one-time transfer with a specified date or a recurring series of transfers on specified dates, then the processing of the transfer will begin, and the debiting of your account will occur, as early as the date specified. However, the funds will be transferred into the recipient's account no earlier than the third Business Day following the specified date.  In addition, in the case of all Two-Step Transfers, the deposit of the funds into the recipient's account (even if withdrawn from your account) will be delayed if the recipient has not provided the Popmoney Service with certain required information. You hereby authorize BancorpSouth and the Popmoney Service to communicate via email from time to time, on your behalf and at their discretion in your name (including utilizing the email address that you supply to or designate for use by the Popmoney Service) to the recipients of your transfers to (1) notify recipients of pending transfers from you, (2) request information from the recipient that is necessary or appropriate to complete the transfer and (3) to remind a recipient that action must be taken to complete a transfer and any and all other notices relevant to an intended recipient of a Popmoney transfer.  You understand and agree that in the case of a Two-Step Transfer your request to transfer funds to a recipient will not be completed until the information requested from a recipient is provided.  If the information is not provided within 30 calendar days (or such other time period as BancorpSouth may select), then the transfer request may be cancelled and the funds returned to your Eligible BancorpSouth Account.
10.10 Expedited Popmoney Transfers
BancorpSouth currently offers next-day transfers to or from contacts or bank information provided from Eligible BancorpSouth Accounts.  However, we may elect not to offer expedited transfers at any time without prior notice to you at our discretion.  For the Send Next Day feature, the funds will be deposited into the recipient’s bank account when the recipient provides the bank account information.  You agree to pay for all Popmoney Transfers in accordance with our current fee schedule and as amended from time to time.  The current fee schedule is outlined in the Account Information Statement and is available on our website.  You authorize us to automatically charge your Eligible BancorpSouth Account (or any of your other accounts at BancorpSouth) for all such fees incurred in connection with Popmoney Transfers.  In the future, we may add to or enhance the features of Popmoney Services.  By using such added or enhanced features, you agree to pay for them in accordance with the fee schedule. The cutoff time for a next day transfer is 2:00 PM CT.
10.11 Limits on Popmoney Transfers
The following limits on transfer amounts are calculated against all outstanding transfers, which are transfers that have been requested but not yet paid.

                IMPORTANT: We may permit transfers in excess of these limits from time to time, based on our loss experience, security issues and other factors. We also may deny or limit specific transfers without prior notice if we have any reason to question the authorization for, or security of, the transaction.
10.12 Receiving Popmoney Transfers
When you are the intended recipient of a Popmoney Service transfer into an account you have at BancorpSouth, you authorize the deposit of funds into the Eligible BancorpSouth Account you designate, either for the receipt of a single transfer or, if you choose the Automatic Deposit feature, for all transfers directed to you through the Popmoney Service.  You understand and agree that there may be a delay between the time you are notified of the pending transfer and the deposit of the funds into your account.  You authorize the sender, the financial institution which holds the sender's account and the Popmoney Website to send emails and SMS text messages to you in connection with the sender's request to transfer funds to you.  You understand and agree that in the case of a Two-Step Transfer if you do not provide the requested information within a certain period of time, the requested transfer will be cancelled and the funds returned to the sender.

                In the event that funds are transferred into your Eligible BancorpSouth Account as a result of a Popmoney transfer and it is determined that such transfer was improper because it was not authorized by the sender or there were not sufficient funds in the sender's account or for any other reason, then you hereby authorize BancorpSouth to withdraw from your BancorpSouth account an amount equal to the amount of funds improperly transferred to you.
10.13 Service Fees and Charges
You understand and agree that you are responsible for paying all fees associated with your use of the Popmoney Service in accordance with our current fee schedule and as amended from time to time.  The current fee schedule is outlined in the Account Information Statement and is available on our website.  BancorpSouth reserves the right to change the fees charged for the use of the Popmoney Service.  You authorize us to automatically charge your Eligible BancorpSouth Account (or any other of your accounts at BancorpSouth) for all such fees incurred in connection with Popmoney Transfers.  In the future, we may add to or enhance the features of Popmoney Services.  By using such added or enhanced features, you agree to pay for them in accordance with the fee.
10.14 Actions Taken Upon an Unsuccessful Popmoney Transfer
When you request a transfer from an Eligible BancorpSouth Account using the Popmoney Service, the transfer may not be completed for various reasons.  If you have not provided complete and accurate required information regarding the recipient, the Popmoney Service cannot complete the Transfer.  If you fail a verification of your identity that is required in connection with scheduling a Popmoney transfer, your requested transfer will be placed on hold, and if you do not call BancorpSouth at 1-888-797-7711 or take other prescribed actions within the prescribed time frames to remove the hold, the transaction will be cancelled.
If you do not have sufficient funds in your Eligible BancorpSouth Account from which you have requested a transfer be made, the transfer will not be completed.  You understand and agree that after an initial failure due to non-sufficient funds in your Eligible BancorpSouth Account, the transfer process will be attempted a second time.  If there again are non-sufficient funds in your Eligible BancorpSouth Account, your requested transfer will be cancelled.  In addition, after any failure due to non-sufficient funds (whether an initial failure or a subsequent failure), your access to the Popmoney Service or any other BancorpSouth service may at BancorpSouth’s discretion be suspended or terminated.
10.15 Rejection of a Popmoney Transfer
BancorpSouth reserves the right to reject your Popmoney Service transfer request. BancorpSouth may reject your request if the dollar value of one or more of your transfer requests exceed any of your transfer limits (as more fully described in Section 10.11 above), if you have insufficient available funds in your Eligible BancorpSouth Account for the amount of the Popmoney Service transfer, plus any applicable fee, if your request is incomplete or unclear, if BancorpSouth identifies a security risk related to a requested transfer or if BancorpSouth is unable to fulfill the request for any other reason.  You understand and agree that if BancorpSouth rejects a request for a Popmoney Service transfer for one or more of the reasons set forth above, you will be informed of the rejection during your online session or by email as soon thereafter as BancorpSouth has determined to reject the request.
10.16 Changes or Cancellation of a Popmoney Transfer Request
You may change or cancel a Popmoney transfer request only if BancorpSouth receives your request prior to the initiation of the ACH transfer into the recipient's account and at a time that provides BancorpSouth with a reasonable opportunity to act upon that request.  If your request to change or cancel a Popmoney transfer is received after such transfer has been processed by BancorpSouth, you understand and agree that your request to stop payment or change your Popmoney transfer will be effective only with the voluntary consent of the recipient's financial institution.  If the recipient's bank confirms that the funds are returnable and agrees to do so, once the funds are returned to BancorpSouth, BancorpSouth will return the funds to you.  The amount that is returned to you may be less than you originally transferred because the entire amount transferred may not be available for return and/or due to service charges of the recipient's bank and/or BancorpSouth. 
10.17  Delays, Non-Execution of Funds Transfer Request
You agree that BancorpSouth shall not be responsible for any delay, failure to execute, or misexecution of your funds transfer request due to circumstances beyond BancorpSouth's reasonable control - including, without limitation, any inaccuracy, interruption, delay in transmission, or failure in the means of transmission of your funds transfer request to the bank or execution of such request by the bank, whether caused by strikes, power failures, equipment malfunctions, or acts or omissions of any intermediary bank or beneficiary bank. BANCORPSOUTH MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED - INCLUDING THE FAILURE OF ANY INTERMEDIARY BANK OR YOUR RECIPIENT'S BANK TO CREDIT YOUR RECIPIENT WITH THE AMOUNT OF THE FUNDS TRANSFER AFTER RECEIPT OF SAME. 
10.18 Unauthorized Popmoney Transfers
You understand that if you think your BancorpSouth Debit/ATM Card has been lost or stolen, someone else has learned your Login Credentials for online or mobile banking or an unauthorized Popmoney Service transfer or other type of online transaction has been made from one of your accounts, you must notify BancorpSouth immediately by telephone at 1-888-797-7711 or, if you are unable to telephone BancorpSouth, in writing to: BancorpSouth Customer Service, 2910 West Jackson St, Tupelo, MS 38801. By providing prompt notice, you may limit your personal liability for unauthorized transfers as more fully described in the "Customer Liability" section of your Regulation E Disclosure provided within this Agreement.
10.19 Significance of Email Notices about Popmoney Service
You agree that all email or SMS text message notices sent to you regarding the status of a Popmoney transfer request are merely service messages and will not constitute a transaction receipt or an official bank record with respect to a Popmoney transfer.  You acknowledge and agree that these notices may be sent to the email address or mobile phone number you provide during your enrollment in the Popmoney Service, even if you have informed BancorpSouth separately in the past (or choose to do so in the future) to not send you marketing messages at that same email address.
10.20 Means of Transfer

				1. Please see your applicable Wells Fargo account agreement and card terms and conditions for information on liability for unauthorized transactions. 2. 10 or more purchases/payments with your Wells Fargo Debit Card each fee period required to avoid the $10 Everyday Checking account monthly service fee. - Included: Debit card purchases include PIN, signature, online and phone purchases that post during the fee period. Debit card payments include one-time and recurring payments of bills made with your debit card that post during the fee period. - Not Included: Any transaction at an ATM (Wells Fargo or non-Wells Fargo) and ACH (Automated Clearing House) transactions. Debit card purchases and debit card payments must post during the fee period to be counted toward the total of 10 or more. The dates of your fee period are located in the “Monthly service fee summary” section of your statement. Transactions received after the applicable cut-off time or on a non-business day (Saturday, Sunday and federal holidays) are posted on the next business day. 3. A qualifying direct deposit is a direct deposit of your salary, pension, Social Security, or other regular monthly income electronically deposited to this checking account by your employer or an outside agency. Transfers from one account to another, or deposits made at a banking location or ATM, do not qualify as a direct deposit. 4. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the bonus interest rate on all eligible savings accounts, and discounts or fee waivers on other products and services will discontinue and revert to the Bank's then- current applicable rate or fee.  For bonus interest rates on time accounts, this change will occur upon renewal. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the remaining unlinked Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking or Wells Fargo Prime Checking account will be converted to another checking product or closed. 5.  Subject to credit qualification. To qualify for a customer relationship discount, you may be required to maintain a qualifying Wells Fargo consumer checking account and make automatic payments from a Wells Fargo deposit account—if automatic payments are required but not selected, or are canceled for any reason at any time after account opening, the interest rate and the corresponding monthly payment may increase. To learn which accounts qualify for the discount, please consult a Wells Fargo banker. 6. The Portfolio by Wells Fargo program has a $30 monthly service fee, which can be avoided when you have one of the following Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances: $25,000 or more in qualifying linked bank deposits (checking, savings, time accounts (CDs), FDIC insured IRAs), OR $50,000 or more in qualifying linked bank, brokerage (available through our brokerage affiliate Wells Fargo Advisors®) and credit balances (including 10% of mortgage balances, certain mortgages not eligible). 7.

				1. Please see your applicable Wells Fargo account agreement and card terms and conditions for information on liability for unauthorized transactions. 2. 10 or more purchases/payments with your Wells Fargo Debit Card each fee period required to avoid the $10 Everyday Checking account monthly service fee. - Included: Debit card purchases include PIN, signature, online and phone purchases that post during the fee period. Debit card payments include one-time and recurring payments of bills made with your debit card that post during the fee period. - Not Included: Any transaction at an ATM (Wells Fargo or non-Wells Fargo) and ACH (Automated Clearing House) transactions. Debit card purchases and debit card payments must post during the fee period to be counted toward the total of 10 or more. The dates of your fee period are located in the “Monthly service fee summary” section of your statement. Transactions received after the applicable cut-off time or on a non-business day (Saturday, Sunday and federal holidays) are posted on the next business day. 3. A qualifying direct deposit is a direct deposit of your salary, pension, Social Security, or other regular monthly income electronically deposited to this checking account by your employer or an outside agency. Transfers from one account to another, or deposits made at a banking location or ATM, do not qualify as a direct deposit. 4. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the bonus interest rate on all eligible savings accounts, and discounts or fee waivers on other products and services will discontinue and revert to the Bank's then- current applicable rate or fee.  For bonus interest rates on time accounts, this change will occur upon renewal. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the remaining unlinked Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking or Wells Fargo Prime Checking account will be converted to another checking product or closed. 5.  Subject to credit qualification. To qualify for a customer relationship discount, you may be required to maintain a qualifying Wells Fargo consumer checking account and make automatic payments from a Wells Fargo deposit account—if automatic payments are required but not selected, or are canceled for any reason at any time after account opening, the interest rate and the corresponding monthly payment may increase. To learn which accounts qualify for the discount, please consult a Wells Fargo banker. 6. The Portfolio by Wells Fargo program has a $30 monthly service fee, which can be avoided when you have one of the following Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances: $25,000 or more in qualifying linked bank deposits (checking, savings, time accounts (CDs), FDIC insured IRAs), OR $50,000 or more in qualifying linked bank, brokerage (available through our brokerage affiliate Wells Fargo Advisors®) and credit balances (including 10% of mortgage balances, certain mortgages not eligible). 7. Subject to applicable transfer or advance fees. 8. Benefits apply only to the primary Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking account within the Portfolio by Wells Fargo. 9. Surcharge fees imposed by non-Wells Fargo ATM owners or operators may apply. For the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program, Wells Fargo will waive its own ATM access fee (U.S. and international) when you withdraw cash from a non-Wells Fargo ATM from your primary checking account within the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program. Where Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances are $250,000 or more, you will be reimbursed for all surcharge fees on non-Wells Fargo ATM withdrawals located in the U.S., and receive reimbursement for up to 5 surcharge fees imposed by non-Wells Fargo ATM owners or operators per monthly fee period if you use a non-Wells Fargo ATM to make a cash withdrawal at an ATM located outside of the U.S. 10. No fee for Wells Fargo personal checks — except desk checks or home office style (3-on-a-page). Check discounts apply only to the primary Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking account.

History[edit]
BancorpSouth Bank's origins began in 1876, when Raymond Trice and Company received a charter to create a bank in Mississippi. In 1886, the banking operation was moved to nearby Tupelo, MS and renamed the Bank of Lee County. Soon after, it was renamed to the Bank of Tupelo. In 1966, it was renamed the Bank of Mississippi. By December 1998, all branches of Bank of Mississippi and Tennessee-based Volunteer Bank — each a subsidiary of BancorpSouth, Inc. — officially adopted the BancorpSouth Bank brand, as the company also acquired Vicksburg-based Merchants Bank.[4]
Subsidiaries[edit]
BancorpSouth, Inc. operates its wholly owned subsidiaries, BancorpSouth Bank and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Gumtree Wholesale Insurance Brokers, Inc. The BancorpSouth Bank headquarters is located in downtown Tupelo, MS.

History[edit]
BancorpSouth Bank's origins began in 1876, when Raymond Trice and Company received a charter to create a bank in Mississippi. In 1886, the banking operation was moved to nearby Tupelo, MS and renamed the Bank of Lee County. Soon after, it was renamed to the Bank of Tupelo. In 1966, it was renamed the Bank of Mississippi. By December 1998, all branches of Bank of Mississippi and Tennessee-based Volunteer Bank — each a subsidiary of BancorpSouth, Inc. — officially adopted the BancorpSouth Bank brand, as the company also acquired Vicksburg-based Merchants Bank.[4]
Subsidiaries[edit]
BancorpSouth, Inc. operates its wholly owned subsidiaries, BancorpSouth Bank and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Gumtree Wholesale Insurance Brokers, Inc. The BancorpSouth Bank headquarters is located in downtown Tupelo, MS.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
