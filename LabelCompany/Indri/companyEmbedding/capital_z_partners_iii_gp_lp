Themes

Due to its large size, considerable diversification and complexity, the financial services sector regularly generates a number of predictable trends and dynamics that give rise to capital needs and attractive investment opportunities.
Capital Deficiencies
Due to the nature and complexity of the products, pricing models and balance sheets of companies within the financial services industry, as well as market events such as natural catastrophes and credit crises, companies or entire sub-sectors within the financial services industry may experience capital deficiencies.
Consolidation Opportunities

Most sub-sectors of the financial services industry remain highly fragmented, which creates opportunities for strategic acquisition financing and for “roll-up” strategies. Deep industry experience is required to identify these trends proactively and to source and structure investment opportunities.
Strategic Shifts by Larger Companies
Many larger financial services companies have undergone alternating periods of expansion through acquisitions followed by contraction through divestitures aimed at refocusing operations on core business lines.
Cyclicality and Market Dislocation
The cyclicality of many sub-sectors of the financial services industry offers investment opportunities arising from market dislocation. During their emergence from cyclical troughs, existing strategic competitors often lack the resources or focus to deploy capital in the early stage of a sub-sector’s recovery.
Niche Growth Opportunities
The large size and fragmentation of many sub-sectors of the financial services industry offer the opportunity for smaller franchises operating in niche markets or possessing unique distribution or product capabilities to gain market share. Specialist companies have often emerged in these niche markets.
Complex Ownership Conversions
Many companies in the financial services industry possess complicated and evolving ownership structures. The insurance and banking industries include many companies that are owned by their policyholders or deposit holders, respectively. Many of these mutual companies continue to seek conversion to stock ownership, driven by the need to access the capital markets and provide equity-linked management incentives.

		Plains GP Holdings LP (PAGP) and Green Plains Inc (GPRE) Lead Today’s Top 11 Investor Filings	
Integrated Core Strategies discloses 5.10% stake in Green Plains

Jun 15, 2017, 7:00 am EDT  |  By Fintel



 
 

There were 11 notable investor filings today. Plains GP Holdings LP (NYSE:PAGP) is the largest company of interest.
When a person or group of persons acquires beneficial ownership of more than 5% of a company’s equity securities, they are required to file a Schedule 13D or 13G with the SEC. If these groups intend to influence management into changing the business strategy, they are considered “activist” investors.
There is considerable academic research that suggest activist investors contribute to excess returns in equities in the subsequent twelve months after the event.
Investors that acquire 10% or more of a company’s shares, or that gain a board seat, are considered insiders by the SEC and are subject to stricter insider trading filing requirements.
