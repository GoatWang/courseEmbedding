PAST RESULTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.  THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT ANY INVESTMENT WILL ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVES, GENERATE PROFITS OR AVOID LOSSES.
        


Hedge funds, commodity pools and other alternative investments involve a high degree of risk and can be illiquid due to restrictions on transfer and lack of a secondary trading market.  They can be highly leveraged, speculative and volatile, and an investor could lose all or a substantial amount of an investment.  Alternative investments may lack transparency as to share price, valuation and portfolio holdings.  Complex tax structures often result in delayed tax reporting.  Compared to mutual funds, hedge funds and commodity pools are subject to less regulation and often charge higher fees.  Mutual funds involve risk including possible loss of principal.  Alternative investment managers typically exercise broad investment discretion and may apply similar strategies across multiple investment vehicles, resulting in less diversification.  Trading may occur outside the United States which may pose greater risks than trading on U.S. exchanges and in U.S. markets. 
The Altegris group of affiliated companies is wholly-owned and controlled by (i) private equity  funds managed by Aquiline Capital Partners LLC and its affiliates (“Aquiline”), and by Genstar  Capital Management, LLC and its affiliates (“Genstar”), and (ii) certain senior management of  Altegris and other affiliates. Established in 2005, Aquiline focuses its investments exclusively in  the financial services industry. Established in 1988, Genstar focuses its investment efforts across a variety of industries and sectors,  including financial services. The Altegris companies include Altegris Investments, Altegris  Advisors, and Altegris Clearing Solutions. As of March 31, 2017, Altegris and its affiliates have approximately $2.43 billion in client assets.

Fitapelli Kurta is investigating complaints on behalf of investors who have invested money in the Altegris Winton Futures Fund.  Altegris Winton Future Fund is based in LaJolla, CA and allows investors to invest with as little as $10,000. 
Investigation: Campbell Strategic Allocation Fund
The Altegris Winton Futures Fund is a type of investment fund known as a “managed future fund.”  Many brokers promote managed futures, such as Altegris Winton Futures Fund, as protection against market declines.  However, the language in the prospectuses for these types of funds is not consistent with that notion.  This is not understood by most brokers and investors.
Unbeknownst to many retail investors, Altegris Winton Futures Fund charges institutions that invest at least $1 million a significantly reduced management fee.  Individuals, however, are less fortunate as they are charged higher annual management fees.  Due to this, some of Altegris Winton Futures Fund’s investors lost 10.1 percent in the same period that institutional investors had gains, according to SEC filings.

“Are any of these managed-futures funds worth it anymore at these fee levels?”
– Altegris Executive Vice President Richard Pfister

Managed-futures funds, such as the Altegris Winton Futures Fund, are a subset of hedge funds. The funds are run by commodity-trading advisers, or CTAs.   Although most hedge funds typically charge a 2 percent management fee, managed-futures funds often charge clients 7 to 9 percent of assets invested annually. Altegris Winton Futures Fund charges investors annual fees totaling up to 4 percent according to SEC filings.

	ITEM 1: BUSINESS




	 




	(a)           General Development of Business




	 




	Winton Futures Fund, L.P. (US) (d/b/a Altegris Winton Futures Fund, L.P.) (the “Partnership”) is a limited partnership organized under the Colorado Uniform Limited Partnership Act in March 1999.  The Partnership’s business is the speculative trading and investment in international futures, options and forward markets (“Commodity Interests”).  The Partnership commenced its trading and investment operations in November 1999.  Under the Partnership’s First Amended Agreement of Limited Partnership (the “Limited Partnership Agreement”), Altegris Portfolio Management, Inc. (d/b/a Altegris Funds), an Arkansas corporation (“Altegris Funds” or the “General Partner”), serves as general partner of the Partnership and has sole responsibility for management and administration of all aspects of the Partnership’s business.  Investors purchasing limited partnership interests (the “Interests”) in the Partnership (“Limited Partners” and together with the General Partner, “Partners”) have no rights to participate in the management of the Partnership.







	Altegris Funds is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) as a Commodity Pool Operator (“CPO”), and is a member of National Futures Association (“NFA”).  Winton Capital Management Limited, a United Kingdom Company, acts as the Partnership’s trading advisor (“Advisor”).  The Advisor is registered with the CFTC as a Commodity Trading Advisor and is authorized and regulated by the United Kingdom’s Financial Services Authority.  Effective as of December 31, 2010, Altegris Funds became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Genworth Financial, Inc. (“Genworth”).  Genworth became a principal of Altegris Funds and Altegris Futures, L.L.C. (“Altegris Futures”), an affiliate of the General Partner, in January 2011.







	Altegris Investments, Inc. (“Altegris”), an affiliate of the General Partner, serves as a selling agent of the Interests and acted as the Partnership’s introducing broker until January 1, 2011, when Altegris Futures replaced Altegris as the Partnership’s introducing broker (“Introducing Broker”).  Altegris Futures is registered with the CFTC as an Introducing Broker.




	 




	The Partnership’s term will end upon the first to occur of the following: December 31, 2035; receipt by the General Partner of an election to dissolve the Partnership at a specified time by Limited Partners owning more than 50% of the Interests then outstanding, notice of which is sent by registered mail to the General Partner not less than ninety (90) days prior to the effective date of such dissolution; withdrawal (including withdrawal after suspension of trading), admitted or court decreed insolvency or dissolution of the General Partner; termination of the Partnership pursuant to the terms of the Limited Partnership Agreement; or any event that makes it unlawful for the existence of the Partnership to be continued or requiring termination of the Partnership.







	The Partnership is not required to be, and is not, registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.




	 




	As of February 28, 2011, the aggregate net asset value of the Interests in the Partnership before redemptions was $757,212,460.  The Partnership operates on a calendar fiscal year and has no subsidiaries.







	The Partnership offers three “classes” of Interests: Class A, Class B and Institutional Interests (each, a “Class of Interest”).  The Classes of Interests differ from each other only in the fees that they pay and the applicable investment minimums.







	(b)           Financial Information About Segments







	The Partnership’s business constitutes only one segment for financial reporting purposes —

	i.e.

	, a speculative “commodity pool.”  The Partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services.  Financial information regarding the Partnership’s business is set forth in the Partnership’s financial statements, included herewith.

	(c)           Narrative Description of Business




	  




	The Partnership is designed to produce long-term capital appreciation through growth, and not current income.  Altegris Funds has selected the Advisor to trade one of the Advisor’s proprietary trading models, the Winton Diversified Program (the “Program”), on behalf of the Partnership.  The Advisor currently has the authority to trade the Program on behalf of the Partnership in all the easily accessible and liquid commodity interests (comprising international futures, options and forward markets) that it practically can, which currently consists mainly of commodity interests that are futures, options and forward contracts and certain OTC products, such as swaps in the following areas: stock indices, bonds, short term interest rates, currencies, precious and base metals, grains, livestock, energy and agricultural products.




	 




	The Advisor’s investment technique in trading the Program consists of trading a portfolio of approximately 120 diversified, highly liquid financial instruments traded across numerous futures markets, and may also include certain OTC instruments and government securities, employing a computerized, technical, principally trend-following trading system.  This system tracks the daily price movements and other data from these markets around the world, and carries out certain computations to determine each day how long or short the portfolio should be to maximize profit within a certain range of risk.  If rising prices are anticipated, a long position will be established; a short position will be established if prices are expected to fall.




	 




	The trading methods applied by the Advisor to trade the Program on behalf of the Partnership are proprietary, complex and confidential.  As a result, the following explanation is of necessity general in nature and not intended to be exhaustive.  The Advisor plans to continue the research and development of its trading methodology and, therefore, retains the right to revise any methods or strategy, including the technical trading factors used, the commodity interests traded and/or the money management principles applied.




	 




	The Program traded by the Advisor pursues a technical trend-following system.  Technical analysis refers to analysis based on data intrinsic to a market, such as price and volume.  This is to be contrasted with fundamental analysis which relies on factors external to a market, such as supply and demand.  The Program uses no fundamental factors.




	 




	A trend-following system is one that attempts to take advantage of the observable tendency of the markets to trend (that is, to move from one price point to another, either higher or lower over a period of time), and to tend to make exaggerated movements in both upward and downward directions as a result of such trends.  These exaggerated movements are largely explained as a result of the influence of crowd psychology or the herd instinct, amongst market participants.




	 




	The Advisor developed the Program by relating the probability of the size and direction of future price movements with certain indicators derived from past price movements which characterize the degree of trending of each market at any time.




	 




	The Program follows a primarily non-discretionary system. This means that trading signals are automatically generated by its models and, except in extreme situations, are followed to the letter. The Advisor has found that the absence of discretion promotes greater consistency in performance and lessens the opportunity for less reliable anecdotal evidence and personal judgment to influence decision-making. In unusual market situations, the Advisor reserves the right to deviate from its automatic system.




	 




	The Advisor will select the type of order to be used in executing each trade on behalf of the Partnership and may use any type of order permitted by the exchange on which the order is placed.  The Advisor may place individual orders for each account it trades, or a block order for all accounts it trades, in which the same commodity interest is being cleared through the same clearing broker.  In the latter instance, the Advisor will allocate trades to individual accounts using a proprietary algorithm.  The aim of this algorithm is to achieve an average price for transactions as close as mathematically possible for each account.  This takes the form of an optimization process where the objective is to minimize the variation in the average traded price for each account.  On occasion, it may direct the clearing broker for the accounts to employ a neutral order allocation system to assign trades.   Partial fills will be allocated in proportion to account size.

	The trading strategy and account management principles of the Program described above are factors upon which the Advisor will base its trading decisions.  Such principles may be revised from time to time by the Advisor as it deems advisable or necessary.  Accordingly, no assurance is given that all of these factors will be considered with respect to every trade or recommendation made on behalf of the Partnership or that consideration of any of these factors in a particular situation will lessen the risk of loss or increase the potential for profits.




	  




	It is expected that between 5% and 50% of the Partnership’s assets generally will be held as initial margin or option premiums (in cash or U.S. Treasury Department (“Treasury”) securities) in the Partnership’s brokerage accounts at its clearing broker, Newedge USA, LLC (“Newedge USA”), a futures commission merchant (“FCM”), and/or Newedge Alternative Strategies, Inc. (“NAST”) (which may from time to time execute spot and other over-the-counter foreign exchange transactions as a counterparty to the Partnership), and available for trading by the Advisor in Commodity Interests on behalf of the Partnership.  Interest on Partnership assets held at Newedge USA in cash or Treasury securities will be credited to the Partnership as described under “Charges.”  Depending on market factors, the amount of margin or option premiums held at Newedge USA could change significantly, and all of the Partnership’s assets are available for use as margin.  The Partnership may also retain other brokers and/or dealers from time to time to clear or execute a portion of Partnership trades made by the Advisor.




	  




	With respect to Partnership assets not held at Newedge USA or NAST as described above, but deposited with Wilmington Trust Company (the “Custodian”), the portion not held in checking, money market or other bank accounts (and used to pay Partnership operating expenses) will be invested in liquid, high-quality short-term securities at the direction of the Custodian or its sub-advisor, Wilmington Trust Investment Management, LLC, an affiliate of the Custodian that is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) as an investment adviser.  The Partnership’s custody and investment management agreement with the Custodian permits the Custodian to invest in U.S. government and agency securities, other securities or instruments guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies, CDs, time deposits, banker’s acceptances, commercial paper and repurchase agreements — subject in each case to specific diversification, credit quality and maturity limitations.  The Custodian may use sub-advisers to attempt to increase yield enhancement.  The General Partner may direct that a portion of Partnership assets be deposited with other custodians and retain other sub-advisers for the purpose of attempting to increase yield enhancement via other cash management arrangements.




	 




	The percentage of the Partnership’s assets deposited with these firms is also subject to change in the General Partner’s sole discretion.  The Partnership’s assets will not be commingled with the assets of any other person.  Depositing the Partnership’s assets with banks or Newedge USA, or other clearing brokers, as segregated funds is not commingling for these purposes.




	  




	The Partnership pays all of its ongoing liabilities, expenses and costs.  Altegris Funds receives a management fee of 0.104% of the month-end net asset value, before deduction for any accrued incentive fees related to the current quarter (the “management fee net asset value”), of all Class A Interests (1.25% per annum), 0.104% of the month-end management fee net asset value of all Class B Interests (1.25% per annum) and 0.0625% of the month-end management fee net asset value of all Institutional Interests (0.75% per annum).  The Advisor receives a management fee of 0.083% of the management fee net asset value of the month-end capital account balances of all Interests (1.0% per annum) and 20% of quarterly trading profits applicable to each Class of Interest.







	Each selling agent selling Class A Interests receives 0.166% of the month-end net asset value of the Partnership apportioned to each Class A Interest sold by such selling agent (2% per annum) and may elect to receive 0.0417% of the month-end net asset value apportioned to any Institutional Interest sold by such selling (0.50% per annum).







	Newedge USA and/or NAST paid Altegris during 2010 and will pay Altegris Futures from and after January 1, 2011 a portion of the brokerage commissions and transaction fees received from the Partnership as well as a portion of the interest income received on the Partnership’s assets.  Monthly brokerage charges equal to the greater of (A) actual commissions of $9.75 per round-turn (higher for certain exchanges or commodities) multiplied by number of round-turn trades, which amount includes other transaction costs; or (B) an amount equal to 0.125% of the management fee net asset value of all Interest holders’ month-end capital account balances (1.50% annually).  If actual monthly commissions and transaction costs in (A) above are less than the amount in (B) above, the Partnership will pay the difference to the Introducing Broker as payment for brokerage-related services. In any




	 




	 






	 






	5










	 






	 




	month when the amount in (A) is greater than the amount in (B) above, the Partnership pays only the amount described in (A) above.







	The Partnership generally pays its operating expenses as they are incurred.  A fixed administrative fee is charged to Class A and Class B Interests and paid to Altegris Funds equal to 0.0275% of the management fee net asset value of the month-end capital account balance of all such Class A and Class B Interests (0.333% per annum).







	(h)           Regulation




	 




	The CFTC has delegated to NFA responsibility for the registration of “commodity trading advisors,” “commodity pool operators,” “futures commission merchants,” “introducing brokers” and their respective associated persons and “floor brokers” and “floor traders.”  The Commodity Exchange Act requires commodity pool operators such as Altegris Funds, commodity trading advisors such as the Advisor and commodity brokers or FCMs such as Newedge USA and introducing brokers such as Altegris Futures to be registered and to comply with various reporting and record keeping requirements.  CFTC regulations also require FCMs and certain introducing brokers to maintain a minimum level of net capital.  In addition, the CFTC and certain commodities exchanges have established limits referred to as “speculative position limits” on the maximum net long or net short speculative positions that any person may hold or control in any particular futures or options contracts traded on U.S. commodities exchanges.  All accounts owned or managed by the Advisor will be combined for position limit purposes.  The Advisor could be required to liquidate positions held for the Partnership in order to comply with such limits.  Any such liquidation could result in substantial costs to the Partnership.  In addition, many futures exchanges impose limits beyond which the price of a futures contract may not trade during the course of a trading day, and there is a potential for a futures contract to hit its daily price limit for several days in a row, making it impossible for the Advisor to liquidate a position and thereby experiencing a dramatic loss.  Currency forward contracts currently are not subject to regulation by any U.S. government agency.







	In addition to such registration requirements, the CFTC and certain commodity exchanges have established limits on the maximum net long or net short position which any person may hold or control in particular commodities.  Most exchanges also limit the changes in futures contract prices that may occur during a single trading day.  In January 2011, the CFTC proposed a separate position limits regime for 28 so-called “exempt” (i.e. metals and energy) and agricultural futures and options contracts and their economically equivalent swap contracts.  Position limits in spot months are proposed to be 25% of the official estimated deliverable supply of the underlying commodity and in a non-spot month a percentage of the average aggregate 12-month rolling open interest in all months (swaps and futures) for each contract.  The General Partner believes that the proposed limits are sufficiently large that if adopted, they should not restrict the Partnership’s trading strategy.







	Currency forward contracts are not currently subject to regulation by any United States (“U.S.”) Government agency.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Reform Act”) was enacted in July 2010.  The Reform Act includes provisions that comprehensively regulate the over-the-counter derivatives markets for the first time.  The Reform Act will mandate that a substantial portion of over-the-counter derivatives must be executed in regulated markets and submitted for clearing to regulated clearinghouses.  The mandates imposed by the Reform Act may result in the Partnership bearing higher upfront and mark-to-market margin, less favorable trade pricing, and the possible imposition of new or increased fees with respect to any swaps entered into by the Partnership.







	The Reform Act also amended the definition of “eligible contract participant,” and the CFTC is interpreting that definition in a such manner that the Partnership may no longer be permitted to engage in forward currency transactions by directly accessing the interbank market.  Rather, when the Reform Act goes into effect in July 2011, the Partnership may be limited to engaging in “retail forex transactions” which could limit the Partnership’s potential forward currency counterparties to futures commission merchants and retail foreign exchange dealers. Limiting on the Partnership’s potential forward currency counterparties in this manner could lead to the Partnership bearing higher upfront and mark-to-market margin, less favorable trade pricing, and the possible imposition of new or increased fees.  The “retail forex” markets could also be significantly less liquid than the interbank market.  Moreover, the creditworthiness of the futures commission merchants and retail foreign exchange dealers with which the Partnership may be required to trade could be significantly weaker than the creditworthiness of the financial institutions with which the Partnership currently engages for its forward currency transactions.  Although the impact

	of requiring the Partnership to conduct forward currency transactions in the “retail” market could be substantial, the full scope is currently unknown and the ultimate effect could also be negligible.







	The Partnership has no employees.

	The Partnership has no operations in foreign countries although it trades on foreign exchanges and other non-U.S. markets.  The Partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services.
