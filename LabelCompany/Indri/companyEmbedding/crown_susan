Crown Santa by Susan Brielmann

$325.00





Crown Santa by Susan Brielmann showcases the artist’s talent for blending elegant touches with her rustic designs. Glittered, vintage style trinkets and ornaments fill the weathered cage that doubles as Santa’s body and a lavish, ruffled paper collar frames Santa’s warm and welcoming face. Swatches of felt and burlap embellished with buttons, twine and individual typewriter keys spelling out SANTA on his cross-body sash complete his attire. And the crowning touch? The handmade, tape-measure crown perched jauntily on his head! Designed and assembled in the USA, the artist employs local artisans to complete the limited production of her three, 2014 original designs: Crown Santa, Birdcage Santa and Teddy Bear Santa.

Early life and education[edit]
The daughter of billionaire Lester Crown and Renée Schine, Susan Crown has a bachelor's degree from Yale University in Connecticut and a master's degree from New York University.[1] She also attended Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University.
Career[edit]
For nearly three decades, Susan Crown dedicated time and talent to social causes and the business world. As Partner of Henry Crown & Co, she helped manage businesses as diverse as oil and gas, defense, banking, cellular technology, and real estate. As Chairman of the Crown Family Philanthropies, she was involved in initiatives including the celebrated Crown Fountain in Millennium Park and the Covenant Awards for leaders in Jewish education.
The first woman board member of Illinois Tool Works[2] (ITW) – a multi-faceted manufacturing and engineering business with a market cap in excess of $30B – Ms. Crown now chairs its Executive Committee. She’s also a board member of The Northern Trust Corporation[3] and a former board member of Baxter International.
Ms. Crown serves as Vice-Chair of Rush University Medical Center.[4] She led a $1 billion effort to transform the medical center campus, including the development of Chicago’s first gold level LEED-certified hospital which in 2014 won the World Architecture Prize for best designed health care facility. She’s a former Fellow of Yale Corporation and co-chaired the Yale Tomorrow Campaign. She’s a director of CARE USA and, in 2011, co-chaired its National Conference on Global Poverty, which led to legislative reforms.
Susan Crown Exchange[edit]
SCE partners with organizations to create social change. SCE’s mission is to help people acquire skills needed to succeed and thrive in a rapidly changing, highly connected world. SCE is focused on two program areas: digital learning and social and emotional learning, building grit, empathy, and emotion management. The Exchange intends to add programs to cultivate other 21st century skills.[5]
SCE promotes social and emotional skills. In 2016, SCE published “Preparing Youth to Thrive: Promising Practices in Social and Emotional Learning", the first field guide for organizations aspiring to foster social and emotional growth in young people. The content was collected from experts of exemplary programs across the nation.
In the digital learning arena, SCE partnered with Common Sense Media to develop a learning ratings system. SCE and Common Sense Media have rated more than 3,500 digital learning products. The system informs parents, educators, and others about the educational value of a specific digital product and what style learner might benefit most from its use.[citation needed]
Owl Creek Partners[edit]
Owl Creek Partners is a private equity company with focused investments in real estate, securities, and consumer products. Most investments are with firms owned or managed by women.
Honors and awards[edit]
She has received several awards for her community work, including the Deborah Award from the American Jewish Congress, the William McCormick Blair Distinguished Service Award from the Yale Club of Chicago, and the Civic Leadership Award from the American Jewish Committee.[6]
Personal life[edit]
Crown and her husband William Charles Kunkler III live in Chicago, Illinois.[7] They have two children.

Susan Crown's juggling act


Susan Crown is branching out from the family business.The granddaughter of industrialist Henry Crown is a lieutenant in Mitt Romney's presidential campaign, she's growing her foundation and she has launched a website."It's all exciting. I was working within a bureaucracy with many sets of constraints," Ms. Crown says, referring to her work as a partner of Henry Crown & Co., which invests in banks, manufacturing, real estate and other industries. "Now I can draw outside the lines."She's stepping back from her role in the family business to focus on SCE, the Susan Crown Exchange foundation, a multimillion-dollar fund (she won't get specific) that she founded in 2009 and that invests in projects related to education and technology.The family company job "is about breadth, and this is about depth," she says, noting she remains an officer at Crown & Co.It's a juggling act, she says."You hope that everything runs smoothly and that no two things break down at the same time," she said last week during a book party she hosted for Jim Steyer, founder of Common Sense Media and partner in some of her new work evaluating the educational value of children's entertainment.Ms. Crown and her husband, William Kunkler III, vice president of CC Industries, the manufacturing arm of the family company, also are heading up Mr. Romney's Illinois finance committee.The daughter of Lester Crown, one of President Barack Obama's earliest supporters, likes the Republican's call for "economic freedom and reducing the size of government."She won't deny any tension.
Lester Crown's daughter has turned her attention to education and technology.
"We've talked about it. It's an act of conscience for my dad and an act of conscience for me. Reasonable people can disagree and still respect one another," she says.That's politics. When it comes to passion, she has it for SCE.It's through SCE that Ms. Crown, 54, teamed up with San Francisco-based Common Sense Media to launch Learning Ratings, a part of Common Sense's website that rates content of games, videos and movies based on their educational value. The site, CommonSenseMedia.org/learning-ratings, went live this month."It helps parents and kids find digital products and games that have the greatest potential to teach," she says.The project dovetails with her interests in children, says John McCarter Jr., the Field Museum CEO who has known Ms. Crown for more than 20 years. Mr. Kunkler is a museum trustee, and Ms. Crown helped create the museum's play lab for preschoolers."She's just wonderfully imaginative. She is interested in how kids deal with the world," the museum chief says.On a recent trip to Silicon Valley to promote the ratings link, Ms. Crown was disappointed that tech executives were cool to the parent-friendly tool. "That will change when they have kids," she notes.In Chicago last week, she talked with Mr. Steyer about his new book, "Talking Back to Facebook," which gives parents tips on how to unplug from the digital world.Her own children, a son in college and daughter working in Colorado, learned that early on, she says."We call it 'the respect app,' " she says. "All phones are off when we're at the dinner table."When her children were younger, she says, the Crown-Kunkler household kept the computer in full view in the kitchen, a point stressed by Mr. Steyer. That way, you can keep an eye on what your children are doing on the computer, he says.When it comes to phones, Ms. Crown says her children got them "when they hit the bar mitzvah circuit and we had to pick them up. You could say religion prompted that," she deadpans. Read more of Shia Kapos on her blog.

Learning without limits

 





Letter from the chairman:

We believe that we can help equip the rising generation with the skills needed to thrive in the 21st century. There is no question: our highly connected world offers powerful tools, real opportunities, and unprecedented challenges.


“Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change.” -Stephen Hawking
To all Colleagues and Friends,
Fifteen years into the 21st century, we still speculate about how our world will change. Issues evolving at a rapid pace include technology, the economy, speed and channels of communication, personal privacy, public safety, and which skills will be in highest demand. There is no doubt that these, and many more fundamental issues, will be drastically different when we enter the 22nd century.
So, what is the best way to prepare and equip the rising generation to thrive in a connected, fast-changing and complex world?
This question is at the heart of SCE’s work. We manage three strategic grant-making programs, all intended to help prepare today’s kids to be able, productive, and fulfilled members of society.
Our Digital Learning program attempts to connect and capitalize on some of the powerful tools, and some of the chronic flaws that exist today. We begin with the unpleasant fact that our public education system is broken, in many ways. We are hardly alone in assuming our public education system has devolved into a class system.  Sadly, the quality of education is all too often dependent on family income; those with the least resources receive the poorest quality education and vice versa. Today’s technology—paired with the right human supports—offers  an opportunity to channel high-quality learning material to kids, anytime, anywhere.
The question then becomes “What is the good?” in technology and how can we use it to participate in the effort to democratize education?  Our highly selective list of grantees illustrates how we are working towards this end.
Our second program area speaks to the “non-cognitive” skills that are most highly correlated to life success and satisfaction.  The attributes we focus on include: grit and resilience, problem-solving, emotion management, agency, and capacity for empathy. These SEL (social and emotional learning) skills form the framework for meaningful relationships. Without them, even the brightest individual can be limited.
A significant body of research confirms that SEL skills are learned. These attributes are usually taught by supportive adults, in safe contexts. Unfortunately, many children lack close, supportive relationships with adults, and there is a paucity of safe places to go on weekends and between dismissal and dinnertime.
Our SEL Challenge focuses on afterschool programs—in arts, sports, every conceivable interest area—where low-income kids and professional youth workers come into frequent contact.  We have selected eight geographically and programmatically diverse organizations, whose common characteristics include great track records, high-quality programs and staff, and an intentional effort to impart SEL skills.
In addition to providing direct support to some of our nation’s best youth-facing programs, we are studying, recording and codifying those practices that cultivate SEL skills in youth. This two-year effort will culminate in the creation of a Field Guide of best practices and user-friendly impact measures, which will be made available free of charge to any youth service interested in strengthening the SEL component of their work.
And finally, we operate a catch-all program called Catalyst Grants, which recognizes innovative and promising approaches to chronic problems. The list of grantees best describes the work.
This kind of work is a privilege and a joy. SCE could not operate without its knowledgeable, dedicated board, and its keenly intelligent and capable team. None of this work would be possible without the generosity of Henry Crown, who believed, as I do, that actions always speak louder than words.
Susan Crown

Our Mission:

SCE is invested in shaping an ecosystem of anytime, anywhere, 21st century learning to prepare youth to adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing and highly connected world. Through three primary programs—digital learning, social and emotional learning, and our catalyst grants—SCE connects talent and innovation with forces for positive change.
We seek to broaden the definition of success to include mastery of skills like problem solving, complex systems thinking, and digital literacy, which extend beyond the acquisition of knowledge –to learning how to learn.

Our History:

In 2009, after three decades in traditional philanthropy, Susan Crown decided to pursue a more finely tuned, strategic approach to social investment. She wanted to focus on a handful of programs, and to take bigger risks on innovative ways to drive positive change for the rising generation. So she built an entity that is different, and nimbler, than traditional foundations. Susan assembled a talented and unconventional staff, and a board of experienced leaders from the public, private, and social sectors. The result is SCE — the Susan Crown Exchange, a social investment organization with a fresh approach to catalyzing change through philanthropy.





Our Team:





        Susan Crown        Chairman & Founder 






Susan Crown is a philanthropist and business executive with a strategic, results-oriented approach. She is Chairman and Founder of the Susan Crown Exchange (SCE) and Chairman and CEO of Owl Creek Partners.
Unlike most foundations, the Exchange uses an approach that goes beyond traditional grant-making; it fosters partnerships and collaborations to create social change. SCE’s mission is to help people acquire skills needed to succeed and thrive in a rapidly changing, highly connected world. SCE is focused on two program areas: digital learning and social and emotional learning, building grit, empathy, and emotion management. The Exchange intends to add programs to cultivate other 21st century skills.
SCE is a leader in promoting social and emotional skills. In 2016, SCE published “Preparing Youth to Thrive: Promising Practices in Social and Emotional Learning,” the first field guide for organizations aspiring to foster social and emotional growth in young people. The content was collected from experts of exemplary programs across the nation – and it is the first best practices field guide of its kind (which can be downloaded at no charge from SELpractices.org).
In the digital learning arena, SCE partnered with Common Sense Media to develop the rubric for a learning ratings system. SCE and Common Sense Media have rated more than 3,500 digital learning products. The system informs parents, educators, and others about the educational value of a specific digital product and what style learner might benefit most from its use.
Owl Creek Partners is a private equity company with focused investments in real estate, securities, and consumer products. Most investments are with firms owned or managed by women.
For nearly three decades, Susan Crown dedicated time and talent to social causes and the business world. As Partner of Henry Crown & Co, she helped manage businesses as diverse as oil and gas, defense, banking, cellular technology, and real estate. As Chairman of the Crown Family Philanthropies, she professionalized an ad hoc family process and spearheaded numerous initiatives including the celebrated Crown Fountain in Millennium Park and the Covenant Awards for leaders in Jewish education.
The first woman board member of Illinois Tool Works (ITW) – a multi-faceted manufacturing and engineering business with a market cap in excess of $30B – Ms. Crown now chairs its Executive Committee. She’s also a board member of The Northern Trust Corporation and a former board member of Baxter International.
Ms. Crown serves as Vice-Chair of Rush University Medical Center. She led a $1 billion effort to transform the medical center campus, including the development of Chicago’s first gold level LEED-certified hospital which in 2014 won the World Architecture Prize for best designed health care facility.  She’s a former Fellow of Yale Corporation and co-chaired the Yale Tomorrow Campaign. She’s a director of CARE USA and, in 2011, co-chaired its National Conference on Global Poverty, which led to legislative reforms.
Susan Crown graduated with honors with a B.A. from Yale University, earned an M.A. from New York University, and attended the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. She lives with her husband, William Kunkler, in Chicago, IL. They have two children.
