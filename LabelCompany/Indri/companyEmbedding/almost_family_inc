Almost Family, Inc. Testified Before U.S. Congress on How to Improve Post-Acute Care


Company President Steve Guenthner's Testimony Highlighted By Ways and Means Committee Chairman Brady

Louisville, KY, September 8, 2016 - CEO and Chairman of the Board of Almost Family, Inc. William Yarmuth announced today that Steve Guenthner, President of the Company, testified yesterday, September 7, before the U.S. House Ways & Means Health Subcommittee on payment reforms in post-acute settings.
Following the Hearing, Mr. Yarmuth said, "We are honored Almost Family was selected by the Subcommittee to discuss the important role home healthcare will play in evolving patient care systems, including value-based purchasing models. I am proud of the way Steve represented the Company and policy positions generally shared by the homecare industry."
In his Committee Press Release on the Hearing, Ways & Means Chair Kevin Brady highlighted portions of Guenthner's testimony which stated, "Value-based purchasing is the natural next step in the evolution of patient-centric Medicare policy, especially when it rewards providers for patient-focused outcomes, balanced against the cost incurred to achieve those outcomes... We need to change the policy question from 'how should we pay providers' to 'how we should care for patients."
Mr. Yarmuth also said, "We are likewise pleased members of the Subcommittee as well as other witnesses are receptive to the need for regulatory relief for homecare. Cong. Price (Ga.-6th) in particular, in his exchange with Steve, highlighted the need to further simplify the Face To Face physician certification requirement and settle the backlog of homecare claims denied under this provision and pending for administrative review."
The Company also noted the exchange between Mr. Guenthner and Cong. Kind (Wi.-3rd), lead co-sponsor of value-based purchasing legislation with Chairman Brady, regarding the value of Accountable Care Organizations in demonstrating that increased use of low-cost services such as home health can lower total Medicare spending and improve quality.
Guenthner commented, "Payment systems that reward quality and better patient outcomes, coupled with improved program integrity controls, are the next step in development of patientcentered integrated care models. We also continue to emphasize the need to address chronic illnesses as a part of managing both post-acute and total costs of care. We thank the Subcommittee for the opportunity to present our views and for the good exchange of ideas with policymakers and among my co-panelists representing other sectors of the healthcare delivery system. We were gratified to hear the overall recognition of the importance of homecare in postacute reform."
A video recording of the full testimony, the Press Release of Chairman Brady on behalf of the Ways and Means Committee, the written testimony submitted by Mr. Guenthner, and copies of a series of white papers submitted by Almost Family in response to requests for stakeholder comment can be found here.

Most of the IT staff works from the corporate headquarters in Louisville, KY, though some IT support staff work from patient care facilities in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut following the company's 2008 acquisition of Patient Care, Inc.

The Manager of IS Operations aides the CIO in developing IT strategies and maintaining security systems, and another manager oversees IT projects and database applications. The IT group focuses on systems operations, troubleshooting network issues and developing software to improve patient care.

Almost Family's clinical software is developed in-house. They use these in-house developed systems to collect assessment data, log patient visits, and generate medical orders. The system also integrates billing and collections as well as its HR information technology.

The Amazon.com Textbooks Store




	
Are you tired of paying a small fortune for your textbooks every year? Wouldn’t you rather buy cheap college textbooks and have more money to buy that great pair of skinny jeans, eat out more often instead of heating up a frozen pizza, or just have a little more spending money? When you come to Amazon.com, you can save money by buying cheap new and used textbooks and by renting textbooks for college. You can also trade your used textbooks for an Amazon Gift Card, whether you bought your books from us or not. By being a smart shopper and saving money on textbooks at Amazon.com, you’ll have more cash for the things in life that can’t be learned from a textbook.

Don’t worry about selection, we’ve got your textbook needs covered for any subject from biology, chemistry, and nursing to accounting, arts, and engineering. Once you’re finished with your textbooks you can trade them in at Amazon.com and get up to 80% of their value in an Amazon Gift Card.   

Shop the Amazon Textbooks Store and save up to 90% on textbook rentals, up to 90% on used textbooks, and up to 50% on new textbooks. You can also enjoy Free Two-Day Shipping on millions of items, including cheap college textbooks, when you join Prime Student. Get your textbooks delivered to your door and save both time and money by shopping at Amazon.com. So go ahead and treat yourself to that designer purse or new video game, you can since you’ve saved so much on your textbooks.

Learn about eTextbook features that help you study smarter, not harder.












We know there are things you would rather be doing than studying, so we built X-Ray for Textbooks to help you save time. With X-Ray for Textbooks, get everything you need with a single tap, including definitions, related pages in your eTextbook, and even relevant content from other sources like Wikipedia and YouTube. X-Ray for Textbooks is available on Fire tablets and the free Kindle Reading App for iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac on select eTextbooks. To access X-Ray for Textbooks, bring up the control bar within an eTextbook by tapping at the top or bottom of your screen.  You can find the X-Ray for Textbooks button at the top of the control screen.

Just carrying around a yellow highlighter? How about pink, blue, orange, and yellow? Multi-color highlights are available on Fire tablets, iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. Tap a word and hold–the digital highlighting tool will pop up and you can adjust the highlighted text and highlight color. You can categorize and save all your highlights in Notebook and even turn them into flashcards with the click of a button; go to Notebook and click on the Flashcards button to create flashcards from your highlights. We store all your highlights at kindle.amazon.com so you can reference them even after you return the eTextbook.














Studying for exams? Notebook for eTextbooks displays all of your notes, colored highlights, saved images and bookmarks in one place. With Notebook you can mark and filter your most important concepts to study when it's test time–you can even export them to email and Evernote on Fire tablets. It's like a digital scrapbook for your studies. Notebook is available on Fire HD tablets and the free Kindle Reading App for iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. On iOS and Android devices, tap the top or bottom of the screen from within the eTextbook to bring up the controls to access Notebook. On PC/Mac, the Notebook icon is on the left side of the Kindle Reading app.














Just finished a chapter and need to review key terms and definitions? Flashcards allow you to quickly brush up on all the terms, concepts, and definitions in each chapter with a simple, easy to use interface. Flashcards are available on iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac from within the eTextbook. Click on the flashcards icon to make your own flashcards. Or, you can auto-generate Flashcards from your notes and highlights and X-Ray terms if your eTextbook includes X-Ray for eTextbooks.














Have a tablet and a laptop? With eTextbooks, you can read your content on all your devices with the free Kindle Reading App. eTextbooks are currently supported on Fire tablets, iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. eTextbooks give you access to your content however you want, whenever you need it. Kindle's Whispersync technology also synchronizes the furthest page you read, your bookmarks, and annotations across your devices so you can pick up where you left off.














You can save money and space in your bag with eTextbooks. Read across your devices and save time studying the concepts you need to learn with interactive features such as Keyword Search and X-Ray for Textbooks. Quickly create and manage your notes and highlights and access them anytime in the Amazon cloud.














Carry less around campus this semester. Take your entire library with you wherever you go, without having to lug around all of your physical textbooks. You can also access all of your eTextbooks, notes, and bookmarks wherever you go, whether it's on your Fire tablet, iPad, iPhone, Android device, PC, or Mac with the free Kindle Reading App.














With the swipe of a finger, quickly and efficiently navigate through pages and chapters of eTextbooks. Swift navigation is available on Android and iOS tablets. Tap the top or bottom of your tablet screen from inside the eTextbook to access swift navigation. On iPads, you have the option of swiping through all the pages from a grid like the one shown above.
