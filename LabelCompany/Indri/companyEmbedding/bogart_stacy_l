Definition:

                            I am here to tell you, that you are worthless. Hopeless, and helpless. You are a nobody and your existence, means nothing. I will suck (withdraw) the energy and motivation out of you, until you no longer want to get out of bed in the morning. I will affect every single one of your lives, whether it is through a loved one, such as your mum, your uncle, or your best friend. Or some of you will experience me first hand. I have killed many people each year, and I don't discriminate based on age, gender, race, skin colour or religion. Who am I you wonder? WELL, I AM DEPRESSION.
