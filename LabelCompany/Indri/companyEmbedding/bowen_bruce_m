“I doubled my sales in less than a year”
 
There is a better way to sell
 


The key to making more sales, more often
 
 







I was trained in CORE+Selling in Dubai & Singapore, this approach to sales has helped me win “The sales performer of the year” Thanks Bruce.
Sagnik Niyogi  – India

 

 
 





“Bruce took the time to understand our business, customise the perfect training, & empower our team to excel. The results are better that we could have hoped for”  
Ali Hassain- UAE

 

 
 





CORE+Selling and the sales road map is a powerful combination to be successful, this has been a life changing program for our team to reach our full potential. Thanks Bruce! 
Carlos Rodriguez Belgium

 

 
 





Bruce’s training is simple yet so effective. I now carry a deck of cards with me in the car to remind me about the Aces. I’m now making more sales in less time – and playing with more aces.  Thanks Bruce  
Justin Heath- Aust.

 

 
 





“Just fantastic! — fun, interactive and a brilliant new approach to selling that is easy. Thanks Bruce”  –        
 Ben Collins UK

of traditional sales training is forgotten within 3 weeks – but not with CORE+Selling

 
 
 



Bruce Bowen developed CORE+Selling because the American ‘closing approach’ to sales and sales training is not very effective outside the USA, yet this ‘closing’ method has become the standard around the world.                          Sales training now has a choice.
 
We are taught to build trust with our customers, yet the traditional approach to sales has left sales people as low as #87 on a list of most trusted professions. That terrible statistic reflects in the over reliance on today’s CRM systems, with less than less than a 4% conversion rate! So while these statistics are extremely concerning, why do we continue to use the same sales methods? CORE+Selling, developed by international sales trainer Bruce Bowen, is a different sales training method. It will give you better results.
Imagine:

No more customer objections
No more screens put up by customers
No more time wasting games played by both sides

 
 

CORE+Selling is for Sales Professionals & Sales Managers who want better sales results.         This sales training method will:
 



Increase your sales conversions
Increase your profit margins
Have you relating to all communication styles better
Strengthen and build better relationships
Improve referrals $ repeat business
Have the team & individuals reach their full potential
Develop and fine tune your ‘Sales Road Map’

 




Download a FREE copy of Bruce’s book & get an overview of what “CORE+Selling” is about. And he won’t even ask you for you details. No gimmicks – No tricks – He just hopes you find something valuable to help you on your sales journey. Of course if you have any questions about any sales training, or sales training methods feel free to get in touch.

WHAT IS CORE+SELLING?
 
 
 





‘CORE’ is the sales method, or ‘what we do’.

C = Circumstances
O = Obstacles
R = Repercussions
E = Explore Solutions


 
 
 




The ‘+’part is how we do things. How we relate to others. How we present our message. How we
 build trust. Nothing will work if we don’t get the how right!

 
 
 




Find the answers to the 4 CORE questions and solve the customer’s problems in the right way. This is
 a modern approach with good old-fashioned integrity at its core. This is CORE+Selling.

Bruce always provides concrete tools that sales professionals can immediately use. He also develops their interpersonal skills to communicate more effectively. On top of it, the training never really ends… Bruce is always willing to help if one of the trainees contact him afterwards.
Atlas Copco has worked several times with Bruce and it has always been a real success. I strongly recommend you to give him a try, you won’t regret it.”
Isabelle Boudreault, VP Human Resources, Atlas Copco Specialty Rental division

 

 
 





CORE+Selling and the sales road map is a powerful combination to be successful, and the most astounding is that the training is not a 2-3 day conference but a complete life changing program to reach our full potential. Thanks Bruce!
Carlos Rodriguez, Competence & Business Development Manager, Atlas Copco Specialty Rental division

 

 
 





I recently engaged Bruce to provide Excellence in Customer Service training to my team. He was very thorough in understanding our needs and customising the package to suit them. His presentation was thoroughly prepared and very effective. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend him to provide training for a wide range of businesses and organisations.
Carla Branson – Owner @ Talking Matters

 

 
 





Bruce is the consummate professional – I have been more than impressed with his “CORE+Selling” approach to sales – it’s original and stimulating. My clients have benefited greatly from his skilful training approach. The fact that he speaks from experience and has successfully practised what he preaches goes along way with my small and large business clients.
Geoff Haygreen – Business Advisor at Polaris Centre

 

 
 





Fantastic, inspirational & relevant. To hold the undivided attention of a room full of sales professionals is no mean feat and Bruce did it with ease—I’m impressed. My team have come away not just with excitement, but self belief that they can achieve beyond their current levels. Thanks Bruce, we will be back for more.
Andrew Harris – Area Manager SA/WA @Astra Zeneca Pharmaceuticals

 

 
 





I have now attended 2 training workshops facilitated by Bruce – I thoroughly enjoy the way Bruce engages his audience, how he can change the structure to accommodate specific needs and how he can change the minds of the less enthusiastic (not me!) and have them participating at a high level from the start. Bruce is a fantastic trainer who leaves a great impression on what training should be all about!
Kylie Rowe – Metcash

 

 
 





I have been a high end sales professional for over 20 years in real estate and new homes. I have attended numerous sales training events over the years, but nothing like this. I thought this session would be the same old same old but how wrong I was. I came away with a fresh insight and renewed energy that I have no doubt is going to have a major impact on my bottom line. What a refreshing way look at sales. Thanks Bruce, i’ll certainly be back for more.
Gary H – Sales Professional

 

 
 





High energy, engaging, extremely relevant for interactions with both clients and colleagues. Having something to occupy my hands enabled me to take on more information…great idea!! All of the course was beneficial to me, even the small talk during the break. Highly recommended.
Marg B – Job Services Australia

 

 
 





I was extremely impressed with how our recent two day leadership training program went. Bruce is an engaging and energetic facilitator who kept the group focused from the beginning to the end. No 3pm nod offs … Bruce had the ability to tap into relevant ‘real life’ examples from our own sector which made it so much more meaningful for our group. Great work Bruce! His knowledge is amazing and he was able to adapt quickly as the group dynamics changed from topic to topic, and from one discussion to another. I am certainly looking forward o our next session with Bruce.
Peter N – Senior Manager Disability Services

 

 
 





Bruce’s coaching is simple yet so effective. I now carry a deck of cards with me in the car next to the console in full view, to remind me about the Aces. I’m now selling to more people – and playing with more aces.  Thanks Bruce, I’m making more money in less time.
Justin Heath – Garden Helpers

 

 
 





Bruce is a highly skilled professional trainer and presenter, with a diverse range of experience that make his delivery both entertaining and relevant. If you want a trainer to up skill your staff in a practical, meaningful way for real results, I would highly recommend you engage the services of Bruce Bowen.
Sandra Hardie – Consultant & Wellness Coach

 

 
 





Bruce has been a presenter for Eastside BEC on our skills development workshops and he has done a fantastic job. His personality and easy style is a joy to follow as he gets his serious message across to small business owners on how to use those soft skills to improve bottom line profitability.
Phil Stump – Business Advisor @ Eastside Business Enterprise Centre

 

 
 





Bruce was initially given a brief outlining what we were hoping to achieve with the introduction of our new Leadership Program. He hit our brief to perfection with this first session which was a fantastic lead into the concept of Effective Leadership & Culture. His session is the first in a series of many to come and this training will be integral to building an effective Leadership Team and positive workplace culture. Well done Bruce and thank you!
Wendy Warren – Chief Executive at EBL Disability Services

 

 
 





I attended Bruce’s sales conference and wow what an eye opener. Bruce is such a motivational speaker and gave us so many sales tips and ways to build rapport with our customers and improve relations. I would definitely recommend to attend and we will be attending another one – thanks Bruce
Tina – Icon Graphic Design

 

 
 





I really enjoyed the session, it was fun, and involved – we participated at all levels. It was relative to me personally and Bruce was really switched on and good at what he did. He answered questions that we face regularly and helped us to understand more. Thank you, I wouldn’t have any hesitations in attending further sessions conducted by Bruce.
Mark M – Manager Electrical Retail

 

 
 





Training was great, Speaker was better, hope more sessions like this comes up soon. Incredibly useful and relevant to my position. Thanks
Brian J – Real Estate Sales

 

 
 





Wow, simple and easy to implement tools that will make a substantial impact on our management team. Bruce delivered the course content with passion and energy, and was able to relate it to every level of our business structure. I have never seen anyone empower, challenge and energise a group of people like Bruce did. We are certainly looking forward to renewed optimism and energy in the wok place. Thanks Bruce, exceptionally well done.
Jo-Anne T – City of Salisbury Council

 

 
 





In one of Bruce’s workshops I got some great tips to sell to different personality types. I was with a guy that I was not relating to very well, then I remembered what Bruce had said. So I changed my approach and walked out with the business – amazing. If you are in sales, then this training is a must.
Rob Hore – Ozpest

ABOUT BRUCE BOWEN
 
 
 


Bruce Bowen has over 30 years’ experience as an Australian based sales professional. Having sat through numerous sales training events and realising it all came from the same source, the American sales gurus, it was time to develop something that worked much better outside of the American business culture. Starting with the things that made him successful as a sales professional, Bruce developed CORE+Selling which is now in great demand. He travels the world passing on his insights and knowledge to companies large and small.
Through CORE+Selling, Bruce is helping sales professionals to reach their full potential making more sales, more often and at higher profit margins. That’s why top 100 global companies have Bruce back again and again to train their sales teams.
 
 

Having a great product and sales method is one thing, being able to teach it to others is another. This is why Bruce invested time, money and hard work developing his craft as a professional trainer. His passion to teach, impart knowledge and help people to grow and be the best they can possibly be, is a prime reason why Bruce is a highly sought after sales trainer and is engaged by some of the biggest companies in the world.
Bruce is author of the book ‘It Is Time For Our Sales Culture To Grow Up’, the creator of ‘The 3 Tiered Sales Suite’®- which has now evolved into CORE+Selling. Bruce is also listed as one of the top sales trainers in the world – ‘Sales Coach World’.
For a fresh approach to sales that is certainly more relevant and effective than what we have had from sales training over the past 50 years, CORE+Selling definitely is – the future of sales training.

Bowen v. Bowen

Annotate this Case






675 A.2d 412 (1996)
Barbara J. BOWEN
v.
Bruce M. BOWEN.
No. 95-226-Appeal.
Supreme Court of Rhode Island.
May 10, 1996.
*413 Albert D. Saunders, Jr., Greenwich, for Plaintiff.
Harold E. Krause, Jr., Providence, for Defendant.
OPINION
PER CURIAM.
This case came before a hearing panel of this Court for oral argument on April 16, 1996, pursuant to an order that had directed the defendant to show cause why the issues raised in his appeal should not be summarily decided.
After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that the issues raised by defendant's appeals will be decided at this time.
Barbara J. Bowen (Barbara) and Bruce M. Bowen (Bruce) were divorced by final judgment of divorce entered on October 29, 1984. Prior to the entry of that final judgment, they had executed a property settlement agreement that, while referenced in the final judgment for divorce, was never merged therein.
Bruce, commencing in 1991, failed to make the required monthly support payments called for in the property settlement agreement to Barbara. She thereupon filed a motion in the Family Court, seeking to have Bruce adjudged in contempt. He filed a motion to modify the property settlement support agreement, alleging a change in circumstances. After hearing, the Family Court granted Barbara's motion to adjudge Bruce in contempt and found Bruce to be in contempt for failure to pay the agreed-upon support payments. Bruce's motion to modify was denied. He appealed. On that appeal this Court on March 17, 1994, entered an order denying and dismissing Bruce's appeal and affirmed the denial of his motion to modify the support agreement/alimony payments. This Court also at that time vacated the Family Court's order adjudging Bruce to be in contempt. In that order this Court stated that when a separation agreement had not been merged into the final divorce judgment, it retains the characteristics of a contract and not a court judgment and that Barbara's remedy for breach of that contract was by civil action for breach of contract or a civil action for specific performance in a breach of contract action. That order mirrored our holding in Riffenburg v. Riffenburg, 585 A.2d 627 (R.I.1991), and also in Weiner v. Weiner, 113 R.I. 403, 321 A.2d 425 (1974).
Barbara ostensibly took the path indicated by our March 17, 1994 order and in April 1994 filed a motion in the Family Court for specific performance of the property settlement support agreement.[1] After hearing, a justice of the Family Court granted Barbara's motion for specific performance. In addition, on the basis of the hearing evidence, he found that Bruce owed Barbara $15,500 pursuant to the property settlement agreement terms. A judgment containing those findings was entered on October 31, 1994, and Bruce filed a timely appeal therefrom.
Apparently both encouraged and revitalized by her recent success, Barbara next filed an application for a garnishment order pursuant to G.L.1956 § 15-5-25 so as to permit withholding of sums sufficient for Barbara's support from Bruce's earnings due from his employer. Under § 15-5-25 the garnished employer would be required to pay the amounts withheld from Bruce directly to the clerk of the Family Court. Another justice of the Family Court heard that motion to assign and granted same. Bruce filed a timely appeal from that assignment-garnishment order.
On appeal Bruce asserts (1) that the Family Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain and hear Barbara's motion-action for specific performance and (2) that the wage assignment-garnishment statute, § 15-5-24, is limited to providing relief only with regard to Family Court child-support orders, *414 and not for support payments to Barbara such as the $15,500 amount arising out of a property settlement contract and not deriving from an order of the Family Court. We disagree with those contentions.
As to the subject matter jurisdiction in the Family Court over the specific performance motion in question, we conclude that the Family Court had the requisite jurisdiction, both legal and equitable, to entertain Barbara's motion-action for specific performance of the property settlement agreement in question as well as her application for a garnishment order pursuant to § 15-5-25.
General Laws 1956 § 8-10-3 sets out the jurisdiction of the Family Court and in part specifically empowers that court to hear and determine all matters pertaining to:
"property settlement agreements and all other contracts between persons who at the time of execution of said contracts, were husband and wife or planned to enter into that relationship."
It appears clear from the wording of § 8-10-3, as amended by P.L.1977, ch. 89, § 1 that the Family Court had subject matter jurisdiction of the property settlement contract entered into between the parties here at a time when they were husband and wife. Acting pursuant thereto the findings of arrearage and the order to pay same made by the Family Court justice were proper.
We note that in Riffenburg v. Riffenburg, 585 A.2d 627 (R.I.1991), and our previous order entered on March 17, 1994, in Bowen v. Bowen, No. 93-245-A, the P.L.1977, ch. 89, § 1 amended wording to § 8-10-3 was not raised by the parties. Had it been called to our attention, we might therein have concluded that the Family Court did in fact have jurisdiction over the property settlement contracts entered into between the parties therein despite the fact that those particular agreements had not been merged into the final decrees in those cases. See, e.g., Abedon v. Abedon, 121 R.I. 366, 371-72, 398 A.2d 1137, 1140 (1979).
As regards the authority and the jurisdiction of the Family Court to order Bruce to assign income due to him over to the clerk of the Family Court pursuant to § 15-5-24, we find the statute to encompass judgments containing child support orders as well as orders for support emanating from spousal support agreements recognized by § 8-10-3. In addition an order directing the assignment provided in § 15-5-24(1) can be made in proceedings subsequent to any initial spousal or child support order entered by the Family Court. Section 15-5-24(2). Once having undertaken to issue an income assignment order, the Family Court, pursuant to § 8-10-38, has been invested with the "like powers" of the Supreme and the Superior Courts as provided in G.L.1956 § 8-6-1. That statute permits the Family Court to frame and issue such "executions and other writs and processes, as may be necessary or proper to carry into full effect all the powers and jurisdiction" that had been vested in that court by constitution or statute. Garnishment of income from a defaulting obligor of support payments would be such a process available to the Family Court under § 8-6-1.
For the reasons stated, the defendant's appeals from the final judgment for specific performance and from the order garnishing his wages entered by the Family Court are both denied and dismissed. The judgment and order appealed from are affirmed, and the papers in the case are remanded to that court.
WEISBERGER, C.J., and MURRAY, J., not participating.
NOTES
[1]  We do not consider the motion for specific performance to constitute the civil action for breach of contract we alluded to in Riffenburg v. Riffenburg, 585 A.2d 627 (R.I.1991), but many a traveler, despite taking the wrong route, reaches the desired destination.
