Liberty Expedia Holdings, Inc. Prices Private Offering Of $350 Million Of 1.0% Exchangeable Senior Debentures Due 2047






Business Wire




Jun 8, 2017 6:50 AM EDT













 


















































  Liberty Expedia Holdings, Inc. ("Liberty") (Nasdaq: LEXEA, LEXEB) announced today that it has priced and agreed to sell to initial purchasers in a private offering $350 million aggregate principal amount of its 1.0% exchangeable senior debentures due 2047 (the "debentures"). Liberty has also granted to the initial purchasers an option to purchase additional debentures in an aggregate principal amount of up to $50 million.  Upon an exchange of debentures, Liberty, at its option, may deliver shares of Expedia, Inc. ("Expedia") common stock, cash or a combination of common stock and cash. Initially, 5.1566 shares of common stock are attributable to each $1,000 principal amount of debentures, representing an initial exchange price of approximately $193.93 for each share of Expedia common stock. A total of approximately 1,804,810 shares of Expedia common stock are attributable to the debentures (assuming the initial purchasers do not exercise their option to purchase additional debentures). Interest will be payable quarterly on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year, commencing September 30, 2017. The debentures may be redeemed by Liberty, in whole or in part, on or after July 5, 2022. Holders of the debentures also have the right to require Liberty to purchase their debentures on July 5, 2022. The redemption and purchase price will generally equal 100% of the adjusted principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, plus any final period distribution.  The offering is expected to close on June 13, 2017, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.  Liberty expects to use the net proceeds of the offering, together with cash on hand, to repay $350 million outstanding under its margin loan facility entered into by a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary. Any remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including to pay interest on the debentures.

Liberty Expedia Holdings, Inc. Proposes Private Offering Of Exchangeable Senior Debentures






Business Wire




Jun 6, 2017 4:15 PM EDT













 


















































  Liberty Expedia Holdings, Inc. ("Liberty") (Nasdaq: LEXEA, LEXEB) announced today that it intends to issue senior debentures exchangeable for Expedia, Inc. common stock in a private offering. The debentures will be exchangeable at the option of holders during specified periods. Upon an exchange of debentures, Liberty, at its option, may deliver Expedia, Inc. ("Expedia") common stock, cash or a combination of Expedia common stock and cash. Liberty expects to use the net proceeds of the offering to repay up to $350 million outstanding under its margin loan facility entered into by a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary. Any remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including to pay interest on the debentures.  The offering of the debentures will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or any state securities laws and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. The debentures will be offered by means of an offering memorandum solely to "Qualified Institutional Buyers" pursuant to, and as that term is defined in, Rule 144A of the Securities Act. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the debentures nor shall there be any sale of debentures in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such state.   Forward-Looking Statements   This press release includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements relating to the intended launch of a private offering of debentures and the use of proceeds therefrom. These forward-looking statements involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements, including, without limitation, general market conditions. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release, and Liberty expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in Liberty's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. Please refer to the publicly filed documents of Liberty, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for risks and uncertainties related to Liberty's business which may affect the statements made in this press release.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding our business, product and marketing strategies; the proposed Expedia Holdings Split-Off; new service offerings; the recoverability of our goodwill and other long-lived assets; our projected sources and uses of cash; and the anticipated impact of certain contingent liabilities related to legal and tax proceedings and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Where, in any forward-looking statement, we express an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished. The following include some but not all of the factors (as they relate to our consolidated subsidiaries and equity affiliates) that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated:  � customer demand for our products and services and our ability to adapt to changes in demand;  � competitor responses to our products and services;  � the levels of online traffic to our businesses' websites and our ability to convert visitors into customers or contributors;  � uncertainties inherent in the development and integration of new business lines and business strategies;  � our future financial performance, including availability, terms and deployment of capital;  � our ability to successfully integrate and recognize anticipated efficiencies and benefits from the businesses we acquire;  � the ability of suppliers and vendors to deliver products, equipment, software and services;  � the outcome of any pending or threatened litigation;  � availability of qualified personnel;  � changes in the nature of key strategic relationships with partners, distributors, suppliers and vendors;  � domestic and international economic and business conditions and industry trends, including the impact the United Kingdom's referendum in which British citizens approved an exit from the European Union;  � consumer spending levels, including the availability and amount of individual consumer debt;  � rapid technological changes;  � failure to protect the security of personal information, subjecting us to potentially costly government enforcement actions and/or private litigation and reputational damage;  � the regulatory and competitive environment of the industries in which we operate;  � threatened terrorist attacks, political and economic unrest in international markets and ongoing military action around the world; and  � fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  For additional risk factors, please see Amendment No. 5 to the Registration Statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-210377) filed on September 30, 2016 (the "Registration Statement"). These forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.  The following discussion and analysis provides information concerning our results of operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our accompanying condensed combined financial statements  I-17  Table of Contents  and the notes thereto and our audited combined financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 in the Registration Statement. See note 1 in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for an overview of new accounting standards that we have adopted or that we plan to adopt that have had or may have an impact on our financial statements.  Explanatory Note  During November 2015, the board of directors of Liberty Interactive Corporation ("Liberty Interactive") authorized management to pursue a plan to distribute to holders of its Liberty Ventures common stock shares of a newly formed entity, Liberty Expedia Holdings, Inc. ("Expedia Holdings" or the "Company" as discussed below) ("Expedia Holdings Split-Off"). Following the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, Expedia Holdings will be comprised of, among other things, Liberty Interactive's ownership interest in Expedia, Inc. ("Expedia"), as well as Liberty Interactive's wholly-owned subsidiary Bodybuilding.com, LLC ("Bodybuilding"). Bodybuilding became a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Interactive in October 2015 when Liberty Interactive purchased the remaining ownership interest in Bodybuilding. The Expedia Holdings Split-Off is intended to be tax-free to Liberty Interactive and stockholders of Liberty Ventures. In the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, (i) 0.4 of each outstanding share of Liberty Interactive's Series A Liberty Ventures common stock will be redeemed for 0.4 of a share of Expedia Holdings' Series A common stock, and (ii) 0.4 of each outstanding share of Liberty Interactive's Series B Liberty Ventures common stock will be redeemed for 0.4 of a share of Expedia Holdings' Series B common stock, with cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Liberty Interactive's Series A and Series B Liberty Ventures common stock and Expedia Holdings' Series A and Series B common stock. In contemplation of the proposed Expedia Holdings Split-Off, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission the Registration Statement that became effective during the third quarter of 2016. By virtue of the Registration Statement having gone effective, the Company is required to file a Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. The Expedia Holdings Split-Off is currently expected to occur at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 4, 2016, subject to the satisfaction or waiver (as applicable) of certain conditions.  Overview  We own an approximate 15.7% equity interest and 52.3% voting interest in Expedia as of September 30, 2016.  Historically, Liberty Interactive has been a party to a Stockholders Agreement with Mr. Barry Diller, Chairman of the Board and Senior Executive Officer of Expedia, pursuant to which Mr. Diller holds an irrevocable proxy (the "Diller Proxy") over all the shares of Expedia common stock ("EXPE") and Expedia class B common stock owned by Liberty Interactive. Liberty Interactive is also subject to a Governance Agreement with Expedia which provides for the right to nominate approximately 20% of the members of Expedia's board of directors, which is currently comprised of 13 members (three of which were nominated by Liberty Interactive). The Governance Agreement also provides for registration and other rights, and imposes certain restrictions on the ownership of shares of Expedia class B common stock. Pursuant to the Governance Agreement, Liberty Interactive has (and, following the completion of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, the Company will have) preemptive rights that entitle it to purchase a number of shares of Expedia common stock (excluding certain issuances related to options, warrants or convertible securities) so that Liberty Interactive or the Company, as applicable, will maintain the identical ownership interest in Expedia (subject to certain adjustments) that it had immediately prior to such issuance or proposed issuance (but not in excess of 20.01%). Any purchase by Liberty Interactive or the Company, as applicable, will be allocated between EXPE and Expedia class B common stock in the same proportion as the issuance or issuances giving rise to the preemptive right, except to the extent that Liberty Interactive or the Company, as applicable, opts to acquire shares of EXPE in lieu of shares of Expedia class B common stock. Based on the Stockholders Agreement and the Governance Agreement, the Company determined that, prior to the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, it does not control Expedia but instead has significant influence with respect to Expedia and accordingly, accounts for its investment in Expedia as an equity method affiliate.  In connection with the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, (a), the Governance Agreement and Stockholders Agreement will be assigned by Liberty Interactive to the Company and (b) Diller will cease to directly control a majority voting interest in Expedia by irrevocably assigning the Diller Proxy to the Company for a period of time up to 18 months following completion of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, subject to certain termination events. By virtue of (i) certain governance rights with respect to the Company as set forth in the Company's restated charter, an amendment to the Stockholders  I-18  Table of Contents  Agreement and an Amended and Restated Transaction Group among Mr. Diller, John C. Malone ("Malone"), Leslie Malone ("Mrs. Malone" and together with Malone, the "Malone Group"), Liberty Interactive and the Company and (ii) the grant by the Malone Group of an irrevocable proxy to vote, subject to certain exceptions, shares of the Company's common stock beneficially owned by the Malone Group upon the completion of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off or thereafter for a period of time ending upon termination of Diller's assignment of the Diller Proxy (the arrangements described in clauses (i) and (ii), the "proxy arrangements"), Diller will be able to elect and replace the directors of the Company who will determine how the Company will exercise certain rights and vote the shares of EXPE and Expedia class B common stock owned by the Company in the election of Expedia directors, though Malone will retain the ability to remove such directors of the Company. The rights under the Governance Agreement and Stockholders Agreement, each as assigned and amended, will be maintained even upon termination of the proxy arrangements. As a result, Expedia Holdings expects to begin consolidating Expedia as of the completion of the Expedia Holdings Split-Off, as Expedia Holdings will then control a majority of the voting interest in Expedia. In conjunction with application of acquisition accounting, we anticipate a full step up in basis of Expedia along with a gain related to a difference between our historical basis and the fair value of our interest in Expedia.  The financial information represents a combination of the historical financial information of Bodybuilding and Liberty Interactive's interest in Expedia. This financial information refers to the combination of the aforementioned subsidiary and investment as "Expedia Holdings," "the Company," "us," "we" and "our" here and in the notes to the condensed combined financial statements.  Bodybuilding is an Internet retailer of sports, fitness, dietary supplements, and other health and wellness products. It is also a large publisher of online health and fitness content, offering complimentary fitness content, workout programs, video trainers, articles, recipes, health advice and motivational stories. The online model also includes a combination of detailed product information and real-time user reviews to help its visitors achieve their health and fitness goals. Visitors include gym-goers, athletes, weightlifters and bodybuilders, and any individual wanting to improve their mental and physical well-being through diet and exercise. Bodybuilding launched its website in 1999 and now includes more than 30,000 pages of editorial content, 10,000 videos, 16,000 pages of store content and over 6.5 million forum threads. Its properties encompass more than 30 million monthly unique visitors and 11 million members of BodySpace, an inclusive fitness community within Bodybuilding that allows people of all health and fitness levels to track their progress and discuss goals, techniques, supplementation and achievements.  Expedia is an online travel company, empowering business and leisure travelers with the tools and information they need to efficiently research, plan, book and experience travel. Expedia seeks to grow its business through a dynamic portfolio of travel brands, including its majority owned subsidiaries that feature a broad supply portfolio-including over 321,000 properties in approximately 200 countries, 475 airlines, packages, rental cars, cruises, as well as destination services and activities. Travel suppliers distribute and market products via its traditional desktop offerings, as well as through alternative distribution channels including mobile and social media, its private label business and its call centers in order to reach its extensive, global audience.  I-19  Table of Contents  Results of Operations-Combined Combined Operating Results Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2016 2015 2016 2015 amounts in thousands Revenue $ 96,802 115,897 325,250 360,849 Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation and amortization included below) 70,397 87,880 242,128 276,097 Gross profit 26,405 28,017 83,122 84,752 Operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation Operating expense 7,125 8,032 23,712 24,314 Selling, general and administrative 12,206 10,674 37,119 33,675 Adjusted OIBDA 7,074 9,311 22,291 26,763 Stock-based compensation expense (benefit) 770 597 (314) 1,510 Depreciation and amortization 4,472 5,076 14,305 15,038 Operating income (loss) $ 1,832 3,638 8,300 10,215  Revenue  Revenue decreased $19.1 million and $35.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by a 4% and 1% decrease in Bodybuilding store visitors for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and a 5% and 6% reduction in the average order value for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, due to increased mobile sales and changes to promotional strategies. In addition, order volumes decreased from the prior year by approximately 15% and 7% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, due in part to lower conversion rates, changes in consumer behavior from price sensitivity, and increased competition and competitive pricing strategies. Bodybuilding evaluates promotions and reprices products continuously in order to present a compelling and competitive offering to customers. These changes to prices and Bodybuilding's ability to source products cost effectively impact margins. Private label and exclusive offerings typically have higher margins and continue to make up a larger portion of total sales compared to prior periods.  Cost of sales  Cost of sales decreased $17.5 million and $34.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The decrease was a result of a decrease in product sales and Bodybuilding's ability to source products cost effectively, an increased sales mix to private label and exclusive offerings, as discussed above, a reduction in overall shipping costs and expired product recovery optimization.  Operating expenses  Operating expenses decreased $907 thousand and $602 thousand for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily driven by reduced freight audit fees and trade filing fees, lower personnel costs and lower merchant processing fees.  Selling, general and administrative expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $1.5 million and $3.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The increase was driven by costs incurred in connection with the closure of a Bodybuilding fulfillment center in the fourth quarter of 2015 and a second fulfillment center in the second quarter of 2016, as well as additional product listing, display retargeting,  I-20  Table of Contents  television ad spend, legal and compliance fees primarily related to product compliance and consulting fees. In addition, selling, general and administrative costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were driven down by legal claim settlements and a credit due to the release of the paid time-off accrual as a result of a corporate policy change.  Stock-based compensation expense (benefit)  Stock-based compensation expense increased $173 thousand and decreased $1.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The increase for the three month period was primarily due to new grants of Bodybuilding stock appreciation rights during 2016. The benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily due to a decrease in the per unit valuation of outstanding stock appreciation rights at Bodybuilding.  Depreciation and amortization expense  Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $604 thousand and $733 thousand for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The decrease was due to fewer capital expenditures and certain assets becoming fully depreciated during the year.  Operating Income (Loss)  Operating income decreased $1.8 million and $1.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year due to the items discussed above.  Adjusted OIBDA  We define Adjusted OIBDA as revenue less cost of sales, operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expense (excluding stock compensation). Our chief operating decision maker and management team use this measure of performance in conjunction with other measures to evaluate our businesses and make decisions about allocating resources among our businesses. We believe this is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our businesses, including each business's ability to service debt and fund capital expenditures. In addition, this measure allows us to view operating results, perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. This measure of performance excludes such costs as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements and restructuring and impairment charges that are included in the measurement of operating income pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Accordingly, Adjusted OIBDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for operating income (loss), net earnings (loss), cash flow provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. See note 8 to the accompanying condensed combined financial statements for a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to earnings (loss) before income taxes.  Adjusted OIBDA decreased $2.2 million and $4.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The decrease in Adjusted OIBDA was a result of a decrease in revenue as well as an increase in selling, general and administrative costs, partially offset by a decrease in cost of sales and operating expense, as discussed above.  I-21  Table of Contents  Other Income and Expense  Components of Other income (expense) are presented in the table below.   Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2016 2015 2016 2015 amounts in thousands Other income (expense): Interest expense $ (259) (321) (838) (910) Related party interest expense - (355) - (1,129) Share of earnings (losses) of Expedia, Inc. 39,812 45,048 18,112 125,147 Gains (losses) on dilution of investment in affiliate 1,097 4,162 (2,368) 4,782 Other, net 212 (102) 61 (467) $ 40,862 48,432 14,967 127,423  Interest expense  Interest expense decreased $62 thousand and $72 thousand for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The decrease was due to overall lower debt outstanding during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year.  Related party interest expense  Related party interest expense recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 related to a note with Liberty Interactive that was contributed to equity in the fourth quarter of 2015.  Share of earnings (losses) of Expedia, Inc.  Share of losses of Expedia decreased $5.2 million and $107.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The change in our share of Expedia's earnings (losses) is primarily due to a gain recognized by Expedia on the sale of its ownership stake in eLong, Inc. ("eLong") as well as a one-time gain recognized in connection with the acquisition of additional interest in one of its equity method investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  See note 3 in the accompanying notes to the condensed combined financial statements for additional discussion of the Company's investment in Expedia.  I-22  Table of Contents  The following is a discussion of Expedia's results of operations. In order to provide a better understanding of Expedia's operations, we have included a summarized presentation of Expedia's results of operations. Expedia is a separate publicly traded company and additional information about Expedia can be obtained through its website and public filings. The amounts included in the table below represent Expedia's results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.   Three months ended Nine months ended September 30, September 30, 2016 2015 2016 2015 amounts in millions Revenue $ 2,581 1,938 6,681 4,974 Operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation (1,918) (1,483) (5,511) (4,185) Adjusted OIBDA 663 455 1,170 789 Depreciation and amortization (201) (119) (596) (324) Stock-based compensation (48) (63) (198) (134) Legal reserves, occupancy tax and other (22) 115 (29) 106 Restructuring and related reorganization charges (6) (43) (33) (53) Operating income (loss) 386 345 314 384 Other income (expense), net (46) (3) (153) 548 Earnings (loss) before income taxes 340 342 161 932 Income tax benefit (expense) (61) (66) 15 (196) Net earnings (loss) $ 279 276 176 736  Expedia had net earnings of approximately $279 million and $276 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and net earnings of approximately $176 million and $736 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Expedia's revenue increased $643 million and $1,707 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the impact of acquisitions, including HomeAway and Orbitz (which added 20% and 22% to the growth rate in total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively), and growth in the Core online travel agencies segment, including growth at Brand Expedia and Hotels.com, as well as growth at trivago.  The increases in revenue (described above) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were offset by the impact of a $435 million and $1,326 million increase in operating expenses, respectively, an $82 million and $272 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, respectively, a $15 million and $64 million increase in stock-based compensation and a $43 million and a $701 million increase in other expense. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, Expedia recognized a pre-tax gain of $509 million on the sale of its ownership stake in eLong and a $77 million gain in connection with the acquisition of additional interest in one of its equity method investments.  The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by an increase in overall costs as a result of acquisitions, increased personnel costs due to an accelerated pace of hiring in the lodging supply organization and additional headcount at HomeAway and Orbitz and higher net credit card processing costs related to growth of its merchant bookings and higher data center costs. These increases were somewhat offset by a decrease in operating expenses as a result of the sale of eLong in May 2015. The increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets related to new business acquisitions (including Orbitz and HomeAway) as well as increased depreciation and amortization of technology assets. The increase in stock-based compensation was largely due to costs associated with trivago as well as expense related to restructuring and reorganization activities, partially offset by the . . .

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
