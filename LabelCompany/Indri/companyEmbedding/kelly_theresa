Kelly Limestone: Calcium Products and Capsulated Pellets   » About Us

 About Us
Kelly Limestone LLC, Company History 
Kelly Limestone LLC continues the tradition of producing quality calcium products that Kelly Lime & Rock Co., Inc. started in 1959.  Richard B. Kelly and Cora C. Kelly founded the company in August of 1959.  They produced agricultural lime and aggregate stone for construction.  Richard B. Kelly, a WW II vet, understood the use of agricultural lime in his father’s farming business.  Due to the decreased demand in agricultural limestone sales on a local basis, agricultural lime demands fell drastically in the mid 1980’s when CRP came into play and many acres were taken out of production.  This led to expansion into different markets of limestone sales.  Richard Kelly had the insight to build a pelletizing plant to produce a number of different calcium related products.  This project was expensive, time consuming and not profitable at the time.  It did pay off over time and has allowed Kelly’s to develop business nationally and internationally.
On December 31, 2002, Douglas Kelly and Theresa Kelly purchased the assets of Kelly Lime & Rock Co., Inc. and formed Kelly Limestone LLC, which has carried on the tradition of producing quality calcium products.  Doug & Traci Kelly are both graduates from the University of Missouri- Columbia with Bachelor degrees.
Spending almost 20 years on the road with the business, Doug has had the opportunity to expand the product line and work with many professional blenders, manufacturers, distributors and end users.  With the insight of knowledge obtained from the market, Kelly’s have had the opportunity to produce a number of different calcium related products.
In early 2011, Kelly Limestone LLC will have completed a plant expansion to improve quality and flexibility of manufacturing in order to be able to custom pelletize other products for other manufacturers and blenders.
In the past 20 years of servicing the pelletized business, Kelly’s is honored to have had the opportunity to work with many superintendents, growers, farmers and horticulturalists and developing programs to meet their calcium requirements.  Kelly’s are proud of the many business relationships it has built over the years and looks forward to the future.

Woman Spends 3 Weeks In Intensive Care After Eating Gas Station Nacho Cheese
5 cases of botulism have been connected to the same gas station..






By David Moye


















1.7k


























A woman in Walnut Grove, California, has spent the last three weeks in intensive care after eating nacho cheese from a gas station.
Lavinia Kelly was driving home from work on April 21 when she stopped at Valley Oak Food and Fuel gas station for a snack.
After purchasing a bag of Doritos, she drizzled them with nacho cheese sauce that was available for customers.
The next day, the mother-of-three went to a local hospital to be treated for double vision, according to the Sacramento Bee. 
Though she was sent home, a few hours later, Kelly was having breathing problems and was vomiting.
Since then, she has been hospitalized and spent her 33rd birthday on Wednesday in intensive care being treated for botulism, a rare paralytic illness. Botulism is caused by a nerve toxin produced by bacteria. Foodborne botulism typically comes from eating improperly canned or preserved foods, according to the CDC.
Symptoms include drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth and muscle weakness. The illness can be fatal and is considered a medical emergency.

Kelly’s sister, Theresa Kelly, said the battle to recover has been an ordeal for the whole family.
“I’ve never seen my sister, um, not have function of her body or be able to communicate. And I’ve never seen my sister on tubes or anything like that,” she told Fox40.com.
Kelly is one of at least five people who have reportedly been hospitalized for botulism after eating food purchased at the gas station, according to the Sacramento County Health and Human Services Dept.
Officials halted food sales at the business on May 5, according to a press release.
Health officials are investigating three other probable cases and one suspected case, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Although Kelly is spending her third week in the hospital, her family is hopeful she will recover.
“We just don’t know how long or how much effort and, and we’ve got somebody here every single morning, every single day,” Theresa Kelly told Fox40. “She’s not left, not one minute. We want to make sure that she can communicate as much as possible.” 
On Tuesday, Kelly’s family filed a lawsuit against the gas station in Sacramento County Superior Court on Tuesday alleging negligence, product liability and breach of implied warranty, according to the Sacrament Bee.
Calls made Thursday to Valley Oak Fuel and Food by HuffPost were not returned.
