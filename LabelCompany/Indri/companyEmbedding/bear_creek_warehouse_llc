Client Testimonials




We send Bear Creek Smokehouse products to our friends and customers.  Some of them are on the program to receive something each month.  They all absolutely love receiving these items.  We even have some of them that have called our office numerous times to say thank you and express how much they like the Bear Creek items. We even have a monthly item delivered to our own office to enjoy ourselves!

Lisa Halley



We have used Bear Creek Gift Baskets at Christmas for years for clients and friends.

We always get great feedback  and they look forward to getting them every year.

We will be ordering them again this year for them and for ourselves as well.

Sam Baxter



For over 25 years, I have been a regular customer and I enjoy the product and the customer service.




Dr. George Bouldien     Germantown, Tennessee



I would like to take this opportunity to commend Bear Creek Smokehouse for providing me with the highest quality of product and customer service for over five years.

My relationship with Bear Creek began with a compulsive personal purchase.  I so enjoyed my purchase I decided to start ordering gifts for other people.  I now depend on this company as my go-to source for all my gift-giving needs.  I have shipped numerous gift packs of your products literally all over the United States.  They have all been met with great appreciation.

Most of these people have also referred your company to their family and friends.

You offer an outstanding product.  Combine that with your outstanding service, and you have an outstanding company.


Keep up the good work

Connie Person



We have loved sending Bear Creek products as gifts during the holidays. Our friends and family love receiving them so much that they have said “we can’t wait till Christmas, we have to order some for ourselves.”

David & Ann Russell Arlington TX



I have used Bear Creek to provide Holiday gifts to my best clients-normally using the 4 lb. smoked briskets for the past 15 years.  Without fail, these are delivered promptly, or whenever I request, and my client response has been 100% positive!   They love the packaging, where the brisket comes in 2 packs, allowing them to freeze one without having to repackage themselves.   Many clients have scheduled family dinners, knowing the brisket was coming, and that the main entrée would WOW their guests.  The client service at Bear Creek is always patient and friendly, and I highly recommend them if you are looking to provide an unusual gift for family or clients….one that will put you on the top of their “highly regarded” list!

Specialty Brands of America, Inc. [SBA] was established in 1992 to build a leading branded specialty foods company through acquisitions and internal growth.
In 1993, the company purchased Original Trenton Crackers [OTC®], a 150-year old line of distinctive oyster and wine crackers famous in the Philadelphia area, and Dixie Fry®, a brand of chicken and fish coating mix widely distributed in California.
In February 1995, SBA expanded its brand portfolio with the acquisition of New York Flatbreads®, a unique and delicious crispbread distributed nationwide in retail stores and upscale restaurants.
In December 1996, the Company entered the syrup category by acquiring from Borden, Inc. Carys® Sugar Free Syrup, and Carys® and MacDonalds® pure maple syrup.
In December 1999, SBA acquired Spring Tree® Corporation, the leading pure maple syrup company in the world. SBA syrups can be found in the U.S. in just about every food store and in most foodservice distributors. In both the pure maple and sugar free syrup segments SBA outsells its nearest competitors by over 3 to 1.
In May 2005, SBA acquired Bear Creek® Country Kitchens, makers of the fast growing and leading brand of hearty dry soups.
Collectively, the SBA brands have over 400 years of history.
SBAs retail division is located in Westbury, NY. SBAs Export and Industrial Division, Spring Tree Maple Products, is in Brattleboro, Vt.

Dining Room Supplies
Make your dining room perfect with our huge selection of tabletop and buffet items



        Dining room supplies have been part of the foodservicedirect product offering for over 15 years. We have cultivated great relationships with premier manufacturers such as Oneida and Libbey glassware. Our goal is to give the independent operator the largest possible selection of name brand items at amazingly competitive prices. Many food service suppliers offered dining room supplies only as an add-on, however, at foodservicedirect, we stock many thousands of these items and they have always been at the core of our offering.

Bar Supplies
All of the tools and supplies that professional bartenders need



        Bar supplies are an important part of our product offering at foodservicedirect. Finding quality products in this segment can be tricky, as many manufacturers of bar supplies are smaller and do not produce other food service items. For almost 20 years we have worked to fine tune our bar supply offering, we hope you'll enjoy our broad selection and competitive prices.
