Cornerstone Investment Advisors, Inc. is a Wealth Management company 
		helping clients manage all aspects of their personal investments and 
		finances.  We serve as your liaison to all issues relating to your 
		financial 
		well being.  We are here to help simplify your financial 
		picture, and save you time and money in dealing with your financial 
		affairs.  Cornerstone has been in business since 1994. 
		
One of our primary roles is managing investment portfolios on a 
		discretionary basis for investors in need of professional portfolio 
		management.  We cater to those investors who don't want the 
		responsibility of managing their own investment portfolios.  And 
		because each of our clients has different risk tolerances and 
		expectations, we customize each portfolio to match individual needs and 
		circumstances.  We manage investment portfolios for Individuals and 
		Businesses. We manage Taxable Investment 
		Accounts, Retirement Accounts and Company Retirement Plans.  
In addition to managing your investments, we use our "Wealth 
		Analyzer" on a regular basis to help identify any areas of your 
		financial picture that require further attention.  The "Wealth 
		Analyzer" is an in depth questionnaire that covers all aspects of your 
		financial affairs.  And since financial pictures can often change, 
		we meet with our clients on a regular basis to review any changes to 
		their "Wealth Analyzer".  Based on our findings, we may call in 
		other experts to help deal with any important issues which need to be 
		addressed.  We will also work with any preferred professionals that 
		you currently have good relationships with.  
We work strictly on an asset based fee, which is determined on the 
		value of your entire investment portfolio.  We don't get paid 
		commissions based on transactions.  Nor do we accept any kickbacks 
		from other professionals that we may refer clients to.  This 
		eliminates any conflicts of interest, and puts 
		us on the same side of the table with our clients.  Too many 
		investors allow commission sales reps to manage their investment 
		affairs.  This can be hazardous to your financial well being.  
		And we aim to eliminate that disadvantage for all our clients!
