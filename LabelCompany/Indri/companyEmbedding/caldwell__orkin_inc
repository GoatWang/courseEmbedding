	Pest Control - Ants







































 




For your convenience and immediate attention, call  
pc














Ants Are No Picnic
They may be small, but they can cause big problems. Ants enter your home through the tiniest cracks. While doing so, they leave behind a scent so others of their like can follow the trail to food.
Most do-it-yourself approaches only kill the ants you see. To be truly effective, a treatment must penetrate and destroy the unseen nest, which could be in your walls or foundation. It's the only way to help prevent ants from returning.
The Advantage Over Ants
Pest control from Orkin can help you with not only the treatment of pests - but also help prevent unwanted pest presence later.

More than 100 years of pest control experience
Extensive training in all areas of pest control

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Coach (NYSE:COH) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 6 Hold Ratings, 21 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.71)Consensus Price Target: $48.42 (1.10% upside)

	Pest Control - Ants







































 




For your convenience and immediate attention, call  
pc














Ants Are No Picnic
They may be small, but they can cause big problems. Ants enter your home through the tiniest cracks. While doing so, they leave behind a scent so others of their like can follow the trail to food.
Most do-it-yourself approaches only kill the ants you see. To be truly effective, a treatment must penetrate and destroy the unseen nest, which could be in your walls or foundation. It's the only way to help prevent ants from returning.
The Advantage Over Ants
Pest control from Orkin can help you with not only the treatment of pests - but also help prevent unwanted pest presence later.

More than 100 years of pest control experience
