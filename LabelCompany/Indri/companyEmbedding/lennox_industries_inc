Our system is backed by a quality screening process, and will only recommend the best contractors at the best prices. Heating & Cooling Contractors Furnace repair is a nuisance, and it always seems to occur in the middle of a bitterly cold winter. So you can't let furnace repair go for very long without fixing it, unless you like runny noses and hacking coughs. Except heating systems can be an easier fix than you may at first imagine. Sometimes a circuit breaker has simply tripped or a fuse has blown. If this is not the case though, you may have a blown pilot light. Though the fix may still be simple, it would be a good idea to hire a trained professional in furnace repair to address major problems in order to be safe rather than sorry. Need a new heating product for your home? Find price comparisons from various stores selling Heaters, Water Heaters and Space Heaters. HVAC Can Raise Your Comfort Level They may not be glamorous, but there's little doubt that the components that make up the HVAC system (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) are some of the most critical features of your home. Installed and maintained properly, these systems have a major impact on your comfort and health. When considering a new home or renovation of an old one, it's worth taking the time and investing the money to select the right systems to guarantee a long, comfortable life span for you and your home in . Our contractors can help you decide which HVAC system and brand is right for you: Trane, Carrier, Goodman, Amana, or Bryant. When you sit down with your contractor, be sure to consider the environment into which the HVAC system will be placed.

Lennox Introduces Versatile iComfort E30 Smart Thermostat
Jul 13 17
Lennox Industries introduced the Lennox iComfort E30 smart thermostat, which brings versatility and flexibility to home comfort. Building off the innovative and personalized home comfort features most desired by homeowners, the iComfort E30 helps homeowners create their ideal living environment, all while saving energy. At the same time, the iComfort E30 gives homeowners peace of mind, and alerts them to a problem before it happens. The Lennox iComfort E30 works with Amazon Alexa smart home devices, which means that homeowners can take advantage of voice controls to operate their thermostat. The iComfort E30 Smart Thermostat also is compatible with any brand of HVAC system, as well as with the Lennox iHarmony Zoning System, which gives homeowners the ability to achieve optimum levels of comfort in up to four zones within a home, saving energy and money by not having to heat or cool unused areas of the home. The iComfort E30's "Perfect Temp" feature, similar to the climate control setting in cars, lets homeowners set the ideal temperature, with the home automatically adjusting heating and cooling to maintain the specified setting. Combined with the Feels Like™ Temperature feature, which takes into account indoor and outdoor temperature and humidity to make a home feel exactly like the homeowner wants it to, homeowners can precisely choose their preferred home comfort setting. Energy Savings: Using the GPS on smartphone, the iComfort E30's Smart Away™ Mode can detect when the family is away and automatically set the thermostat to an energy-saving mode and return the home to the desired temperature when a family member starts returning home – adjusting to a household's unique schedules. Combined with Schedule IQ Technology™ the iComfort E30 optimizes smart energy use based on the homeowner's routine. The first-of-its-kind Allergen Defender is a key feature of the iComfort E30, and can result in better indoor air quality by monitoring air quality and pollen levels outside. When high levels of pollutants and allergens are detected, the fan automatically turns on to keep the home's air cleaner. Key Features and Benefits: Alexa-enabled to work with the full array of Amazon smart home devices, Scheduling capabilities to reduce energy use when away, Pollen monitoring based on zip code to improve air quality, Custom ideal temperature settings, Homeowners with multiple systems or zones can view and control from one thermostat and 7" HD color touchscreen with screen savers that mimic current weather conditions.

Comfort: The iComfort S30's "Feels Like™" Temperature, similar to a weather report, takes into account indoor and outdoor temperature and humidity to make a home feel exactly like the homeowner wants it to. For example, when the thermostat is set to 72 degrees, a home will "Feel Like" 72 degrees year-round. Healthy Air: The first-of-its-kind Allergen Defender on the iComfort S30 gives immediate allergy relief by monitoring air quality and pollen levels outside.

Our system is backed by a quality screening process, and will only recommend the best contractors at the best prices. Heating & Cooling Contractors Furnace repair is a nuisance, and it always seems to occur in the middle of a bitterly cold winter. So you can't let furnace repair go for very long without fixing it, unless you like runny noses and hacking coughs. Except heating systems can be an easier fix than you may at first imagine. Sometimes a circuit breaker has simply tripped or a fuse has blown. If this is not the case though, you may have a blown pilot light. Though the fix may still be simple, it would be a good idea to hire a trained professional in furnace repair to address major problems in order to be safe rather than sorry. Need a new heating product for your home? Find price comparisons from various stores selling Heaters, Water Heaters and Space Heaters. HVAC Can Raise Your Comfort Level They may not be glamorous, but there's little doubt that the components that make up the HVAC system (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) are some of the most critical features of your home. Installed and maintained properly, these systems have a major impact on your comfort and health. When considering a new home or renovation of an old one, it's worth taking the time and investing the money to select the right systems to guarantee a long, comfortable life span for you and your home in . Our contractors can help you decide which HVAC system and brand is right for you: Trane, Carrier, Goodman, Amana, or Bryant. When you sit down with your contractor, be sure to consider the environment into which the HVAC system will be placed.
