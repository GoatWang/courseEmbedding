	EXPLANATORY NOTE




	This quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 is being filed concurrently with the quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q
	for the quarters ended June 30 and September 31, 2015. The Company previously filed on October 3, 2016 its annual report for the 2015 fiscal
	year to which these quarterly reports belong, which ended December 31, 2015. This quarterly report and those filed concurrently should be
	read in conjunction with our 2015 annual report on Form 10-K.




	Because the Company is concurrently filing all three quarterly reports for fiscal year 2015, each such quarterly report contains an identical
	exhibit list, which is current as of the date of filing the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the period ending December 31, 2015
	rather than the reporting period for each such report.

	NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED
	FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

	(UNAUDITED)






	NOTE 1  BASIS OF
	PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES







	Basis of
	Presentation










	The accompanying unaudited
	interim consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared
	in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
	of America (GAAP) and with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities
	and Exchange Commission (SEC) applicable to Form 10-Q including Article 8 of
	Regulation S-X. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should
	be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company for the year
	ended December 31, 2014 and notes thereto contained in the information as part
	of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on September 1,
	2016. Notes to the consolidated financial statements which would substantially
	duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited financial statements for
	fiscal 2015, as reported on the
	Form 10-K filed with
	the SEC on October 3, 2016, have been omitted. In the opinion of
	management, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements furnished
	reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) which are
	necessary to present fairly the financial position and the results of operations
	for the interim periods presented herein. Unaudited interim results are not
	necessarily indicative of the results for the full year.






	Oil and Gas
	Properties








	The Company owns royalty
	interests and one working interest. The Company capitalizes asset acquisition
	costs. Unproved oil and gas properties are periodically assessed to determine
	whether they have been impaired, and any impairment in value is charged to
	expense. The costs of properties, which are determined to be productive, are
	transferred to prove oil and gas properties and amortized on an equivalent
	unit-of-production basis.




	During the three months
	ended March 31, 2015, the Company recognized no impairment of its oil and gas
	properties.





	NOTE 2  RELATED PARTY
	TRANSACTIONS







	Related Party
	Receivable






	In connection with the
	acquisition of the Holms Property, the Company granted to Holms Energy LLC.,
	which is owned by a former officer of the Company, a five percent (5%)
	overriding royalty on all revenue generated from the Holms Property for ten
	years from the date of the acquisition closing. As of March 31, 2015, and
	December 31, 2014, the royalty receivable was $101,786


	and
	$138,846, respectively. The related party receivable resulted from royalties
	that had been overpaid during 2014.






	Related Party
	Payable






	Through December 31, 2014,
	the Company collected royalty payments for certain wells on behalf of Holms
	Energy Development Corporation, which is controlled by Companys former Chief
	Executive Officer (CEO). This occurred because one of the Companys operators,
	Oasis Petroleum, did not recognize Holms Energy Development Corporations
	ownership of minerals below the Bakken Formation. This situation was corrected
	beginning January 1, 2015. Therefore, the Company will no longer serve as a
	payment conduit for Holms Energy Development Corporation. The Company did not
	generate any revenue associated with these royalty payments and the cash
	payments were remitted directly to Holms Energy Development Corporation by the
	Company. The related party payable balance was $104,493.






	Big Willow
	Lease






	On July 9, 2014, the
	Company entered into an oil and gas lease with Big Willow Properties, LLP (the
	Big Willow Lease). At present, the Big Willow Lease contemplates that the property will
	be eventually operated by Holms Energy Development Corporation, an entity that
	is controlled by the Companys former CEO. Terms of such arrangements between
	the Company and Holms Energy Development Corporation have not yet been
	considered and approved by the disinterested members of the Companys Board of
	Directors. See Note 6 below for additional information relating to the Big Willow Lease.





	NOTE 3  SALE OF PROVED
	MINERAL RIGHTS





	On February 4, 2014, the
	Company sold a portion of its producing proved mineral rights for an aggregate
	cash sales price of $7,847,417 and a 2% retained royalty on proceeds derived
	from such sold mineral assets. The net book value of the asset on the date of
	the sale was $675,266 resulting in a gain on the sale of proven mineral rights
	of $7,172,151 for the three months ended March 31, 2014. Ten percent (10%) of
	the total cash purchase price was escrowed with a third-party financial
	institution for approximately 90 days following the closing of this transaction.






	6









	The property sold consists
	of the 767+/- net mineral acres acquired by the Company as part of the Companys
	acquisition of the former Greenfield mineral interests in 2010. The Greenfield
	mineral interests derive from substantially the same gross mineral acreage as
	those originally contributed to the Company in 2010. During 2013, thirty-six percent
	(36%) of total revenue was generated from the property that was sold.




	The mineral rights sale
	reduces current year and future revenue from North Dakota production. It also
	impacts comparable financial statements since one-third of the Companys mineral
	rights are no longer producing revenue, thus making historical comparisons
	difficult. It does, however, create considerable cash reserves that can be used
	to secure additional mineral to generate rights driving future revenue.





	NOTE 4  STOCKHOLDERS
	EQUITY





	During the three months
	ended March 31, 2015, aggregate options expense of $0 has been recognized
	related to common stock options granted during 2012. As of March 31, 2015, all
	options granted have been fully expensed and all warrants issued have expired.





	NOTE 5  INCOME TAXES





	During the three months
	ended March 31, 2015, aggregate income tax benefit totaled $22,844. Income tax
	payable totaled $1,059,062 reflecting the income tax burden for 2014 arising
	from capital gains tax on the mineral acreage sale.




	During the three months
	ended March 31, 2015, the Company made income tax payments totaling $0 in
	addition to income tax withholding on royalty payments totaling $17,499. The
	current income tax payable as of March 31, 2015 was $0 and North Dakota income
	tax withheld totals $17,499.







	NOTE 6  SUBSEQUENT
	EVENT






	Val Holms
	Termination



	: The Companys
	founder and CEO, Val M. Holms, was terminated in May 2016 on the basis of fraud
	and other allegations levied against him.





	Eagle Private Equity
	Transaction



	: In May 2016, the
	Company entered into a financing agreement with Eagle Private Equity (Eagle).
	The Eagle transaction provides a non-revolving line of credit not to exceed
	$1,000,000 and intended for the acquisition of non-working interest assets. The
	Convertible Loan Credit Agreement is convertible into Series A preferred stock.
	Series A preferred stock generally holds common stock voting rights equivalent
	to 100 shares of common stock for each share of series A preferred stock.






	The agreement includes
	conversion rights if certain triggering events occurred. On July 20, 2016, a
	triggering event occurred, which granted Eagle the right to put loans to the
	Company and convert debt ($600,000) into equity (600,000 preferred shares)
	having the voting equivalent of 60 million shares of the Companys common stock.







	Big Willow Lease
	Expiration



	: On July 9, 2014,Val
	Holms entered into a two year lease agreement on 28,000 gross acres
	approximately 9,300 net mineral acres) in southwest Idaho. The agreement,
	referred to as the Big Willow lease, included a two year primary term with the
	option to extend for an additional term. On July 9, 2016 the lease expired. As
	of December 31, 2015, the Company has invested more than $751,000 on lease bonus
	payments, title work, and other development related costs. These costs have been
	written off on July 9, 2016.







	Attempted
	Takeover



	: On July 20, 2016, Val
	Holms half-brother, Allan Holms, attempted a takeover of the Company. Allan
	Holms and an armed security force attempted to remove the existing Board of
	Directors, remove current management, remove all counsel and suspend litigation,
	and take control of the Companys cash assets. Allan Holms purported to hold
	proxies from Val Holms and other shareholders representing a majority of the
	Companys common stock. Law enforcement agencies intervened and ended the
	takeover. The Company has filed for and received temporary restraining orders in
	Montana and Nevada enjoining Allan Holms from taking such takeover actions,
	pending preliminary hearings. A hearing in Montana has taken place and is
	pending a decision. Hearings in Nevada are scheduled to be heard in late October
	2016. The Company believes such proxies were improperly and illegally obtained
	and that Allan Holms actions on July 20 are invalid and without merit.







	Roil Lawsuit
	Appeal



	: In August 2016, the
	Washington State Appellate Court ruled to affirm the lower courts ruling that
	Allan Holms and Roil Energy, LLC did not have any claims to the Companys assets
	and also to overturn the lower courts ruling that found certain fraud and
	awarded Allan Holms certain attorneys fees. The Company had posted a $462,485
	appeal bond as part of the appeal process. The plaintiffs are petitioning the
	Washington State Supreme Court. When all legal remedies have been exhausted, the
	Company will recognize the appeal bond refund as a receivable on the balance
	sheet.

	NOTE 7  COMMITMENTS AND
	CONTINGENCIES









	Office Lease
	Commitment












	On December 1, 2010, BRI
	entered into a one-year office lease, renewable for up to five years, for a
	2,175 square foot executive office at 1425 Birch Ave., Suite A, Helena, MT
	59601, for a monthly charge of $1,600 for the first year; $1,800 second year;
	$2,000 third year; $2,200 fourth year; and $2,400 fifth year. BRI has leased an
	additional room at $100 per month. Therefore, total rent is $2,500 per month.








	Litigation












	On April 2, 2012, BRI was
	served with a summons relating to a complaint filed by Allan Holms, both
	individually and derivatively through Roil Energy, LLC. Allan Holms is the
	half-brother of BRIs CEO, Val Holms. The Complaint (filed in the Superior Court
	of the State of Washington located in Spokane County) names, among others,
	Joseph Edington, Val and Mari Holms, Holms Energy, LLC and BRI as defendants.
	The Complaint primarily alleges breach of contract, tortious interference with
	prospective business opportunity and fraud. The complaint focuses on events
	allegedly occurring around February and March 2010 whereby Allan Holms alleged
	an oral agreement took place whereby he was to receive up to 40% of the
	originally issued equity of Roil Energy, LLC. Allan Holms alleges Roil Energy
	was originally intended to be the predecessor entity to BRI. After various court
	proceedings, the Washington Court of Appeals affirmed a trial courts ruling
	against the plaintiff and reversed the trial courts ruling against certain of
	the defendants. The Company believes the possibility of any future economic
	damages to BRI to be unlikely. When the Company filed the appeal with the
	Washington Court of appeals, the Company was required to post a bond of
	$462,485. Upon the successful appeal, the bond will be returned to the Company.






	On June 6, 2012, the
	Company filed a Temporary Restraining Order (the TRO) and Verified Complaint
	for Injunctive Relief against McKinley Romero, Peter Swan Investment Consulting
	Ltd and IWJ Consulting Group, LLC (collectively, the Defendants), in
	connection with the Defendants request to the transfer agent to remove
	restrictive legends from an aggregate of 4.7 million shares, which the Company
	believes were improperly obtained by the Defendants. The Company obtained the
	TRO from the Second Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada, County of
	Washoe on June 6, 2012 enjoining the Defendants from seeking removal of the
	restrictive legends. On a scheduled hearing on June 26, 2012 the judge in this
	matter ruled in favor of the Companys motion for a preliminary injunction. The
	order granting such preliminary injunction was issued from this court on August
	14, 2012. This matter is pending the Companys motion for final judgment in
	favor of the Company.






	In March 2013, the Company
	received notice of a complaint titled Gillis v. Bakken Resources, Inc., Case No.
	A-13-675280-B, filed in the District Court of the State of Nevada for Clark
	County. Mr. Gillis, the plaintiff in this matter (the Gillis Case), is the
	trustee of the Bruce and Marilyn Gillis 1987 Trust. Mr. Gillis is alleging that
	the Company breached certain registration rights obligations pursuant to an
	equity investment made at or around November 2010. The Court in this this matter
	granted class certification and class notice in March 2014. The Company settled
	this matter in September 2014 for $200,000. This expenditure has been identified
	on this income statement as Settlement Expense.






	In March 2014, the Company
	received notice of a complaint titled Manuel Graiwer and TJ Jesky v. Val Holms,
	Herman Landeis, Karen Midtlyng, David Deffinbaugh, Bill Baber, W. Edward
	Nichols, and Wesley Paul, Case No. CV14 00544 (the Graiwer Case), filed in the
	Second Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada for Washoe County. Messrs.
	Graiwer and Jesky, the plaintiffs in the Graiwer Case, bring action on behalf of
	the Company derivatively, and the Company is also named as a nominal defendant.
	Messrs. Graiwer and Jesky are shareholders of the company and allege breach of
	fiduciary duty, gross negligence, corporate waste, unjust enrichment, and civil
	conspiracy against one or more of the named defendants. The Company is also
	informed that each of the other named defendants denies the validity of the
	claims made in the Graiwer case, and each intends to vigorously defend against
	such claims, as applicable. The plaintiff in the Graiwer Case have agree to
	dismiss all claims against all defendants except Val M. Holms, and such
	dismissal is pending approval by the Court.






	The Bakken Resources Inc.
	bylaws state that the Company will indemnify officers and directors for actual
	and reasonable amounts incurred while acting as an agent of the corporation. Val
	Holms attorneys have submitted invoices to Bakken through December 31, 2015 for
	direct payment totaling more than $282,000. These services include the Graiwer
	lawsuit and investigation related defense costs, as well as a litany of other
	services that dont pertain to any litigation. The Company has reviewed all submitted charges.
	The Company paid all billings that appear to be indemnifiable under the
	Companys bylaws and Val Holms Leave of Absence Agreement. Consequently,
	$169,000 in services billed have not been reimbursed nor accrued as legal fees
	expense.

	The nature of these
	commitments and contingencies is such that management cannot accurately
	determine what impact, if any, they may have on results of operation, cash
	flows, and financial statements. Management believes, however, it is unlikely
	that any adverse impact will occur from these commitments and contingencies.

	MANAGEMENTS
	DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS









	This discussion and
	analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in
	conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included in this
	quarterly report on Form 10-Q (the Quarterly Report) and the audited financial
	statements and notes thereto included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the
	year ended December 31, 2014 (the 2014 Annual Report), as filed with the
	SEC on October 3, 2016. In addition to historical
	information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements
	that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may
	differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as
	a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those identified in
	the 2014 Annual Report in the section entitled Risk Factors.







	Overview






	Bakken Resources, Inc. (the
	Company, BRI, we, us, or our) is an independent energy company focused
	on holding



	non-working
	interests



	in oil and natural gas
	properties throughout North America. Bakkens primary focus since inception has
	been the Williston Basin in western North Dakota. The Company owns mineral
	rights to approximately 7,200 gross acres and 1,600 net mineral acres of land
	located about 8 miles southeast of Williston, North Dakota. The Companys land
	assets consist generally of net mineral acres spanning from the sub-surface to
	the base of the so-called rock unit in an area commonly referred to as the
	Bakken Formation.




	A non-working interest
	simply means that the Company doesnt bear either the risk or the financial
	burden attributable to exploration and production of oil and natural gas wells.
	The Company simply invests in successful wells or projects that have
	demonstrated a high degree of success. The Company partners with strong
	operators to explore and develop oil and natural gas from company leases.




	During the first quarter of
	2015, the Company received royalty and overriding royalty payments on
	seventy-five (75) producing oil wells seventy-two (72) of which also produce
	natural gas. This production and proved reserves are as follows:

	Bbls =
	Barrels   MCF = thousand cubic
	feet








	The leases comprising the
	Companys mineral rights average 17%. When the mineral rights were transferred
	from Holms Energy LLC., Holms Energy LLC. retained a 5% overriding royalty.
	Therefore, these mineral rights currently bear to us an average 12% royalty (17%
	less 5%) from the oil and gas produced on such lands until November 2020. At
	that time the 5% overriding royalty currently held by Holms Energy, LLC, a
	related private Nevada company (Holms Energy) will revert back to the Company.
	The Companys average net royalty interest is further reduced by the approved
	North Dakota Industrial Commission (NDIC) well spacing units attributable to
	each of the sixteen spacing units. The net average royalty percentage in 2015
	was .70%.




	We currently have leases
	with three contracted oil drilling operators on various parcels of land
	constituting the 7,200 gross acres (and approximately 1,600 net mineral acres)
	on which we have mineral rights royalty interests. The contracted oil drilling
	companies with whom we are parties in interest pursuant to lease agreements
	(collectively, the Lessees) that we acquired rights to in November 2010
	include: (1) Oasis Petroleum, (2) Continental Resources, Inc., and (3) Statoil
	ASA. We have no rights or ability to influence the activities conducted by these
	Lessees of our mineral rights, but if the Lessees do not accomplish the agreed
	upon drilling programs within the timeline, Lessees can lose their leases.




	The predecessor to our
	company was incorporated on June 6, 2008, under the laws of the state of Nevada,
	under the name Multisys Language Solutions, Inc. (MLS). Holms Energy
	contributed the primary assets that formed the basis of our current business
	operations. In connection with the closing of the transactions resulting in the
	contribution of the mineral rights held by Holms Energy in November 2010, Holms
	Energy received forty million (40,000,000) shares of common stock of the
	Company. Holms Energy retained a 5% overriding royalty on all gross revenue
	generated from the Company's gas and oil production royalty revenues.






	9









	Also in connection with the
	November 2010 transactions, the Company purchased approximately 800 net mineral
	acres from the Revocable Living Trust of Rocky G. Greenfield and Evenette G.
	Greenfield. The Company sold these 800 net mineral acres to a third party in
	February of 2014. The Company retained a two percent (2%) overriding royalty on
	the sale of these mineral rights.




	The mineral rights received
	by the Company from the contribution by Holms Energy in connection with the
	November 2010 transactions included mineral rights from the surface to the base
	of the Bakken formation. The mineral rights received by the Company from the
	Greenfields include all mineral rights from the surface to the basement.




	After closing the Asset
	Purchase Agreement with Holms Energy on December 10, 2010, MLS changed its name
	to Bakken Resources, Inc. These transactions and the resulting change of control
	are described below under Acquisition of Assets.





	Description of Oil
	Leases and Oil Production





	BRI currently derives its
	primary source of revenue from royalties generated from leasing its mineral
	acreage. BRIs mineral acreage consists of approximately 1,600 net mineral acres
	located primarily in McKenzie County, North Dakota. Such 1,600 net mineral acres
	are currently spread across 17 spacing units. Operators covering BRIs minerals
	have been approved for up to 15 wells per spacing unit (typically 1,280 acres),
	but generally petition for permits prior to the commencement of drilling in a
	particular spacing unit. If this holds for all spacing units under which BRI has
	mineral acres, BRI would have a royalty interest in up to 187 wells. Note,
	however, that the royalties due to BRI under any particular well vary based on
	the number of acres BRI has under any particular spacing unit with a producing
	well.




	With respect to drilling
	operations, pursuant to the North Dakota Oil and Gas Commission, long lateral
	deep horizontal multi-stage fracking wells in the Bakken Formation must be
	permitted in spacing unit of not less than 640 acres, up to 2,900 acres, with
	some exceptions. The spacing units have to be approved and permitted in advance
	of drilling by the North Dakota Oil and Gas Commission. Recently, the North
	Dakota Industrial Commission (NDIC) has approved multi-well permits for wells
	drilled in the Three Forks formation along several of the defined benches
	typically associated with separate geologic benchmarks contained in the Three
	Forks formation. Since approximately one-third of the Companys current net
	mineral acres include acreage in the Three Forks formation, any increase in the
	drilling operations on the Companys net mineral acres which include permitted
	for Three Forks wells may result an increased number of total wells from which
	the Company may derive royalty income.




	When a horizontal well is
	drilled in the area where the subject property is located, it is typically
	drilled down about 10,800 vertical feet and then a down-hole directional
	drilling tool is used to flatten the hole to 90 degrees and drill horizontally
	down the oil and gas producing formation. Horizontal directional drilling
	provides more contact area to the oil bearing formation than a typical vertical
	well. This method of drilling, together with fracking is referred to as an
	enhanced oil recovery method, and is the primary source of recovery from the
	Bakken Formation. The Company also has interests in certain wells not drilled
	into the Bakken Formation.




	Well activity information
	for wells in which the Company has mineral interests are compiled in a table
	which is available on the Company web site at
	http://www.bakkenresourcesinc.com/well-activity.




	The information provided in
	the websites table is categorized by well name, operator, field and pool, the
	NDIC identifying number, and the well status and location description. Well
	status is defined by several categories: Producing; Confidential; Drilling; and
	Permitted Location to Drill. The table is updated as new information becomes
	available on the NDIC website at https://www.dmr.nd.gov/oilgas/. Included in the
	table are NDIC file numbers which can be used to search for information for each
	well listed on the BRI webpage. Individuals may subscribe to the NDIC website
	following the prompts on the homepage. A premium service subscription is also
	available for a fee.




	Currently, most of the
	leases covering the Companys mineral acres contain what is commonly referred to
	as continuous drilling clauses. Generally, a continuous drilling clause
	requires an operator to maintain active drilling operations in order to hold or
	extend an oil and gas lease past the natural expiration date of the lease. All
	of the Companys current leases currently have active drilling operations and
	are likely to have active operations in the foreseeable future.






	Results of Operations







	Comparison of the Three
	Months Ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2014






	Revenue



	. We generated net revenue (gross revenue less
	production taxes and deductions) for the three months ended March 31, 2015
	totaling $222,625 compared to revenue of $337,252 for the three months March 31,
	2014. The decrease relative to 2014 reflects the sale of the Greenfield assets
	(33% of total mineral acres) and declining oil and natural gas unit prices
	(sixty percent 60%). Although unit prices are down relative to the first quarter
	2014, production is at record highs. First quarter oil production totaled
	1,090,654 barrels up 67% from 2014. Similarly, natural gas production totaled
	975,369 mcf up 52% from 2104. Throughout 2014, the Company saw many new wells
	initiate production. This trend continued into 2015. The producing well count at
	March 31, 2015, seventy four (74), increased by twenty four (24) wells compared
	to March 31, 2014. The company currently has seventy-four (74) producing wells,
	twenty-three (23) permitted wells, seven (7) wells in confidential status, and
	six (6) wells being drilled.






	10









	Revenue is driven by
	product unit prices and volume. Although the Company sold 33% of its mineral
	rights in 2014 and production unit prices have declined more than sixty (60%)
	since 2014 highs, new well production is sustaining revenue. As unit prices
	rebound, new production will continue to drive revenue and profitability. The
	State of North Dakota establishes spacing rules that dictate how many wells can
	be drilled and operated over a defined area (acres). Based upon current spacing
	units, the Company has current potential well capacity totaling one hundred
	ninety wells (190). Therefore, the company has capacity for an additional eighty
	(80). wells. These potential additional wells offer little risk since they will
	be drilled into known reserves where existing wells are already producing
	successfully. Therefore, current year and future revenue will likely continue to
	increase without a significant increase in operating expenses.





	Operating
	Expenses



	. Operating expenses fell
	sharply, by approximately $287,000, or forty seven percent (47%) from March 31,
	2015 compared to March 31, 2014, driven by substantially lower legal and
	professional fees $292,618. Several contracted
	positions have been consolidated into existing staff. Legal costs are also
	decreasing as a result of Director and Officers insurance reimbursement for
	costs relating to the derivative lawsuit, and as litigation has decreased.
	General and administrative expenses were $27,736 for the three months ended
	March 31, 2015 compared to $5,370 for the same period in 2014.




	The net loss for the first
	quarter 2015 totaled $77,957, down from income of $4,454,199 in the first
	quarter 2014. The first quarter 2014 results include the $7,172,151 gain on the
	sale of proved mineral rights.




	Our material financial
	obligations include our salaries paid to our only current employee, fees paid to outside consultants, public
	company reporting expenses, transfer agent fees, bank fees, and other recurring
	fees.






	Liquidity and Capital
	Resources






	As of March 31, 2015, the
	Company had cash of $6,578,500 compared to $6,334,092 as of December 31, 2014.
	As of March 31, 2015, the Company has expended $751,000 to acquire the Big
	Willow lease. The Company has $175,000 in remaining bonus payments on the Big
	Willow lease. The Company also expects that title work to determine the net
	mineral acres will total approximately $68,000. This work is slated to be
	completed by June 15, 2015.




	Operating costs consist mainly of salaries,
	office rent and professional fees and is consistent with general operating cash used in prior quarters. Net cash
	provided/(used) by operations for the period ended March 31, 2015 was $74,408 compared to $508,884 during the three months ended March 31, 2014. The sharp reduction reflects lower professional fees
	attributable to the number of lawsuits in which the Company is currently involved. The 2014 figures include extraordinary,
	one-time expenses attributable to the sale of mineral rights. As suits have been settled or dismissed, the Companys
	legal fees have fallen. It also reflects reimbursement for legal expenses from the Companys Director and Officer
	insurance policy. It also reflects the consolidation of two contractor positions totaling $8,000 per month into the
	Corporate Secretary and CFO positions. Given our recent rate of use of cash in our operations, we believe we have
	sufficient capital to carry on operations for the next year. Our long term capital requirements and the adequacy of our
	available funds will depend on many factors, including the reporting company costs, public relations fees, and operating
	expenses, among others.




	In the future, we
	anticipate we will be able to provide the necessary liquidity from royalty
	revenues related to sale of oil reserves of existing properties. No assurances,
	however, can be given that such royalties will continue to be received. As of
	March 31, 2015, the royalty revenues received have been sufficient to provide
	liquidity during the previous twelve months. If the Company does not generate
	sufficient revenues it will continue to finance operations through equity or
	debt financings.




	We will continue to
	evaluate additional properties containing mineral rights that we may seek to
	acquire. With respect to transactions involving the acquisition of additional
	mineral rights or other business collaboration transactions, we may seek to
	issue shares of our common stock or other equity to finance part or all such
	acquisitions or transactions. To the extent that such acquisitions or
	transactions require cash payments, such payments will likely have a material
	impact on our liquidity.




	Our proposed operations may
	require additional capital from outside sources. However, we may not be
	successful in obtaining cash from new or existing agreements, or in receiving
	royalty payments under our existing leases. In addition, we cannot be sure that
	additional financing will be available when needed or that, if available,
	financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or to our stockholders.
	Having insufficient funds may require us to delay, scale back, or eliminate some
	or all of our business development activities. Failure to obtain adequate
	financing also may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern.
	If we raise additional funds from the issuance of equity securities, substantial
	dilution to our existing stockholders would likely result. If we raise
	additional funds by incurring debt financing, the terms of the debt may involve
	significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial
	ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business.






	11











	Satisfaction of our
	cash obligations for the next twelve (12) months






	A critical component of our
	operating plan impacting our continued existence is the ability to obtain
	additional capital through additional equity or debt financing and JV drilling
	partnerships. In the event we cannot obtain the necessary capital to pursue our
	strategic plan, we may have to cease or significantly curtail our operations.
	This would materially impact our ability to continue operations. However, due to
	our low base overhead, we are not dependent on new capital if we do not wish to
	develop our drilling programs or buy up working interests in potential wells
	during the next twelve (12) months.








	Since inception, we have
	financed cash flow requirements through debt financing and issuance of common
	stock for cash and services. As we expand operational activities, we may
	continue to experience net negative cash flows from operations, pending receipt
	of sales or development fees, and will be required to obtain additional
	financing to fund operations through common stock offerings and debt borrowings
	to the extent necessary to provide working capital.




	Over the next twelve months
	we believe that existing capital and anticipated funds from operations will be
	sufficient to sustain current operations. We may seek additional capital in the
	future to fund growth and expansion through additional equity or debt financing
	or credit facilities. No assurance can be made that such financing would be
	available, and if available it may take either the form of debt or equity. In
	either case, the financing could have a negative impact on our financial
	condition and our Stockholders.




	We have information that an
	additional thirty six (36) wells are either permitted, drilling, or are in
	confidential status. Although we believe that our income from our wells will
	likely reduce or eliminate operating losses in the near future, we have no
	control over the timing of when we will receive such royalty payments. In
	addition, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing
	operational risks, and the failure to do so can have a material adverse effect
	on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.






	Off-Balance Sheet
	Arrangements






	We currently do not have
	any off-balance sheet arrangement that have or are reasonably likely to have a
	current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
	condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
	expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.






	Critical Accounting
	Policies, Estimates, and Judgments






	Our financial statements
	are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial
	statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
	amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and
	liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of
	revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We continually evaluate our
	estimates and judgments, the most critical of which are those related to revenue
	recognition, the timing of the royalty revenues, and income taxes. We base our
	estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that we
	believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Materially different results
	can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known.




	Besides the estimates
	identified above that are considered critical, we make many other accounting
	estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. All
	estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of assets,
	liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets
	and liabilities. These estimates and judgments are also based on historical
	experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the
	circumstances. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change
	and additional information becomes known, even for estimates and judgments that
	are not deemed critical.




	For further information,
	refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the
	Companys annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
	2014.








	Item 4. CONTROLS AND
	PROCEDURES





	Management is responsible
	for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
	reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined  in Rule
	13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
	amended  as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a companys
	principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by a companys
	board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable
	assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
	of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and that includes those policies and procedures:






	12











	●





	Pertaining to the
	maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
	reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;

	 







	●





	Providing reasonable
	assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
	preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
	are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
	directors of the company; and

	 







	●





	Providing reasonable
	assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
	acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a
	material effect on the financial statements.







	Our management, with the
	participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
	assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as
	of March 31, 2015.




	A material weakness is a
	deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial
	reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
	misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
	or detected on a timely basis.




	We identified material
	weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2015
	because certain elements of an effective control environment were not present as
	of March 31, 2015, including the financial reporting processes and procedures,
	and internal control procedures by our board of directors.




	Based on this assessment
	and the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that
	internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of March 31,
	2015. Following the resignation of our prior Chief Financial Officer, our new
	Chief Financial Officer has reviewed prior financial statements and has
	implemented expanded policies and procedures relating to our internal controls
	and procedures in order to help address existing material weaknesses.




	We intend to take the
	following steps as soon as practicable to remedy the material weaknesses we
	identified as follows:






	■





	We will segregate
	incompatible functions using existing personnel where possible or, given
	sufficient capital resources, we will hire additional personnel to perform
	those functions.

	 







	■





	We will appoint
	additional outside directors, particularly those who may have experience
	with regard to financial reporting, financial reporting processes and
	procedures, and internal control procedures.

	 







	■





	We will hire
	independent consultants when necessary to advise the Company and our Board
	on special financial matters as the need arises.








	Changes in Internal
	Control Over Financial Reporting





	As of the end of the period
	covered by this Report, there have been no changes in internal control over
	financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during
	the quarter ended March 31, 2015, that materially affected, or are reasonably
	likely to materially affect, our Companys internal control over financial
	reporting.









	PART II  OTHER
	INFORMATION








	Item 1. LEGAL
	PROCEEDINGS





	On April 2, 2012, BRI was
	served with a summons relating to a complaint filed by Allan Holms, both
	individually and derivatively through Roil Energy, LLC. Allan Holms is the
	half-brother of BRIs former CEO, Val Holms. The complaint (filed in the Superior Court
	of the State of Washington located in Spokane County) names, among others,
	Joseph Edington, Val and Mari Holms, Holms Energy, LLC and BRI as defendants.
	The Complaint primarily alleges breach of contract, tortious interference with
	prospective business opportunity and fraud. The complaint focuses on events
	allegedly occurring around February and March 2010 whereby Allan Holms alleged
	an oral agreement took place whereby he was to receive up to 40% of the
	originally issued equity of Roil Energy, LLC. Allan Holms alleges Roil Energy
	was originally intended to be the predecessor entity to BRI. Both Mr. Val Holms,
	our CEO, and BRI dispute such allegations in their entirety and intend to and
	have vigorously defended against such claims. This case went to trial in
	November 2013. Following trial, the Court issued conclusions that the evidence
	presented in this case did not support Allan Holms claims that an oral
	agreement existed. Post-trial motions are currently being heard in this case and
	final judgment is expected to be issued following the conclusion of such
	post-trial motions.

	On June 6, 2012, the
	Company filed a Temporary Restraining Order (the TRO Case) and Verified
	Complaint for Injunctive Relief against McKinley Romero, Peter Swan Investment
	Consulting Ltd., and IWJ Consulting Group, LLC (collectively, the IWJ
	Defendants), in connection with the IWJ Defendants request to the transfer
	agent to remove restrictive legends from an aggregate of 4.7 million shares,
	which the Company believes were improperly obtained by the IWJ Defendants. The
	Company obtained a temporary restraining order from the Second Judicial District
	Court of the State of Nevada, County of Washoe on June 6, 2012, enjoining the
	IWJ Defendants from seeking removal of the restrictive legends. The Company
	secured a judgment in its favor (and a permanent injunction) in June 2014 and is
	in the process of collecting its fees and costs from the defendants in the TRO
	Case.




	In March 2013, the Company
	received notice of a complaint titled Gillis v. Bakken Resources, Inc., Case No.
	A-13-675280-B, filed in the District Court of the State of Nevada for Clark
	County (the Gillis Case). Mr. Gillis, the plaintiff in the Gillis Case, is the
	trustee of the Bruce and Marilyn Gillis 1987 Trust. Mr. Gillis is alleging that
	Client breached certain registration rights obligations pursuant to an equity
	investment made at or around November 2010. The Company reached settlement in
	the Gillis Case for $200,000, and this matter has received final court approval.




	On or around July 18, 2013,
	BRI received notice of a complaint filed in McKenzie County, ND (Roil Energy v.
	Toll Reserve Consortium (ND Dist. Ct., Case No. 27-2013-CV-00124)) (the ND
	Case). The plaintiffs in the ND Case are the same as in the Allan Holms Case
	described above. The claims in the ND Case arise from the same facts alleged by
	the plaintiffs in the Washington case. The plaintiffs in the ND Case sought to,
	among other things, quiet title in mineral assets the plaintiffs claim were
	intended to be conveyed to Roil Energy. The ND Case was dismissed without
	prejudice, and a release from lis pendens relating to the ND Case was filed with
	McKenzie County on September 11, 2014.




	In March 2014, the Company
	received notice of a complaint titled Manuel Graiwer and TJ Jesky v. Val Holms,
	Herman Landeis, Karen Midtlyng, David Deffinbaugh, Bill Baber, W. Edward Nichols
	and Wesley Paul, Case No. CV14 00544, filed in the Second Judicial District
	Court of the State of Nevada for Washoe County. Mssrs. Graiwer and Jesky, the
	plaintiffs in this matter (the Graiwer Case), bring action on behalf of the
	Company derivatively, and the Company is also named as a nominal defendant.
	Mssrs. Graiwer and Jesky are shareholders of the Company and allege breach of
	fiduciary duty, gross negligence, corporate waste, unjust enrichment and civil
	conspiracy against one or more of the named defendants. The Company and is also
	informed that each of the other named defendants denies the validity of the
	claims made in the Graiwer Case and each intends to vigorously defend against
	such claims, as applicable. The plaintiffs in the Graiwer case have agreed to
	dismiss all claims against all defendants except Val Holms, and such dismissal
	is pending approval by the court.

	b)




	       




	Any fraud, whether or
	not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
