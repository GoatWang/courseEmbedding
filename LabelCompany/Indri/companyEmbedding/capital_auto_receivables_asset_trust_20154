original issuance, shall be issued in the form of Exhibit A

(b) At the election of the
Certificateholder, the Definitive Certificates issued pursuant to
Section 3.2(a) may be exchanged for Book-Entry
Certificates to be delivered to the Owner Trustee, as agent for the
Clearing Agency, by or on behalf of the Trust. The Book-Entry
Certificates shall be issued in an aggregate nominal principal
amount of $100,000 (which shall be deemed to be the equivalent of

nominal principal amount of all Certificates to exceed $100,000, or
100 units, without the prior written consent of all
Certificateholders. No distributions of moneys to the
Certificateholders under the Basic Documents shall be deemed to
reduce the nominal principal amount of any Certificate prior to
payment in full of all Notes; provided , however ,
that the final aggregate $100,000 distributed to the
Certificateholders under the Basic Documents upon final
distribution of the Trust Estate and termination of the Trust
pursuant to Section 7.1 shall be deemed to repay the
aggregate nominal principal amount of the Certificates in full;
provided , further , that any failure to pay in full
the nominal principal amount of a Certificate on such final
distribution date shall not result in any recourse to, claim
against or liability of any Person for such shortfall. Any amounts
payable to the Certificateholders on or in respect of the
Certificates under the Basic Documents shall be paid and allocated
to the various Certificateholders ratably based on their respective
Percentage Interests. The Book-Entry Certificates shall initially
be registered on the Certificate Register in the name of the
Certificate Depository (initially, Cede & Co.), and no
Certificate Owner shall receive a Definitive Certificate
representing such Certificate Owner’s interest in such
Book-Entry Certificate, except as provided in
Section 3.12 . Unless and until Definitive Certificates

Section 3.12 in exchange for the Book-Entry

Participants and receive and transmit payments due under the Basic
Documents with regard to the Certificates to such Clearing Agency
Participants;

(v) whenever this Agreement requires
or permits actions to be taken based upon instructions or
directions of Certificateholders evidencing a specified Percentage
Interest, the Clearing Agency shall deliver instructions to the
Owner Trustee only to the extent that it has received instructions
to such effect from Certificate Owners or Clearing Agency
Participants or Persons acting through Clearing Agency Participants
owning or representing, respectively, such required percentage of
the beneficial interest in the Book-Entry Certificates;

(vi) owners of a beneficial interest
in a Book-Entry Certificate shall not be entitled to have any
portion of a Book-Entry Certificate registered in their names and
shall not be considered to be the Certificateholders of any
Book-Entry Certificates under this Trust Agreement; and

(vii) payments on a Book-Entry
Certificate shall be made to the Clearing Agency, or its nominee,
as the registered owner thereof, and none of the Trust, the Owner
Trustee or the Paying Agent shall have any responsibility or
liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments
made on account of beneficial ownership interests in a Book-Entry
Certificate or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any
records relating to the beneficial ownership interests.

(c) Notwithstanding any provision to
the contrary herein, so long as a Book-Entry Certificate remains
outstanding and is held by or on behalf of the Clearing Agency,
transfers of a Book-Entry Certificate, in whole or in part, shall
only be made in accordance with Section 3.4 . Subject
to Section 3.4 , transfers of a Book-Entry Certificate
shall be limited to transfers of such Book-Entry Certificate in
whole, but not in part, to a nominee of the Clearing Agency or to a
successor of the Clearing Agency or such successor’s
nominee.

exchanged for one another only in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement and with such procedures as may be from time to time
adopted by the Trust and the Owner Trustee.

(e) The Certificates shall represent
the entire beneficial interest in the Trust. The Certificates shall
be executed on behalf of the Trust by manual or facsimile signature
of a Responsible Officer of the Owner Trustee. Certificates bearing
the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were, at the
time when such signatures shall have been affixed, authorized to
sign on behalf of the Trust, shall be duly issued, fully paid and

the board, its president or any vice president, without further
limited liability company action by the Depositor. Such Certificate
shall be issued to and held by the Depositor, as the initial
Certificateholder. No Certificate shall entitle its holder to any
benefit under this Agreement, or shall be valid for any purpose,
unless there shall appear on such Certificate a certificate of
authentication substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A,
executed by the Owner Trustee or the Owner Trustee’s
authenticating agent, by manual signature. Such authentication
shall constitute conclusive evidence that such Certificate shall
have been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. All
Certificates shall be dated the date of their
authentication.

Certificates; Registration of Transfer and Exchange of
Certificates .

(a) The Certificate Registrar, as an
agent of the Trust, shall keep or cause to be kept, at the office

assign in any manner its rights to and interests in the
Certificates (including its right to distributions from the Reserve
Account), provided that: (A)(i) such transfer, conveyance or
assignment is made to the Depositor or such entity pledges its
rights and interests in the Certificates or (B)(i) such action will
not result in a reduction or withdrawal of the rating of any class
of Notes, (ii) the Certificateholder provides to the Owner

subdivided upon transfer or exchange in a manner such that the
resulting Certificate represents less than a 1.10% Percentage

“publicly traded partnership” under Section 7704
of the Code, but in no event less than a 1.00% Percentage Interest

Certificates may be exchanged for other Certificates of a like
aggregate Percentage Interest in the Trust, as shown on the
applicable Certificates, upon surrender of the Certificates to be

agent to authenticate and deliver) one or more Certificates dated
the date of authentication by the Owner Trustee or any
authenticating agent. Such Certificates shall be delivered to the

registration of transfer or exchange shall be canceled and
subsequently destroyed or otherwise disposed of by the Owner
Trustee or Certificate Registrar in accordance with its customary

or for the account of an employee benefit plan or plan that is not
subject to the provisions of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975
of the Code (including non-U.S. or governmental plans) if such

under, or a violation of, any applicable law that is substantially
similar to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code.

(A) only be acquired by or for the account of a Person who is
a United State s Person (within the meaning of

corporation, or partnership (or a disregarded entity, the single
owner of which is any of the foregoing) where more than 50% of the

pledged or otherwise transferred in accordance with this Agreement
and the applicable legend on such Certificates set forth
below.

(m) Each transferee of a Certificate
understands that an investment in the Certificates involves certain
risks, including the risk of loss of all or a substantial part of

necessary or appropriate in order to make an informed investment
decision with respect to its purchase of the Certificates. Each
transferee acknowledges that it has such knowledge and experience
in financial and business matters that the transferee is capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the
Certificates, and the transferee and any accounts for which it is
acting are each able to bear the economic risk of the
holder’s or of its investment.

(n) No transferee of a Certificate
will offer, transfer, pledge, sell or otherwise dispose of the
Certificates or any interest in the Certificates to any Person in
any manner, or solicit any offer to buy, transfer or otherwise
dispose of the Certificates or any interest in the Certificates
from any Person in any manner, or make any general solicitation by
means of general advertising or in any other manner, or take any
other action that would constitute a distribution of the

Person to act on its behalf, in such manner with respect to the
Certificates.

of any replacement Certificate under this Section 3.5 ,
the Owner Trustee may require the payment by the Holder of such
Certificate of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any
other reasonable expenses (including the fees and expenses of the
Owner Trustee and the Certificate Registrar) connected
therewith.

(d) Any duplicate Certificate issued
pursuant to this Section 3.5 in replacement of any
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate shall constitute
an original additional beneficial interest in the Trust, whether or
not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate shall be
found at any time or be enforced by anyone, and shall be entitled
to all the benefits of this Agreement equally and proportionately
with any and all other Certificates duly issued
hereunder.

(e) The provisions of this
Section 3.5 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the
extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the
replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Certificates.

Section 3.6 Persons Deemed
Certificateholders . Subject to the provisions of
Section 3.4 herein, prior to due presentation of a
Certificate for registration of transfer, the Owner Trustee or the
Certificate Registrar may treat the Person in whose name any
Certificate shall be registered in the Certificate Register as the
Certificateholder of such Certificate for the purpose of receiving
distributions pursuant to Article V and for all other purposes
whatsoever, and neither the Owner Trustee nor the Certificate
Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the
contrary.

Section 3.7 Access to List
of Certificateholders’ Names and Addresses . The
Certificate Registrar shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the
Servicer and the Depositor, within fifteen (15) days after
receipt by the Certificate Registrar of a request therefor from the
Servicer or the Depositor in writing, a list of the names and
addresses of the Certificateholders as
 
12


of the most recent Record Date. Each Holder, by
receiving and holding a Certificate, shall be deemed to have agreed
not to hold any of the Servicer, the Depositor, the Certificate
Registrar or the Owner Trustee accountable by reason of the
disclosure of its name and address, regardless of the source from
which such information was derived.

Section 3.8 Maintenance of
Corporate Trust Office . The Owner Trustee shall maintain an
office or offices or agency or agencies where Certificates may be
surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange and where
notices and demands to or upon the Owner Trustee in respect of the
Certificates and the Basic Documents may be served. The Owner
Trustee initially designates its office located at 301 Bellevue
Parkway, 3rd Floor, Wilmington, Delaware 19809, as its principal
office for such purposes. The Owner Trustee shall give prompt
written notice to the Depositor, to the Servicer and to the
Certificateholders of any change in the location of the Certificate
Register or any such office or agency.

Section 3.9 Appointment of
Paying Agent . Except as otherwise provided in
Section 5.2 , the Paying Agent shall make distributions
to Certificateholders from the Certificate Distribution Account
pursuant to Section 5.2 and shall report the amounts of
such distributions to the Owner Trustee and the Servicer;
provided , however , that no such reports shall be
required so long as the Depositor is the sole Certificateholder.
Any Paying Agent shall have the revocable power to withdraw funds
from the Certificate Distribution Account for the purpose of making
the distributions referred to above. The Owner Trustee may revoke
such power and remove the Paying Agent if the Owner Trustee
determines in its sole discretion that the Paying Agent shall have
failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement in any
material respect. The Paying Agent shall initially be BNY Mellon
Trust of Delaware, and any co-paying agent chosen by BNY Mellon
Trust of Delaware. BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware shall be permitted
to resign as Paying Agent upon thirty (30) days’ written
notice to the Owner Trustee. If BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware shall
no longer be the Paying Agent, the Owner Trustee shall appoint a
successor to act as Paying Agent (which shall be a bank or trust
company). The Owner Trustee shall cause such successor Paying Agent
or any additional Paying Agent appointed by the Owner Trustee to
execute and deliver to the Owner Trustee an instrument in which
such successor Paying Agent or additional Paying Agent shall agree
with the Owner Trustee that as Paying Agent, such successor Paying
Agent or additional Paying Agent shall hold all sums, if any, held
by it for payment to the Certificateholders in trust for the
benefit of the Certificateholders entitled thereto until such sums
shall be paid to such Certificateholders. The Paying Agent shall
return all unclaimed funds to the Owner Trustee and upon removal of
a Paying Agent such Paying Agent shall also return all funds in its
possession to the Owner Trustee. The provisions of Sections
6.3 , 6.6 , 6.7 and 6.9 shall apply to
the Owner Trustee also in its role as Paying Agent or Certificate
Registrar for so long as the Owner Trustee shall act as Paying
Agent or Certificate Registrar and, to the extent applicable, to
any other paying agent, certificate registrar or authenticating
agent appointed hereunder. Any reference in this Agreement to the
Paying Agent shall include any co-paying agent unless the context
requires otherwise.

Section 3.10 Depositor as
Certificateholder . The Depositor in its individual or any
other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Certificates and
may otherwise deal with the Owner Trustee or its Affiliates as if
it were not the Depositor.
 
13



Section 3.11 Rule 144A
Information . The Depositor shall, during any period in which a
purchaser of the Certificates holds such Certificate and in which
the Depositor is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, make available, upon request, to any holder of such
Certificates in connection with any sale thereof and any
prospective purchaser of Certificates from such holder, the
information specified in Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Act.

Section 3.12 Definitive
Certificates . If (i) the Administrator advises the Owner
Trustee in writing that the Clearing Agency is no longer willing or
able to properly discharge its responsibilities with respect to the
Book-Entry Certificates and the Trust is unable to locate a
qualified successor; (ii) the Administrator, at its option,
advises the Owner Trustee in writing that it elects to terminate
the book-entry system through the Clearing Agency; or
(iii) Certificate Owners representing beneficial interests
aggregating at least a majority of the Percentage Interests in the
Trust advise the Clearing Agency in writing that the continuation
of a book-entry system through the Clearing Agency is no longer in
the best interests of the Certificate Owners, then the Clearing
Agency shall notify all Certificate Owners and the Owner Trustee of
the occurrence of any such event and of the availability of
Definitive Certificates to Certificate Owners requesting the same.
Upon surrender to the Owner Trustee of the typewritten Certificate
or Certificates representing the Book-Entry Certificate by the
Clearing Agency, accompanied by registration instructions, the
Trust shall execute and the Owner Trustee shall authenticate the
Definitive Certificates in accordance with the instructions of the
Clearing Agency. None of the Trust, the Certificate Registrar or
the Owner Trustee shall be liable for any delay in delivery of such
instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be protected
in relying on, such instructions. Upon the issuance of Definitive
Certificates, the Owner Trustee shall recognize the Holders of the
Definitive Certificates as Certificateholders.

Section 3.13 Notices to
Clearing Agency . Whenever a notice or other communication to
the Certificateholders is required under this Agreement, unless and
until Definitive Certificates shall have been issued to the owner
of a Certificate pursuant to Section 3.12 , the Owner
Trustee shall give all such notices and communications specified
herein to be given to the Certificateholders to the Clearing
Agency, and shall have no obligation to the owner of a
Certificate.

actions referred to in the preceding sentence only upon written
instructions signed by the Majority Certificateholders.

Section 4.3 Action by
Certificateholders with Respect to Bankruptcy . Notwithstanding
any prior termination of this Agreement, the Owner Trustee shall
not have the power to commence a voluntary case under Title 11 of
the United States Code or any successor provision relating to the

termination of the Trust.
 
15

direct the Owner Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action
if such action or inaction would be contrary to any obligation of
the Trust or the Owner Trustee under this Agreement, including

ARTICLE V

APPLICATION OF TRUST FUNDS;
CERTAIN DUTIES

Section 5.1 Establishment of
Certificate Distribution Account .

(a) Except as otherwise provided in
Section 5.2 , the Servicer, for the benefit of the
Certificateholders, shall establish and maintain in the name of the
Trust an Eligible Deposit Account known as the Capital Auto
Receivables Asset Trust 2015-4 Certificate Distribution Account
(the “ Certificate Distribution Account ”),
bearing an additional designation clearly indicating that the funds
deposited therein are held for the benefit of the
Certificateholders.

(b) The Certificateholders shall
possess all right, title and interest in and to all funds on
deposit from time to time in the Certificate Distribution Account
and in all proceeds thereof. Except as otherwise provided herein,
in the Indenture or in the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement, the
Certificate Distribution Account shall be under the sole dominion
and control of the Owner Trustee or the Paying Agent for the
benefit of the Certificateholders. If, at any time, the Certificate
Distribution Account ceases to be an Eligible Deposit Account, the
Owner Trustee (or the Servicer on behalf of the Owner Trustee, if
the Certificate Distribution Account is not then held by the Owner
Trustee or an Affiliate thereof) shall within ten
(10) Business Days (or such longer period, not to exceed
thirty (30) calendar days, as to which each Rating Agency may
consent) establish a new Certificate Distribution Account as an
Eligible Deposit Account and shall transfer any cash or any
investments to such new Certificate Distribution
Account.

Section 5.2 Application of
Trust Funds .

(a) On each Distribution Date, the
Owner Trustee or the Paying Agent shall distribute to the
Certificateholders, on a pro rata basis, amounts equal to the
amounts deposited in the Certificate Distribution Account pursuant
to Sections 4.06 and 4.07 of the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement
on or prior to such Distribution Date. Funds received by the Owner
Trustee or the Paying Agent by 1:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on any
Distribution Date will be
 
16


distributed to the Certificateholders on such
Distribution Date. Each of the Owner Trustee and the Paying Agent
shall use its best efforts to distribute any funds received after
1:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on any Distribution Date to the
Certificateholders as soon as reasonably possible, but neither the
Owner Trustee nor the Paying Agent shall be liable if such funds
are not distributed until the next Business Day. Any funds received
by the Owner Trustee or the Paying Agent after 1:00 p.m. (Eastern
time) shall be held uninvested in the Certificate Distribution
Account until distributed to the Certificateholders, and neither
the Owner Trustee nor the Paying Agent shall be liable for any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to
the contrary in this Agreement or the other Basic Documents, if and
for so long as Certificates representing in the aggregate a 100%
beneficial interest in the Trust are held by the Depositor,
(i) no Certificate Distribution Account shall be required to
be established or maintained and (ii) all distributions and
payments on the Certificates (including the final distribution as
contemplated by Section 7.1(c) hereof) required
hereunder or under the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement shall be
made directly to the Depositor by the Indenture Trustee (whether or
not the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement otherwise contemplates
deposit into the Certificate Distribution Account) and the Owner
Trustee shall have no duty or liability to see to such
distribution.

(b) On each Distribution Date, the
Owner Trustee shall send to each Certificateholder the statement
provided to the Owner Trustee by the Servicer pursuant to
Section 4.09(a) of the Trust Sale and Servicing Agreement on
such Distribution Date; provided that no such statement
shall be required to be sent by the Owner Trustee if and for so
long as the Depositor is the sole Certificateholder.

(c) If any withholding tax is
imposed on the Trust’s payment (or allocations of income) to
a Certificateholder, such tax shall reduce the amount otherwise
distributable to the Certificateholder in accordance with this
Section 5.2 ; provided that the Owner Trustee or
the Paying Agent shall not have an obligation to withhold any such
amount if and for so long as the Depositor is the sole
Certificateholder. The Owner Trustee or the Paying Agent is hereby
authorized and directed to retain from amounts otherwise
distributable to the Certificateholders sufficient funds for the
payment of any tax that is legally payable by the Trust (but such
authorization shall not prevent the Owner Trustee or the Paying
Agent from contesting any such tax in appropriate proceedings and
withholding payment of such tax, if permitted by law, pending the
outcome of such proceedings). The amount of any withholding tax
imposed with respect to a Certificateholder shall be treated as
cash distributed to such Certificateholder at the time it is
withheld by the Trust and remitted to the appropriate taxing
authority. If there is a possibility that withholding tax is
payable with respect to a distribution (such as a distribution to a
non-U.S. Certificateholder), the Owner Trustee or the Paying Agent
may in its sole discretion withhold such amounts in accordance with
this Section 5.2(c) . If a Certificateholder wishes to
apply for a refund of any such withholding tax, the Owner Trustee
or the Paying Agent shall reasonably cooperate with such
Certificateholder in making such claim so long as such
Certificateholder agrees to reimburse the Owner Trustee or the
Paying Agent for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred.

(d) If the Indenture Trustee holds
escheated funds for payment to the Trust pursuant to
Section 3.3(e) of the Indenture, the Owner Trustee shall, upon
notice from the Indenture Trustee that such funds exist, submit on
behalf of the Trust an Issuing Entity Order to the Indenture
Trustee pursuant to Section 3.3(e) of the Indenture
instructing the Indenture Trustee to pay such funds to or at the
order of the Depositor.
 
17



Section 5.3 Method of
Payment . Subject to Section 7.1(c) , distributions
required to be made to Certificateholders on any Distribution Date
shall be made to each Certificateholder of record on the related
Record Date by wire transfer, in immediately available funds, to
the account of such Holder at a bank or other entity having
appropriate facilities therefor, if such Certificateholder shall
have provided to the Certificate Registrar appropriate written
instructions at least five (5) Business Days prior to such
Distribution Date or if not, by check mailed to such
Certificateholder at the address of such Certificateholder
appearing in the Certificate Register; provided ,
however , that, unless and until Definitive Certificates
have been issued pursuant to Section 3.12 , with
respect to Certificates registered on the applicable Record Date in
the name of the Certificate Depository (initially, Cede &
Co.), payment shall be made by wire transfer in immediately
available funds to the account designated by the Certificate
Depository.

Section 5.4 Accounting and
Reports to the Certificateholders, the Internal Revenue Service and
Others . The Owner Trustee shall maintain (or cause to be
maintained) the books of the Trust on a calendar year basis on the
accrual method of accounting, deliver to each Certificateholder, as
may be required by the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations or
otherwise, such information as may be required to enable each
Certificateholder to prepare its federal income tax return, file
such tax returns relating to the Trust and make such elections as
may from time to time be required or appropriate under any
applicable State or federal statute or rule or regulation
thereunder so as to maintain the Trust’s characterization as
an entity described in Section 2.11(i) for federal
income tax purposes, cause such tax returns to be signed in the
manner required by law and collect or cause to be collected any
withholding tax as described in and in accordance with
Section 5.2(c) with respect to income or distributions
to Certificateholders. If the Trust were to become a partnership in
accordance with Section 2.11 or the Internal Revenue
Service were to contend successfully that the Trust is not a
disregarded entity but is rather a partnership for federal income
tax purposes, the Trust shall allocate items of income, gain,
deduction and loss to the partners of the Trust in accordance with
their economic interests in the Trust. With respect to interest
expense of the Trust, the Trust shall allocate to the
Certificateholders their share of the entire amount of such
interest expense.

Section 5.5 Signature on
Returns; Other Tax Matters . The Owner Trustee shall sign on
behalf of the Trust any and all tax returns of the Trust, unless
applicable law requires a Certificateholder to sign such documents,
in which case such documents shall be signed by the Depositor. To
the extent one may be required, the Depositor shall be the
“tax matters partner” of the Trust pursuant to the
Code.

failure of the Administrator to carry out its obligations under the

(c) In the absence of bad faith on
its part, the Owner Trustee may conclusively rely upon certificates
or opinions furnished to the Owner Trustee and conforming to the
requirements of this Agreement in determining the truth of the
statements and the correctness of the opinions contained therein;
provided , however , that the Owner Trustee shall
have examined such certificates or opinions so as to determine
compliance of the same with the requirements of this
Agreement.

(d) The Owner Trustee may not be
relieved from liability for its own negligent action, its own
negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except
that:

(i) this Section 6.1(d)
shall not limit the effect of Section 6.1(a) or
6.1(b) ;

(ii) the Owner Trustee shall not be
liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a
Responsible Officer unless it is proved that the Owner Trustee was
negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and

(iii) the Owner Trustee shall not be
liable with respect to any action it takes or omits to take in
goo

Fitch Rates Capital Auto Receivables Asset Trust 2015-2 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Rates Capital Auto Receivables Asset Trust 2015-2
    





May 20, 2015 04:02 PM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to 
      the notes issued by Capital Auto Receivables Asset Trust 2015-2:
    

      --$205,000,000 class A-1a 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$205,000,000 class A-1b 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$290,000,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$290,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$95,400,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$63,650,000 class B 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$60,300,000 class C 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$53,600,000 class D 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$67,000,000 class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Stable Collateral Characteristics: The 2015-2 pool is representative of 
      nonprime collateral, with a 633 weighted average (WA) Fair Isaac Corp. 
      (FICO) score, 8.76% WA annual percentage rate (APR) and 104% WA 
      loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Of the pool, 60% consists of new vehicle 
      contracts, while extended-term contracts total 77%, all relatively 
      consistent with recent securitized pools.
    

      One-Year Revolving Period Risk: The revolving structure introduces risk 
      of collateral migrating to a weaker pool before the start of the 
      amortization period, although eligibility criteria pertaining to the 
      additional receivables may mitigate some of this risk. Fitch accounts 
      for collateral migration in its derivation of the base case loss proxy 
      for 2015-2.
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement: Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for 
      class A notes totals 19.50%. The non-declining reserve is 0.50%, 
      subordination totals 18.25% and initial overcollateralization (OC) is 
      0.75%, growing to a target of 2.25% after the revolving period.
    

      Stable Portfolio Performance: AFIN's nonprime auto loan portfolio has 
      shown improved performance relative to the weak 2006-2008 period, given 
      the gradual improvements in the U.S. economy and healthy used vehicle 
      values. Fitch's base case loss proxy for 2015-2 is 5.60%; however, 
      Fitch's ABS extrapolation based on outstanding CARAT transactions out of 
      the revolving period is below 3.00%.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: Fitch currently rates AFIN 'BB+/B'/Outlook 
      Stable. AFIN demonstrates solid capabilities as an originator, 
      underwriter and servicer, as evidenced by its historical prime and 
      nonprime portfolios and securitization performance.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of AFIN would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. In turn, it could result in potentially adverse rating actions on 
      the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to 
      all classes of Capital Auto Receivables Asset Trust 2015-2 to increased 
      losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the 
      notes display some sensitivity to increased defaults and losses. In 
      fact, they could lead to potential downgrades of up to one category 
      under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. The notes could
