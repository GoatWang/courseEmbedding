James R. Goff Jr.: Close Harmony History Of Southern Gospel
Video von James R. Goff Jr. - Close Harmony History Of Southern Gospel

English, Paperback, 14.5x23 cm, 392 pages, b&w photos; The spread of white gospel music is intricately connected to the people who based their livelihoods on it and 'Close Harmony' is filled with the stories of artists and groups such as Frank Stamps, the Chuck Wagon Gang, the Blackwood Brothers, the Rangers, the Swanee River Boys , the Statesmen, and the Oak Ridge Boys. As the most successful of these groups carried southern gospel outside the South, they set the stage for the musical diversity that splintered the industry during the 1960s and 1970s, when the traditional barriers to interaction between white and black artists were broken. In the decades that followed, white gospel was significantly changed by various musical influences, including black gospel, bluegrass, rock, metal, and later, rap. With Christian music sales topping the $600 million mark at the close of the twentieth century, 'Close Harmony' explores the history of an important and influential segment of the thriving gospel industry.

Produktbeschreibung




					A controversial look at the impending Chinese economiccollapse--the history behind it, its contemporary causes, andits dire implications for the global economy All the experts agree: the 21st century belongs to China. GivenAmerica's looming insolvency and the possibility of the collapse ofthe U.S. dollar, who can doubt that China is poised to take overthe role of economic superpower? Written by political economist andleading financial journalist James Gorrie, this book offers ahighly controversial, contrarian view of contemporary China.Drawing upon a wealth of historical and up-to-the-minute data,Gorrie makes a strong case that China, itself, is on the verge ofan economic crisis of epic proportions. He explains how, caught ina recurrent boom/bust cycle that has played itself out severaltimes over the past sixty years, China is again approaching totaleconomic and social collapse. But with one important differencethis time: they may very well take the entire global economy downwith them. * Explores the Chinese communist party's unfortunate history ofmaking costly and very bloody mistakes on an enormous scale * One-by-one Gorrie analyzes those critical mistakes and explainshow they may lead to economic collapse in China and globaldepression * Describes Chinese "cannibal capitalism," and where its massiveabuse of the country's environment, people, and arable lands isleading that country and the world economy * Chronicles China's history of recurring economic crisis andexplains why all the evidence suggests that history is about torepeat itself

Rezensionen

"An inside look at China's future. James R. Gorrie reveals a China that the mainstream press has failed to investigate. His conclusions, based in fact and historical reality, may change your thinking about this potential superpower, which may have overplayed its hand. A must-read in a world of global currency wars."--Craig R. Smith, founder and Chairman of Swiss America Trading Corp., author, commentator, and monetary expert"Anyone who isn't aware of the impact China is going to have on the world over the next few years has their head stuck in the sand. From their focused attack on the US dollar to the many bubbles they've created with their unsustainable economic policies, these will cause enormous impacts upon that country with reverberations that will be felt around the world. James R. Gorrie does a fantastic job of laying out the real story of China for all of the world to see."--John F. Carter, Founder of TradeTheMarkets.com, frequent commentator on CNBC and Bloomberg and regular contributor to SFO magazine and MSN Money

Produktbeschreibung




					Matrix Analysis for Statistics, Second Edition provides in-depth, step-by-step coverage of the most common matrix methods now used in statistical applications, including eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the Moore-Penrose inverse, matrix differentiation, the distribution of quadratic forms, and more. The subject matter is presented in a theorem/proof format, allowing for a smooth transition from one topic to another. Proofs are easy to follow, and the author carefully justifies every step. Accessible even for readers with a cursory background in statistics, yet rigorous enough for students in statistics, this new edition is the ideal introduction to matrix analysis theory and practice.AUS DEM INHALT: Preface. 1.
