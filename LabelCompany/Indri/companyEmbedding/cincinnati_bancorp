Cincinnati Bancorp Completes Stock Offering And Reorganization

CINCINNATI, Oct. 14, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Cincinnati Bancorp (the "Company"), the federally-chartered holding company for Cincinnati Federal (the "Bank"), announced today that it completed its stock offering in connection with the mutual holding company reorganization of the Bank on October 14, 2015.  
The Company sold 773,663 shares of common stock at $10.00 per share in the subscription offering for gross proceeds of approximately $7.7 million, including 67,397 shares purchased by the Bank's employee stock ownership plan. In connection with the reorganization, the Company also issued 945,587 shares of common stock to CF Mutual Holding Company, a federally-chartered mutual holding company.
Shares of the Company's common stock are expected to begin trading on October 15, 2015 on the OTC Pink Marketplace (www.otcmarkets.com) under the trading symbol "CNNB". Direct Registration Statements reflecting the shares purchased in the stock offering are expected to be mailed to subscribers on or about October 15, 2015.
Robert Bedinghaus, the Chairman of the Company, said: "Our Board of Directors and the officers and employees of Cincinnati Federal would like to extend our appreciation to our customers for their loyalty and support in completing our reorganization and stock offering. The fact that we were oversubscribed at the customer level we see as a real vote of confidence in our approach to growing the Bank.  We look forward to turning our attention towards continuing to serve our community, attaining our strategic goals and delivering value to our new stockholders." 
This was a history making transaction in that this was the first mutual holding company reorganization/public stock offering approved by the Federal Reserve Board pursuant to its authority granted under the Dodd-Frank Act. 
Mr. Bedinghaus commented, "While it is never easy to plow new ground, we adopted the Mutual Holding Company structure so that we could raise new capital to support the continued growth of our business while at the same time maintaining mutual control. Upon the completion of our reorganization, a majority of our shares will continue to be controlled by our depositor members and we will remain able to partner with other mutual institutions, should favorable opportunities arise."
Luse Gorman, PC, acted as legal counsel to the Company and the Bank.  Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc., a Stifel Company, acted as selling agent in the subscription offering and served as financial advisor to the Company and the Bank in connection with the reorganization and stock offering.  
Subscribers in the first priority of the subscription may confirm their allocation online at https://allocations.kbw.com or by contacting the Stock Information Center at (877) 643-8198.  The Stock Information Center is open Monday through Friday, between 10:00 am and 4:00 pm Eastern Time.
Cincinnati Federal is a federally chartered savings bank serving the financial needs of its customers located in southwest Ohio, northern Kentucky and southeastern Indiana. Cincinnati Federal conducts business from its corporate headquarters and main office in Green Township, Ohio and three full service branches located in Price Hill (City of Cincinnati), and Miami Heights and Anderson (suburban Hamilton County).
This press release contains certain forward-looking statements about the reorganization and stock offering.  Forward-looking statements include statements regarding anticipated future events and can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.  They often include words such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," and "intend" or future or conditional verbs such as "will," "would," "should," "could," or "may".  Forward-looking statements, by their nature, are subject to risks and uncertainties.  Certain factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results include increased competitive pressures, changes in the interest rate environment, general economic conditions or conditions within the securities markets, and legislative and regulatory changes that could adversely affect the business in which the Company and the Bank are engaged.

Plan for Your Goals

              Invest For Retirement

Plan your retirement right
Planning for retirement is one of the most important things you can do in life. And it’s never too early—or too late—to start. So tell us where you are today. We’ll help you get to the right retirement tomorrow.

Start Planning
Ready to retire


              Plan For Education

Planning for the costs of education
It’s smart to go to college. It’s even smarter to plan ahead. If you have a child or grandchild and you want to start saving for their education, you’re in the right place. A 529 savings account is a great way to help pay for higher education. It allows your money to grow over time with the security of FDIC insurance and 529 tax advantages.

Student Planning


              Buy A Home

Buying a home
Buying a house is a big deal. And finding the home of your dreams is only part of it. You’ll also want to find the loan that fits your finances.
At Fifth Third, our Mortgage Loan Originators are here to listen to you, learn about your unique needs, and answer all of your questions. Then, we will find the loan that's right for you.

              Save For Life Event

Life Events
Life is full of surprises. Some are great—like suddenly falling in love and planning a wedding. Others are not so great. But whatever life has in store, it’s important to be financially prepared. We can help you and your personal bank accounts get ready.

Life Events


              Consolidate Debt

Consolidate Debt
Credit cards, auto loans, money borrowed for college—paying all those bills every month can be a real hassle. Why not consolidate your debts with someone you can trust?
Consolidating with Fifth Third can help simplify your life by giving you one simple monthly payment. Plus, our competitive rates can really help you put more of your money in your personal bank account.

Money isn't everything. But knowing how to manage money can make everything better. That's what our Financial Empowerment program is all about—helping people understand how to better manage their finances and save for the future.
We even have programs designed specifically for students—it's never too soon to learn how to manage money and establish good habits.

Graham Number
=GURUF("OTCBB:CNNB","Graham Number")

$10.87 (As of Mar. 2017)
Graham Number is a figure that measures a stock's fundamental value by taking into account the company's earnings per share and book value per share. The Graham number is the upper bound of the price range that a defensive investor should pay for the stock. According to the theory, any stock price below the Graham number is considered undervalued, and thus worth investing in.
As of today, the stock price of Cincinnati Bancorp is $9.50. Cincinnati Bancorp's graham number for the quarter that ended in Mar. 2017 was $10.87. Therefore, Cincinnati Bancorp's Price to Graham Number ratio for today is 0.87.

Graham Number is a combination of asset valuation and earnings power valuation. It is a very conservative way of valuing a stock.

Definition
Graham Number is a concept based on Ben Graham's conservative valuation of companies.
Cincinnati Bancorp's Graham Number for the fiscal year that ended in Dec. 2016 is calculated as



Graham Number


=sqrt of (22.5*Tangible Book Value per Share*EPS without Non-Recurring Items (NRI))


=sqrt of (22.5*10.269*0.44)


=10.08



Cincinnati Bancorp's Graham Number for the quarter that ended in Mar. 2017 is calculated as



Graham Number


=sqrt of (22.5*Tangible Book Value per Share*EPS without Non-Recurring Items (NRI) (TTM))


=sqrt of (22.5*10.291*0.51)


=10.87



* All numbers are in millions except for per share data and ratio. All numbers are in their local exchange's currency.

Explanation
Ben Graham actually did not publish a formula like this. But he wrote in The Intelligent Investor (1948 version) regarding to the criteria for purchases:
Current price should not be more than 15 times average earnings of the past three years.
Current price should not be more than 1.5 times the book value last reported. However, a multiplier of earnings below 15 could justify a correspondingly higher multiplier of assets. As a rule of thumb we suggest that the product of the multiplier times the ratio of price to book value should not exceed 22.5. (This figure corresponds to 15 times earnings and 1.5 times book value. It would admit an issue selling at only 9 times earnings and 2.5 times asset value, etc.)
Unlike valuation methods such as DCF or Discounted Earnings, the Graham number does not take growth into the valuation. Unlike the valuation methods based on book value alone, it takes into account the earnings power. Therefore, the Graham Number is a combination of asset valuation and earnings power valuation.
In general, the Graham number is a very conservative way of valuing a stock. It cannot be applied to companies with negative book values. 
Cincinnati Bancorp's Price to Graham number Ratio for today is calculated as



Price to Graham number=Share Price (Today)/Graham number (Q: Mar. 2017 )


=9.50/10.87


=0.87



* All numbers are in millions except for per share data and ratio. All numbers are in their local exchange's currency.

Be Aware
Please keep these in mind:
1. Graham Number does not take growth into account. Therefore it underestimates the values of the companies that have good earnings growth. We feel that if the earnings per share grows more than 10% a year, Graham Number underestimates the value.
2. Graham Number punishes the companies that have temporarily low earnings. Therefore, an average of earnings makes more sense in the calculation of Graham Number.
3. Graham Numbers underestimates companies that are light with book.
