Quotes[edit]
"Product development" , 1995[edit]
Shona L. Brown and Kathleen M. Eisenhardt. "Product development: Past research, present findings, and future directions." Academy of management review 20.2 (1995): 343-378.

The literature on product development continues to grow. This research is varied and vibrant, yet large and fragmented. In this article we first organize the burgeoning product-development literature into three streams of research: product development as rational plan, communication web, and disciplined problem solving. Second, we synthesize research findings into a model of factors affecting the success of product development. This model highlights the distinction between process performance and product effectiveness and the importance of agents, including team members, project leaders, senior management, customers, and suppliers, whose behavior affects these outcomes. Third, we indicate potential paths for future research based on the concepts and links that are missing or not well defined in the model.

p. 343; Abstract



"The art of continuous change", 1997[edit]
Shona L. Brown and Kathleen M. Eisenhardt. "The art of continuous change: Linking complexity theory and time-paced evolution in relentlessly shifting organizations." Administrative science quarterly (1997): 1-34.

In contrast to the punctuated equilibrium model of change, this inductive study of multiple-product innovation in six firms in the computer industry examines how organizations engage in continuous change. Comparisons of successful and less-successful firms show, first, that successful multiple-product innovation blends limited structure around responsibilities and priorities with extensive communication and design freedom to create improvisation within current projects. This combination is neither so structured that change cannot occur nor so unstructured that chaos ensues. Second, successful firms rely on a wide variety of low-cost probes into the future, including experimental products, futurists, and strategic alliances. Neither planning nor reacting is as effective. Third, successful firms link the present and future together through rhythmic, time-paced transition processes. We develop the ideas of "semistructures," "links in time," and "sequenced steps" to crystallize the key properties of these continuously changing organizations and to extend thinking about complexity theory, time-paced evolution, and the nature of core capabilities.

p. 1; Abstract



Competing on the Edge, 1998[edit]
Shona L. Brown, and Kathleen M. Eisenhardt (1998), Competing on the Edge: Strategy as Structured Chaos. Boston: Harvard Business School Press.

Complexity theory began with an interest u how order spring from chaos. According to complexity theory, adaption is most effective in systems that are only partially connected. The argument is that too much structure creates gridlock, while too little structure creates chaos. A good example would be the traffic lights in a city. If there are no lights, traffic is chaotic. If there are too many lights, traffic stops. A moderate number of lights creates structure, but still allows drivers to adapt their routes in surprising ways in response to changing traffic conditions. Consequently, the key to effective change is to stay poised on this edge of chaos. Complexity theory focuses managerial thinking on the interrelationships among different parts of an organization and on the trade-off of less control for greater adaptation.

p. 14




Although the behavior that emerges is complex, the rules that guide it are necessarily simple. In fact, it is their simplicity that creates the freedom to behave in complicated adaptive, and surprising ways.

p. 18




Coadaptation is the process whereby systems of related agents take mutual advantage of each other in order to change more effectively, yet still be adaptive in each agent's particular situation.

p. 60




In our work in fast- changing markets, we often see that time pacing helps managers avert the danger of changing too infrequently. By setting a regular pace for change, managers avoid becoming locked into old patterns and habits.

p. 67




Managers who extensively plan the future get the timing wrong. Sometimes they arrive to market too early and so must wait for the demand to catch up. Sometimes they are too late and so must accelerate to rejoin the future.

p. 135

Product Development: Past Research, Present Findings, and Future Directions

Abstract
This review of the state of research on product development as of the mid-1990s finds that it is quite fragmented, and sets out to create a framework by which to view the literature. Most empirical research can be grouped into three views of the nature of the product development process: rational plan, communication web, or disciplined problem solving. Based on the prior research, a model of success factors is developed, which highlights the value of various stakeholders, or agents, and distinguishes between success in the process and a successful product.        The focus on product development as successful when rationally planned identified the value of organizational characteristics such as cross-functional teams and product champions, and the importance of market conditions. Research on the role of communication, within the product development team and externally, focused on the importance of a communication strategy and the need for gatekeepers and boundary spanners on the team. The disciplined problem solving approach emerged first in studies of Japanese product development processes. This approach requires strong leadership and a clear vision. With a clear goal in mind, and input from various functions, there is also autonomy to experiment, going through multiple problem solving iterations.          These research streams overlap, and from that commonality a model is developed herein that emphasizes the importance of such factors as cross-functional teams, strong leadership, resource availability and information flow. Three issues for future product development research are (1) the role of senior managers; (2) the organization of work (e.g., improvision vs planning); and (3) the connections and dependencies between the development process, market factors, effective products and financial performance. 



Keywords: Organizational planning, Gatekeepers, Champions, Boundary spanning, Communication patterns, Communication strategies, Information flow, Organizational goals, Market demand, Communication skills, Information dissemination, Leadership, Product development, Stakeholders, Cross-functional teams, Problem solving, Organizational vision, Work roles

Shona Brown in 2007


Shona L. Brown (born circa 1966) is a business executive and consultant to non-profits and corporations. She was a Google executive from 2003 to the end of 2012 when she was the senior vice president of business operations.[1][2][3]
Life[edit]
Brown has a bachelor of computer systems engineering from Carleton University in Canada and a master's degree in economics and philosophy from the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. Brown received her Ph.D from Stanford University's department of industrial engineering and engineering management, where she also did postdoctoral work on business theory.[4] From October 1995 to August 2003, Brown was at McKinsey & Company, a management consulting firm, as a partner in the Los Angeles office since December 2000.[5][1] In 1998, she published the book Competing on the Edge: Strategy as Structured Chaos, with co-author Kathleen M. Eisenhardt, her doctoral advisor at Stanford.[6][7]
Brown joined Google in September 2003 and took on the responsibility of building both the people operations and business operations groups. In January 2006, she was promoted to senior vice president,[1] and CNN included Brown as one of four rising stars in their most powerful women in business section,[8] as a journalist called her Google's "chief chaos officer", testing her business theories at the company.[9] In October 2007 she was involved with an illegal non-solicitation compact to not poach engineers from Apple Inc.[10][3]
Fortune ranked Brown the sixth highest paid woman in 2010, with over $16 million in total compensation.[11] Effective April 13, 2011, Brown kept her title of senior vice president for Google, but business operations and human resources were moved under chief financial officer Patrick Pichette.[2][12] She was became a senior vice president for the Google.org charitable group (following Megan Smith) from April 2011 to December 2012.[13] In early 2013 she stepped down to become an advisor to Google and other companies. In November 2015, she joined the board of Atlassian.[14]
Brown is a director of the non-profit organizations such as San Francisco Jazz Organization, the Bridgespan Group and the Exploratorium. Brown also served on the board of PepsiCo.[15]

Patching - Restitching business portfolios in dynamic markets
HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW

EISENHARDT, K. M., Brown, S. L.

1999; 77 (3): 72-?


Abstract
In turbulent markets, businesses and opportunities are constantly falling out of alignment. New technologies and emerging markets create fresh opportunities. Converging markets produce more. And of course, some markets fade. In this landscape of continuous flux, it's more important to build corporate-level strategic processes that enable dynamic repositioning than it is to build any particular defensible position. That's why smart corporate strategists use patching, a process of mapping and remapping business units to create a shifting mix of highly focused, tightly aligned businesses that can respond to changing market opportunities. Patching is not just another name for reorganizing; patchers have a distinctive mindset. Traditional managers see structure as stable; patching managers believe structure is inherently temporary. Traditional managers set corporate strategy first, but patching managers keep the organization focused on the right set of business opportunities and let strategy emerge from individual businesses. Although the focus of patching is flexibility, the process itself follows a pattern. Patching changes are usually small in scale and made frequently. Patching should be done quickly; the emphasis is on getting the patch about right and fixing problems later. Patches should have a test drive before they're formalized but then be tightly scripted after they've been announced. And patching won't work without the right infrastructure: modular business units, fine-grained and complete unit-level metrics, and companywide compensation parity. The authors illustrate how patching works and point out some common stumbling blocks.

Time pacing: Competing in markets that won't stand still
HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW

Abstract
Most companies change in reaction to events such as moves by the competition, shifts in technology, or new customer demands. In fairly stable markets, "event pacing" is an effective way to deal with change. But successful companies in rapidly changing, intensely competitive industries take a different approach. They change proactively, through regular deadlines. The authors call this strategy time pacing. Like a metronome, time pacing creates a rhythm to which managers can synchronize the speed and intensity of their efforts. For example, 3M dictates that 25% of its revenues every year will come from new products, Netscape introduces a new product about every six months, and Intel adds a new fabrication facility to its operations approximately every nine months. Time pacing creates a relentless sense of urgency around meeting deadlines and concentrates people on a common set of goals. Its predictability also provides people with a sense of control in otherwise chaotic markets. The authors show how companies such as Banc One, Cisco Systems, Dell Computer, Emerson Electric, Gillette, Intel, Netscape, Shiseido, and Sony implement the two essentials of time pacing. The first is managing transitions--the shift, for example, from one new-product-development project to the next. The second is setting the right rhythm for change. Companies that march to the rhythm of time pacing build momentum, and companies that effectively manage transitions sustain that momentum without missing important beats.

How management teams can have a good fight
HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW

EISENHARDT, K. M., Kahwajy, J. L., BOURGEOIS, L. J.

1997; 75 (4): 77-?


Abstract
Top-level managers know that conflict over issues is natural and even necessary. Management teams that challenge one another's thinking develop a more complete understanding of their choices, create a richer range of options, and make better decisions. But the challenge--familiar to anyone who has ever been part of a management team--is to keep constructive conflict over issues from degenerating into interpersonal conflict. From their research on the interplay of conflict, politics, and speed in the decision--making process of management teams, the authors have distilled a set of six tactics characteristic of high-performing teams: They work with more, rather than less, information. They develop multiple alternatives to enrich debate. The establish common goals. They make an effort to inject humor into the workplace. They maintain a balanced corporate power structure. They resolve issues without forcing a consensus. These tactics work because they keep conflict focused on issues; foster collaborative, rather than competitive, relations among team members; and create a sense of fairness in the decision-making process. Without conflict, groups lose their effectiveness. Managers often become withdrawn and only superficially harmonious. The alternative to conflict is not usually agreement but rather apathy and disengagement, which open the doors to a primary cause of major corporate debacles: groupthink.

Shona Brown - Wikipedia






















 






Shona Brown

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

For the African American author, see Shonia Brown.




Shona Brown in 2007


Shona L. Brown (born circa 1966) is a business executive and consultant to non-profits and corporations. She was a Google executive from 2003 to the end of 2012 when she was the senior vice president of business operations.[1][2][3]
Life[edit]
Brown has a bachelor of computer systems engineering from Carleton University in Canada and a master's degree in economics and philosophy from the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. Brown received her Ph.D from Stanford University's department of industrial engineering and engineering management, where she also did postdoctoral work on business theory.[4] From October 1995 to August 2003, Brown was at McKinsey & Company, a management consulting firm, as a partner in the Los Angeles office since December 2000.[5][1] In 1998, she published the book Competing on the Edge: Strategy as Structured Chaos, with co-author Kathleen M. Eisenhardt, her doctoral advisor at Stanford.[6][7]
Brown joined Google in September 2003 and took on the responsibility of building both the people operations and business operations groups. In January 2006, she was promoted to senior vice president,[1] and CNN included Brown as one of four rising stars in their most powerful women in business section,[8] as a journalist called her Google's "chief chaos officer", testing her business theories at the company.[9] In October 2007 she was involved with an illegal non-solicitation compact to not poach engineers from Apple Inc.[10][3]
Fortune ranked Brown the sixth highest paid woman in 2010, with over $16 million in total compensation.[11] Effective April 13, 2011, Brown kept her title of senior vice president for Google, but business operations and human resources were moved under chief financial officer Patrick Pichette.[2][12] She was became a senior vice president for the Google.org charitable group (following Megan Smith) from April 2011 to December 2012.[13] In early 2013 she stepped down to become an advisor to Google and other companies. In November 2015, she joined the board of Atlassian.[14]
Brown is a director of the non-profit organizations such as San Francisco Jazz Organization, the Bridgespan Group and the Exploratorium. Brown also served on the board of PepsiCo.[15]

Shona Brown in 2007


Shona L. Brown (born circa 1966) is a business executive and consultant to non-profits and corporations. She was a Google executive from 2003 to the end of 2012 when she was the senior vice president of business operations.[1][2][3]
Life[edit]
Brown has a bachelor of computer systems engineering from Carleton University in Canada and a master's degree in economics and philosophy from the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. Brown received her Ph.D from Stanford University's department of industrial engineering and engineering management, where she also did postdoctoral work on business theory.[4] From October 1995 to August 2003, Brown was at McKinsey & Company, a management consulting firm, as a partner in the Los Angeles office since December 2000.[5][1] In 1998, she published the book Competing on the Edge: Strategy as Structured Chaos, with co-author Kathleen M. Eisenhardt, her doctoral advisor at Stanford.[6][7]
Brown joined Google in September 2003 and took on the responsibility of building both the people operations and business operations groups. In January 2006, she was promoted to senior vice president,[1] and CNN included Brown as one of four rising stars in their most powerful women in business section,[8] as a journalist called her Google's "chief chaos officer", testing her business theories at the company.[9] In October 2007 she was involved with an illegal non-solicitation compact to not poach engineers from Apple Inc.[10][3]
Fortune ranked Brown the sixth highest paid woman in 2010, with over $16 million in total compensation.[11] Effective April 13, 2011, Brown kept her title of senior vice president for Google, but business operations and human resources were moved under chief financial officer Patrick Pichette.[2][12] She was became a senior vice president for the Google.org charitable group (following Megan Smith) from April 2011 to December 2012.[13] In early 2013 she stepped down to become an advisor to Google and other companies. In November 2015, she joined the board of Atlassian.[14]
Brown is a director of the non-profit organizations such as San Francisco Jazz Organization, the Bridgespan Group and the Exploratorium. Brown also served on the board of PepsiCo.[15]

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
