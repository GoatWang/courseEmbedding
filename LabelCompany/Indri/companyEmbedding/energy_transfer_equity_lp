CORPORATE OVERVIEW
Energy Transfer is a Texas-based company that began in 1995 as a small intrastate natural gas pipeline operator and is now one of the largest and most diversified investment grade master limited partnerships in the United States. Growing from roughly 200 miles of natural gas pipelines in 2002 to more than 71,000 miles of natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGLs), refined products, and crude oil pipelines today, the Energy Transfer family of partnerships remains dedicated to providing exceptional service to its customers and attractive returns to its investors.
Through several transformative transactions, we have expanded our scope of services. While we remain committed to the natural gas industry, we enhanced our diversified portfolio of assets by making a strategic entrance into the NGL business through the acquisition of Louis Dreyfus’ NGL storage, fractionation and transportation operations in 2011. In 2012, we acquired Southern Union Company, a leading diversified natural gas company, which expanded our national footprint and added more than 20,000 miles of gathering and transportation pipelines to our portfolio. We made a strong entrance into the crude oil and refined products business by acquiring Sunoco, Inc. in 2012, including its interest in Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P. 
(NYSE: SXL). Lastly, through the merger with Regency Energy Partners in 2015, we significantly diversified our footprint, both geographically and across business lines. We expanded our reach in the refined products and convenience store business with the acquisition of Susser Holdings Corporation, including its interest in Susser Petroleum Partners LP, 
(now Sunoco LP - NYSE: SUN). In April 2017, Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics Partners merged, with the combined company now called Energy Transfer Partners, creating one of the largest MLPs by Enterprise Value with a fully integrated midstream/liquids platform. These acquisitions, together with our already robust asset base, have enabled Energy Transfer to become a premier provider of services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, and refined products.
Today, there are four publicly traded partnerships in the Energy Transfer Family.

Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. 
 (NYSE: ETP) is a master limited partnership that owns and operates one of the largest and most diversified portfolios of energy assets in the United States. Strategically positioned in all of the major U.S. production basins, ETP owns and operates a geographically diverse portfolio of complementary natural gas midstream, intrastate and interstate transportation and storage assets; crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGL) and refined product transportation and terminalling assets; NGL fractionation; and various acquisition and marketing assets.  ETP’s general partner is owned by Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. 
 (NYSE: ETE).

(NYSE: ETE) is a master limited partnership that owns the general partner and 100% of the incentive distribution rights (IDRs) of Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. 
(NYSE: ETP) and Sunoco LP

CORPORATE OVERVIEW
Energy Transfer is a Texas-based company that began in 1995 as a small intrastate natural gas pipeline operator and is now one of the largest and most diversified investment grade master limited partnerships in the United States. Growing from roughly 200 miles of natural gas pipelines in 2002 to more than 71,000 miles of natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGLs), refined products, and crude oil pipelines today, the Energy Transfer family of partnerships remains dedicated to providing exceptional service to its customers and attractive returns to its investors.
Through several transformative transactions, we have expanded our scope of services. While we remain committed to the natural gas industry, we enhanced our diversified portfolio of assets by making a strategic entrance into the NGL business through the acquisition of Louis Dreyfus’ NGL storage, fractionation and transportation operations in 2011. In 2012, we acquired Southern Union Company, a leading diversified natural gas company, which expanded our national footprint and added more than 20,000 miles of gathering and transportation pipelines to our portfolio. We made a strong entrance into the crude oil and refined products business by acquiring Sunoco, Inc. in 2012, including its interest in Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P. 
(NYSE: SXL). Lastly, through the merger with Regency Energy Partners in 2015, we significantly diversified our footprint, both geographically and across business lines. We expanded our reach in the refined products and convenience store business with the acquisition of Susser Holdings Corporation, including its interest in Susser Petroleum Partners LP, 
(now Sunoco LP - NYSE: SUN). In April 2017, Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics Partners merged, with the combined company now called Energy Transfer Partners, creating one of the largest MLPs by Enterprise Value with a fully integrated midstream/liquids platform. These acquisitions, together with our already robust asset base, have enabled Energy Transfer to become a premier provider of services to producers and consumers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, and refined products.
Today, there are four publicly traded partnerships in the Energy Transfer Family.

Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. 
 (NYSE: ETP) is a master limited partnership that owns and operates one of the largest and most diversified portfolios of energy assets in the United States.

ETP’s general partner is owned by Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. 
 (NYSE: ETE).

Forget Energy Transfer Equity, L.P.: Here Are 3 Better Dividend Stocks
There’s something to be said for an easy-to-understand investment.











                Matthew DiLallo
            

                (TMFmd19)



            
            Feb 3, 2016 at 12:07PM
            
            





Energy Transfer Equity (NYSE:ETE) can be a very complex company to understand because its income is derived from its ownership interests in a number of affiliated MLPs. For a lot of investors, this complexity alone is a turnoff. However, it actually makes it harder for its MLPs to grow because it adds to their costs, which is why investors might want to look at some better options.
Making sense of Energy Transfer Equity The following slide details the organizational structure of Energy Transfer Equity once it closes its acquisition of Williams Companies later this year:

Source: Energy Transfer Equity Investor Presentation.
The above chart makes it a bit more straightforward to understand Energy Transfer Equity because it's really an investment in its affiliated MLPs. At the moment, this includes Energy Transfer Partners (NYSE:ETP), Sunoco, and Sunoco Logistics Partners. However, there is more to the story here, which is best left to the company to explain.
In one of its recent press releases, Energy Transfer Equity says that it "owns the general partner and 100% of the incentive distribution rights (IDRs) of Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco, approximately 2.6 million ETP common units, approximately 81.0 million ETP Class H Units, which track 90% of the underlying economics of the general partner interest and IDRs of Sunoco Logistics Partners, and 100 ETP Class I Units." While that's pretty tough to comprehend, what it means is that Energy Transfer Equity is pulling fees from its MLPs through a variety of different sources.





In one sense, that's a pretty good deal for Energy Transfer Equity; however, as I'll show in a moment, midstream companies that have a much simpler ownership structure have a big strategic advantage over this complex peer.
The one-stop shops That simpler model is the stand-alone master limited partnership, which includes midstream companies that have done away with the complexity of the general partner by acquiring this entity. The top three in this category are Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD), Magellan Midstream Partners (NYSE:MMP), and Buckeye Partners (NYSE:BPL).
Magellan Midstream Partners was the first in the group to simplify its structure after it acquired its general partner in 2009. At the time, the company said that the transaction would lower its costs of capital to make it more competitive for future acquisition and expansion opportunities, as well as reduce the administrative costs associated with operating a second publicly traded entity. It was followed the next year by Buckeye Partners and Enterprise Products Partners; both companies cited the lower capital costs they'd incur after buying out their general partners.
What these companies found was that paying out the general partner fees and incentive distribution rights were costing their investors a lot of money in the long run. These fees to their general partners left them with not only less cash to pay their own investors, but virtually no cash to reinvest into their businesses and fund growth projects.





Instead, they had to turn to the capital markets for this cash, issuing more units or debt to raise the cash needed to fund growth investments. This was not only really dilutive to current investors, but increased the hurdle rate for future growth. Not only that, but issuing debt and equity has become much harder to do in recent months because of the downturn in the energy market. 
Today, these companies actually have a competitive advantage over peers such as Energy Transfer Partners that are still tied to their general partner because they don't need to access the capital markets quite as frequently. That's clear from the following chart, which shows a much slower growth rate for outstanding units:

ETP Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Quarterly) data by YCharts.
Further, not only have all three issued far fewer units than Energy Transfer Partners, but each has grown their distributions by a rate that's at least as fast, if not faster, than Energy Transfer Equity's namesake MLP. This trio has also issued less debt because they are retaining more cash, which has resulted in each maintaining an investment grade credit rating, with Enterprise Products Partners and Magellan Midstream both rated BBB+, and Buckeye Partners is BBB-.





While Energy Transfer Partners also owns an investment grade credit rating at BBB-, it's at risk of being downgraded to below investment grade because of its weaker cash flow and coverage ratio. Below investment grade is actually where we find Energy Transfer Equity; it was slapped with a BB credit rating due to concerns over its debt. In other words, not only is the added complexity harder for investors to understand, but it has acted as a financial weight on this organization.
Investor takeaway Energy Transfer Equity is one of the more complex energy companies because it's the general partner to a growing number of MLPs. That adds a lot more work for investors, and also makes it harder on its own MLPs to compete. Investors who want to avoid this added complexity, and all that goes with it, should instead take a look at stand-alone MLPs Enterprise Products Partners, Magellan Midstream Partners, and Buckeye Partners.

About Energy Transfer Equity, L.P.

   Energy Transfer Equity transfers natural gas and other energy resources through its massive pipelines running across the country. The company acts as the general partner of Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) and Regency Energy Partners. Through these operations, and through Sunoco and Southern Union, the company owns natural gas pipelines all over the country and a crude oil pipeline with the capacity of around 12,300 miles. All in all, Energy Transfer Equity's  family of companies owns 71,000 miles of natural gas, natural gas liquids, refined products, and crude pipelines. In 2015 Energy Transfer Equity agreed to buy Tulsa-based Williams Companies in a $37.7 billion merger, but the deal fell through in 2016.
   Operations

   The company has four reportable segments: Investment in ETP (including the consolidated operations of ETP; Investment in Sunoco LP, including the consolidated operations of Sunoco LP; Investment in Lake Charles LNG, including the operations of Lake Charles LNG; and Corporate and Other.
  

   The largest segment, Investment in ETP accounted for 67% of total revenues in 2015; Investment in Sunoco LP, 33% .
  

   The company divides its revenues across six channels. Refined product sales accounted for 37% of its revenues in 2015 while crude sales generated 20%. Other segments include natural gas (9%); NGL sales (9%); gathering, transportation and other fees (10%); and other (15%).
  

   Through its Energy Transfer Partners GP unit, Energy Transfer Equity owns a 2% general partnership stake in Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) and about 26% of common stock. Energy Transfer Equity is managed by general partner LE GP, LLC. ETP operates as a conglomerator in the fragmented pipeline and propane industries. It has more than 45,000 miles of natural gas pipelines and 30.7 billion cu. ft. per day of natural gas transportation capacity.
  

   Energy Transfer Equity's family of companies owns and operates 71,000 miles of natural gas, natural gas liquids, refined products, and crude oil pipelines.
  
 Regency Energy Partners, of which Energy Transfer Equity is the general partner, is a publicly traded partnership engaged in the gathering, processing, contract compression, treating, and transportation of natural gas, and the transportation, fractionation, and storage of NGLs. Its operations are run through about eight segments: Intrastate Transportation and Storage, Midstream, NGL Transportation and Services, Retail Marketing, and Sunoco, and Regency Energy Partners.
  

   During 2015 Energy Transfer Equity's consolidated subsidiaries, Trunkline LNG Company, LLC, Trunkline LNG Export, LLC and Susser Petroleum Partners LP, changed their names to Lake Charles LNG Company, LLC, Lake Charles LNG Export, LLC and Sunoco LP, respectively.
  
Geographic Reach

   Energy Transfer Equity has more than 400 locations in about 40 US states.
  
Sales and Marketing

   ETP's retail marketing business operations are conducted through various wholly-owned subsidiaries as well as through Sunoco LP, which ETP controls through its ownership of the general partner.
  

   ETP's counterparties consist of a diverse portfolio of customers across the energy industry, including petrochemical companies, commercial and industrial manufacturers, oil and gas producers, municipalities, gas and electric utilities, and midstream companies.
  

   The company sells natural gas to utilities, industrial consumers, other marketers and pipeline companies. Its retail marketing segment sells gasoline and diesel in addition to a broad mix of merchandise such as groceries, fast foods and beverages at its convenience stores. A portion of our gasoline and diesel sales are to wholesale customers on a consignment basis,
  

   ETP's retail marketing and wholesale distribution operations include the following activities conducted in 30 US states: the sale of motor fuel (gasoline and diesel) and merchandise at company-operated retail locations and branded convenience stores ;and the distribution of gasoline, diesel, and other petroleum products to convenience stores, independent dealers, distributors, and other commercial customers.
  

   The unit's retail marketing operations have a portfolio of outlets operating under three channels of trade: company-operated, dealer-operated and distributor-operated sites.
  

   The company has 900 company operated convenience stores and fuel outlets, including 725 Stripes convenience stores; 438 Sunoco-operated convenience stores and retail fuel outlets; 147 independently operated consignment locations; 5,323 convenience stores and retail fuel outlets operated by independent operators; and 1,930 other commercial customers, including unbranded convenience stores.
  
Financial Performance

   In 2015 Energy Transfer Equity's net revenues decreased by 24% due to lower investment in ETP.
  

   Revenue from the Investment in ETP segment dropped due to a decrease in retail marketing operations, caused by the deconsolidation of Sunoco LP as a result of the sale of Sunoco LP's general partner interest due to unfavorable fuel margins, and due to unfavorable volumes in the retail and wholesale channels, partially offset by favorable impact from the acquisition of Susser in August 2014 and from other recent acquisitions.
  

   Midstream operations decreased due to a lower non-fee based margins for natural gas and decrease in non-fee based margins for crude oil and NGL as the result of  lower natural gas, crude oil, and NGL prices.
  

   Transportation and storage operations declined as a result of higher basis differentials driven by colder weather, lower revenues due to the expiration of a transportation rate schedule, and lower sales of gas due to lower prices.
  

   Revenues also decreased due to lower natural gas sales, NGL sales, crude sales, gathering, transportation and other fees, fefined product sales, and others.
  

   In 2015 Energy Transfer Equity's net income jumped by 88% due to a decrease in the cost of sales and a benefit from income tax.
  

   Cash from operating activities declined by 3% due to the changes in inventory valuation adjustments, losses on extinguishments of debt, and non-cash compensation expense.
  
Strategy

   The company has grown through large complementary acquisitions.
  

   ETP and Regency each have strategies that contemplate growth through the development and acquisition of a wide range of midstream and other energy infrastructure assets. These strategies include constructing and acquiring additional assets and businesses to enhance their ability to compete effectively and diversify their respective asset portfolios, thereby providing more stable cash flow. ETP and Regency regularly consider and enter into discussions regarding the acquisition of additional assets and businesses, stand-alone development projects or other transactions that ETP and Regency believe will present opportunities to realize synergies and increase cash flow.
  

   In  2014 Energy Transfer Equity, ETP and Phillips 66 formed two joint ventures to develop the previously announced Dakota Access Pipeline and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline  projects. ETP and ETE hold an aggregate interest of 75% in each joint venture and ETP operates both pipeline systems. Phillips 66 owns the remaining 25% interests and funds its proportionate share of the construction costs.
  
Mergers and Acquisitions

   In a major industry consolidation move, in 2015 Energy Transfer Equity agreed to buy Williams Companies in a $37.7 billion deal.
  

   In 2015 ETP and Regency entered into a definitive merger agreement, pursuant to which Regency will merge with a wholly-owned subsidiary of ETP, with Regency continuing as the surviving entity and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of ETP.
  

   In 2015 ETP acquired Susser Holdings Corporation for $1.9 billion. By acquiring Susser Holdings, ETP will own the general partner  interest and the incentive distribution rights in Susser (50.2 % of its shares), and Susser's existing retail operations (630 convenience stores).
  

   In 2014 Regency acquired Eagle Rock's midstream business for $1.3 billion. This acquisition complements Regency's core gathering and processing business and further diversifies Regency's basin exposure in the Texas Panhandle, east Texas and south Texas.
  

   Regency acquired PVR for 5.7 billion in 2014. The PVR acquisition enhanced Regency's geographic diversity with a strategic presence in the Marcellus and Utica shales in the Appalachian Basin and the Granite Wash in the Mid-Continent region.
  
Company Background

   In 2012 Energy Transfer Equity bought diversified gas player Southern Union for $9.4 billion (including $3.7 billion in debt). The acquisition made Energy Transfer Equity one of the largest natural gas infrastructure companies in the US.
  

   That year the company also completed a $2 billion merger of a wholly owned Energy Transfer Partners subsidiary with and into Southern Union subsidiary CrossCountry Energy, LLC, which owns an indirect 50% interest in Citrus Corp., the owner of the Florida Gas Transmission pipeline system. After the merger, CrossCountry Energy remained as the surviving entity, a wholly owned subsidiary of Energy Transfer Partners.
  

   In 2010 Energy Transfer Equity acquired the general partner stake of Regency Energy Partners and sold a 49.9% stake in its Midcontinent Express Pipeline to that company. The move was seen as a way for the company to diversify its general partner operations with the aim of getting a better return for shareholders. Regency Energy Partners focuses on the gathering, processing, marketing, and transportation of natural gas and natural gas liquids in Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, and Texas.
  

   Energy Transfer Equity was formed in 2002 as La Grange Energy, a Texas limited partnership. In early 2005 it changed its name to Energy Transfer Company. In August 2005 it converted from a Texas limited partnership to a Delaware limited partnership and became Energy Transfer Equity.

	ENERGY TRANSFER EQUITY






	REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS









	Dallas - May 3, 2017


	 -


	Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. (NYSE:ETE)


	 (“ETE” or the “Partnership”) today reported financial results for the quarter ended


	March 31, 2017


	.




	ETE’s net income attributable to partners was


	$239 million


	 for the three months ended


	March 31, 2017


	 compared to


	$312 million


	 for the three months ended


	March 31, 2016


	. Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, for the three months ended


	March 31, 2017


	 was


	$215 million


	 compared to


	$349 million


	 for the three months ended


	March 31, 2016


	. The decreases in net income attributable to partners and Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, were primarily driven by a $105 million reduction in incentive distributions from ETP. As previously reported, ETE has agreed to a reduction in incentive distributions from ETP in the aggregate amount of $720 million over a period of seven quarters, beginning the quarter ended June 30, 2016.




	The Partnership’s recent key accomplishments and other developments include the following:













	•






	In April 2017, ETE announced a $0.285 distribution per ETE common unit for the quarter ended


	March 31, 2017


	, or $1.14 per unit on an annualized basis.
















	•






	In March 2017, ETE invested $300 million in Sunoco LP through a preferred equity private placement, and Sunoco LP used the proceeds to repay borrowings under its revolving credit facility.
















	•






	In February 2017, the Partnership entered into an equity distribution agreement with an aggregate offering price up to $1 billion. There was no activity under the distribution agreements for the


	three months ended




	March 31, 2017


	.


















	•






	In January 2017, ETE issued 32.2 million common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership to certain institutional investors in a private transaction for gross proceeds of approximately $580 million, which ETE used to purchase 15.8 million newly issued Energy Transfer, LP (“ETP”) common units.
















	•






	As of


	March 31, 2017


	, ETE’s


	$1.5 billion


	 revolving credit facility had


	$1.15 billion


	 of outstanding borrowings and its leverage ratio, as defined by the credit agreement, was 3.88x.







	The Partnership has scheduled a conference call for 8:00 a.m. Central Time, Thursday, May 4, 2017 to discuss its first quarter 2017 results. The conference call will be broadcast live via an internet webcast, which can be accessed through


	www.energytransfer.com


	 and will also be available for replay on the Partnership’s website for a limited time.






	The Partnership’s principal sources of cash flow are derived from distributions related to its direct and indirect investments in the limited and general partner interests in Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. (“Post-Merger ETP”), including 100% of ETP’s incentive distribution rights, ETP Common Units and ETP Class I Units, limited and general partner interest in Sunoco LP, including Sunoco LP Common Units, as well as the Partnership’s ownership of Lake Charles LNG. In connection with the merger of ETP and Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P. (“Sunoco Logistics”), the ETP Class H units were cancelled, and ETE now owns 27.5 million Post-Merger ETP Common Units (representing 2.5% of the total outstanding Post-Merger ETP common units) and 100 Post-Merger ETP Class I units. The Partnership’s primary cash requirements are for general and administrative expenses, debt service requirements and distributions to its partners.

	This press release and accompanying schedules include the non-generally accepted accounting principle (“non-GAAP”) financial measures of Distributable Cash Flow, and Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted. The Partnership’s non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP financial measures such as net income, cash flow from operating activities or any other GAAP measure of liquidity or financial performance.







	Distributable Cash Flow and Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted.


	  The Partnership defines Distributable Cash Flow and Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, for a period as cash distributions expected to be received in respect of such period in connection with the Partnership’s investments in limited and general partner interests, net of the Partnership’s cash expenditures for general and administrative costs and interest expense. The Partnership’s definitions of Distributable Cash Flow and Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, also include distributable cash flow from Lake Charles LNG to the Partnership. For Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, certain transaction-related expenses that are included in net income are excluded.




	Distributable Cash Flow is a significant liquidity measure used by the Partnership’s senior management to compare net cash flows generated by the Partnership to the distributions the Partnership expects to pay its unitholders. Due to cash expenses incurred from time to time in connection with the Partnership’s merger and acquisition activities and other transactions, Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, is also a significant liquidity measure used by the Partnership’s senior management to compare net cash flows generated by the Partnership to the distributions the Partnership expects to pay its unitholders. Using these measures, the Partnership’s management can compute the coverage ratio of estimated cash flows for a period to planned cash distributions for such period.




	Distributable Cash Flow and Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, are also important non-GAAP financial measures for our limited partners since these indicate to investors whether the Partnership’s investments are generating cash flows at a level that can sustain or support an increase in quarterly cash distribution levels. Financial measures such as Distributable Cash Flow and Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, are quantitative standards used by the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships because the value of a partnership unit is in part measured by its yield (which in turn is based on the amount of cash distributions a partnership can pay to a unitholder). The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Distributable Cash Flow, and Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, is net income for ETE on a stand-alone basis (the “Parent Company”).




	Distribution Coverage Ratio.


	  The Partnership defines Distribution Coverage Ratio for a period as Distributable Cash Flow, as adjusted, divided by total cash distributions expected to be paid to the partners of ETE in respect of such period.
