	Dear Vitacost.com Customer:
We regret to inform you that Burt’s Bees, which is owned by parent company Clorox, has decided to stop selling their products through Vitacost.com. Neither Clorox nor Burt’s Bees offered an explanation for this change, other than saying that selling through our website is not “consistent” with their current strategy.
	We find it unfortunate that you will no longer be able to benefit from the convenience of online delivery of this product, as well as Vitacost.com’s competitive pricing.

New Chapter Combines Nature’s Wisdom & Science for Supplements You Can Trust

If you’re familiar with New Chapter, the Vermont-based vitamin and supplement company that was founded in 1982, you probably know their remarkable dedication to sourcing the best ingredients for health in environmentally responsible ways.
New Chapter believes the best way to deliver the healing wisdom of nature is through effective, high-quality products that acknowledge not only the latest science, but are also inspired by time-tested herbal tradition. New Chapter has vowed to only introduce products that will make meaningful contributions-products that are new chapters for holistic health.
Inspired by nature, validated by science
New Chapter’s uncompromising dedication to quality and Mother Earth goes all the way back to their roots. New Chapter® was founded in 1982 by Paul and Barbi Schulick out of a desire to bring the remarkable value of nature’s botanicals into people’s lives. From the beginning, Paul and Barbi made a firm commitment to utilizing each whole plant in its pure, unadulterated form.
Nature, in its wholeness, offers a profound opportunity for supporting well-being!
What sets New Chapter apart
Sourcing the ideal ingredients is key in the production of New Chapter supplements. The company travels the globe for herbs, vegetables, mushrooms and fruits that meet strict standards for purity, potency and especially sustainable sourcing. And these ingredients are bursting with nourishment-organic turmeric from India in Turmeric Force™, wild-caught salmon from Alaska’s clean waters in Wholemega™, 10 potent herbs in clinically studied Zyflamend™ Whole Body and sustainably harvested plant calcium from Iceland in Bone Strength Take Care™. 
New Chapter is also a fermentation pioneer. In 1986 they began creating fermented multivitamins that are easily digestible and gentle on the stomach. Their proven, two-step fermentation method uses the power of clinically studied probiotics to bring vitality to each nutrient and unlock its health benefits. Fermentation creates a nutritious fermentate and unleashes Nature’s immune-boosters called beta glucans. Today, New Chapter makes holistic multivitamins for every stage of life, including prenatal and postnatal support.
 Plus New Chapter became a Certified B Corporation in 2014. B Corps are a vibrant new kind of business that define success not just in terms of profit, but in terms of people and planet.
Discover the New Chapter difference
Just as you might check foods for organic and non-GMO labeling, you can confirm the credentials of New Chapter vitamins and supplements the same way. New Chapter multivitamins are made with third-party certified organic vegetables and herbs, and they’re verified by the Non-GMO Project. You can find the Non-GMO Project Verified seal on Zyflamend™ Whole Body, on all New Chapter herbals and herbal blends, on LifeShield™ mushrooms and on their plant calcium, too.
Paul and Barbi’s mission today remains still the same: to deliver the wisdom of nature to all those seeking natural wellness. Check out New Chapter’s whole family of products and experience your own new chapter in holistic health!

Ask away.  We have answers.



Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

The LegalZoom 3-step process was developed by attorneys from some of the most prestigious law firms in America. There are no complex instructions to follow and nothing to download or print. Simply answer a few questions and get started on
              setting up your corporation.

We Create and File Your Incorporation Papers

We even create company-specific bylaws and organizational minutes.
Final Wrap-Up
						When we receive your filed Articles of Incorporation back from the state, we send them to you along with the rest of your formation documents, as well as easy instructions regarding next steps.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Suffering is Hard.. 
Suffering is always hard to quantify - especially when the pain is caused by as cruel a disease as Alzheimer's. Most illnesses attack the body; Alzheimer's destroys the mind - and in the process, annihilates the very self.

About


Mission
Cerebain Biotech (OTC: CBBT) is a development-stage medical device company focused on the creation and clinical development of a minimally invasive implantable device. The device leverages the clinically observable, positive impact that omentum stimulation has on cognitive function as related to dementias, and in particular, Alzheimer’s disease.
The corporate vision is based on these positive clinical observations. These impacts were so compelling they led to the use of a highly invasive surgical procedure that successfully improved brain function in virtually all of the observed patients. The risks associated with the procedure, however, rendered it all but obsolete.
In 2010 Cerebain Biotech licensed patent-pending technology for an implantable device that stimulates the omentum, and can be adjusted non-invasively to account for a range of factors, including frequency, strength of stimulation and location.
 
Company Overview
Existing therapeutics have been unable to halt disease progression or extend life in a meaningful way
Cerebain’s novel device approach is supported by research and patient outcomes
Clinical evidence supports the Company’s working approach, that omentum stimulation improves cognitive function in patients with dementia, including Alzheimer’s Disease
Minimally invasive, one-time device implantation will overcome challenges associated with previous omentum stimulation procedures that are highly invasive
Patent-pending technology with broad applicability
Recent scientific breakthroughs regarding the potential identification of gene-specific protein increases prior to on-set of symptoms, could compliment our work
Early diagnosis is key to helping patients maintain quality of life http://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/publication/alzheimers-disease-genetics-fact-sheet
Experienced management and advisory teams with the expertise to move the clinical program forward efficiently and effectively
 
Corporate Leadership
 
Eric Clemons, President and CEO
e-mail:  clemons@cerebain.com
Mr. Clemons has a long history building and growing companies across multiple industries. Prior to assuming leadership of Cerebain, he served as President and Chief Operating Officer for GTC Telecom Corp, a publicly traded Nevada Corporation that operated out of Costa Mesa, CA. During his tenure, Mr. Clemons was instrumental in growing the company’s annual revenues from $500,000 per year to over $17 million per year.
It was Cerebain technology, which offers a completely new way of approaching the development of an effective Alzheimer’s disease treatment that captured Mr. Clemons’ imagination, triggering his move into the life sciences arena.
“While there have been some very recent key learnings in the Alzheimer’s treatment space, the fact is that the disease remains the only top ten killer in the United States with no effective treatments currently available and no way to halt or slow progression,” Clemons said. “We are hopeful that our device, which will focus on the impact of omental stimulation and cognitive function in Alzheimer’s Disease patients, can change that.”
Wesley Tate – Chief Financial Officer
e-mail:  wtate@cerebain.com
Prior to joining Cerebain Biotech, Mr. Tate was the owner of Strategic Business Associates, a Tennessee-based consultancy offering business management and growth services to start-up and early-stage companies.
Over the course of his career Mr. Tate has held key managerial positions at both healthcare and telecoms companies. This includes HST Global, Inc., (CFO) a development-state biotechnology company in Virginia; and Director of Operations for The Health Network, Inc., a Health and Wellness company also located in Virginia.
Mr. Tate received his Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, with majors in Finance and Psychology, and earned his Masters of Business Administration from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, with concentrations in Finance and Management.
He is proud to have served his country as a member of the United States Army.

Download our Corporate Executive Summary
The Imperative that Drives Us
There is a clear need to develop new approaches in the fight against Alzheimer’s Disease.
Current treatment options have little impact on the life of the patient, or the two-to-four unpaid caregivers each patient needs to care for them.
Cerebain has the critical intellectual property, management and development experience and expertise, the passion and the drive to put its clinical and regulatory strategies in place and execute against them.
Our vision: Forge a new and more effective path forward in this fight against a killer that robs every victim of past and future.

Our Approach
Cerebain has a patent-pending device that is implanted in the omentum, a protective layer of skin that protects the abdominal organs.  The device is designed to stimulate the omentum in patients with Alzheimer’s Disease.  Omental stimulation has been shown to improve cognitive function in patients with dementias, including Alzheimer’s Disease.  
Cerebain will evaluate the effect of omental stimulation at different intervals and levels of stimulation to determine the device’s ability to slow, stop or reverse the progression of Alzheimer’s Disease on patients.
About the Omentum
Generally described as a protective layer in the abdomen, the omentum covers the intestines, hangs on to the stomach and can be lifted like a flap.   While the omentum is not a well-recognized body part, it can play important healing and protective roles for its host.
Protection: The omentum has abundant blood and lymphatic vessels, and can move flexibly throughout the abdomen to protect organs from threat and injury. 
Healing: Additionally, it contains the largest supply of stem cells in the adult body.  Because of its abundant blood supply, surgeons have long used the omentum to patch internal injuries sustained to other parts of the body.
Cerebain’s Technology
Patent-pending technology has allowed for the development of a medical device that can
be implanted using a minimally invasive procedure.
Once implanted via what will probably be a same-day surgery procedure, patients may not have to undergo surgery again using this treatment method.
Cerebain has a manufacturing agreement with Sonos Medical, a trusted and reliable medical device supplier.
Clinical Trials
The Company is now in the process of preparing for initial clinical trials that will most likely occur at multiple medical centers in Europe.
 
Potential for a Personalized Approach toTreatment for Alzheimer’s Disease Patients
As clinical trials are conducted and variables are put into play (e.g., frequency of stimulation, duration, location, etc.,) we may find that individuals respond differently and require individualized treatment plans.  Cerebain’s device can potentially provide this, making our ability to positively impact the lives of as many Alzheimer’s Disease patients as possible.

	Dear Vitacost.com Customer:
We regret to inform you that Burt’s Bees, which is owned by parent company Clorox, has decided to stop selling their products through Vitacost.com. Neither Clorox nor Burt’s Bees offered an explanation for this change, other than saying that selling through our website is not “consistent” with their current strategy.
	We find it unfortunate that you will no longer be able to benefit from the convenience of online delivery of this product, as well as Vitacost.com’s competitive pricing.

New Chapter Combines Nature’s Wisdom & Science for Supplements You Can Trust

If you’re familiar with New Chapter, the Vermont-based vitamin and supplement company that was founded in 1982, you probably know their remarkable dedication to sourcing the best ingredients for health in environmentally responsible ways.
New Chapter believes the best way to deliver the healing wisdom of nature is through effective, high-quality products that acknowledge not only the latest science, but are also inspired by time-tested herbal tradition. New Chapter has vowed to only introduce products that will make meaningful contributions-products that are new chapters for holistic health.
Inspired by nature, validated by science
New Chapter’s uncompromising dedication to quality and Mother Earth goes all the way back to their roots. New Chapter® was founded in 1982 by Paul and Barbi Schulick out of a desire to bring the remarkable value of nature’s botanicals into people’s lives. From the beginning, Paul and Barbi made a firm commitment to utilizing each whole plant in its pure, unadulterated form.
Nature, in its wholeness, offers a profound opportunity for supporting well-being!
What sets New Chapter apart
Sourcing the ideal ingredients is key in the production of New Chapter supplements. The company travels the globe for herbs, vegetables, mushrooms and fruits that meet strict standards for purity, potency and especially sustainable sourcing. And these ingredients are bursting with nourishment-organic turmeric from India in Turmeric Force™, wild-caught salmon from Alaska’s clean waters in Wholemega™, 10 potent herbs in clinically studied Zyflamend™ Whole Body and sustainably harvested plant calcium from Iceland in Bone Strength Take Care™. 
New Chapter is also a fermentation pioneer. In 1986 they began creating fermented multivitamins that are easily digestible and gentle on the stomach. Their proven, two-step fermentation method uses the power of clinically studied probiotics to bring vitality to each nutrient and unlock its health benefits. Fermentation creates a nutritious fermentate and unleashes Nature’s immune-boosters called beta glucans. Today, New Chapter makes holistic multivitamins for every stage of life, including prenatal and postnatal support.
 Plus New Chapter became a Certified B Corporation in 2014. B Corps are a vibrant new kind of business that define success not just in terms of profit, but in terms of people and planet.
Discover the New Chapter difference
Just as you might check foods for organic and non-GMO labeling, you can confirm the credentials of New Chapter vitamins and supplements the same way. New Chapter multivitamins are made with third-party certified organic vegetables and herbs, and they’re verified by the Non-GMO Project. You can find the Non-GMO Project Verified seal on Zyflamend™ Whole Body, on all New Chapter herbals and herbal blends, on LifeShield™ mushrooms and on their plant calcium, too.
Paul and Barbi’s mission today remains still the same: to deliver the wisdom of nature to all those seeking natural wellness. Check out New Chapter’s whole family of products and experience your own new chapter in holistic health!

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.

It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Suffering is Hard.. 
Suffering is always hard to quantify - especially when the pain is caused by as cruel a disease as Alzheimer's. Most illnesses attack the body; Alzheimer's destroys the mind - and in the process, annihilates the very self.
