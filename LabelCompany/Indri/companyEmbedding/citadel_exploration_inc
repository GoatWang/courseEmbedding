				We believe the best place to find oil is where it has already been found.			










Corporate Overview



Citadel Exploration (OTCQB: COIL) is a pure-play California oil and gas company rooted in nearly a century of experience throughout the State, with four decades of focus on Kern County. CEO Armen Nahabedian is the fourth generation of a family that has found and developed some of the most significant discoveries in state history.
Citadel devotes its focus to Kern County, the largest producing county in the entire United States, accounting for over 140 million barrels per year, or 75% of the oil produced in California. Not only is Kern County oil-rich with a plethora infrastructure and service providers, but the County government has historically been very supportive of independent producers and prides itself in being business friendly. Currently, Citadel is developing two prospects in Kern County. The first, Kern Bluff, is a 1100-acre project with an estimated 60 million barrels of original oil in place. It will be developed with a combination of new vertical and horizontal wells, recompletions, andcyclic steam injection. The company also is continuing to develop its 3,000 acre Yowlumne area, a producing asset strategically located between several multi-million barrel fields, including Chevron’s historic Midway-Sunset field. Citadel prides itself on its legacy of discovery and innovation in the industry. We are committed to a plan of careful, deliberate growth tempering risk by focusing on historically successful projects.
The best place to find oil, is where it has already been found.

Four Generations - Citadel Exploration























































 














				We believe the best place to find oil is where it has already been found.			










Four Generations





The Nahabedian family’s legacy in the California oil business was nearly brief and inglorious one. It began with William Wallace Stabler’s venture from the Pennsylvania Dutch countryside to pursue life as a cowboy in the still Wild West, which soon led him to the Los Angeles basin in the early days of the oil boom.
He immediately took to the oil patch, first as a mule skinner, loading pipe in LA and hauling it to Santa Paula, CA, then the epicenter of the oil and gas industry. Young Bill took an interest in a well in lieu of payment for a load of pipe and soon was out of the pipe hauling business and wildcatting himself.
Bill soon expanded his focus to Huntington Beach and the San Joaquin Valley, site of the Lakeview Gusher, a blow-out that had flowed nine-million barrels of oil into a man-made lake over 18 months a decade earlier. In April of 1923, Stabler’s Globe Petroleum Company drilled Encyclopedia Well #3, reaching a total depth of 5,052 feet, the deepest producing oil well in the world at the time, flowing at rates in excess of 4,000 barrels per day. Globe’s Huntington Beach rigs soon dotted the surfside like wildflowers.
 




It was not long thereafter that Bill’s daughter, Katherine met Aramis Nahabedian, a hard-nosed entrepreneur in the rubbish business of East Los Angeles. Aramis took an immediate interest in his father in-law’s oil business. What he lacked in technical knowledge of the oil business he more than made up for with a tremendous business acumen he learned on the mean streets of Los Angeles. Without an education in geology, Aramis instead adopted the strategy of “closeology.” Go where oil had been found, acquire adjacent land, and drill. The best place to find oil is where it has already been found.




Bill lived out his days in a cabin near Fort Tejon, hunting and prospecting. Over his life, he was responsible for locating more than two hundred million barrels of oil. Over the next few decades, Aramis would befriend and employ many of the men who would one day become premiere oil finders in the state of California. Some of them continue to work with the family to this very day.
Oil now flowed in the Nahabedian family blood. Aramis and Katherine’s son, Mark Nahabedian, embarked as the third generation in the oil industry with a more scientific approach. He graduated from UCLA with a degree in geology and went to work prospecting across the San Joaquin, Sacramento and Salinas basins. His finds alone would prove to be enough of a legacy for the family, with discoveries at Landslide, Panama Lane, Hastings Ranch, Denverton Creek and many more. Mark Nahabedian also discovered Pastoria Creek Oilfield in 1988, the last major discovery on the Tejon Ranch that his grandfather previously had pioneered. Mark’s discoveries alone account for some two hundred million barrels of equivalent oil.


For Mark’s sons Armen, Vahagn and Mark Jr., the oil patch was the backdrop of childhood. Recycled maps and well logs were Christmas wrapping paper and trips to oilfields were common at a very early age. Mark educated Armen and his brothers in all aspects of the family business as soon as they learned to read and write.
After high school, Armen enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and served in Operation Iraqi Freedom as an infantryman and translator for his platoon. He witnessed firsthand the sacrifices that our servicemen have made for both Middle East democracy and the oil that supports the economy in the region. When he returned from the war, Armen officially entered the family business, The Nahabedian Exploration Group.


Borrowing from his grandfather, Armen also employed the strategy of closeology, embarking on his first lease as an offset to the famous Belridge Oil Field, where he drilled and completed his first discovery well, which was mapped and interpreted by his father. With the momentum of success, Armen rose quickly through the family business, becoming an operations manager then expanding his duties into land acquisition, business development and finance.
Today, Armen is the CEO of Citadel Exploration Inc, poised to begin re-exploring in the San Joaquin
The company’s mantra remains that of his grandfather: The best place to find oil, is where it has already been found.

Biographies


 Armen Nahabedian, President & CEO: A fourth generation California oil and gas explorer, Mr. Nahabedian grew up with geology and well logs as dinner table conversation. He joined his family’s oil company, Nahabedian Exploration Group (NEG), at age 22 and was almost immediately successful in his early exploration efforts. He soon became a regional supervisor, managing the drilling operations for some of the deepest exploratory wells in California in the mid 2000s. In 2007, Mr. Nahabedian joined NEG as a partner and supervised land acquisition efforts (over 750,000 acres leased or optioned) and prospect generation. He continued to act as an operational supervisor and took on additional responsibilities in business development and finance until the formation of Citadel. Mr. Nahabedian is a veteran of the United States Marine Corps, and served as an infantry corporal and platoon translator in Operation Iraqi Freedom.
 
Philip J. McPherson, CFO, Secretary, Treasurer and Director:  Mr. McPherson joined COIL with nearly two decades of experience in the capital markets and financial services sectors.  He started his career as a retail stock broker with Mission Capital in 1997 and became partner before it was acquired by oil and gas boutique C. K. Cooper & Company. At C.K. Cooper, Mr. McPherson was a research analyst specializing in small cap exploration & production companies.  In 2007, he joined Global Hunter Securities as a partner and managing director of the energy research group. During his Wall Street career, Mr. McPherson was presented the Wall Street Journal “Best on the Street” Award.

Why California - Citadel Exploration




















































 














				We believe the best place to find oil is where it has already been found.			










Why California


And why Kern County in specific?
Kern County is the most prolific oil producing county in the entire United States – more productive even than the famous Texas counties of the Permian and Eagleford basins — pumping out some 140,000,000 barrels in 2014, or about 75% of California’s total production. The reason is simple: No region in the entire world has a greater concentration of 100-million-barrel producing fields than the San Joaquin Basin – not Saudi Arabia, not the Bakken and not Texas. And, with five billion-barrel fields within its borders, Kern County covers the heart of the basin.
California E&Ps enjoy the high demand of a large population with an oil-thirsty car culture. Refiners in the Golden State simply cannot buy enough local oil. In fact, California produces just 600,000 barrels per day, but refiners have more than three-times that capacity — over 2 million barrels – a number that barely meets the demand of 33 million people, as evidenced by a recent spike in gasoline process to nearly $5 a gallon, despite the oil price plunge. So, even with thousands of oil wells pumping away within an hour’s drive of most refineries, the majority of California gasoline is refined from oil imported from overseas or other states.   The balance comes from Alaska (22%), Saudi Arabia (14%), Ecuador (10%), Iraq (5%) and Mexico (3%).
That’s why California oil often attracts a premium of 5-10% over West Texas Intermediate (WTI) pricing, depending on market fluctuations. In fact, California oil prices have more closely mirrored pricing for Brent crude, the standard world price deck for oil, in recent years.
Because of its key geological location, Kern County’s economy is dominated by the oil industry, along side the agriculture industry. As a result, the county features robust industry infrastructure and a deep bench of service providers supported by an extremely efficient regulatory system that safely and effectively permits new production in a matter of weeks. Perhaps more importantly, Kern County is an oasis of regulatory sanity. The County government is currently finalizing a County-wide Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the entire industry. This will further streamline the local government’s approach to permitting production and greatly reduce paperwork for exploratory drilling, the only County in the State to take such an industry-friendly approach.
This does not in any way mean that Kern County standards are unsafe or overly permissive. In addition to being the heart of the State’s oil industry, the County is also the heart of the San Joaquin Valley, one of the most productive agriculture regions in the world. In fact, oil production is often located inside agricultural operations, and the two are mutually supportive. Produced water from oil operations is cleaned and sold to farmers, while walnut shells and other agriculture by-products play a role in oil production. Kern County’s forward-thinking, realistic approach to oil industry regulation ensures that both opportunities are safely and effectively maximized.
Technical innovations are de-risking inaccessible oil and revealing hidden prospects. Older fields and field extensions represent low hanging fruit as technology and higher commodity prices allow the industry to unlock previously uneconomic zones. Reprocessing of vintage seismic data combined with new, high-resolution 3-D seismic, is highlighting previously unnoticed oil – often adjacent to or under legacy wells. The comingling of multiple hydrocarbon bearing zones is making wells more economical, as are horizontal drilling techniques being applied to conventional targets. And, most impactful to COIL, advances in thermal recovery coupled with record low natural gas prices are making it economically feasible to recover significant quantities of oil untouched by previous production.
Major oil companies like Chevron, Exxon and Shell never left their California operations while others, like Occidental Petroleum’s California Resource Corporation spin-off are refocusing in the region That means there are few “ground floor” opportunities in small-cap E&P space – and zero with four generations of experience in California Oil.
These opportunities will bear fruit in the near future via robust oil production. As this trend is identified by both investors and independent E&P companies, an eventual exit strategy should present itself. And Kern County will be at the heart of the action.
