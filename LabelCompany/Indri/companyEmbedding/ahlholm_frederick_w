CAMBRIDGE, Mass., July 14, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Minerva Neurosciences (NASDAQ:   NERV), a leader in the development of new therapies to treat neuropsychiatric diseases and disorders, today announced that Frederick W. Ahlholm has been appointed vice president of finance and chief accounting officer, effective June 2, 2014. 
Mr. Ahlholm is a senior executive with more than 20 years of experience in directing the financial functions at technology and life science companies. His background includes the management of compliance and reporting requirements for companies registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

He is a CPA and earned his BBA at the University of Notre Dame.
"I am excited to be joining Minerva Neurosciences at this pivotal time, and am looking forward to working with the rest of the executive team to advance our business strategy targeting a range of unmet needs and highly promising commercial opportunities in neuropsychiatric health in the years ahead," said Mr. Ahlholm.
The news of Mr. Ahlholm's appointment comes on the heels of the pricing of the company's initial public offering on June 30, 2014. Shares began trading on the NASDAQ Global Market under the ticker symbol "NERV" on July 1, 2014. 
"Frederick's extensive experience with life sciences companies and his proven ability to contribute to the growth and success of clinical-stage organizations make him an ideal addition to the senior team at Minerva Neurosciences," said Rogerio Vivaldi, MD, MBA, Minerva president and CEO.
