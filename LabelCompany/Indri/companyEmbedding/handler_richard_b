Early life and education[edit]
Handler grew up in New Jersey, graduating in 1979 from Pascack Hills High School in Montvale.[4] Handler received a BA in economics from the University of Rochester in 1983 and an MBA from Stanford University in 1987.[5] Before graduate school, he worked as an investment banker at First Boston, and after as a junk bond trader for Michael Milken at Drexel Burnham Lambert.[4]
Professional career[edit]
Handler joined Jefferies in April 1990 as a salesman and trader[4] and was appointed CEO on January 1, 2001,[6] Chairman in 2002.[4] During his time at Jefferies, between 1990 and 2012, shares compounded annually at 22%.[7] On November 12, 2012, Jefferies announced its merger with Leucadia, its largest shareholder. At that time, Leucadia common shares were trading at $21.14 per share.[8] As of December 31, 2015, Leucadia shares were trading at $17.39 per share.[9] In March 2013, Jefferies merged with Leucadia,[10] and Handler became CEO of both companies.[11]
In April 2012, Handler and Chairman of the Jefferies Executive Committee Brian Friedman formed the Jefferies Global Senior Advisory Board, which now includes James D. Robinson III, Lord Hollick, Michael Goldstein, Bernard Bourigeaud, Dennis Archer, Sir David Reid,[12] Gilles Pélisson,[13] and G. Richard Wagoner.[14] In August 2012, Handler played a lead role in saving Knight Capital Group after they suffered a $440 million loss due to a 'technology glitch.' Together with Brian Friedman, Handler structured and led the rescue,[15] which included making Jefferies the largest shareholder with an investment of $125 million.[16]
In November 2011, ratings company Egan-Jones issued a negative report regarding Jefferies that caused a 20% decline in the Jefferies stock price minutes after the opening bell the following morning.[17] This report was found to contain a number of inaccuracies: Jefferies was accused of having 77% of its shareholder’s equity tied up in the same illiquid sovereign debt securities that had just toppled MF Global, neglecting to mention that the position had been hedged, supposedly offsetting exposure.[18] Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer & Co. made public statements pointing out additional figures in the Egan-Jones report that were 'so grotesquely wrong they should immediately jump off the page to anyone remotely familiar with the numbers.' This included the false claim that Jefferies revenue had declined 37.8% annually over the previous ‘couple of years.’[19] In fact, Jefferies net revenues actually increased by 154% from 2008 to 2011 according to company filings.[20] The Egan-Jones report was described by Kotowski in his research report from November 23, 2011 titled "Another Hack Attack" as 'flat out wrong',[21] and was followed by what Richard Handler characterized as a multi-week public attack on Jefferies by Sean Egan.[18] Handler and the Jefferies management team responded with unprecedented immediacy and transparency, collapsing 75% of this sovereign debt position in a matter of days to prove the bonds were hedged and highly liquid, sharply reducing the rest of Jefferies balance sheet, and publicly addressing the accusations on an almost daily basis.[22] This aggressive and unconventional response resulted in an eventual rebound in Jefferies share price from the November lows.[18]
Richard Handler is also Chairman and CEO of the Handler Family Foundation and serves on the Advisory Council of the Stanford University School of Business.[23] For the University of Rochester, Handler serves on the Board of Trustees,[24] as Chairman of the Finance Committee,[23] and as Co-Chairman of the university's Capital Campaign.[25] Handler has donated $25 million for the Jane and Alan Handler Scholarship Fund (named for Handler's parents) for exceptional students from underprivileged backgrounds with the potential for future leadership.[26]
Compensation[edit]
From 2004 to 2014, 78% of Richard Handler’s compensation has been paid in stock.[7] Assuming Handler continues his employment with Leucadia through all vesting and deferral periods, he will own 11,240,470 shares of Leucadia.[27] Handler has never sold shares of Leucadia or Jefferies, with the exception of charitable donations and a one-time sale for tax purposes.[28] According to the New-York Times,[29] Richard Handler was one of the better paid chief executives on Wall Street when he ran the Jefferies Group ($19 million in 2012). After the Leucadia National Corporation acquired Jefferies, his compensation fell by more than 80 percent due to the disappointing performance of the Jefferies subsidiary. In 2014, Handler turned down a $2.2 million bonus after a year of weak results and a sliding stock for the securities firm's parent company.[30]

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Richard B. "Rich" Handler (born May 23, 1961) is an American businessman, currently serving as the Chairman of the Board and CEO of Jefferies Group,[1] where he is the longest-tenured CEO on Wall Street.[2] Handler also serves as the CEO and director of Leucadia.[3]

Early life and education[edit]
Handler grew up in New Jersey, graduating in 1979 from Pascack Hills High School in Montvale.[4] Handler received a BA in economics from the University of Rochester in 1983 and an MBA from Stanford University in 1987.[5] Before graduate school, he worked as an investment banker at First Boston, and after as a junk bond trader for Michael Milken at Drexel Burnham Lambert.[4]
Professional career[edit]
Handler joined Jefferies in April 1990 as a salesman and trader[4] and was appointed CEO on January 1, 2001,[6] Chairman in 2002.[4] During his time at Jefferies, between 1990 and 2012, shares compounded annually at 22%.[7] On November 12, 2012, Jefferies announced its merger with Leucadia, its largest shareholder. At that time, Leucadia common shares were trading at $21.14 per share.[8] As of December 31, 2015, Leucadia shares were trading at $17.39 per share.[9] In March 2013, Jefferies merged with Leucadia,[10] and Handler became CEO of both companies.[11]
In April 2012, Handler and Chairman of the Jefferies Executive Committee Brian Friedman formed the Jefferies Global Senior Advisory Board, which now includes James D. Robinson III, Lord Hollick, Michael Goldstein, Bernard Bourigeaud, Dennis Archer, Sir David Reid,[12] Gilles Pélisson,[13] and G. Richard Wagoner.[14] In August 2012, Handler played a lead role in saving Knight Capital Group after they suffered a $440 million loss due to a 'technology glitch.' Together with Brian Friedman, Handler structured and led the rescue,[15] which included making Jefferies the largest shareholder with an investment of $125 million.[16]
In November 2011, ratings company Egan-Jones issued a negative report regarding Jefferies that caused a 20% decline in the Jefferies stock price minutes after the opening bell the following morning.[17] This report was found to contain a number of inaccuracies: Jefferies was accused of having 77% of its shareholder’s equity tied up in the same illiquid sovereign debt securities that had just toppled MF Global, neglecting to mention that the position had been hedged, supposedly offsetting exposure.[18] Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer & Co. made public statements pointing out additional figures in the Egan-Jones report that were 'so grotesquely wrong they should immediately jump off the page to anyone remotely familiar with the numbers.' This included the false claim that Jefferies revenue had declined 37.8% annually over the previous ‘couple of years.’[19] In fact, Jefferies net revenues actually increased by 154% from 2008 to 2011 according to company filings.[20] The Egan-Jones report was described by Kotowski in his research report from November 23, 2011 titled "Another Hack Attack" as 'flat out wrong',[21] and was followed by what Richard Handler characterized as a multi-week public attack on Jefferies by Sean Egan.[18] Handler and the Jefferies management team responded with unprecedented immediacy and transparency, collapsing 75% of this sovereign debt position in a matter of days to prove the bonds were hedged and highly liquid, sharply reducing the rest of Jefferies balance sheet, and publicly addressing the accusations on an almost daily basis.[22] This aggressive and unconventional response resulted in an eventual rebound in Jefferies share price from the November lows.[18]
Richard Handler is also Chairman and CEO of the Handler Family Foundation and serves on the Advisory Council of the Stanford University School of Business.[23] For the University of Rochester, Handler serves on the Board of Trustees,[24] as Chairman of the Finance Committee,[23] and as Co-Chairman of the university's Capital Campaign.[25] Handler has donated $25 million for the Jane and Alan Handler Scholarship Fund (named for Handler's parents) for exceptional students from underprivileged backgrounds with the potential for future leadership.[26]
Compensation[edit]
From 2004 to 2014, 78% of Richard Handler’s compensation has been paid in stock.[7] Assuming Handler continues his employment with Leucadia through all vesting and deferral periods, he will own 11,240,470 shares of Leucadia.[27] Handler has never sold shares of Leucadia or Jefferies, with the exception of charitable donations and a one-time sale for tax purposes.[28] According to the New-York Times,[29] Richard Handler was one of the better paid chief executives on Wall Street when he ran the Jefferies Group ($19 million in 2012). After the Leucadia National Corporation acquired Jefferies, his compensation fell by more than 80 percent due to the disappointing performance of the Jefferies subsidiary. In 2014, Handler turned down a $2.2 million bonus after a year of weak results and a sliding stock for the securities firm's parent company.[30]

Woodforest National Bank


                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

                                            It's not the worst, but it's certainly deceptive. I can't trust a company that lies to me for two bucks.

Veridian Credit Union


                                            i love banking with veridian, but the new updated online banking is garbage.10x harder to navigate than before staring from the log in page. Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

I don't have this problem with any of my other credit accounts. Had my account over a year in good standing. Paid it down to zero twice. What a joke!

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Complete Coverage | Complete Rankings



Methodology: 
	Compensation rank is based on total compensation for latest fiscal year. Total compensation for each chief executive includes the following: salary and bonuses; other compensation, such as vested restricted stock grants, LTIP payouts and perks; and stock gains, the value realized by exercising stock options. Efficiency rank is based on our chief executive's performance/pay score. Ranks are given only to chief executives who have a six-year tenure and six-year compensation history. The most efficient rank is 1 and least efficient is 196.

Footnotes: 
	Compensation data is from the latest available proxy statements filed through Mar. 25, 2011. Total returns and value of stock owned (including all classes) is based on Mar. 18, 2011 stock price. Compensation percent change is based on combined salary and bonus. Annualized total return during tenure covers the tenure of the executive or from the time of the IPO or available stock history. Relative to market is the ending value of $100 invested in the stock, divided by the ending value of $1 invested in the S & P 500 (a score of 100 = the S & P 500). NA: Not available or not applicable.  
1Annualized.
	2Four-year total.
	3Three-year total.
	4Less than 0.01%.
	5Prior-year data.
	6New chief executive; compensation may be for another executive office.
	7Less than $100,000.
	8Includes shares indirectly held.
	*Return is for less than tenure.
	**Due to the change in 2010 in the company's fiscal year, amounts reflect only the portion of compensation earned on or before Nov. 30, 2010. Because bonuses are typically paid on an annual basis, commpany attributed 11/12ths of the compensation paid during calendar 2010 to the new 2010 fiscal year, which contained only eleven months.

Richard Handler of Leucadia Wants to Rescue Companies





Leucadia wants troubled yet potentially successful companies at their doorstep							
















Richard Handler of Leucadia says he wants his firm to be the one companies with profit potential turn to when they need a financial boost,   according to Bloomberg. 
CEO of Leucadia Richard Handler and President Brian Friedman wrote in a letter to investors that they want Leucadia to be “the one who gets the call.” Leucadia took over Jeffries in 2013. Since the merger,   the combined company has seen success in investing in companies that need a little financial backing to get going again. The firm gained 50% in its investment in Harbinger Group and thinks its $300 million loan to FXCM will pay off.
Handler said of the financing,   according to Bloomberg,   “Bite sizes below $500 million fit our current capitalization and should allow us to take meaningful stakes enjoy heavy influence (or,   better yet,   control) please our bondholders and build our shareholders equity.”
Another major success story prior to Jeffries’ being taken over by Leucadia,   was the rescue of Knight Capital,   which was headed for bankruptcy because of a technical glitch. Jeffries made $192 million in cash on the deal and has 22.5 million shares in the recovered company.
Richard Handler and Brian Friedman are back on their feet after a bruising scandal forced them to take drug tests to prove Jeffries management were not junkies. Former Jeffries partner,   Sage Kelly,   resigned after his ex wife Christina alleged Jeffries had a compulsory and compulsive drug abusing culture. Her claims appeared to be motivated by a desire to secure exclusive custody. Handler and Friedman were clean of drugs,   but the bank lost more than a few clients in the scandal,   and both men were forced to forfeit their bonuses because of the shortfall.

Investment Bank’s C.E.O. Turns Down a $2.2 Million Bonus


				By Nathaniel Popper			
February 4, 2015 4:34 pm
February 4, 2015 4:34 pm







PhotoTraders at Jefferies in New York in 2006.Credit Librado Romero/The New York Times
Richard B. Handler, the head of the investment bank Jefferies, turned down a $2.2 million bonus after the bank suffered a difficult final quarter in 2014. 
The compensation committee at Jefferies’s parent, the Leucadia National Corporation, where Mr. Handler is also chief executive, was prepared to offer Mr. Handler and the president, Brian P. Friedman, $2.2 million cash bonuses, according to a regulatory filing made on Wednesday. 
The filing said that both Mr. Handler and Mr. Friedman chose to receive no bonus for the year. Their long-term stock compensation was also cut by 67,000 shares, which is worth about $1.5 million at the current share value. That reduction was because Jefferies failed to meet its performance targets. 
Leucadia’s stock price fell 20 percent during 2014. 
Mr. Handler’s reduced pay package stands in stark contrast to his compensation two years ago, when he received $19 million, more than the pay of chief executives at some of the biggest banks, including Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase. 
Since then, after facing questions about its holdings of European bonds, Jefferies gained stability by merging with the corporate conglomerate Leucadia.  
In his first year running both Leucadia and Jefferies, Mr. Handler’s pay package fell to $3.1 million, including a $1.8 million bonus. 
In the final quarter of 2014, Jefferies suffered a loss of $92.4 million after revenue from its bond trading desks fell 73 percent. 
Jefferies is one of the last firms trying to succeed with the traditional Wall Street model of trading, underwriting and advisory work.

Richard B. Handler - Wikipedia





















 






Richard B. Handler

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Richard B. "Rich" Handler (born May 23, 1961) is an American businessman, currently serving as the Chairman of the Board and CEO of Jefferies Group,[1] where he is the longest-tenured CEO on Wall Street.[2] Handler also serves as the CEO and director of Leucadia.[3]

Early life and education[edit]
Handler grew up in New Jersey, graduating in 1979 from Pascack Hills High School in Montvale.[4] Handler received a BA in economics from the University of Rochester in 1983 and an MBA from Stanford University in 1987.[5] Before graduate school, he worked as an investment banker at First Boston, and after as a junk bond trader for Michael Milken at Drexel Burnham Lambert.[4]
Professional career[edit]
Handler joined Jefferies in April 1990 as a salesman and trader[4] and was appointed CEO on January 1, 2001,[6] Chairman in 2002.[4] During his time at Jefferies, between 1990 and 2012, shares compounded annually at 22%.[7] On November 12, 2012, Jefferies announced its merger with Leucadia, its largest shareholder. At that time, Leucadia common shares were trading at $21.14 per share.[8] As of December 31, 2015, Leucadia shares were trading at $17.39 per share.[9] In March 2013, Jefferies merged with Leucadia,[10] and Handler became CEO of both companies.[11]
In April 2012, Handler and Chairman of the Jefferies Executive Committee Brian Friedman formed the Jefferies Global Senior Advisory Board, which now includes James D. Robinson III, Lord Hollick, Michael Goldstein, Bernard Bourigeaud, Dennis Archer, Sir David Reid,[12] Gilles Pélisson,[13] and G. Richard Wagoner.[14] In August 2012, Handler played a lead role in saving Knight Capital Group after they suffered a $440 million loss due to a 'technology glitch.' Together with Brian Friedman, Handler structured and led the rescue,[15] which included making Jefferies the largest shareholder with an investment of $125 million.[16]
In November 2011, ratings company Egan-Jones issued a negative report regarding Jefferies that caused a 20% decline in the Jefferies stock price minutes after the opening bell the following morning.[17] This report was found to contain a number of inaccuracies: Jefferies was accused of having 77% of its shareholder’s equity tied up in the same illiquid sovereign debt securities that had just toppled MF Global, neglecting to mention that the position had been hedged, supposedly offsetting exposure.[18] Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer & Co. made public statements pointing out additional figures in the Egan-Jones report that were 'so grotesquely wrong they should immediately jump off the page to anyone remotely familiar with the numbers.' This included the false claim that Jefferies revenue had declined 37.8% annually over the previous ‘couple of years.’[19] In fact, Jefferies net revenues actually increased by 154% from 2008 to 2011 according to company filings.[20] The Egan-Jones report was described by Kotowski in his research report from November 23, 2011 titled "Another Hack Attack" as 'flat out wrong',[21] and was followed by what Richard Handler characterized as a multi-week public attack on Jefferies by Sean Egan.[18] Handler and the Jefferies management team responded with unprecedented immediacy and transparency, collapsing 75% of this sovereign debt position in a matter of days to prove the bonds were hedged and highly liquid, sharply reducing the rest of Jefferies balance sheet, and publicly addressing the accusations on an almost daily basis.[22] This aggressive and unconventional response resulted in an eventual rebound in Jefferies share price from the November lows.[18]
Richard Handler is also Chairman and CEO of the Handler Family Foundation and serves on the Advisory Council of the Stanford University School of Business.[23] For the University of Rochester, Handler serves on the Board of Trustees,[24] as Chairman of the Finance Committee,[23] and as Co-Chairman of the university's Capital Campaign.[25] Handler has donated $25 million for the Jane and Alan Handler Scholarship Fund (named for Handler's parents) for exceptional students from underprivileged backgrounds with the potential for future leadership.[26]
Compensation[edit]
From 2004 to 2014, 78% of Richard Handler’s compensation has been paid in stock.[7] Assuming Handler continues his employment with Leucadia through all vesting and deferral periods, he will own 11,240,470 shares of Leucadia.[27] Handler has never sold shares of Leucadia or Jefferies, with the exception of charitable donations and a one-time sale for tax purposes.[28] According to the New-York Times,[29] Richard Handler was one of the better paid chief executives on Wall Street when he ran the Jefferies Group ($19 million in 2012). After the Leucadia National Corporation acquired Jefferies, his compensation fell by more than 80 percent due to the disappointing performance of the Jefferies subsidiary. In 2014, Handler turned down a $2.2 million bonus after a year of weak results and a sliding stock for the securities firm's parent company.[30]

Richard B. "Rich" Handler (born May 23, 1961) is an American businessman, currently serving as the Chairman of the Board and CEO of Jefferies Group,[1] where he is the longest-tenured CEO on Wall Street.[2] Handler also serves as the CEO and director of Leucadia.[3]

Early life and education[edit]
Handler grew up in New Jersey, graduating in 1979 from Pascack Hills High School in Montvale.[4] Handler received a BA in economics from the University of Rochester in 1983 and an MBA from Stanford University in 1987.[5] Before graduate school, he worked as an investment banker at First Boston, and after as a junk bond trader for Michael Milken at Drexel Burnham Lambert.[4]
Professional career[edit]
Handler joined Jefferies in April 1990 as a salesman and trader[4] and was appointed CEO on January 1, 2001,[6] Chairman in 2002.[4] During his time at Jefferies, between 1990 and 2012, shares compounded annually at 22%.[7] On November 12, 2012, Jefferies announced its merger with Leucadia, its largest shareholder. At that time, Leucadia common shares were trading at $21.14 per share.[8] As of December 31, 2015, Leucadia shares were trading at $17.39 per share.[9] In March 2013, Jefferies merged with Leucadia,[10] and Handler became CEO of both companies.[11]
In April 2012, Handler and Chairman of the Jefferies Executive Committee Brian Friedman formed the Jefferies Global Senior Advisory Board, which now includes James D. Robinson III, Lord Hollick, Michael Goldstein, Bernard Bourigeaud, Dennis Archer, Sir David Reid,[12] Gilles Pélisson,[13] and G. Richard Wagoner.[14] In August 2012, Handler played a lead role in saving Knight Capital Group after they suffered a $440 million loss due to a 'technology glitch.' Together with Brian Friedman, Handler structured and led the rescue,[15] which included making Jefferies the largest shareholder with an investment of $125 million.[16]
In November 2011, ratings company Egan-Jones issued a negative report regarding Jefferies that caused a 20% decline in the Jefferies stock price minutes after the opening bell the following morning.[17] This report was found to contain a number of inaccuracies: Jefferies was accused of having 77% of its shareholder’s equity tied up in the same illiquid sovereign debt securities that had just toppled MF Global, neglecting to mention that the position had been hedged, supposedly offsetting exposure.[18] Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer & Co. made public statements pointing out additional figures in the Egan-Jones report that were 'so grotesquely wrong they should immediately jump off the page to anyone remotely familiar with the numbers.' This included the false claim that Jefferies revenue had declined 37.8% annually over the previous ‘couple of years.’[19] In fact, Jefferies net revenues actually increased by 154% from 2008 to 2011 according to company filings.[20] The Egan-Jones report was described by Kotowski in his research report from November 23, 2011 titled "Another Hack Attack" as 'flat out wrong',[21] and was followed by what Richard Handler characterized as a multi-week public attack on Jefferies by Sean Egan.[18] Handler and the Jefferies management team responded with unprecedented immediacy and transparency, collapsing 75% of this sovereign debt position in a matter of days to prove the bonds were hedged and highly liquid, sharply reducing the rest of Jefferies balance sheet, and publicly addressing the accusations on an almost daily basis.[22] This aggressive and unconventional response resulted in an eventual rebound in Jefferies share price from the November lows.[18]
Richard Handler is also Chairman and CEO of the Handler Family Foundation and serves on the Advisory Council of the Stanford University School of Business.[23] For the University of Rochester, Handler serves on the Board of Trustees,[24] as Chairman of the Finance Committee,[23] and as Co-Chairman of the university's Capital Campaign.[25] Handler has donated $25 million for the Jane and Alan Handler Scholarship Fund (named for Handler's parents) for exceptional students from underprivileged backgrounds with the potential for future leadership.[26]
Compensation[edit]
From 2004 to 2014, 78% of Richard Handler’s compensation has been paid in stock.[7] Assuming Handler continues his employment with Leucadia through all vesting and deferral periods, he will own 11,240,470 shares of Leucadia.[27] Handler has never sold shares of Leucadia or Jefferies, with the exception of charitable donations and a one-time sale for tax purposes.[28] According to the New-York Times,[29] Richard Handler was one of the better paid chief executives on Wall Street when he ran the Jefferies Group ($19 million in 2012). After the Leucadia National Corporation acquired Jefferies, his compensation fell by more than 80 percent due to the disappointing performance of the Jefferies subsidiary. In 2014, Handler turned down a $2.2 million bonus after a year of weak results and a sliding stock for the securities firm's parent company.[30]

If you look at the highest paid men, you can easily conclude that technology companies such as Google, Apple and Oracle pay their senior staff more money than CEOs in best of the companies.It also shows that the talent in technology sector is limited and these companies want to retain their senior staff at any cost.Take example of Christopher Fry, the senior vice president of engineering at Twitter. The company paid him $10.3 million last year, slightly less than the CEO ($11.5 million). And in many companies, senior staff is making more money than the CEOs.Let’s look the highest paid men in the corporate world.Source: FortuneClick NEXT to read more…

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
