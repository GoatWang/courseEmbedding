	Scott Kauffman






Scott Kauffman – Personal Injury Attorney, Owner and Managing Partner
For more than 30 years, personal injury attorney Scott Kauffman has fought to help his injured clients seek equitable financial compensation. Scott’s long-time passion for fighting for the rights of injured victims is what drew him to open his law firm, Kauffman & Associates, and specialize in personal injury law. Scott solely represents clients who have been injured in motor vehicle accidents, pedestrian accidents, slip and falls, product liability accidents and wrongful death situations. He has handled literally thousands of bodily injury cases and has a proven track record of obtaining excellent settlements.
 
After earning his law degree in Southern California in the early 1980s, Scott Kauffman began his career as a summer intern in a legal clinic serving the needs of indigent clients. He quickly realized that his true core sympathies and values were not in representing large corporate clients or insurance companies, but rather helping victims who had been harmed as a result of others’ negligence.
 
Attorney Scott Kauffman is a member of the State Bar of California, Consumer Attorneys of California, San Francisco Bar Association, Marin County Chamber of Commerce, Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, and Business Networking International.He is fluent in Russian. His firm, Kauffman & Associates, is located in San Rafael, CA and serves clients primarily in Northern California.





What People Are Saying… 

“Attorney Kauffman helped me tremendously after I was hit by a Muni bus in San Francisco while crossing the street. I suffered horrible injuries and have lost the use of my arm, but Scott and his office worked tirelessly on my case and recovered over $1 million for me. I would have truly been lost without his assistance. I am told that this is the largest settlement Muni ever paid out on a case like this.” – Vlad R.


“After suffering second-degree burns when a waiter spilled coffee on me, I contacted Scott's office not knowing what to expect. Scott and his staff were there for me through every step of my treatment, and were able to recover over $200,000 for my case even though I was lucky enough not to have any permanent scarring. Thanks to his office I was able to get the medical care needed to avoid any permanent injury.” – Adam D.


“After being rear-ended on the freeway, I suffered severe neck injuries which eventually required surgery. Had it not been for Scott Kauffman and his staff I know that I would not only have received a lot less money for my suffering, but also that I would not have gotten the medical care I truly needed. After fighting on my behalf for over two years they were able to settle the case for its maximum dollar value. Although this does not make up for all of the suffering I had to endure it was comforting knowing that I had somebody fighting in my corner to get me the most for my loss.” – Marte S.


“While I was pulling a driver out of his truck, I suffered injuries that made my already bad carpal tunnel much worse. Since I wasn't involved in a car crash, I didn't even think that I could get a settlement until I contacted Scott's office. Not only was he able to secure a favorable settlement on my behalf, he was able to recover over $100,000 to cover the cost of my medical expenses.”– Maria N.
