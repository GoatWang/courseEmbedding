Information for investors in Singapore:  This communication has not been registered as a prospectus with the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Funds are not authorised or recognised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Accordingly, this communication and any other communication or material in connection with the offer, sale, invitation for subscription or purchase of interests in any Fund may not be circulated or distributed, nor may interests in any Fund be offered, sold or be made the subject of an invitation for subscription or purchase, whether directly or indirectly, to the public or any member of the public in Singapore other than a person who is an accredited investor or an institutional investor (each as defined under the Securities and Futures Act (Chapter 289) of Singapore) or unless otherwise permitted under any applicable exemption.
        

        This communication may contain simulated performance results achieved by means of the retroactive application of the adviser's investment methodology, or the real-time application of a hypothetical capital allocation to such strategy. Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are described below. No representation is being made that any particular trading program will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program. One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading. For example, the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect actual trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading results.
        

        Although the information in this communication is believed to be materially correct as at the date of issue, no representation or warranty is given as to the accuracy of any of the information provided. Furthermore no representation or warranty is given in respect of the correctness of the information contained herein as at any future date. Certain information included in this communication is based on information obtained from third-party sources considered to be reliable. Any projections or analysis provided to assist the recipient of this communication in evaluating the matters described herein may be based on subjective assessments and assumptions and may use one among alternative methodologies that produce different results. Accordingly, any projections or analysis should not be viewed as factual and should not be relied upon as an accurate prediction of future results. Furthermore, to the extent permitted by law, BCM (UK) LLP, BCML, the Funds and their affiliates, agents, service providers and professional advisers assume no liability or responsibility and owe no duty of care for any consequences of any person acting or refraining to act in reliance on the information contained in this communication or for any decision based on it.
        

PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. The actual performance realised by any given investor will depend on numerous factors and circumstances. This communication may include returns for various indices. These indices are not intended to be direct benchmarks for a particular Fund, nor are they intended to be indicative of the type of assets in which a particular Fund may invest. The assets invested in by any of the Funds will likely be materially different from the assets underlying these indices, and will likely have a significantly different risk profile. Target returns, volatility and Sharpe ratio figures quoted are targets only and are based over the long term on the performance projections of the investment strategy and market interest rates at time of modelling and therefore may change.
        

        Among the risks we wish to call to the particular attention of prospective investors are the following: (1) each Fund's investment programme is speculative in nature and entails substantial risks; (2) the investments of each Fund may be subject to sudden and large falls in price or value and there could be a large loss upon realisation of a holder's investment, which could equal the total amount invested; (3) as there is no recognised market for many of the investments of the Funds, it may be difficult or impossible for a Fund to obtain complete and/or reliable information about the value of such investments or the extent of the risks to which such investments are exposed; (4) the use of a single adviser group could mean a lack of diversification and, consequently, higher risk, and may depend upon the services of key personnel, and if certain or all of them become unavailable, the Funds may prematurely terminate; (5) an investment in a Fund is illiquid and there is no secondary market for the sale of interests in a Fund and none is expected to develop; (6) there are restrictions on transferring interests in a Fund; (7) BCML and its affiliates may receive performance-based compensation, which may result in riskier investments, and the Funds' fees may offset trading profits; (8) the Funds are subject to certain conflicts of interest; (9) certain securities and instruments in which the Funds may invest can be highly volatile; (10) the Funds may be leveraged; (11) a substantial portion of the trades executed for the Funds take place on non-U.S. exchanges; (12) changes in rates of exchange may also have an adverse effect on the value, price or income of the investments of each Fund; and (13) the Funds are not mutual funds pursuant to and therefore not subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act.
