Head lice might be the last thing anyone wants to think about.And according to two local women who own a lice removal company, most people think they’ll never be the ones to get it — someone else’s family will have to deal with it instead of their own.That’s truly what most people think, said Rachel Knutson of Prior Lake and Lisa Rudquist of Savage, who own a company called Ladibugs Hair Care. Ladibugs removes head lice and sells pesticide-free lice treatment and prevention products nationwide.
It’s what they both thought in the fall of 2009, when their first-grade daughters attended St. Paul’s Lutheran School in Prior Lake. That school year, there was a lice outbreak. Both moms were sure their kids Ella (Knutson’s daughter) and Sierra (Rudquist’s daughter) wouldn’t get it.By April, both girls had gotten it. Knutson even bought pesticide-filled lice removal.“It was a nightmare,” she said. “It didn’t work. It was awful.”Knutson and Rudquist, who look alike and are even asked if they are twin sisters, didn’t know each other at all except casually through their kids’ school. But the experience brought them to a moment in St. Paul Lutheran School’s parking lot, where they bonded over the terrible lice experience their families just went through.“Are you thinking what I’m thinking?” Rudquist said to Knutson. “Let’s start a business.”Starting a companyBy May 3, 2010, just two weeks after their conversation, the duo started an incorporated business with the state of Minnesota.They decided to name the company “Ladibugs” because they wanted to bring light to an otherwise heavy — even gross — topic.“[We’re the] ladies that get out the bugs,” Rudquist said.Both had a background in caring for others; each has worked as registered nurses. Knutson graduated from nursing school at St. Catherine University in 1995 and has worked as the trauma coordinator at St. Francis Regional Medical Center in Shakopee. Rudquist got her bachelor’s of science degree in Nursing from Minnesota State University-Mankato in 1998 and completed her master’s degree in leadership studies from Augsburg college in 2005.Neither had any idea this is what they would be doing with their lives, let alone together.“We didn’t know how big of a thing we were getting into,” Rudquist said.Knutson said they were naive, which did them a favor because they didn’t have time to be afraid, she said. They learned how to do everything, from sales to budgets — and all with a beginner’s mind.“We obviously have come a long, long way,” Rudquist said.Now neither can imagine their lives any other way.“It was like yesterday that we had this conversation,” Knutson said.Growth
In seven years, the company has grown from 150 head lice treatments in the first year to nearly 3,000 treatments estimated for this year.They’ve also grown to a staff of two full-time and three part-time employees underneath them. They’ve also brought on an outside third party as their COO/CFO, a man named Jim Parkhurst of Medina. He came on in March 2016.“He complements us so well,” Knutson said.They’ve also gotten recognized quite a bit. Their mentor is now the high-profile Rhoda Olsen, the CEO of Great Clips. In 2015, they received an emerging entrepreneur award from the TwinWest Chamber of Commerce. In 2016 they received an innovations in healthcare award from the National Association of Women Business Owners.They’ve even been invited to a red carpet event in California where they met and mingled with celebrities such as the cast of the popular 1990s television show, 90210.They created a line of pesticide-free lice elimination and prevention products, including shampoo, conditioner, detangling spray and a variety of other products, which are are sold nationwide, including in salons such as Great Clips and Regis.If you go to their office in Hopkins, they have stayed as late as 2 a.m. removing lice for people; they use an FDA-approved piece of medical equipment called AirAllé, which kills head lice and even lice eggs. They also work with school districts, camps and health professionals, and they pride themselves in offering education about lice to people. Especially since so many people are just like them — they didn’t believe it would happen. And then it did.Knutson and Rudquist said they offer free head checks by appointment, but on July 13, they will offer free checks to anyone from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. at their office in Hopkins, 7900 Excelsior Blvd, Suite 350.Both women say their lives have been a bit of rollercoaster because this business has taken on a life of its own since that day in the parking lot.But they also say they have a limitless passion for what they do.“If you have a passion like this, nothing will stop you,” Rudquist said. “When you have this much passion, you cannot deny it. You just have to go with it.”

About Us


Our Story
We are two moms that are both registered nurses, who were frustrated with our options for high-quality hair care products. We teamed up with a chemist and tested a myriad of products, landing on a solution that includes the highest quality ingredients and essential oils.
Less than a year after our first conversation about starting a hair care company, we launched Ladibugs Haircare – a full line hair care and cleansing products. Used with our special patent-pending comb, they are most effective.
In May 2011, the Ladibugs product line was tested at select Kids’ Hair locations in the Midwestern United States. In just one month, Ladibugs hair care products became the top selling products for Kids’ Hair.
Ladibugs products are now being sold in salons across North America, including Great Clips and Kids’ Hair locations. Ladibugs is constantly expanding its reach.


Lisa R.N. and Rachel R.N., the founders of Ladibugs, Inc.


Our Founders
Rachel Knutson, R.N.
Co-founder
Rachel is no stranger to urgent health needs. After graduating from nursing school at St. Catherine University in 1995, she spent many years in intensive care units and emergency rooms. Most recently, she served as the trauma coordinator at St. Francis Regional Medical Center in Shakopee, Minn.
Rachel lives in a Minneapolis suburb with her husband, Tim, who works in the airline industry, daughters Ella and Adeline, and dog Charlie.
Lisa Rudquist, R.N.
Co-founder
Lisa’s path into healthcare began at Minnesota State University–Mankato, where she earned a BSN in 1998. She went on to earn a masters degree in leadership studies from Augsburg college in 2005. In addition to her experience in the neonatal care, Lisa spent 12 years in the healthcare industry, researching and analyzing clinical studies to benefit patients.
She and her husband, Sean (owner of a local remodeling and construction business) are proud parents to Scott, Sierra and Megan. They live in a suburb of Minneapolis.

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

Stage Stores Credit Card


                                            I was charged fees then late fees then fees. So $28.22 balance appeared out of thin air without any purchase. I moved while opening the credit card account so I did not receive statements on time (or maybe they did not send it to me). Called and got $17 back. As for the rest, I...show more

Amazon.com Store Card


                                            IF I COULD GIVE IT A ZERO I WOULD! Amazon/Synchrony Bank will cut your limit out of no where, even when making monthly payments. I've spent almost a year trying to pay off a card THEY maxed out and now they have sent to collections AS IM PAYING IT! DO NOT APPLY FOR THIS CARD!

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.
