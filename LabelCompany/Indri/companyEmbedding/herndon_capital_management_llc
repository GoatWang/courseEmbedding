Large Cap Value Equity



We look for broken stocks not broken companies. Our value philosophy preaches that true value is defined by companies that trade at a discount to what their fundamentals merit. Identifying sound companies out of favor with investors due to temporary conditions has historically proven to be a very successful strategy as their true value is ultimately recognized in the marketplace.

This product is designed to give our clients exposure to companies which are undervalued versus their peers but have demonstrated the ability to produce better than market returns.
The goal of the product is to outperform the Russell 1000 Value Index over a market cycle.
Quality and liquidity are highly emphasized.
A rigorous risk management process is applied during construction of the portfolio.
The portfolio is fully invested at all times.

Mid Cap Value Equity



“To everything there is a season...” (Ecclesiastes 3:1). True value is defined by companies that trade at a discount to what their fundamentals merit. Identifying sound companies out of favor with investors due to temporary conditions has historically proven to be a successful strategy as their true value is ultimately recognized in the marketplace. We call these companies value-creating opportunities.
Our process identifies stocks based upon relative value versus the other stocks in our Russell Mid Cap Index. We combine fundamental analysis in a valuation-oriented framework with risk assessment. We do not want to own stocks merely because they appear "cheap."  We screen our value candidates for performance-based characteristics to avoid "value traps."  The stocks we own tend to have low valuation metrics, but they also have sound fundamental characteristics, hopefully leading to outperformance as their value is recognized in the market.

About




Our Firm
Herndon Capital Management is an institutional investment management firm specializing in large and mid capitalization equity strategies. Founded and registered with the SEC in 2001, the firm is an affiliate of Atlanta Life Financial Group (ALFG), a financial services firm founded in 1905. The firm began managing assets in June 2002.
Serving a variety of institutional clients, HCM has a primary focus of Large Cap Funds. These funds serve to help balance the sectors of public pension funds, endowments, and other institutional assets. 




History of Our Name
Alonzo Franklin Herndon, a former slave, founded what is currently Atlanta Life Financial Group in 1905. Herndon began his successful entrepreneurial track owning and operating a barber shop, the only African American business located on historic Peachtree Street in 1902. Also revered for his philanthropic endeavors, Alonzo Herndon became Atlanta’s first African American millionaire.
With a similar drive for business success, Herndon Capital Management (HCM) is proud to share his name. Carrying on his legacy is an integral part of the culture of Herndon Capital Management.

Large Cap Core Equity 


Large Cap Core Equity



Experience has shown us that the most consistent method for producing better risk-adjusted returns than the peer group over time involves the use of a highly disciplined, risk-managed approach. And while either the growth or value strategy may dominate for certain periods, portfolios constructed with complementary elements of both strategies will produce more dependable benchmark-beating results.

Our core product is designed to give the client exposure to public large capitalization companies in the US which represent an attractive mix of quality and valuation.
The goal of the Portfolio is to outperform a large capitalization core benchmark such as the Russell 1000 or S&P 500 over a market cycle.
Our investment process focuses on bottom-up stock selection, but also benefits from macroeconomic analysis.
Outperformance will be accomplished by identifying the most attractive stocks in each sector and then optimally constructing a portfolio which contains them.
