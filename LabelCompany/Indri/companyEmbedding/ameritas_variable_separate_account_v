	The Board of Directors of Calvert Variable Products, Inc. ("CVP")
	has approved a resolution to reorganize the Calvert VP Inflation Protected Plus Portfolio into the Calvert VP Investment Grade
	Bond Index Portfolio (the "Reorganization"). Each Portfolio is a series of Calvert Variable Products, Inc.


	 


	The CVP Board has recommended approval of the Reorganization
	by shareholders of the Calvert VP Inflation Protected Plus Portfolio. If the Reorganization is approved by the shareholders of
	the Calvert VP Inflation Protected Plus Portfolio, it will be merged into the Calvert VP Investment Grade Bond Index Portfolio
	on or about November 14, 2014. If your variable annuity Contract or variable life insurance Policy remains allocated to the Subaccount
	corresponding to the Calvert VP Inflation Protected Plus Portfolio at the time the Reorganization is consummated, those units will
	be replaced by units corresponding to the Calvert VP Investment Grade Bond Index Portfolio, and thereafter the value of your Contract
	or Policy will depend on the performance of the Calvert VP Investment Grade Bond Index Portfolio rather than the Calvert VP Inflation
	Protected Plus Portfolio. The number of Calvert VP Investment Grade Bond Index Portfolio units you receive will depend on the value
	of your Calvert VP Inflation Protected Plus Portfolio units at the time the Reorganization takes place.


	 


	If the Reorganization is approved, your prospectus is revised
	by deleting all mention of the Calvert VP Inflation Protected Plus Portfolio at the time of the Reorganization.


	 


	All other provisions remain as stated in your
	Contract or Policy and prospectus, as supplemented.


	 



	Please retain this Supplement with the
	current prospectus for your variable Contract or Policy with




	Ameritas Life Insurance Corp.




	 




	If you do not have a current prospectus,
	please contact Ameritas Life at 1-800-745-1112.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the Public Reference Branch of the Commission, 100 F Street, NE., Room 1580, Washington, DC 20549 (telephone (202) 551-5850). 
Applicants' Representations 
1. Ameritas is a stock life insurance company organized in the State of Nebraska currently licensed to sell life insurance in 49 states (all except New York) and in the District of Columbia. Ameritas is a wholly owned subsidiary of AMAL Corp. which is a direct subsidiary of Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. is a subsidiary of Ameritas Acacia Mutual Holding Company. 
2. Ameritas Investment, a Nebraska corporation, is registered as an investment adviser under the 1940 Act and as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Ameritas Investment is an affiliate of Ameritas. Ameritas Investment is the investment adviser of the Ameritas Portfolios and principal underwriter of the Contracts. 
3. Account V is a separate account established by Ameritas under Nebraska law to fund variable life insurance contracts issued by Ameritas. Account VA-2 is a separate account established by Ameritas under Nebraska law to fund variable annuity contracts issued by Ameritas. Account V and Account VA-2 are registered under the 1940 Act as unit investment trusts (File Nos. 811-04473 and 811-05192 respectively). The variable life insurance contracts and variable annuity contracts issued through the Separate Accounts (together, “Contracts”) have been registered under the 1933 Act. 
4. Calvert Variable Series, Inc. (“CVS”) is registered under the 1940 Act as an open-end management investment company of the series type. The Ameritas Portfolios, including Ameritas Income and Growth, are series of CVS. CVS obtained an order pursuant to Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act exempting it and Ameritas Investment, as investment advisor, from Section 15(a) of the 1940 Act with respect to subadvisory agreements (the “Manager of Managers Order”). The Manager of Managers Order permits Ameritas Investment to replace any sub-adviser or to employ a new sub-adviser for each of its series without obtaining shareholder approval. At a meeting held on January 15, 2002, shareholders of each Ameritas Portfolio approved the implementation of procedures contemplated in the Manager of Managers Order. Fred Alger Management, Inc. is the subadviser to Ameritas Income & Growth. 
5. Each of the Contracts permits its owners to allocate the Contract's accumulated value among numerous Subaccounts of the Separate Accounts. Each Subaccount invests exclusively in a different investment portfolio (“Fund”) of an underlying mutual fund. Depending on the Contract, between twenty-one and thirty-six different Subaccounts (and corresponding funds) are currently available for this purpose. 
6. Contract Owners can allocate accumulated Contract value to one or more Subaccounts and/or, where available, to the Fixed Account, subject to certain potential restrictions described in the application and in the prospectus relating to each Contract. No sales charge applies to any transfer of accumulated Contract value among Subaccounts. Applicants represent that the relief requested here will not affect any charge to which Contract Owners of any Contract would otherwise be subject, or affect any right or privilege to which such owners are otherwise entitled. 
7. The Contracts expressly reserve to Ameritas the right to substitute shares of another investment company for shares of an investment company held by a Subaccount of the Separate Accounts. Ameritas proposes to substitute shares of Ameritas Income and Growth for shares of (a) Alger AllCap and (b) Salomon Variable All Cap held by Subaccounts of the Separate Accounts (each a “Substitution” and together, the “Substitutions”). 
8. The investment objectives and principal investment policies of the Replacement Fund and the Substituted Portfolios are as follows: Ameritas Income & Growth primarily seeks to provide a high level of dividend income, with a secondary goal to provide capital appreciation, by investing in dividend paying equity securities, such as common or preferred stocks, preferably those which the subadviser believes also offer opportunities for capital appreciation. Alger AllCap seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing in equity securities of companies of any size which demonstrate promising growth potential. Salomon Variable All Cap seeks capital appreciation by investing primarily in securities which the manager believes have above-average capital appreciation potential. A secondary consideration is given to a company's dividend record and the potential for improved dividend return. Salomon Variable All Cap invests primarily in common stocks and common stock equivalents of large well known domestic companies, but may also invest a significant portion of its assets in securities of small to medium-sized companies and may invest in fixed income securities, convertible debt securities, securities of foreign issuers, and in non-dividend paying stocks. 
9. Following is the comparative expense data for the Substitutions as of December 31, 2004. Applicants submit that each Substitution will result in a Replacement Fund with net expenses and management fees less than the Substituted Fund. Applicants also represent that there are no breakpoints in fund expenses for either the Substituted Funds or the Replacement Fund.

Management Fee includes both the investment advisory fee and administrative service fee. The administrative service fee is 0.05% of the fund's average daily net assets with a minimum of $50,000.2 Supra, footnote 1.
10. The day-to-day manager of both the Substituted Alger AllCap Fund as its adviser and to the Replacement Ameritas Income & Growth Fund as its subadviser is Fred Alger Management, Inc. 
11. Applicants note that Contract Owners with Subaccount balances invested in shares of the Replacement Funds will have lower total expense ratios than they currently have in the Substituted Funds. Moreover, there will be no increase in Contract fees and expenses including mortality and expense risk fees and administration and distribution fees charged to the Separate Accounts as a result of the Substitutions. Applicants believe that, if the proposed Substitutions are implemented, the core investment goals of affected Contract Owners will not be frustrated and the investment expectations of affected Contract Owners can continue to be met. Applicants expect that the Substitutions will provide significant benefits to Contract Owners, including improved selection of portfolio managers and simplification of fund offerings through the elimination of overlapping offerings. 
Applicants state that Ameritas considered the performance history of the Substituted Funds and the Replacement Funds and determined that no Contract Owners would be materially adversely affected as a result of the Substitutions. Applicants believe that the Substitutions, each of which replaces outside funds with a fund for which Ameritas Investment acts as investment advisor, will permit Ameritas Investment, under a multi-manager order granted by the Commission and under shareholder approval previously obtained, to hire, monitor and replace subadvisers as necessary to seek optimal performance and to ensure a consistent investment style. Applicants further believe that the subadviser to the Replacement Fund is better positioned to provide consistent above-average performance for its Fund than the adviser or subadvisers of the Substituted Funds. Applicants state that Contract Owners will continue to be able to select among a large number of funds, with a full range of investment objectives, investment strategies, and managers. Applicants believe there will also be a significant savings to Contract Owners because certain costs, such as the costs of printing and mailing lengthy periodic reports and prospectuses for the Substituted Funds will be substantially reduced. 
12. Applicants represent that they will not receive, for three years from the date of the Substitutions, any direct or indirect benefits from the new fund, its advisors or underwriters, or from affiliates of the new funds, their advisors or underwriters, in connection with assets attributable to Contracts affected by the Substitutions, at a higher rate than Applicants have received from substituted funds, their advisors or underwriters, or from affiliates of substituted funds, their advisors or underwriters, including without limitation Rule 12b-1 fees, shareholder service or administrative or other service fees, revenue sharing or other arrangements (collectively “Revenue Arrangements”). Applicants represent that the substitutions and the selection of the new fund was not motivated by any financial consideration paid or to be paid to Applicants or any affiliate of Applicants by the new fund, its advisors, underwriters, or affiliates. 
13. The proposed Substitutions will take place at relative net asset value with no change in the amount of any Contract Owner's Contract value, cash value, or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in the Separate Accounts. Applicants expect that the Substitutions will be effected by redeeming shares of a Substituted Fund and reinvesting the proceeds of such redemption in shares of the Replacement Fund through a combination of cash and “in kind” transactions. 
14. Contract Owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed Substitutions, nor will their rights or Ameritas' obligations under the Contracts be altered in any way. All expenses incurred in connection with the proposed Substitutions, including brokerage, legal, accounting, and other fees and expenses, will be paid by Ameritas. In addition, the proposed Substitutions will not impose any tax liability on Contract Owners. The proposed Substitutions will not cause the Contract fees and charges currently being paid by existing Contract owners to be greater after the proposed Substitutions than before the proposed Substitutions. No fees will be charged on the transfers made at the time of the proposed Substitutions because the proposed Substitutions will not be treated as a transfer for the purpose of assessing transfer charges or for determining the number of remaining permissible transfers in a Contract year. 
15. Following the date on which Ameritas is notified that the notice of the Application is to be published in the Federal Register, but before the date on which the order requested by the application becomes effective, Ameritas will send to affected Contract Owners notice (“Substitution Notice”). The Substitution Notice will inform affected Contract Owners of (a) the Effective Date of the Substitutions (“Effective Date”); (b) the right of each affected Contract Owner, under their Contract, to transfer contract values among the various Subaccounts; and (c) the fact that any such transfer involving a transfer from a substituted fund will not be subject to any administrative charge and will not count as one of the “free transfers” to which affected Contract Owners may otherwise be entitled. The Substitution Notice will also inform affected Contract Owners that (a) Ameritas will not exercise any rights reserved under any Contract to impose additional restrictions on transfers (other than with respect to “market timing” activity described in each Contract's prospectus) until at least 30 days after the proposed Substitutions; (b) for 30 days after the proposed Substitutions, Ameritas will permit affected Contract Owners to make transfers of Contract value (or annuity unit exchange) out of the Start Printed Page 61853Replacement Fund Subaccount to another Subaccount without the transfer (or exchange) being treated as one of a limited number of transfers (or exchanges) permitted without a transfer charge. 
16. Within five days after the Effective Date, Ameritas will also send affected Contract Owners a second written notice (“Confirmation Notice”). The Confirmation Notice will (a) confirm that the Substitutions were carried out; (b) reiterate that each affected Contract Owner may transfer all of the contract value or cash value under a Contract that is invested in a Substituted Fund to any other Subaccount available under their Contract without such transfer being subject to any administrative charge, or being counted as one of the “free transfers” (or one of the limited number of transfers) to which affected Contract Owners may be entitled under the Contracts; and (c) state that, other than with respect to “market timing” activity described above, Ameritas will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the Contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers until at least 30 days after the Effective Date. 
17. For those who were Contract Owners on the date of the proposed Substitutions, Ameritas and Ameritas Investment will reimburse, on the last business day of each fiscal period (not to exceed a fiscal quarter) during the twenty-four months following the date of the proposed Substitutions, the Subaccount investing in the Replacement Fund such that the sum of the Replacement Fund's operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) and Subaccount expenses (asset-based fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from Subaccount assets and reflected in the calculation of Subaccount unit values) for such period will not exceed, on an annualized basis, the sum of the Replacement Fund's operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) and Subaccount expenses for the fiscal year preceding the date of the proposed Substitutions. In addition, for twenty-four months following the proposed Substitutions, Ameritas and Ameritas Investment will not increase separate account fees or charges for Contracts outstanding on the date of the proposed Substitutions. 
Applicants' Legal Analysis 
1. Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act provides, in pertinent part, that “it shall be unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer to substitute another security for such security unless the Commission shall have approved such substitution.” Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act also provides that the Commission shall issue an order approving such substitutions if the evidence establishes that the substitutions are consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policies and provisions of the 1940 Act. 
2. The Contracts expressly reserve to Ameritas the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to substitute shares of another investment company for shares of an investment company held by a Subaccount of the Separate Accounts. Applicants assert that the prospectuses for the Contracts and the Separate Accounts contain appropriate disclosure of this right. 
3. In each case, Applicants believe that it is in the best interests of the Contract Owners to substitute the Replacement Fund for the Substituted Fund. In this regard, Applicants contend that the proposed Replacement Fund for each Substituted Fund has an investment objective that is at least substantially similar to that of the Substituted Fund. Applicants also assert that the principal investment policies of the Replacement Funds are similar to those of the corresponding Substituted Funds. In addition, with respect to each proposed substitution, Applicants note that affected Contract Owners with balances invested in the Replacement Fund will have a lower or the same expense ratio in all cases. 
4. Applicants anticipate that Contract Owners will be better off with the array of Subaccounts offered after the proposed Substitutions than they have been with the array of Subaccounts offered prior to the Substitutions. The proposed Substitutions retain for Contract Owners the investment flexibility which is a central feature of the Contracts. If the proposed Substitutions are carried out, all Contract Owners will be permitted to allocate purchase payment and transfer Contract values and cash values between and among approximately the same number of Subaccounts as they could before the proposed Substitutions. Moreover, the elimination of the costs of printing and mailing prospectuses and periodic reports of the Substituted Funds will benefit Contract Owners. 
5. Applicants note that Contract Owners who do not wish to participate in a Replacement Fund will have an opportunity to reallocate their accumulated value among other available Subaccounts without the imposition of any charge or limitation (other than with respect to “market timing” activity). 
6. Applicants assert that, for the reasons summarized above, the proposed Substitutions and related transactions meet the standards of Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act and that the requested order should be granted. 
7. Sections 17(a)(1) and (2) of the 1940 Act prohibit an affiliated person of a registered investment company, or affiliated persons of any such affiliated person, or any principal underwriter for such company (collectively, “Transaction Affiliates”) from selling a security to, or purchasing a security from, the registered investment company. Applicants may be deemed to be Transaction Affiliates of one another based upon the definition of “affiliated person” under Section 2(a)(3) of the 1940 Act. Because the Substitutions may be effected, in whole or in part, by means of in-kind redemptions and purchases, the Substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between Transaction Affiliates. 
8. Section 17(b) provides that the Commission may grant an application exempting proposed transactions from the prohibitions of Section 17(a) if the terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; the transaction is consistent with the investment policies of each registered investment company concerned; and the transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act. Applicants state that the consideration to be paid by the Replacement Fund, and each of the Substituted Funds, will be fair and reasonable and will not involve overreaching because the Substitutions will not result in the dilution of the interests of any affected Contract Owners and will not effect any change in economic interest, Contract value or the dollar value of any variable contract held by an affected Contract Owner. 
9. In addition, Applicants state that to the extent the Substitutions are effected by redeeming shares of the Substituted Funds and using the redemption proceeds to purchase shares of the Replacement Funds, the Substitutions will satisfy each of the procedural safeguards adopted by the Board of Directors responsible for each of the Ameritas Portfolios and the Substituted Funds, respectively under Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act. 
Applicants' Conclusion 
Applicants assert that for the reasons summarized above the proposed substitutions and transactions meet the standards of Section 26(c) of the Act and are consistent with the standards of Start Printed Page 61854Section 17(b) of the Act and that the requested orders should be granted.

Please see the fund prospectuses for more information about subaccount underlying portfolios, including portfolio operating expenses for the year ended December 31, The Asset Allocation Program section of your prospectus and SAI is deleted and replaced with the following: ASSET ALLOCATION PROGRAM We may offer an asset allocation program using models. However, you have the ability to construct your own asset allocation plan from among the Investment Options available in your Policy. Asset allocation programs using models are intended to match model risk tolerance and investment objectives with the Investment Options available in your Policy. To assist you in your selection of an asset allocation model, we offer an Asset Allocation Program (the "Program"). The Program consists of models that were developed by an unaffiliated third party investment adviser. The unaffiliated third party investment adviser provided research and business support services relating to the models and selected the specific funds to populate each model from those available in the Policy. Ameritas Life paid for these consultant services at no additional cost to the Policy Owners. Ameritas Investment Corp. ("AIC"), an affiliate of ours, has served as discretionary investment adviser for Program participants solely in connection with the development and periodic updates to the model portfolios. In this regard, AIC has entered into an investment advisory agreement with each Policy Owner participating in the Program. In its role as investment adviser, AIC relied upon the recommendations of third parties to provide research and business support services and select the specific funds to populate the models. AIC's role as investment adviser for development of and periodic updates to the models will terminate on August 1, 2016, and the models in the Program will no longer undergo periodic updates. Important Information Concerning the Asset Allocation Program after August 1, 2016 On and after August 1, 2016, the models in the Program will no longer undergo periodic updates (the models will become "static"). The investment advisory agreement you have previously entered into with AIC will terminate, and AIC will no longer make updates to the models. Policy Owners will receive notice of the termination of their investment advisory agreement and additional notice that the models are becoming static. The models will remain invested in accordance with the most recent model allocations. You may continue rebalancing your allocation among the funds in your particular static model on a quarterly basis. You will not be required to take any action if you wish to continue participating in a static model. You may allocate to a different static model or discontinue participating in static models after August 1, To participate in the Program: You are responsible for determining which model is best for you. Your financial adviser can help you make this determination and may provide you with an investor questionnaire to help you define your investing style. There is no guarantee that the model you select is appropriate to your ability to withstand investment risk. We are not responsible for your selection of a specific investment option or model, or your decision to change to a different Investment Option. You must allocate all of your Policy Value to one asset allocation model. We must receive notice of your asset allocation model election by Written Notice before we can begin a Program for you. Only you can select which model is best for you. The Asset Allocation questionnaire can be an aid, but is just a tool; you will make your own selection. You may wish to consult with your own financial professional to determine whether participation in the Program is best for you, and if so, which model is most suitable. IN3 If you are currently participating in a Program model and you make changes to your allocations outside the model, you will be considered as having withdrawn from the Program. You will be required to communicate with the Service Center if you wish to make a transfer or trade. The Service Center will communicate that your election to execute a trade will result in the discontinuance of the Program for your Policy prior to you being able to execute any telephone transaction. You may participate in quarterly rebalancing where each quarter we will automatically rebalance the Subaccount values to be consistent with the allocation percentages for the Program model that you selected. Such rebalancing will be disclosed in quarterly statements to you. Performance of each model is updated monthly on our website and is available upon request. The Program consists of five models, ranging from aggressive to conservative. On and after August 1, 2016, the static models will retain these descriptions. Aggressive Model The Aggressive Model is for long-term investors who want high growth potential and do not need current income. The model may entail substantial year-to-year volatility in exchange for potentially higher long-term returns. Losses are still possible. Capital Growth Model The Capital Growth Model is for long-term investors who want good growth potential and do not need current income. The model entails a fair amount of volatility, but not as much as the Aggressive Model. Losses are still possible. Balanced Model The Balanced Model is for long-term investors who do not need current income and want some growth potential. The model is likely to entail some fluctuations, but presents less volatility than the overall equity market. Losses are still possible. Moderate Model The Moderate Model is for investors who seek current income and stability, with modest potential for increase in the value of their investments. Losses are still possible. Conservative Model The Conservative Model is for investors who seek current income and stability, and are less concerned about growth. Losses are still possible. The Adding, Deleting, or Substituting Variable Investment Options Section describes how changes to the Subaccounts' underlying portfolios will be addressed once the Program becomes static. Potential Conflicts of Interest Relating to Program Models We, and our affiliates, managed the competing interests that had the potential to influence the decision making with regard to the models by engaging a third party investment adviser to design the models and select the Investment Options for such models. Such competing interests include the following: AIC is compensated by us as principal underwriter for the Policies and as a distributor for a majority of our Policies. Calvert Variable Products, Inc. and Calvert Variable Series, Inc. (the "Calvert Funds"), have portfolios offered through the Policy. The Calvert Funds are advised by Calvert Investment Management, Inc. ("CIM"), an affiliate of ours, and certain of the Calvert Funds are subadvised by Ameritas Investment Partners, Inc. ("AIP") also an affiliate of ours. CIM and AIP are compensated for administrative, advisory and sub-advisory services they provide to Calvert Funds. Calvert Fund portfolios may or may not be included in the models. We may receive administrative services fees from other portfolios that are available as Investment Options or distribution fees. As a result of these competing interests the affiliated parties faced in this Program, there was an increased potential risk of a conflict of interest in these arrangements. There is no additional charge for selecting the Program. Although asset allocation programs are intended to mitigate investment risk, there is a risk that investing pursuant to a model will still result in losses. The models will remain unchanged, thus, the percentages of your Policy value allocated to each portfolio within the selected model will not be changed by us, and subsequent purchase payments will be invested in the same model unless we receive new instructions. Over time, the static model you select may no longer align with its original investment objective due to the effects of underlying portfolio performance and changes in underlying portfolio investment objectives. Therefore, your investment may no longer be consistent with your objectives. Portfolio rebalancing may help address this risk, but this is not guaranteed. You should consult with your financial professional about how to keep your allocations in line with your current investment goals. We may discontinue the Asset Allocation Program at any time. We reserve the right to modify the terms of the Program. We may configure new static models from time to time. We will provide advance notice of any such changes to the Program and inform you of your options.

Certain of the proceedings we are involved in assert claims for substantial amounts.

Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters, and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on any or all of the above.

Subadvisers: (1) Fidelity Investments Money Management, Inc. and (2) other investment advisers serve as sub-advisers for the fund. IN /139 Portfolio Substitution 3. We have filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") seeking an order approving the substitution of shares of the Fidelity VIP Money Market Portfolio, Initial Class for shares of the Calvert VP Money Market Portfolio. The effect of the substitution would permit us to replace the Calvert VP Money Market Portfolio ("Existing Fund") with the Fidelity VIP Money Market Portfolio ("Replacement Fund") as an investment option under the Policies. The Existing Fund and Replacement Fund are described in their respective summary prospectuses, which are available at no charge by contacting Customer Service at , or by logging into your account on the internet service center at Ameritas.com. Until the date of the substitution, Policy value currently allocated to the Calvert VP Money Market Portfolio may remain invested in the corresponding Subaccount, and transfers of Policy value into and out of that Subaccount will be allowed. Any allocation to the Calvert VP Money Market Portfolio pursuant to an asset allocation model will continue according to the model until the date of any substitution unless we receive different allocation instructions from you. We anticipate the substitution will occur on or around November 15, From the date of this supplement to the date of the substitution, if you have allocations to the Calvert VP Money Market Portfolio Subaccount, you may transfer such allocations to any other available Subaccount without any charge or limitation (except potentially harmful transfers (see Disruptive Trading Procedures in the Prospectus)) and without the transfer counting toward the number of free transfers that otherwise may be made in a given Policy Year. If carried out, the proposed substitution would result in any Policy value you have allocated to the Subaccount funded by the Existing Fund being, in effect, transferred at relative net asset value to a Subaccount investing in the Replacement Fund. We will pay all expenses incurred in connection with the substitution. There would be no tax consequences resulting from this exchange. After the substitution, the Subaccount funded by the Existing Fund will no longer be available for investment under the Policy. Once the substitution occurs, unless you instruct us otherwise, any existing or future instruction that designates the Subaccount funded by the Existing Fund will be deemed to be an instruction for the Subaccount funded by the Replacement Fund. This includes, but is not limited to, instructions for purchase payments, partial withdrawals, and transfer instructions (including instructions under any automatic or systematic transfer option). All references in your prospectus to the Existing Fund will be replaced with a reference to the Replacement Fund. From the date of the substitution, until at least thirty (30) days after the substitution, you are permitted to transfer Policy value out of the Subaccount investing in the Replacement Fund to one or more other Subaccounts or the fixed account (if available) within the Policy without any charge or limitation (except potentially harmful transfers (see Disruptive Trading Procedures in the Prospectus)) and without the transfer being treated as one of a limited number of free transfers allowed under your Policy. If you would like to make a transfer of Policy value, please contact Customer Service at , or log into your account on the internet service center at Ameritas.com. Information about the Replacement Fund, its investment policy, risks, fees and expenses and other aspects of its operations, can be found in its prospectus, which you should read carefully. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY NEW FUND WILL ACHIEVE ITS STATED OBJECTIVE. If you have any questions about this proposed substitution, please contact a Customer Service representative at All other provisions of your Policy remain as stated in your Policy and prospectus, as previously supplemented.

In the first paragraph on Potential Conflicts of Interest, the sentence "SIA analyzes all our model investment options and their underlying portfolios; it evaluates and recommends the selection, allocation weighting, and periodic updates regarding portfolios in the models." is deleted and replaced with the following: Summit analyzes all our model investment options and their underlying portfolios; it evaluates and recommends the selection of specific funds and periodic updates regarding portfolios in the models.

The following paragraphs are added to your prospectus Separate Account and Transfers sections: Resolving Material Conflicts Underlying Investment Interests In addition to serving as underlying portfolios to the Subaccounts, the portfolios are available to registered separate accounts of other insurance companies offering variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts. We do not currently foresee any disadvantages to you resulting from the fund companies selling portfolio shares to fund other products. However, there is a possibility that a material conflict of interest may arise between Policy Owners and the owners of variable contracts issued by other companies whose values are allocated to one of the portfolios. Shares of some of the portfolios may also be sold to certain qualified pension and retirement plans qualifying under section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code. As a result, there is a possibility that a material conflict may arise between the interests of Owners or owners of other contracts (including contracts issued by other companies), and such retirement plans or participants in such retirement plans. In the event of a material conflict, we will take any necessary steps to resolve the matter, including removing that portfolio as an underlying investment option of the Separate Account. The Board of Directors of each fund company will monitor events in order to identify any material conflicts that may arise and determine what action, if any, should be taken in response to those events or conflicts. See the accompanying prospectuses of the portfolios for more information. Omnibus Orders Purchase and redemption orders received by the portfolios generally are "omnibus" orders from intermediaries such as retirement plans and separate accounts funding variable insurance products. The omnibus orders reflect the aggregation and netting of multiple orders from individual retirement plan participants and individual owners of variable insurance products. The omnibus nature of these orders may limit the ability of the portfolios to apply their respective disruptive trading policies and procedures. We cannot guarantee that the portfolios will not be harmed by transfer activity relating to the retirement plans or other insurance companies that may invest in the portfolios. These other insurance companies are responsible for their own policies and procedures regarding frequent transfer activity. If their policies and procedures fail to successfully discourage harmful transfer activity, it will affect other owners of portfolio shares, as well as the owners of all variable life insurance or variable annuity contracts, including ours, whose variable investment options correspond to the affected portfolios. In addition, if a portfolio believes that an omnibus order that we submit may reflect one or more transfer requests from Owners engaged in disruptive trading, the portfolio may reject the entire omnibus order and thereby delay or prevent us from implementing your request. Any references to "mixed and shared funding" are deleted from the prospectus. 3. References to Rule 12h-7 are deleted and replaced with the following text: Ameritas relies on the exemption provided by Rule 12h-7 to file reports under the Securities Exchange Act of The Model Asset Allocation section of your prospectus is deleted and replaced with the following: Asset Allocation Program We may offer an asset allocation program using models. However, you always have the ability to construct your own asset allocation plan from among the investment options available in your Policy. Asset allocation programs using models are intended to match model risk tolerance and investment objectives with the investment options available in your Policy. To assist you in your selection of an asset allocation model, our Asset Allocation Program (the "Program") uses fund-specific model recommendations developed by our affiliate, Summit Investment Advisors, Inc. ("SIA"). These recommendations are offered to you through an agreement between Ameritas and SIA. The Program consists of five models, ranging from aggressive to conservative. SIA provides Ameritas Investment Corp. ("AIC"), our majority owned subsidiary, with ongoing recommendations and monitoring of the portfolios that comprise the models. To participate in the Program: AIC will serve as your investment adviser fiduciary for the Program solely for purposes of development of the models and periodic updates to the models. You must give AIC your written consent and discretionary authority for AIC to give us instructions to allocate your premiums (or, for an existing Policy, Policy value) pursuant to the allocations of the model you select. AIC will also periodically instruct us to change your allocations consistent with any changes to the model made by AIC as recommended by SIA. AIC has no discretionary authority to execute any other transfers for your Policy. IN1507 5/1019 You must complete the Asset Allocation questionnaire. You must allocate all of your Policy value to one asset allocation model. We must receive notice of your asset allocation model election by Written Notice before we can begin a Program for you. Only you can select which model is best for you. The Asset Allocation questionnaire can be an aid, but neither it nor AIC will make this decision for you. You may wish to consult with your own financial professional to determine whether participation in the Program is best for you, and if so, which model is most suitable. Each quarter we will automatically rebalance the Subaccount values to be consistent with the allocation percentages for the Program model that you selected. Such rebalancing will be disclosed in quarterly statements to you. Performance of each model is updated daily on our website and is available upon request. At least annually, AIC will re-evaluate and may make changes to each investment level model based upon SIA s recommendations. When AIC updates the models, we will send you written notice of the updated models at least 30 days in advance of the date the updated models are to be effective. If you wish to accept the changes in your selected model, you will not need to take any action, as your Policy value and any subsequent premium will be automatically reallocated pursuant to the updated model. If you do not wish to accept the changes to your selected model, you can change to a different model or withdraw from the Program. If you are currently participating in a Program model and you make changes to your allocations outside the model, you will not receive future notifications of model changes. You will then be considered as having withdrawn from the Program and as having cancelled your relationship with AIC for purposes of implementing the Program with your Policy. For this reason, you will not be able to execute trades online if you participate in the Program. You will be required to talk to a Service Center representative if you are in the Program, but wish to make a transfer or trade. The Service Center representative will explain to you, prior to executing any telephone transaction, that your election to execute a trade will result in the discontinuance of the Program for your Policy. If participation in the Program terminates, including by death of the Owner, Policy value will not be reallocated automatically if the model is changed, and thus will not reflect the most current allocation recommendations. Any additional premiums received after the death of the Owner will be returned. Potential Conflicts of Interest AIC and SIA may be subject to competing interests that have the potential to influence their decision making with regard to the models. AIC is compensated by us as principal underwriter for the Policies. SIA is compensated by us for its fund-specific model recommendations, and its ongoing oversight of the available investment options. We and AIC may receive fees for administrative services from other portfolios in the models. This additional compensation and related responsibilities may create conflicts of interest as AIC determines what portfolios should be in the models. Also, Calvert Variable Products, Inc. and Calvert Variable Series, Inc. (the "Calvert Funds"), which are part of the UNIFI Mutual Holding Company and therefore are affiliated with us, have portfolios offered through the Policy. The Calvert Funds are advised by Calvert Asset Management Company, Inc. ("CAMCO"), an affiliate of ours, and certain of the Calvert Funds are subadvised by Summit Investment Partners, Inc. ("Summit"), also an affiliate of ours. CAMCO and Summit are compensated for advisory oversight, subadvisory, and administrative services. Calvert Fund portfolios may or may not be included in the models. SIA may have an incentive to recommend certain portfolios that have administrative, advisory or subadvisory services provided by CAMCO and Summit. As a result of the competing interests the affiliated parties face in this Program, there is an increased potential risk of a conflict of interest in these arrangements. There is no additional charge for selecting the Program. Although asset allocation programs are intended to mitigate investment risk, there is a risk that investing pursuant to a model will still lose value. For information about risks of participating in the Program and more detail about the Program, including more information about conflicts of interest, ask for a copy of the Separate Account's Statement of Additional Information. More information about AIC s role as investment adviser for the Program is available on AIC s Form ADV Part II which is delivered to you at the time you subscribe to the Program. We may modify or discontinue the Asset Allocation Program at any time. 5. The Model Asset Allocation section of your Statement of Additional Information is deleted and replaced with the following: ASSET ALLOCATION PROGRAM The Service Ameritas Investment Corp. ("AIC"), a majority owned subsidiary of Ameritas, has developed several asset allocation models, each based on different profiles of an investor s willingness to accept investment risk, and provided exclusively through our Policies as the Asset Allocation Program (the "Program"). AIC periodically (typically annually) evaluates and updates the models. In developing and periodically updating the models, AIC IN1507 5/1020 currently relies on the fund-specific model recommendations made by Summit Investment Advisors, Inc. ("SIA"), a registered investment advisor, which, like Ameritas, is wholly owned by AHC and ultimately by UNIFI. AIC may change the firm it uses, or, as is currently the case, may use no independent firm when developing the models for the Program. If you choose to subscribe to the Program, AIC will serve as your investment adviser solely for purposes of development of the Program models and periodic updates of the models. If you choose to subscribe to the Program, AIC instructs us to allocate your initial premium (in the case of a new application) or accumulated value, as applicable, to the investment options according to the model you select, to similarly allocate subsequent premium, and to periodically automatically reallocate your accumulated value or premium payments. Your Policy value will be rebalanced quarterly consistent with your selected model. The Asset Allocation Program Models Development of the Program models is a two-step process. First, SIA performs an optimization analysis to determine the breakdown of asset classes. Next, after the asset class exposures are known, a determination is made of how available investment options can be used to implement the asset class level allocations. Investment options are selected in a way intended to optimize potential returns for each model, given a particular level of risk tolerance. SIA may also choose passively managed index investment options to optimize returns for a given risk profile. SIA's philosophy on selecting active investment managers centers on choosing experienced managers that add value over time, using a consistent process, and staying on mandate across market cycles. When selecting investment options, SIA looks for competitive fees, tenured fund management, and total returns that are competitive to their peers. SIA avoids managers holding "off-mandate" exposures, or other significant portfolio concentrations that could lead to sharp performance deviations. This process could, in some cases, result in the inclusion of an investment option in a model based on its specific asset class exposure or other specific optimization factors, even where another investment option may have better historical performance. Periodic Updates of the Models and Notices of Updates Each model is evaluated periodically (generally, annually) to assess whether the combination of investment options within each model should be changed to better seek to optimize the potential return for the level of risk tolerance intended for the model. As a result, each model may change, and the investment options used within a model may change. When your selected model is updated, AIC instructs us to automatically reallocate your accumulated value and any subsequent premium payments in accordance with any changes to the model you have selected. This means the allocation of your accumulated value, and potentially the investment options in which you are invested, will automatically change and your accumulated value and any subsequent premium payments will be automatically reallocated among the investment options in your updated model (independently of the automatic quarterly rebalancing). AIC requires that you give it discretionary investment authority to periodically instruct us to reallocate your accumulated value and any subsequent premium payments in accordance with the updated version of the model you have selected, if you wish to participate in the Program. When AIC updates the models, we will send you written notice of the updated models at least 30 days in advance of the date the updated models are to be effective. If you wish to accept the changes in your selected model, you will not need to take any action, as your Policy value and any subsequent premium will be automatically reallocated pursuant to the updated model. If you do not wish to accept the changes to your selected model, you can change to a different model or withdraw from the Program. Risks Although asset allocation models are designed to optimize returns given the various levels of risk, there is no assurance that a model portfolio will not lose money or that investment results will not experience volatility. Investment performance of your accumulated value could be better or worse by participating in a Program model than if you had not participated. A model may perform better or worse than any single investment option or asset class or other combinations of investment options or asset classes. Model performance is dependent upon the performance of the component investment options (and their underlying portfolios). The timing of your investment and the automatic quarterly rebalancing may affect performance. Your accumulated value will fluctuate, and when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Periodic updating of the models can cause the underlying portfolios to incur transaction expenses to raise cash for money flowing out of the portfolios or to buy securities with money flowing into the portfolios. These expenses can adversely affect performance of the pertinent portfolios and the models. IN1507 5/10  View more

5. Pursuant to the Contracts, the Life Insurance Companies reserve the right to substitute shares of one Portfolio for shares of another. The prospectuses for the Contracts also disclose that the Life Insurance Companies reserve this right.
6. CVSI is an open-end management investment company (File No. 811-03591) that currently consists of six investment portfolios, including the Current Portfolio, and issues a separate series of shares in connection with each. CVSI has registered such shares under the 1933 Act (File No. 002-80154).
7. Calvert Investment Management, Inc. (“CIM”) serves as the investment adviser to each CVSI Portfolio. CIM is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of AMHC.
8. The VIPFV is an open-end management investment company (File No. 811-05361) that currently consists of 32 investment portfolios, one of which, the Replacement Portfolio, is the subject of the proposed Substitution. VIPFV issues a separate series of shares in connection with each Portfolio and has registered such shares under the 1933 Act (File No. 033-17704).
9. Fidelity Management & Research Company (“FMR”) serves as the manager of each Portfolio of VIPFV. FMR receives an investment management fee from each Portfolio. Fidelity Investments Money Management, Inc. (“FIMM”) and other affiliates of FMR serve as sub-advisers for the Replacement Portfolio. FIMM has the day-to-day responsibility of choosing investments for the Replacement Portfolio. In addition, other affiliates of FMR serve as sub-advisers for the Replacement Portfolio and may provide investment research and advice for the Replacement Portfolio. None of VIPFV, FMR, FIMM, or other affiliates of FMR are affiliated persons (or affiliated persons of affiliated person) of any of the Applicants. Likewise, none of the Applicants are affiliated persons (or affiliated persons of affiliated persons) of VIPFV, FMR, FIMM or other affiliates of FMR.
10. The Applicants state that Replacement Portfolio's and Current Portfolio's respective investment objectives, strategies and risks are substantially the same. A comparison of the investment objectives, strategies and risks of the Replacement Portfolio and the Current Portfolio is included in the application.
11. The following table compares the fees and expenses of the Current Portfolio and the Replacement Portfolio as of the year ended December 31, 2012:
 Current portfolioReplacement portfolioCalvert Variable Series, Inc., Calvert VP Money Market PortfolioVariable Insurance Products Fund V, VIP Money Market Portfolio, Initial ClassManagement Fee0.25%0.17%.Distribution and Service (12b-1) FeeNoneNone.Other Expenses0.14%0.09%.Total Operating Expenses0.39%0.26%.Fee Waivers and Expense ReimbursementsNone 1None.Net Operating Expenses0.39% 20.26%.1 The Investment Advisor, CIM, has contractually agreed to limit direct net annual portfolio operating expenses through April 30, 2014 to 0.40%. Under the terms of the contractual expense limitation, operating expenses do not include interest expense, brokerage commissions, taxes and extraordinary expenses. Only the Board of Directors of CVSI may terminate a Portfolio's expense cap before the contractual period expires.2 The Advisor further voluntarily reimbursed expenses of $88,900 or 0.11%, for Net Operating Expenses of 0.28% to maintain a positive yield during the year ended December 31, 2012.
12. The Applicants state that the proposed Substitution is in response to a decision by the Board of Directors for CVSI, at a meeting held on June 5, 2013, to approve the dissolution of the Current Portfolio on or about November 15, 2013 (the “Liquidation Date”). The board's decision to liquidate the Current Portfolio requires the Life Insurance Companies to transfer accumulated Contract value invested in the Current Portfolio to an alternative investment option available under the Contracts on or before the Liquidation Date. Currently, the only money market portfolio investment option offered under the Contracts is the Current Portfolio. Accordingly, the proposed Substitution is necessary in order to provide the Contract owners with continued access to a money market portfolio investment option. Consequently, the Life Insurance Companies have determined to replace the Current Portfolio with the Replacement Portfolio via the Substitution.
13. The Life Insurance Companies submit that the Replacement Portfolio is an appropriate alternative for Contract owners for several reasons. First, its investment objectives, strategies and risks are substantially the same as those of the Current Portfolio. Second, it is substantially larger than the Current Portfolio, has had lower overall expense levels than the Portfolio in recent years, and has had higher yields in recent years than the Current Portfolio. Third, the Contracts and other variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts issued by the Life Insurance Companies currently offer one or more VIPFV portfolios (other than the Replacement Portfolio).
14. The Applicants believe that Contract owners would benefit from the significantly larger size of the Replacement Portfolio and the somewhat higher yields of the Replacement Portfolio, as contrasted Start Printed Page 65395with the size and recent yields of the Current Portfolio. The yield for the Current Portfolio for the seven days ending December 31, 2012 was 0.01%. The net asset value of the Current Portfolio was $85,913,000 as of December 31, 2012. The yield for the Replacement Portfolio Initial Class shares for the seven days ending December 31, 2012 was 0.08%. The net asset value of the Replacement Portfolio supporting Initial Class shares was $889,797,000 as of December 31, 2012.
15. The Applicants believe that Contract owners will benefit from the reduction in overall expenses of the Replacement Portfolio as compared to the Current Portfolio. Specifically, the management fee, other expenses, and total operating expenses are less than those of the Current Portfolio. Both Portfolios have no charge for Rule 12b-1 distribution and services fees. The total annual operating expense of the Replacement Portfolio is less than that of the Current Portfolio. Given this decrease, the Applicants believe that the Substitution would benefit Contract owners by reducing the overall level of Portfolio expenses.
Legal Analysis and Conditions
1. The Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act approving the proposed Substitution. Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act requires the depositor of a registered unit investment trust holding securities of a single issuer to obtain Commission approval before substituting the securities held by the trust.
2. Applicants submit that the proposed Substitution is not the type of substitution that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent. Section 26(c) was intended to provide for Commission scrutiny of a proposed Substitution which could, in effect, force shareholders dissatisfied with the substitute security to redeem their shares, thereby possibly incurring a loss of the sales load deducted from initial premium, an additional sales load upon reinvestment of the proceeds of redemption, or both, as well as possibly suffering adverse tax consequences upon redemption. Consequently, the section was designed to forestall the ability of a depositor to present holders of interest in a unit investment trust with situations in which a holder's only choice would be to continue an investment in an unsuitable underlying security, or to elect a costly and, in effect, forced redemption.
3. Applicants submit that the proposed substitution will provide Contract owners with substantially the same investment vehicle and would not raise any of the aforementioned concerns that Congress intended to address when the 1940 Act was amended to include Section 26(c).
4. Applicants represent that redemptions and purchases will occur simultaneously so that contract values will remain fully invested at all times. All redemptions of shares of the Current Portfolio and purchases of shares of the Replacement Portfolio will be effected in accordance with Section 22(c) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder. The Substitution will take place at relative net asset value as of the effective date of the Substitution (“Effective Date”) with no change in the amount of any Contract owner's contract value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investments in the money market subaccount of the applicable Account.
5. Contract values attributable to investments in the Current Portfolio will be transferred to the Replacement Portfolio without charge (including sales charges or surrender charges) and without counting toward the number of transfers that may be permitted without charge. Contract owners will not incur any additional fees or charges as a result of the Substitution, nor will their rights or the Life Insurance Companies' respective obligations under the Contracts be altered in any way and the Substitution will not change Contract owners' insurance benefits under the Contracts. All expenses incurred in connection with the Substitution, including legal, accounting, transactional, and other fees and expenses, including brokerage commissions, will be paid by the Life Insurance Companies. In addition, the Substitution will not impose any tax liability on Contract owners.
6. The Applicants also represent that the Substitution will not cause the Contract fees and charges currently paid by existing Contract owners to be greater after the Substitution than before the Substitution. The Life Insurance Companies will not exercise any right they may have under the Contracts to impose restrictions on transfers under the Contracts for the period beginning on the date of the Pre-Substitution Notice (defined below) through at least thirty (30) days following the Effective Date.
7. Existing Contract owners will be notified of the proposed Substitution by means of a prospectus or prospectus supplement for each of the Contracts (“Pre-Substitution Notice”) at least thirty (30) days before the Effective Date. New purchasers of the Contracts will be provided the Pre-Substitution Notice, the Contract prospectus, and the prospectus for the Replacement Portfolio in accordance with all applicable legal requirements.
8. The Pre-Substitution Notice will: (i) State that the Applicants filed the application seeking approval of the Substitution; (ii) set forth the anticipated Effective Date; (iii) explain that the Contract values attributable to investments in the Current Portfolio would be attributable to the Replacement Portfolio as of the Effective Date; (iv) state that, from the date of the Pre-Substitution Notice until the Effective Date, Contract Owners are permitted to transfer Contract value out of any Current Portfolio sub-account to any other sub-account(s) offered under the Contract without the transfer being treated as a transfer for purposes of transfer limitations and fees that would otherwise be applicable under the terms of the Contract; (v) advise Contract owners that any contract value remaining in the Current Portfolio sub-account on the Effective Date will be transferred to a sub-account investing in the Replacement Portfolio, and that the Substitution will take place at relative net asset value; (vi) inform Contract owners that for at least thirty (30) days following the Effective Date, the applicable Life Insurance Company will permit Contract owners to make transfers of contract value out of the sub-account investing in the Replacement Portfolio to any other available sub-accounts offered under their Contracts without the transfer being counted as a transfer for purposes of transfer limitations and fees, if any, that would otherwise be applicable under the terms of the Contracts; and (vii) inform Contract owners that, except as described in the market timing limitations section of the relevant prospectus, the applicable Life Insurance Company will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the Contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers out of the sub-account investing in the Replacement Portfolio for at least thirty (30) days after the Effective Date.
9. All Contract owners will have received a copy of the most recent prospectus for the Replacement Portfolio prior to the Substitution. In addition, within five (5) days following the Substitution, Contract owners affected by the Substitution will be notified in writing that the Substitution was carried out. This notice will restate the relevant information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Notice, and will also explain that the contract values attributable to investments in the Current Portfolio were transferred to the Replacement Portfolio without charge Start Printed Page 65396(including sales charges or surrender charges) and without counting toward the number of transfers that may be permitted without charge.
10. The Applicants represent that the Life Insurance Companies will not receive, for three (3) years after the Effective Date, any direct or indirect benefits from the Replacement Portfolio, its advisor or underwriter (or their affiliates), in connection with assets attributable to the Contracts affected by the Substitution, at a higher rate than the Life Insurance Companies had received from the Current Portfolio, its advisor or underwriter (or their affiliates), including without limitation 12b-1 fees, revenue sharing or other arrangements. The Applicants further represent that the Substitution and the selection of the Replacement Portfolio were not motivated by any financial consideration paid or to be paid to a Life Insurance Company or its affiliates by the Replacement Portfolio, its advisor or underwriter, or their affiliates.
11. Applicants submit that the replacement of the Current Portfolio with the Replacement Portfolio is consistent with the protection of Contract owners and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act and, thus, meets the standards necessary to support an order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act. In addition, the Applicants submit that the proposed Substitution meets the standards that the Commission and its staff have applied to Substitutions that have been approved in the past.
Conclusion
For the reasons and upon the facts set forth above in the application, the Applicants believe that the requested order meets the standards set forth in Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act and should therefore be granted.

For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority.

                     Ameritas Variable Life Insurance Company Separate Account V

    This prospectus describes the Policy, especially its Separate Account. The
Policy is designed to help you, the Policy Owner, provide life insurance        
protection while having flexibility, within limits, as to the amount and timing 
of premium payments, the amount of the death benefit, and how to invest your    
Policy value among up to 20 investment options. The value of your Policy will go
up or down based on the investment performance of the investment options you    
choose. The amount of the death benefit can also vary as a result of investment 
performance.                                                                    

You may allocate all or part of your Policy value among a variety of  
variable investment options where you have the investment risk, including       
possible loss of principal. (They are listed in Appendix A of this prospectus.) 

 You may also allocate all or part of your investment to a Fixed Account
fixed interest rate option where we have the investment risk and guarantee a    
certain return on your investment. Allocations to fund any guaranteed death     
benefit must be made to the Fixed Account.                                      

Please Read this Prospectus Carefully and Keep It for Future Reference. It      
provides information you should consider before investing in a Policy.

POLICY SUMMARY 

Refer to the Policy for the actual and complete terms of the Policy. You may    
obtain a copy from us.                                                          

        The Policy 4101 is flexible premium variable universal life insurance.
The Policy will usually be unsuitable for short-term savings or short-term life 
insurance needs. We are obligated to pay all amounts promised under the Policy. 
The Policy pays death benefit proceeds to the Policy beneficiary upon the       
insured's death, or pays a Cash Surrender Value to you if you surrender the     
Policy. The insured cannot be under age 20 or over age 80 on the insured's      
birthday nearest the Policy issue date. We will only issue the Policy for an    
initial face amount of insurance coverage of $100,000 or more.                  

       You have flexibility under the Policy. Within certain limits, you can
vary the amount and timing of premium payments, change the death benefit, change
the guaranteed death benefit period (but not less than 10 years) or funding     
period, and transfer amounts among the investment options. You can take out a   
Policy loan, make a partial withdrawal, or surrender your Policy completely,    
subject to certain restrictions. However, loans, partial withdrawals and        
surrenders may be subject to income tax and penalty tax.                        

       Your Policy value and Death Benefit will go up or down as a result of
the investment experience of your Policy. Even if you pay Planned Periodic      
Premiums, your Policy could lapse if the Policy value is not enough to pay the  
Policy's charges.                                                               

         Buying a Policy might not be advisable if it is just replacing existing
life insurance. You may wish to consult with your financial or insurance        
adviser.

o    Premium is used to create Policy value to cover Policy charges and to      
generate investment earnings.

Separate Account, which in turn invest in corresponding underlying    
   portfolios. Fixed Account allocations are invested in our general account

    o    You may borrow a limited amount of Policy value. Each loan must be at
       least $200. Interest accrues on outstanding loan amounts. After the
     5th Policy Year, loans at a lower interest rate may be available.

Surrenders.

  o    If you meet certain premium requirements, we will guarantee a death
benefit for a certain period. See the OTHER IMPORTANT POLICY

   We currently do not assess a separate charge against our Separate
Account or Fixed Account for any income taxes. We may, however, make such a     
charge in the future if income or gains within the Separate Account will incur  
any income tax liability, or if tax treatment of our Company changes.

       The next table shows the minimum and maximum total operating expenses
charged by the portfolio companies, before any waivers or reductions, that you  
may pay periodically during the time that you own the contract, followed by a

(1)      Ameritas Money Market Portfolio. The portfolio adviser (AIC) has       
   contractually agreed to limit annual portfolio operating expenses
through December 31, 2004, as reflected above.                

(2)      Calvert CVS Social International Equity Portfolio. Total expenses      
       reflect an indirect fee and fees before waivers. Indirect fees result
         from the portfolio's offset arrangement with the custodian bank whereby
     the custodian's and transfer agent's fees may be paid indirectly by
   credits earned on the portfolio's uninvested cash balances. These
    credits are used to reduce the portfolio's expenses. Net operating
    expenses after reductions for fees paid indirectly and fee waivers
would be 2.24%.

(1) The portfolio adviser (AIC) has contractually agreed to limit annual        
portfolio operating expenses through December 31, 2004, as reflected above,     
except for Ameritas Select, which has a cap of 1.50%.                           

(2) The adviser has contractually agreed to limit annual portfolio operating    
expenses through April 30, 2005 to 0.98% for CVS Income Portfolio and 1.08% for 
CVS Social Equity Portfolio.                                                    

(3) "Total Fees" reflect an indirect fee and fees before waivers. Indirect fees 
result from the portfolio's offset arrangement with the custodian bank whereby  
the custodian's and transfer agent's fees may be paid indirectly by credits     
earned on the portfolio's uninvested cash balances. These credits are used to   
reduce the portfolio's expenses. Net operating expenses after reductions for    
fees paid indirectly and fee waivers would be as follows:                       

    CVS Social International Equity                2.24%
    CVS Social Mid Cap Growth                      1.17%
    CVS Social Small Cap Growth                    1.31%

(4) Total Expenses of portfolios after any applicable reimbursement and/or      
directed brokerage/custodial expense reductions:                                
    VIP Contrafund                                 0.65%
    VIP Equity-Income                              0.56%
    VIP Growth                                     0.64%
    VIP Overseas                                   0.86%

(5) Each MFS series has an expense offset arrangement that reduces the series'  
custodian fee based upon the amount of cash maintained by the series with its   
custodian and dividend disbursing agent. Each series may enter into other such  
arrangements and directed brokerage arrangements, which would also have the     
effect of reducing the series' expenses. "Other Fees" do not take into account  
these fee reductions and are therefore higher than the actual expenses of the   
series. Had these fee reductions been taken into account, "Total Expenses       
(reflecting waivers and/or reimbursements, if any)" would be lower and would    
equal:                                                                          
    Utilities Series                               0.91%

(6) MFS has contractually agreed, subject to reimbursement, to bear expenses for
the MFS Strategic Income series such that the portfolio's "Other Fees" do not   
exceed 0.15% annually. This contractual fee arrangement may not be changed      
without approval of the board of trustees which oversees the portfolio series.  
The reimbursement arrangement will terminate on April 30, 2005.                 

(7) Total operating expenses in excess of those stated for each Summit portfolio

(8) The fees disclosed reflect gross ratios prior to any voluntary              
waivers/reimbursements of expenses by the adviser. For the year ended December
31, 2003, the management fee was reduced to reflect the voluntary waiver of a   
portion of the management fee and the reimbursement by the Portfolio's adviser  
to the extent total annual operating expenses exceed the following percentages: 
Emerging Markets Equity Portfolio 1.75%; U.S. Real Estate Portfolio 1.10%. The  
adviser may terminate this voluntary waiver at any time at its sole discretion. 
After such reductions, the "Management Fees", "Other Expenses" and "Total Annual
Expenses", respectively, were as follows:

Additionally, in determining the actual amount of voluntary management fee      
waiver and/or expense reimbursement for a Portfolio, if any, the adviser        
excludes from total annual operating expenses certain investment related        
expenses, such as foreign country tax expense and interest expense on borrowing.
Included in "Other Expenses" of the Emerging Markets Equity Portfolio is 0.03%  
of such investment related expense.

CHARGES EXPLAINED 

     The following adds to information provided in the EXPENSES section.
Please review both prospectus sections, and the Policy, for information on      
charges. Certain charges expressly permit you to designate the investment       
options from which the charge is to be applied against first.                   

TRANSACTION FEES                                              

o        Percent of Premium Charge                                              
    We currently deduct a percentage of each Policy premium payment we
receive as a Percent of Premium Charge. This charge partially offsets premium   
taxes imposed by some States and local governments and federal taxes on certain 
capitalized acquisition expenses.                                               

o        Surrender Charge                                                       
         Upon a full surrender of your Policy, we deduct a Surrender Charge from
the total Policy value. The amount and duration of this charge varies by the    
insured's sex, issue age (or attained age at the time of any increase), risk    
class, face amount of insurance coverage, and the length of time the Policy has 
been in force. The longest Surrender Charge duration is 14 years through issue  
age 80. The Surrender Charge applies from the Policy issue date as to the       
initial face amount of insurance coverage, and from the date of any increase as 
to increases in the face amount. Ask for a Policy illustration or see your      
Policy for these charges applicable to you. Taxes and tax penalties may apply.  

o        Partial Withdrawal Charge                                              
      Upon a partial withdrawal from your Policy, we will deduct a Partial
Withdrawal Charge. This fee will be deducted from the investment options and in 
the same allocation as your partial withdrawal allocation instruction; if that  
is not possible (due to insufficient value in one of the investment options you 
elect) or you have not given such instructions, we will deduct this fee on a    
pro-rata basis from balances in all Subaccounts and the Fixed Account. Taxes and
tax penalties may apply.                                                        

o        Transfer Fee                                                           
         We may charge a Transfer Fee for any transfer in excess of 15 transfers
per Policy Year. This fee may be deducted only from Policy investment options   
you designate; if that is not possible (due to insufficient value in an         
investment option you elect) or you have not provided such instructions, we will
deduct this fee on a pro-rata basis from balances in all Subaccounts and the    
Fixed Account.

PERIODIC CHARGES:  MONTHLY DEDUCTIONS FROM POLICY VALUE       

     The following charges are deducted from Policy value on each Policy
Monthly Anniversary.                                                            

o        Cost of Insurance Charge                                               
    The cost of insurance rate per $1,000 of net amount at risk cannot
exceed the guaranteed cost of insurance rate that is set forth in the Policy.   
The maximum cost of insurance each month can be determined by using the         
guaranteed cost of insurance rate in the formula below for cost of insurance.   

    The cost of insurance charge is for providing insurance protection
under the Policy. Because the cost of insurance charge depends upon several     
variables, the cost for each Policy Month can vary from month to month. The cost
of insurance rate for the initial face amount of insurance coverage varies by   
the insured's sex, issue age, risk class and the length of time the Policy has  
been in force. The cost of insurance rate for an increase in face amount varies 
by the insured's sex, age and risk class at the time of the increase, and the   
length of time the Policy has been in force since the increase. We may use      
current cost of insurance rates less than those shown in the Policy, and reserve
the right to change them so long as they do not exceed the rates shown in the   
Policy. Changes will equally apply to similarly situated Policy Owners and be   
based on changes in future expectations of factors such as investment earnings, 
mortality, persistency, and expenses. We expect a profit from this charge. Ask  
for a Policy illustration or see your Policy for these charges applicable to    
you.                                                                            

The Cost of Insurance each month equals:                                        
-    The "Net Amount at Risk" for the month;                                    
multiplied by                                                         
-    The cost of insurance rate per $1,000 of net amount at risk; divided by    
-    $1,000.                                                                    

The Net Amount at Risk in any month equals:                                     

-    The death benefit on the Policy Monthly  Anniversary,  discounted at the   
guaranteed rate of interest for the Fixed Account for one month;      
minus                                                                 
-    The Policy value on the Policy Monthly Anniversary after deducting the     
  charge for any optional features selected and the administrative charges
but not the cost of insurance charge.                                 

o        Administrative Charge,                                                 
Administrative Charge per $1,000 of Initial Face Amount, and  
Administrative Charge per $1,000 of Increase in Face Amount   

       These administrative charges partially compensate us for our costs in
issuing and administering the Policy and operating the Separate Account.        

o        Cost of Optional Features                                              
        The cost for any optional features you select (sometimes called Policy
"Riders") is also deducted monthly from Policy value. See the EXPENSES section  
for information about the costs of these features, and refer to APPENDIX B for  
descriptions of these features. Optional features may not be available in all   
states.                                                                         

o        Assessing the Monthly Deductions                                       
        If a guaranteed death benefit is not in effect, you may tell us how to
allocate your Policy's total monthly deduction among the investment options,    
provided that the Policy value remaining in any selected investment option is at
least $100. If you do not, or if there is not enough Policy value in any        
selected investment option, we will allocate the deduction pro-rata among the   
investment options.                                                             

         If a guaranteed death benefit is in effect, we will deduct the corridor
portion of the cost of insurance charge pro-rata from the variable investment   
options to the extent possible and will deduct any remaining amount from the    
fixed account to the extent possible. We will waive any part of the remainder of
the monthly deductions we are unable to collect from the fixed account.         

PERIODIC CHARGES: DAILY DEDUCTION FROM SEPARATE ACCOUNT ASSETS

       The following charges are applied daily to Separate Account assets in
determining the daily Accumulation Unit value of each Subaccount.               

o        Risk Charge                                                            
      The Risk Charge is for the mortality risks we assume - that insureds
may live for shorter periods of time than we estimate, and also compensates us  
for the Policy expense risks we assume. If this charge exceeds our actual costs 
to cover these risks, the excess goes to our general account. Conversely, if    
this charge is not enough, we bear the additional expense, not you. We expect a 
profit from this charge.

o        Portfolio Charges                                                      
Each Subaccount's underlying portfolio has investment advisory
expenses. These expenses, as of the end of each portfolio's last fiscal year,   
are stated in this prospectus' EXPENSES section and described in more detail in 
each fund's prospectus. A portfolio's charges and expenses are not deducted from
your Policy value. Instead, they are reflected in the daily value of portfolio  
shares which, in turn, will affect the daily Accumulation Unit value of the     
Subaccounts. These charges and expenses help to pay the portfolio's investment  
adviser and operating expenses.                                                 

INVESTMENT OPTIONS                                                              

   The Policy allows you to choose up to 20 investment options - each chosen
for its potential to meet specific investment objectives.                       

    You may allocate all or a part of your premiums among the Separate Account
variable investment options or the Fixed Account fixed interest rate option.    
Allocations must be in whole percentages and total 100%. The variable investment
options, which invest in underlying portfolios, are listed and described in     
Appendix A to this prospectus.                                                  

The value of your Policy will go up or down based on the investment performance 
of the variable investment options you choose. Please consider carefully, and on
a continuing basis, which investment options best suit your long-term investment
objectives and risk tolerance.                                                  

    SEPARATE ACCOUNT VARIABLE INVESTMENT OPTIONS (also see Appendix A)

   The Separate Account provides you with variable investment options in the
form of underlying portfolio investments. Each underlying portfolio is an       
open-end investment management company. When you allocate investments to an     
underlying portfolio, those investments are placed in a Subaccount of the       
Separate Account corresponding to that portfolio, and the Subaccount in turn    
invests in the portfolio. The Policy value of your Policy depends directly on   
the investment performance of the portfolios that you select.                   

     The Separate Account is registered with the SEC as a unit investment trust.
However, the SEC does not supervise the management or the investment practices  
or policies of the Separate Account or us. Under Nebraska law, we own the       
Separate Account assets, but they are held separately from our other assets and 
are not charged with any liability or credited with any gain of business        
unrelated to the Separate Account. Any and all distributions made by the        
underlying portfolios, with respect to the shares held by the Separate Account, 
will be reinvested in additional shares at net asset value. We are responsible  
to you for meeting the obligations of the Policy, but we do not guarantee the   
investment performance of any of the variable investment options' underlying    
portfolios. We do not make any representations about their future performance.  

   The underlying portfolios in the Separate Account are NOT publicly traded
mutual funds, and are NOT the same as other publicly traded mutual funds with   
very similar names. They are only available as separate account investment      
options in life insurance or variable annuity policies issued by insurance      
companies, or through participation in certain qualified pension or retirement  
plans.                                                                          
   Even if the investment options and policies of some underlying portfolios
available under the Policy may be very similar to the investment objectives and 
policies of publicly traded mutual funds that may be managed by the same        
investment adviser, the investment performance and results of the portfolios    
available under the Policy may vary significantly from the investment results of
such other publicly traded mutual funds.                                        
 You should read the prospectuses for the underlying portfolios together
with this prospectus for more information.                                      

You bear the risk that the variable investment
 options you select may fail to meet their
objectives, that they could decrease in value,
and that you could lose principal.

        Each Subaccount's underlying portfolio operates as a separate variable
investment option, and the income or losses of one generally has no effect on   
the investment performance of any other. Complete descriptions of each variable 
investment option's investment objectives and restrictions and other material   
information related to an investment in the variable investment option are      
contained in the prospectuses for each of the series funds which accompany this 
prospectus.

o        Adding, Deleting, or Substituting Variable Investment Options          
        We do not control the Subaccounts' underlying portfolios, so we cannot
guarantee that any of the portfolios will always be available. We retain the    
right to change the investments of the Separate Account, and to eliminate the   
shares of any Subaccount's underlying portfolio and substitute shares of another
series fund portfolio. If the shares of the underlying portfolio are no longer  
available for investment or if, in our judgment, investment in the portfolio    
would be inappropriate in view of the purposes of the Separate Account, we will 
first notify you and receive any necessary SEC and state approval before making 
such a change.                                                                  

      New Separate Account underlying portfolios may be added, or existing
funds eliminated, when, in our sole discretion, conditions warrant a change. If 
a portfolio is eliminated, we will ask you to reallocate any amount in the      
eliminated portfolio. If you do not reallocate these amounts, we will           
automatically reinvest them in the Ameritas Money Market Subaccount.            

         If we make a portfolio substitution or change, we may change the Policy
to reflect the substitution or change. Our Separate Account may be (i) operated 
as an investment management company or any other form permitted by law, (ii)    
deregistered with the SEC if registration is no longer required, or (iii)       
combined with one or more other separate accounts. To the extent permitted by   
law, we also may transfer assets of the Separate Account to other accounts.     

o        Voting Rights                                                          
       As a Policy Owner, you may have voting rights in the portfolios whose
shares underlie the Subaccounts in which you invest. You will receive proxy     
material, reports, and other materials relating to each underlying portfolio in 
which you have voting rights.                                                   

 If you send us written voting instructions, we will follow your
instructions in voting the portfolio shares attributable to your Policy. If you 
do not send us written instructions, we will vote those shares in the same      
proportions as we vote the shares for which we have received instructions from  
other Policy Owners. We will vote shares that we hold in the same proportions as
we vote the shares for which we receive instructions from other Policy Owners.  
The underlying portfolios may not hold routine annual shareholder meetings.     

FIXED ACCOUNT FIXED INTEREST RATE OPTION                      

     There is one fixed interest rate option ("Fixed Account"), where we
bear the investment risk. We guarantee that you will earn a minimum interest    
rate that will yield at least 3% per year, compounded annually. We may declare a
higher current interest rate. We have sole discretion over how assets allocated 
to the Fixed Account are invested, and we bear the risk that those assets will  
perform better or worse than the amount of interest we have declared. The focus 
of this prospectus is to disclose the Separate Account aspects of the Policy.   
Refer to the Policy for additional details regarding the Fixed Account.         

All amounts allocated to the Fixed Account become assets of our general account.
Interest in the general account has not been registered with the SEC and is not 
subject to SEC regulation. Therefore, SEC staff have not reviewed the Fixed     
Account disclosures in this prospectus.                                         

TRANSFERS                                                     

       Subject to restrictions during the "right to examine period", you may
transfer Policy value from one Subaccount to another, from the Separate Account 
to the Fixed Account, or from the Fixed Account to any Subaccount, subject to   
these rules:                                                                    

Transfer Rules:                                               
   o    A transfer is considered any single request to move assets
between one or more investment options.           
     o    We must receive notice of the transfer at our Service center
           Trading Unit - either Written Notice, an authorized telephone
              transaction, fax or by Internet when available. Our Trading Unit
              facsimile number is 402-467-7923. Transfers will be processed on
           the business day they are received by our Trading Unit before
        3:00 p.m. Central Time. You must be available to receive a
              confirmation telephone call for any faxed transfer requests sent
              to us, or your trade may not be processed until it is confirmed.
    o    The transferred amount must be at least $250, or the entire
             Subaccount value if it is less. (If the value remaining after a
              transfer will be less than $100 in a Subaccount, we will include
that amount as part of the transfer.)             
              -    If the Dollar Cost Averaging systematic transfer program is
                  used, then the minimum transfer amount out of a Subaccount
               is the lesser of $100 or the balance in the Subaccount.

      o    The first 15 transfers each Policy Year are free. Thereafter,

           EXPENSES EXPLAINED section of this Prospectus for information
               about how this charge is applied. This fee is not subtracted from
        the amount of the transfer. Transfers under any systematic
          transfer program do count toward the 15 free transfer limit.
     o    A transfer from the Fixed Account (except made pursuant to a
systematic transfer program):                     
-    may be made only once each Policy Year;      
-    may be delayed up to six months;             
       -    is limited during any Policy Year to the greater of:
              -    25% of the Fixed account value on the date of the
   transfer during that Policy Year;
                   -    the greatest amount of any similar transfer out of the
                 Fixed Account during the previous 13 months; or
-    $1,000.                            
       o    If the Policy value in any Subaccount falls below $100, we may
             transfer the remaining balance, without charge, to the Ameritas
Money Market Subaccount.                          

THIRD-PARTY SERVICES                                          

    Where permitted and subject to our rules (including those Transfer
Rules above regarding rejection of a transfer request), we may accept your      
authorization to have a third party (such as your sales representative or       
someone else you name) exercise transfers or investment allocations on your     
behalf. Third-party transfers and allocations are subject to the same rules as  
all other transfers and allocations. You can make this election on the          
application or by sending us Written Notice on a form provided by us. Please    
note that any person or entity you authorize to make transfers or allocations on
your behalf, including any investment advisory, asset allocation, money         
management or timing service, does so independently from any agency relationship
they may have with us for the sale of the Policies. They are accountable to you 
alone for such transfers or allocations. We are not responsible for such        
transfers or allocations on your behalf, or recommendations to you, by such     
third-party services. You should be aware that charges assessed by such third   
parties for their service are separate from and in addition to charges paid     
under the Policy.                                                               

DISRUPTIVE TRADING PROCEDURES                                 

       The Policy is not designed to serve as a vehicle for frequent trading
in response to short-term fluctuations in the market. Such frequent trading,    
programmed transfers, or transfers that are large in relation to the total      
assets of a Subaccount's underlying portfolio can disrupt management of a       
Subaccount's underlying portfolio and raise expenses. This in turn can hurt     
performance of an affected Subaccount and therefore hurt your Policy's          
performance.                                                                    

Organizations or individuals that use market timing investment strategies and   
make frequent or other disruptive transfers should not purchase the Policy,     
unless such transfers are limited to Subaccounts whose underlying portfolio     
prospectus specifically permits such transfers.                                 

     We reserve the right to reject or restrict, in our sole discretion,
transfers initiated by a market timing organization or individual or other party
authorized to give transfer instructions. We further reserve the right to impose
restrictions on transfers that we determine, in our sole discretion, will       
disadvantage or potentially hurt the rights or interests of other Policy Owners.
Restrictions may include changing, suspending or terminating telephone, on-line 
and facsimile transfer privileges. We will also enforce any Subaccount          
underlying portfolio manager's own restrictions imposed upon transfers          
considered by the manager to be disruptive. Our disruptive trading procedures   
may vary from Subaccount to Subaccount, and may also vary due to differences in 
operational systems and contract provisions. Any Subaccount restrictions will be
uniformly applied.                                                              

      There is no assurance that the measures we take will be effective in
preventing market timing or other excessive transfer activity. Our ability to   
detect and deter disruptive trading and to consistently apply our disruptive    
trading procedures may be limited by operational systems and technological      
limitations. Also, because other insurance companies and retirement plans may   
invest in Subaccount underlying portfolios, we cannot guarantee that Subaccount 
underlying portfolios will not suffer harm from disruptive trading within       
contracts issued by them.                                                       

Excessive Transfers                                           
    We reserve the right to restrict transfers if we determine you are
         engaging in a pattern of transfers that may disadvantage Policy Owners.
     In making this determination, we will consider, among other things:
o    the total dollar amount being transferred;             
o    the number of transfers you make over a period of time;

-11-

P-->N-615th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�15th
 o    whether your transfers follow a pattern designed to take
              advantage of short term market fluctuations, particularly within
certain Subaccount underlying portfolios;         
          o    whether your transfers are part of a group of transfers made by a
             third party on behalf of individual Policy Owners in the group;
and                                               
o    the investment objectives and/or size of the Subaccount
underlying portfolio.                             

Third Party Traders                                           
     We reserve the right to restrict transfers by any firm or any other
    third party authorized to initiate transfers on behalf of multiple
        Policy Owners if we determine such third party trader is engaging in a
     pattern of transfers that may disadvantage Policy Owners. In making
this determination, we may, among other things:               
     o    reject the transfer instructions of any agent acting under a
           power of attorney on behalf of more than one Policy Owner, or
          o    reject the transfer or exchange instructions of individual Policy
            Owners who have executed transfer forms which are submitted by
               market timing firms or other third parties on behalf of more than
one Policy Owner.                                 

     We will notify affected Policy Owners before we limit transfers, modify
transfer procedures or refuse to complete a transfer. Transfers made pursuant to
participation in a dollar cost averaging, portfolio rebalancing, earnings sweep 
or asset allocation program are not subject to these rules, nor are they subject
to a transfer fee. See the sections of the Prospectus describing those programs 
for the rules of each program.                                                  

      SYSTEMATIC TRANSFER PROGRAMS (applies to variable investment options
only; does not apply to the Fixed Account)                                      

        Transfers under any systematic transfer program do count toward the 15
free transfer limit. We reserve the right to alter or terminate any systematic  
transfer program upon thirty days advance written notice. Only one systematic   
transfer program may be utilized at a time.                                     

o        Dollar Cost Averaging                                                  
         The Dollar Cost Averaging program allows you to automatically transfer,
on a periodic basis, a set dollar amount or percentage from the Ameritas Money  
Market Subaccount or the Fixed Account to any other Subaccount(s) or the Fixed  
Account. Requested percentages are converted to a dollar amount. You can begin  
Dollar Cost Averaging when you purchase the Policy or later. You can increase or
decrease the amount or percentage of transfers or discontinue the program at any
time. Dollar Cost Averaging is intended to limit loss by resulting in the       
purchase of more Accumulation Units when a portfolio's value is low, and fewer  
units when its value is high. However, there is no guarantee that such a program
will result in a higher Policy value, protect against a loss, or otherwise      
achieve your investment goals.                                                  

Dollar Cost Averaging Rules:                                  
    o    There is no additional charge for the Dollar Cost Averaging
program.                                          
o    We must receive notice of your election and any changed
           instruction - either Written Notice, by telephone transaction
instruction, or by Internet when available.       
o    Transfers can only occur monthly.                      
     o    The minimum transfer amount out of the Ameritas Money Market
          Subaccount or the Fixed Account is the lesser of $250 or the
             balance in the Subaccount or Fixed Account. Under this program,
               the maximum amount that may be transferred from the Fixed Account
         each month is 1/36th of the Fixed Account value at the time
       Dollar Cost Averaging is established. While a Dollar Cost
           Averaging program is in effect, elective transfers out of the
               Fixed Account are prohibited. There is no maximum transfer amount
limitation applicable to any of the Subaccounts.  
        o    Dollar Cost Averaging program transfers cannot begin before the
end of a Policy's "right to examine" period.      
      o    You may specify that transfers be made on the 1st through the
           28th day of the month. Transfers will be made on the date you
         specify (or if that is not a Business Day, then on the next
          Business Day). If you do not select a date, the program will
               begin on the next Policy Month Anniversary following the date the
Policy's "right to examine" period ends.          
        o    You can limit the number of transfers to be made, in which case
             the program will end when that number has been made. Otherwise,
         the program will terminate when the amount remaining in the
           Ameritas Money Market Subaccount or the Fixed Account is less
than $250.                                        
  o    Dollar Cost Averaging is not available when the Portfolio
Rebalancing Program is elected.

o        Portfolio Rebalancing                                                  
       The Portfolio Rebalancing program allows you to rebalance your Policy
value among designated Subaccounts only as you instruct. You may change your    
rebalancing allocation instructions at any time. Any change will be effective   
when the next rebalancing occurs.                                               

Portfolio Rebalancing Program Rules:                          
    o    There is no additional charge for the Portfolio Rebalancing
program.                                          
o    The Fixed Account is excluded from this program.       
o    You must request the rebalancing program, give us your 
             rebalancing instructions, or request to end this program either
            by Written Notice, by telephone transaction instruction, or by
Internet when available.                          
   o    You may have rebalancing occur quarterly, semi-annually or
annually.                                         
    o    Portfolio Rebalancing is not available when the Dollar Cost
Averaging Program is elected.                     

o        Earnings Sweep                                                         
         The Earnings Sweep program allows you to rebalance your Policy value by
automatically allocating earnings from your Subaccounts among designated        
investment options (Subaccounts or the Fixed Account), either based on your     
original Policy allocation of premiums or pursuant to new allocation            
instructions. You may change your Earnings Sweep program instructions at any    
time. Any change will be effective when the next sweep occurs.                  

Earnings Sweep Program Rules:                                 
      o    There is no additional charge for the Earnings Sweep program.
o    The Fixed Account is included in this program.         
  o    You must request the Earnings Sweep program, give us your
               allocation instructions, or request to end this program either by
         Written Notice, by telephone transaction instruction, or by
Internet when available.                          
     o    You may have your earnings sweep quarterly, semi-annually or
annually.                                         

      MODEL ASSET ALLOCATION (applies to variable investment options only;
does not apply to the Fixed Account)                          

         We may offer a model asset allocation program. However, you always have
the ability to construct your own asset allocation plan from among the          
investment options available in your Policy. Model asset allocation programs are
intended to match model risk tolerance and investment objectives with the       
investment options available in your Policy. Currently, we offer the            
Morningstar(R) Asset Allocator ("Morningstar") program, from Morningstar        
Associates, LLC, which consists of five models, ranging from aggressive to      
conservative.                                                                   
      To participate in the asset allocation program you must complete the
Asset Allocation Questionnaire. Your registered representative will match your  
responses to an asset allocation model. You may choose to follow the recommended
investment level model or select your own investment options using the asset    
class level model.                                                              
      The following applies only when selecting an investment level model:
o    You must allocate all of your Policy value to one asset
               allocation model. We must receive notice of your asset allocation
              model election either by written notice, an authorized telephone
            transaction or Internet (when available) before we can begin a
program for you.                                  
  o    Each calendar quarter we will automatically rebalance the
    Subaccount values to be consistent with the allocation
 percentages for the program model that you elected.
       o    Annually, Morningstar will re-evaluate and may make changes to
         each investment level model. We will notify you of any such
            changes. In the event of a model change, you must give us your
            affirmative election to have the model changes applied to your
             Policy. If we do not receive your election to change your model
        allocations according to the updated recommendations, your
               allocations will remain unchanged and you will not be notified of
             any future changes to the models. Your affirmative election may
        be given either by written notice, an authorized telephone
transaction or Internet (when available).         
        o    If you are currently participating in an asset allocation model
             and you make changes to your allocations outside the model, you
     will not receive future notifications of model changes.

There is no additional charge for selecting a model asset allocation program. We
may modify or discontinue the model asset allocation program at any time.

OTHER IMPORTANT POLICY INFORMATION                                              
POLICY APPLICATION AND ISSUANCE                               

     The insured must not be younger than 20 or older than age 80 on the
insured's birthday nearest to the Policy Date. To purchase a Policy, you must   
submit an application, at least the Initial Premium (see below), and provide    
evidence of the proposed insured's insurability satisfactory to us. Before      
accepting an application, we conduct underwriting to determine insurability. We 
reserve the right to reject any application or premium. If we issue a Policy,   
insurance coverage will be effective as of the Policy Date.                     

Replacing an existing life insurance policy is not always your best choice. 
 Evaluate any replacement carefully.

      The minimum initial face amount of life insurance is $100,000, which
can be a combination of base Policy coverage and term insurance provided by an  
optional rider. The face amount of base coverage must be at least $50,000 and at
issue must be at least 10% of the total face amount (base plus term coverage    
combined).                                                                      

o        Application in Good Order                                              
         All application questions must be answered, but particularly note these
requirements:                                                 
         o    The Owner's and insured's full name, Social Security number (tax
           identification number for a business or trust Owner), date of
             birth, and certain other required information must be included.
o    Your premium allocations must be complete, be in whole 
percentages, and total 100%.                      
o    Initial Premium requirements must be met (see below).  
 o    Your signature and your agent's signature must be on the
application.                                      
o    City, state and date the application was signed must be
completed.                                        
       o    You must provide all information required for us to underwrite
              your application (including health and medical information about
       the insured, and other information we consider relevant).
          o    If you have one, please give us your e-mail address to facilitate
          receiving updated Policy information by electronic delivery.
          o    There may be forms in addition to the application required by law
               or regulation, especially when a replacement of other coverage is
involved.                                         
         o    Your agent must be both properly licensed and appointed with us.

o        Premium Requirements                                                   
       Your premium checks should be made payable to "Ameritas Variable Life
Insurance Company." We may postpone crediting any payment made by check until   
the check has been honored by your bank. Payment by certified check, banker's   
draft, or cashier's check will be promptly applied. Under our electronic fund   
transfer program, you may select a monthly payment schedule for us to           
automatically deduct premiums from your bank account or other sources.          

Initial Premium                                               
    o    At least enough premium to fund the greater of any selected
            guaranteed death benefit, or the number of monthly deductions,
             times the number of months between the Policy Date and the date
the Policy is issued plus one month.              

Additional Premiums                                           
          o    Payment of additional premiums is flexible, but must be enough to
cover Policy charges.                             
       o    If a premium increases the net amount of insurance coverage at
        risk, it is subject to evidence of the insured's continued
             insurability and our underwriting requirements as to the amount
of the increase.                                  
       o    Planned Periodic Premiums may be paid annually, semi-annually,
         quarterly, or monthly. You may change your Planned Periodic
        Premium, subject to our approval. Because Policy value can
       fluctuate depending upon the performance of your selected
           variable investment options, payment of your Planned Periodic
         Premiums does not guarantee that your Policy will remain in
        force. Your Policy can lapse, subject to the LAPSE & GRACE
             PERIOD: Guaranteed Death Benefit provision, even if you pay all
Planned Periodic Premiums on time.                
   o    If there is a Policy loan, you should identify any payment
              intended to reduce a loan as a loan repayment; otherwise it will
be treated as a premium and added to Policy value.
 o    Additional premiums are applied pursuant to your current
   allocation instructions, unless you give us different
    instructions by Written Notice or authorized telephone
transaction when you make the payment.            
       o    We reserve the right to limit premiums or refund any values so
               the Policy qualifies as life insurance under the federal Internal
Revenue Code.

o        Crediting and Allocating Premium                                       
    Once your application is in good order, we will credit initial net
premium to the Policy on the Policy Coverage Date. Until your Policy Coverage   
Date, premium payments received by us are held in our general account and are   
credited with interest at a rate we determine. On your Policy Coverage Date,    
premium allocated to the Fixed Account will be deposited directly into that     
account. On your Policy Coverage Date, all premium allocated to the variable    
investment options is allocated to the Ameritas Money Market Subaccount until 13
days after the Policy Coverage Date to accommodate state "Right to Examine"     
rights under the Policy. Then, we allocate your Policy value to the investment  
options according to your allocation instructions. If a Policy is not issued, we
will return your premium.                                                       

POLICY VALUE                                                  

    On your Policy Coverage Date, Policy value equals your initial net
premium (premium less the Percent of Premium Charge) less the Policy's first    
monthly deductions. On any Business Day thereafter, your total Policy value     
equals the sum of Policy value in the Separate Account variable investment      
options, the Fixed Account, and the Loan Account, minus any monthly deduction   
due and not paid.                                                               

o        Separate Account Value                                                 
     Premiums or transfers allocated to Subaccounts are accounted for in
Accumulation Units. The Policy value held in the Separate Account Subaccounts on
any Business Day is determined by multiplying each Subaccount's Accumulation    
Unit value by the number of Subaccount units allocated to the Policy. Each      
Subaccount's Accumulation Unit value is calculated at the end of each Business  
Day as follows:                                                                 

     (a)  the per share net asset value of the Subaccount's underlying
          portfolio as of the end of the current Business Day plus any
              dividend or capital gain distribution declared and unpaid by the
             underlying portfolio during that Business Day, times the number
      of shares held by the Subaccount, before the purchase or
redemption of any shares on that date; minus      
(b)  the daily risk charge; and this result divided by      
         (c)  the total number of Accumulation Units held in the Subaccount on
       the Business Day before the purchase or redemption of any
Accumulation Units on that day.                   

       When transactions are made to or from a Subaccount, the actual dollar
amounts are converted to Accumulation Units. The number of Accumulation Units   
for a transaction is equal to the dollar amount of the transaction divided by   
the Accumulation Unit value on the Business Day the transaction is made.        

       An investment in money market funds is neither insured nor guaranteed
by the U.S. Government. There can be no assurance that the funds will be able to
maintain a stable net asset value of $1.00 per share.                           

o        Fixed Account Value                                                    
   The Policy value of the Fixed Account on any Business Day equals:
          (a)  the Policy value of the Fixed Account at the end of the preceding
Policy month; plus                                
        (b)  any net premiums credited to the Fixed Account since the end of
the previous Policy month; plus                   
        (c)  any transfers from the Subaccounts or Loan Account to the Fixed
       Account since the end of the previous Policy month; minus
        (d)  any transfers from the Fixed Account to the Subaccounts or Loan
       Account since the end of the previous Policy month; minus
        (e)  any partial withdrawal and partial withdrawal charge taken from
           the Fixed Account since the end of the previous Policy month;
minus                                             
        (f)  the Fixed Account's share of any monthly deductions from Policy
value; minus                                      
        (g)  the Fixed Account's share of charges for any optional features;
plus                                              
        (h)  interest credited on the Fixed Account balance since the end of
the previous Policy month.                        

MISSTATEMENT OF AGE OR SEX                                    

       If the age or sex of the insured or any person insured by a Policy or
rider has been misstated on the application, the Policy death benefit and any   
additional benefits provided will be those which would be purchased by the most 
recent cost of insurance charge and the cost of such additional benefits at the 
insured person's correct age or sex.

SUICIDE                                                       

        We will pay the greater of the premiums received or Policy value, less
any partial withdrawals and indebtedness, if the insured, while sane or insane, 
commits suicide within two years (one year in Colorado and North Dakota) after  
the date the Policy was issued (and in Missouri, the insured intended suicide at
the time coverage was applied for). We will pay the greater of the monthly      
deductions for an increase in face amount of insurance coverage or Policy value 
attributable to such an increase if the insured, while sane or insane, commits  
suicide within two years (one year in Colorado and North Dakota) after the      
effective date of any increase (and in Missouri, the insured intended suicide at
the time the increase was applied for). Optional feature riders to the Policy   
may have separate suicide provisions.                                           

INCONTESTABILITY                                              

     We will not contest the validity of the Policy after it has been in
force during the insured's lifetime for two years from the date the Policy was  
issued or for two years from the date of any reinstatement. We will not contest 
the validity of an increase in the face amount of insurance coverage after the  
Policy has been in force during the insured's lifetime for two years from the   
effective date of any increase. Any contest of an increase in the face amount of
insurance coverage will be based on the application for that increase. Optional 
benefit riders to the Policy may have separate incontestability provisions.     

TELEPHONE TRANSACTIONS                                        

Telephone Transactions Permitted                                                
o    Transfers among investment options.                                        
o    Establish systematic transfer programs.                                    
o    Change premium allocations.                                                

How to Authorize Telephone Transactions                                         
o    Upon your authorization on the Policy application or in Written Notice to  
    us, you, your registered representative or a third person named by you may
     do telephone transactions on your behalf. You bear the risk of the accuracy
of any designated person's instructions to us.                        

Telephone Transaction Rules                                                     
o    Must be received by close of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") (usually 
    3 p.m. Central Time); if later, the transaction will be processed the next
day the NYSE is open.                                                 
o    Will be recorded for your protection.                                      
o    For security, you or your authorized designee must provide your Social     
Security number and/or other identification information.              
o    May be discontinued at any time as to some or all Owners.                  

We are not liable for following telephone transaction instructions we reasonably
believe to be genuine.                                                          

LAPSE AND GRACE PERIOD                                        

o        Lapse                                                                  

      Because Policy value can fluctuate depending upon the performance of
your selected variable investment options, your Policy can lapse, even if you   
pay all Planned Periodic Premiums on time.                                      

         This Policy will lapse with no value when Policy's cash surrender value
is not enough to cover any due but unpaid charges and a guaranteed death benefit
is not in effect. However, this Policy will not terminate during a grace period 
as long as sufficient premium is paid by the end of the grace period to prevent 
lapse.                                                                          

 Lapse of the Policy may result in adverse tax consequences.

o        Guaranteed Death Benefit                                               

         We guarantee the Policy will not lapse for the guaranteed death benefit
period you select so long as Net Funding exceeds Required Funding throughout the
selected guaranteed death benefit period. On the first day of a guaranteed death
benefit period and each Monthly Anniversary thereafter, we will compare the Net 
Funding to the Required Funding to determine if the guaranteed death benefit    
remains in effect or lapses.                                                    

    When you apply for your Policy, you select the period of time over
which you wish the guaranteed death benefit to be in effect, which must be at   
least ten years. You also select the period of time over which you plan to pay  
for it. You also select the amount of initial premium you wish allocated to the 
Fixed Account to specifically reduce the amount of guaranteed death benefit     
premium. We calculate the monthly guaranteed death benefit premium based on     
these specifications. The guaranteed death benefit period and required premium  
to fund it varies depending upon your age at Policy issue. Certain changes to   
your Policy while the guaranteed death benefit is in effect will result in      
establishing a new guaranteed death benefit period and a recalculation of the   
guaranteed death

benefit premium. These changes include an increase or decrease in the face      
amount of insurance, a change in death benefit option, an increase or decrease  
in the amount of rider coverage, or a change in risk of the insured.            

       You may change your Policy guaranteed death benefit period or funding
period at any time after the Policy Date, subject to our minimum and maximum    
requirements. We will then establish a new guaranteed death benefit period and  
recalculate the guaranteed death benefit premium. The change will be effective  
on the Monthly Anniversary following the date we receive your request. This     
change is at no cost if made while a guaranteed death benefit is already in     
effect or during a guaranteed death benefit grace period. Otherwise, there is a 
charge (stated in the Charges section).                                         

      If Net Funding exceeds Required Funding at the end of the guaranteed
death benefit period, we will calculate a new guaranteed death benefit period to
be purchased by the surplus, and the new guaranteed death benefit premium will  
be zero.                                                                        

o        Grace Period                                                           

Guaranteed Death Benefit Grace Period                         
    If, on any Monthly Anniversary during the guaranteed death benefit
period, Net Funding is less than Required Funding, the guaranteed death benefit 
will lapse as of that Monthly Anniversary. You will receive notice of this lapse
and will have 61 days from the date the notice is mailed to pay sufficient      
premium if you wish to keep the guaranteed death benefit. You cannot reinstate  
the guaranteed death benefit. However, after a guaranteed death benefit grace   
period ends and for a charge (see EXPENSES section), you may start a new        
guaranteed death benefit period as described in the Guaranteed Death Benefit    
provision, above.                                                               

Policy Grace Period                                           
      On each Policy Monthly anniversary, if a guaranteed death benefit is
not in effect, we will compare your Policy Cash Surrender Value to the total    
monthly deduction charges. If the Cash Surrender Value is less than the monthly 
deductions, your Policy will lapse and the Policy grace period will begin.      

     If your Policy lapses, we allow you a 61-day grace period to make a
premium payment in order to continue the Policy. The grace period begins on the 
date we mail a notice of the premium necessary to keep this Policy in force. We 
will mail this notice to you at your current address on record with us and to   
any assignee on record. Insurance coverage continues during the grace period,   
but the Policy has no value for purposes of Policy loans, surrenders or         
transfers. If sufficient premium is not paid by the end of the grace period, the
Policy will terminate without value as of the first day of the grace period. If 
the insured dies during the grace period, we will deduct outstanding Policy debt
and Policy charges due but not paid from the death benefit proceeds payable.    

REINSTATEMENT                                                 

        If the Policy lapses because a grace period ended without a sufficient
payment being made, you may reinstate it within three years of the date of      
lapse. To reinstate, we must receive:                                           
o    Written application signed by you and the insured;     
       o    Evidence of the insured's insurability satisfactory to us, and
               the insurability of any insured covered under an optional benefit
rider;                                            
o    Premium at least equal to the greater of:              
         (1)  An amount sufficient to bring the Cash Surrender Value after the
        first monthly deduction to an amount greater than zero; or
  (2)  Three times the current Policy Month's monthly deduction.
   o    Repayment or reinstatement of any outstanding Policy debt.

The effective date of reinstatement will be the Policy Monthly
Anniversary date on or next following the date the reinstatement is approved.   

         The face amount of the reinstated Policy may not exceed the face amount
at the time of lapse. The Policy value on the effective date of reinstatement   
will equal the Policy value as of the date of lapse. The surrender charge at    
reinstatement, if any, will be based on the current Policy Year as if the Policy
had never terminated. Any guaranteed death benefit cannot be reinstated.        

     The Policy cannot be reinstated once it has been fully surrendered.

DELAY OF PAYMENTS OR TRANSFERS                                

        We will usually pay any amounts from the Separate Account requested as
a partial withdrawal or cash surrender within seven days after we receive your  
Written Notice. We can postpone such payments or any transfers out of a         
Subaccount if: (i) the NYSE is closed for other than customary weekend and      
holiday closings; (ii) trading on the NYSE is restricted; (iii) an emergency    
exists as determined by the SEC, as a result of which it is not reasonably      
practical to dispose of securities, or not reasonably practical to determine the
value of the net assets of the Separate Account; or (iv) the SEC permits delay  
for the protection of security holders. The applicable rules of the SEC will    
govern as to whether the conditions in (iii) or (iv) exist.                     

     We may defer payments of a full or partial surrender from the Fixed
Account for up to six months from the date we receive your Written Notice       
requesting the surrender.                                                       

BENEFICIARY                                                   

         You may change your beneficiary by sending Written Notice to us, unless
the named beneficiary is irrevocable. Once we record and acknowledge the change,
it is effective as of the date you signed the Written Notice. The change will   
not apply to any payments made or other action taken by us before recording. If 
the named beneficiary is irrevocable, you may change the named beneficiary only 
by Written Notice signed by both you and the beneficiary. If more than one named
beneficiary is designated, and you fail to specify their interest, they will    
share equally.                                                                  

   If the named beneficiary dies before you, then your estate is the
beneficiary until you name a new beneficiary.                                   

     The interest of any beneficiary is subject to that of any assignee.

MINOR OWNER OR BENEFICIARY                                    

       Generally (and except as provided for in some states) a minor may not
own the Policy solely in the minor's name and cannot receive payments directly  
as a Policy beneficiary. Contrary to common belief, in most States parental     
status does not automatically give parents the power to provide an adequate     
release to us to make beneficiary payments to the parent for the minor's        
benefit. A minor can "own" a Policy through the trustee of a trust established  
for the minor's benefit, or through the minor's named and court appointed       
guardian, who owns the Policy in his or her capacity as trustee or guardian.    
Where a minor is a named beneficiary, we are able to pay the minor's beneficiary
payments to the minor's trustee or guardian. Some states allow us to make such  
payments up to a limited amount directly to parents. Parents seeking to have a  
minor's interest made payable to them for the minor's benefit are encouraged to 
check with their local court to determine the process to be appointed as the    
minor's guardian; it is often a very simple process that can be accomplished    
without the assistance of an attorney. If there is no adult representative able 
to give us an adequate release for payment of the minor's beneficiary interest, 
we will retain the minor's interest on deposit until the minor attains the age  
of majority.                                                                    

POLICY CHANGES                                                

        Any change to your Policy is only effective if on a form acceptable to
us, and then only once it is received at our Service Center and recorded on our 
records. Information on how to contact us to determine what information is      
needed and where you can get various forms for Policy changes is shown on this  
prospectus' page 1, TABLE OF CONTENTS page and last page.                       

"FREE LOOK" RIGHTS                                            

    Most States give you a limited period of time within which you can
cancel your Policy, usually called a "right to examine" or "free look" period.  
The amount we will refund if you cancel during this period varies, but will     
always be at least the amount required by the State whose law governs your      
Policy. The specific terms of your state's "free look" requirements are on the  
front page of your Policy.

OPTIONAL FEATURES                                             

        Subject to certain requirements, one or more of the optional insurance
benefits described in APPENDIX B - OPTIONAL FEATURES may be added to your Policy
by rider. The cost of any optional insurance benefit will be deducted monthly   
from Policy value as stated in this prospectus' EXPENSES EXPLAINED section.     

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS                                             

       As of the date of this Prospectus, there are no proceedings affecting
the Separate Account, or that are material in relation to our total assets.     

HOW TO GET FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                               
Our company and separate account financial statements are included in a
Statement of Additional Information ("SAI"). For information on how to obtain   
copies of these financial statements, at no charge, see the STATEMENT OF        
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION; REGISTRATION STATEMENT provision on the last page of    
this prospectus.

POLICY DISTRIBUTIONS                                                            

        The principle purpose of the Policy is to provide a death benefit upon
the insured's death, but before then you may also borrow against the Policy's   
Cash Surrender Value, take a partial withdrawal, or fully surrender it for its  
Cash Surrender Value. Tax penalties and surrender charges may apply to amounts  
taken out of your Policy.                                                       

DEATH BENEFIT                                                 

  Upon the insured's death, we will pay to the Policy beneficiary:
         (a)  the death benefit on the insured's life, determined as described
below; plus                                       
        (b)  any additional life insurance proceeds provided by any optional
benefit or rider; minus                           
(c)  any outstanding Policy debt; minus                     
        (d)  any due and unpaid Policy charges, including deductions for the
month of death.                                   

      We will pay the death benefit after we receive Due Proof of Death of
the insured's death and as soon thereafter as we have sufficient information    
about the beneficiary to make the payment. Death benefits may be paid pursuant  
to a payment option to the extent allowed by applicable law and any settlement  
agreement in effect at the insured's death. If neither you nor the beneficiary  
makes a payment option election within 60 days of our receipt of Due Proof of   
Death, we will issue a lump-sum payment to the beneficiary.                     

A death benefit is payable upon:                                                
-  Your Policy being in force;                                            
-  Our receipt of Due Proof of Death of the last Insured;                 
   -  Our receipt of sufficient beneficiary information to make the payment; and
-  Your election of a payment option.                                     
"Due Proof of Death" is generally a certified copy of a death certificate, a    
certified copy of a decree of a court of competent jurisdiction as to the       
finding of death, or any other proof satisfactory to us.                        

o        Death Benefit Options                                                  
        You may choose one of two death benefit options. Option D is in effect
unless you elect Option A. The corridor death benefit for each Option is the    
amount by which that Option (b) exceeds (a), if any.                            

Death Benefit Option A                                                          
   If you prefer to have favorable investment performance, if any, reflected
in higher Policy value rather than increased insurance coverage, you should     
generally select Option A.                                                      
Under Option A, the death benefit is the greater of:                  
(a) the face amount of insurance coverage on the insured's date of death; or    
(b) the Policy value on the date of death multiplied times a corridor percentage
stated in the Policy.                                                   

Death Benefit Option D                                                          
   If you prefer to have favorable investment performance, if any, reflected
in increased insurance coverage rather than higher Policy value, you should     
generally select Option D.                                                      
Under Option D, the death benefit is the greater of:                  
(a)  the face amount of insurance coverage on the date of death plus the Policy 
    value in the Separate Account and Loan Account minus an adjustment amount.
  (The adjustment amount is the sum of transfers from the Fixed Account to
the Separate Account since Option D became effective, plus the sum of 
    transfers from the Fixed Account to the Loan Account since Option D became
 effective minus the sum of transfers from the Loan Account to the Fixed
Account since Option D became effective but not less than zero.) This 
     amount will never be less than the face amount of insurance coverage on the
date of death; or                                                     
(b)  the Policy value on the date of death multiplied times a corridor          
percentage stated in the Policy.                                      

o        Changes in Death Benefit Option                                        
         After the first Policy Year, you may change your Policy's death benefit
option.                                                                         

Changes in Death Benefit Option Rules                                           
o    Your request for a change must be by Written Notice.                       
o    You can only change your Policy death benefit option once each Policy Year.
 The change will be effective on the Policy Monthly Anniversary after we
  receive (or, if evidence of insurability is necessary, after we approve)
your request.                                                         
o    There is no fee to change your Policy death benefit option.                
o    We will adjust the face amount of insurance so that the death benefit      
immediately after the option change is the same as the death benefit  
immediately before the option change.

o        Change in Face Amount of Insurance Coverage                            
         You may change the current face amount of insurance coverage by Written
Notice on a form provided by us, and subject to our approval. A change could    
have federal tax consequences (see this Prospectus' TAX MATTERS section). Any   
change will take effect on the Policy Monthly Anniversary on or after the date  
we receive your Written Notice.                                                 

INCREASE in Coverage Rules                                                      
o    No increase is allowed in the first Policy Year.                           
o    The insured's age nearest birthday must be 80 or younger.                  
o    A new application, evidence of insurability, and additional premium for the
amount of the increase may be required.                               
o    Minimum amount of an increase in face amount of insurance coverage is      
$25,000.                                                              
o    Cost of insurance charges for the increase will be based upon the insured's
attained age and underwriting class at the time of the increase.      
o    Surrender Charges become applicable to the amount of the increase, measured
from the date of the increase. See this Prospectus' EXPENSES EXPLAINED
section.                                                              
o    Ongoing additional premium may be required to maintain your Policy's       
    Guaranteed Death Benefit Premium requirements. (See this Prospectus' OTHER
IMPORANT POLICY INFORMATION: Lapse and Grace Period - Guaranteed Death
Benefit provision.)                                                   
o    An additional Administrative Charge Per $1,000 of Increase in Face Amount  
will be added. See this Prospectus' EXPENSES EXPLAINED section.       
o    Additional premium may be required if Policy value at the time of the      
     increase, minus outstanding Policy debt, is less than an amount equal to 12
times what the current monthly deductions from Policy value will be   
reflecting the increase in face amount of insurance coverage.         

DECREASE in Coverage Rules                                                      
o    No decrease is allowed in the first Policy Year nor during the first 12    
  Policy Months following an increase in face amount of insurance coverage
except for a decrease which is the result of a partial withdrawal.    
o    The face amount of coverage after the decrease must be at least $100,000.  
o    We may limit any requested decrease to the amount necessary to keep the    
 Policy in compliance with maximum premium limits under federal tax law.
o    For purposes of determining the new Cost of Insurance charge, the decrease 
 will reduce the face amount of insurance coverage by first reducing the
     face amount provided by the most recent increase, then the next most recent
increase successively, and finally the Policy's initial face amount of
insurance coverage.                                                   
o    A decrease in Face Amount will not decrease the surrender charge nor the   
Administrative Charge Per $1,000 of Initial Face Amount.              

NO MATURITY DATE                                              

      This Policy does not have a maturity date. Cost of Insurance charges
continue through age 120. If you are still alive on the Policy Anniversary      
nearest your 121st birthday, there are no further monthly deduction charges. All
other Policy provisions will remain unchanged.

POLICY LOANS                                                  

        If you ask, your sales representative or we may be able to provide you
with illustrations giving examples of how a loan might affect Policy value, Cash
Surrender Value and death benefit. Any loan transaction will permanently affect 
Policy values. Surrender or lapse of a Policy while a loan is outstanding could 
result in significant tax consequences.                                         

AMOUNT YOU CAN BORROW                                                           
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Standard Policy Loan. After the first Policy Year, you may borrow not less than 
$200 and up to an amount equal to the Cash Surrender Value, minus guaranteed    
monthly deductions from Policy value for the rest of the Policy Year, minus     
interest on Policy debt including the requested loan to the next Policy         
anniversary.                                                                    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reduced Rate Policy Loan. Available after the 5th Policy Year. Amount eligible  
is limited to Policy earnings (Policy value exceeding the amount of premiums    
paid minus any previous partial withdrawals, minus any outstanding Reduced Rate 
Policy Loan); but, cannot exceed the maximum available loan amount. Any Standard
Policy Loan outstanding at the end of the 5th Policy Year will become a Reduced 
Rate Policy Loan up to the eligible amount from that point forward. Once a loan 
is categorized as a Reduced Rate Policy Loan, it will continue to be charged the
reduced loan rate.                                                              

LOAN INTEREST RATE                                                              
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Standard Policy Loan. Current net annual loan interest rate of 2%. We charge a  
current interest rate with a 5% effective annual yield (guaranteed to not exceed
5 1/2%) , but we also credit an interest rate with an effective annual yield of 
3% to any amounts in the Loan Account.                                          
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reduced Rate Policy Loan. Current net annual loan interest rate of 0%: we charge
a current interest rate with a 3% effective annual yield (guaranteed to not     
exceed 3 1/2%), but we also credit an interest rate with an effective annual    
yield of 3% to any amounts in the Loan Account.                                 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Loan Rules                                                                      
o    The Policy must be assigned to us as sole security for the loan.           
o    We will accept a loan request signed by you on our form of Written Notice  
by mail or facsimile.                                                 
o    We will transfer all loan amounts from the Subaccounts and the Fixed       
  Account to a Loan Account. The amounts will be transferred on a pro rata
basis, unless you instruct us otherwise. If the value of an investment
  option after a transfer pursuant to your instructions is less than $100,
the amounts will be transferred on a pro rata basis.                  
o    Loan interest is due on each Policy Anniversary. If the interest is not    
     paid when due, we will transfer an amount equal to the unpaid loan interest
    from only Policy investment options you designate; if that is not possible
   (due to insufficient value in an investment option you elect) or you have
    not provided such instructions, we will deduct loan interest on a pro-rata
basis from balances in all Subaccounts and the Fixed Account.         
o    If Policy debt exceeds Policy value minus the Surrender Charge minus       
   accrued expenses and charges, you must pay the excess or your Policy will
lapse.                                                                
o    All or part of a loan may be repaid at any time while the Policy is in     
force. We will deduct the amount of the loan repayment from the Loan  
Account and allocate that amount among the Subaccounts and the Fixed  
    Account in the same percentages as net premium is allocated on the date of
 repayment. We will treat any amounts you pay us as a premium unless you
specify that it is a loan repayment.                                  
o    The death benefit will be reduced by the amount of any loan outstanding and
unpaid loan interest on the date of the insured's death.              
o    Any loan taken from the Fixed Account may negatively impact the            
availability of a guaranteed death benefit.                           
o    We may defer making a loan for up to six months unless the loan is to pay  
premiums to us.                                                       

FULL SURRENDER                                                

       While the insured is alive, you may terminate the Policy for its Cash
Surrender Value. Following a full surrender, all your rights in the Policy end, 
and the Policy may not be reinstated.                                           

Full Surrender Rules                                          
          o    We will accept a full surrender request signed by you on our form
               of Written Notice by mail or facsimile. However, when accepting a
               request by a method not requiring an original signature, there is
            a greater possibility that unauthorized persons can manipulate
       your signature and make changes on your Policy (including
withdrawals) without your knowledge.              
        o    The applicable Surrender Charge is described in your Policy and
the EXPENSES EXPLAINED section of this Prospectus.
         o    We may defer surrender payments from the Fixed Account for up to
six months from the date we receive your request.

PARTIAL WITHDRAWAL                                            

        While the insured is alive, you may withdraw part of the Policy value.
The amount requested and any partial withdrawal charge will usually be deducted 
from the Policy value on the date we receive your request if received before 3  
p.m. Central Time.                                                              

Partial Withdrawal Rules                                                        
o    We will accept a partial withdrawal request signed by you on our form of   
     Written Notice by mail or facsimile. However, when accepting a request by a
    method not requiring an original signature, there is a greater possibility
     that unauthorized persons can manipulate your signature and make changes on
your Policy (including withdrawals) without your knowledge.           
o    The applicable Partial Withdrawal Charge is described in your Policy and   
the EXPENSES EXPLAINED section of this Prospectus.                    
o    The minimum partial withdrawal amount is $500; the maximum is an amount    
  such that remaining Cash Surrender Value is at least $1,000 or an amount
sufficient to maintain the Policy in force for the next 12 months.    
o    A partial withdrawal is irrevocable.                                       
o    For tax purposes, partial withdrawals are treated as made first from       
premiums paid and then from earnings, beginning with the most recent  
premium payment, unless the Policy is a modified endowment contract.  
o    Partial withdrawals will be deducted from your variable investment options 
   on a pro rata basis, unless you instruct us otherwise. If the value of an
    investment option after a withdrawal pursuant to your instructions is less
than $100, the amounts will be deducted on a pro rata basis.          
o    Partial withdrawals result in cancellation of Accumulation Units from each 
applicable Subaccount.                                                
o    If death benefit Option A is in effect, the current Face Amount and Policy 
  value will be reduced by the amount of any partial withdrawal, including
the partial withdrawal charge.                                        
o    If death benefit Option B is in effect, the current face amount will be    
reduced by the amount of the partial withdrawal taken from the Fixed  
Account. Policy value will be reduced by the amount of the partial    
withdrawal, including the partial withdrawal charge.                  
o    Any partial withdrawal from the Fixed Account may negatively impact the    
availability of a guaranteed death benefit and the amount of the death
benefit.                                                              
o    We reserve the right to defer withdrawal payments from the Fixed Account   
for up to six months from the date we receive your request.           
o    Depending upon the circumstances, a partial withdrawal may have tax        
consequences.                                                         

PAYMENT OF POLICY PROCEEDS                                    

     A primary function of a life insurance policy is to provide payment
options for payment of Policy proceeds in a way that best benefits the payee.   
Policy proceeds are payable upon the insured's death, a full surrender or       
partial withdrawal of Policy value, or upon any other benefit where certain     
proceeds are payable. You may elect to have Policy proceeds paid under one of   
several payment options or as a lump sum. If another option is not chosen within
60 days of the date we receive satisfactory proof of the insured's death, we    
will make payment in a lump sum to the beneficiary.                             

Rules for Payment of Policy Proceeds                                            
o    You, or your beneficiary after your death if you are the insured, may elect
    a payment option by completing an election form that can be requested from
us at any time.                                                       
o    Payees must be individuals who receive payments in their own behalf unless 
otherwise agreed to by us.                                            
o    An association, corporation, partnership or fiduciary can only receive a   
   lump sum payment or a payment under a fixed period payment option (Option
C).                                                                   
o    Any payment option chosen will be effective when we acknowledge it.        
o    We may require proof of your age or survival or the age or survival of the 
payee.                                                                
o    We reserve the right to pay the proceeds in one lump sum when the amount is
less than $5,000, or when the payment option chosen would result in   
 periodic payments of less than $100. If any payment would be or becomes
    less than $100, we also have the right to change the frequency of payments
   to an interval that will result in payments of at least $100. In no event
     will we make payments under a payment option less frequently than annually.
o    No payee may commute, encumber or alienate any proceeds under this Policy  
    before they are due. No proceeds are subject to attachment for any debt or
obligation of any payee.                                              
o    When the last payee dies, we will pay to the estate of that payee any      
  amount on deposit, or the then present value of any remaining guaranteed
payments under a fixed payment option.

P-->N-627th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�27th
        Payments under the payment options are fixed payments based on a fixed
rate of interest at or higher than the minimum effective annual rate which is   
guaranteed to yield 3% on an annual basis. Proceeds to fund payments are        
transferred to our general account and are no longer a part of the Separate     
Account. We have sole discretion whether or not to pay a higher interest rate   
for payment options A, B, C, D or E (see below). Current single premium         
immediate annuity rates for options D or E are used if higher than the          
guaranteed amounts (guaranteed amounts are based upon the tables contained in   
the Policy). Current interest rates, and further information, may be obtained   
from us. The amount of each fixed annuity payment is set and begins on the date 
payment of Policy proceeds is to begin, and does not change.                    

o        Selecting a Payment Option                                             

  Once fixed payments under a payment option begin, they cannot be
changed. (We may allow the beneficiary to transfer amounts applied under options
A to C to options D to F after the date payment of Policy proceeds begins.      
However, we reserve the right to discontinue this practice.)                    

The longer the guaranteed or projected payment option period, the lower the     
amount of each payment.                                                         

       Note: If you elect payment options D or E and select a non-guaranteed
period, it is possible that only one annuity payment would be made under the    
payment option if the person whose life the payment is based upon (the          
"measuring life") dies before the due date of the second payment, only two      
payments would be made if the "measuring life" died before the due date of the  
third payment, etc.                                                             

The payment options for receiving Policy proceeds are:        

A.   Interest Payment. We will pay interest each month at a rate determined by  
us on the amount retained.                                            

B.   Payments for a Fixed Amount. Proceeds are paid in equal monthly            
     installments until proceeds, with interest, have been fully paid. The total
annual payment must be at least 5% of the amount retained.            

C.   Payments for a Fixed Period. Proceeds are paid in equal monthly            
 installments for the face period chosen not to exceed 20 years. Monthly
incomes for each $1,000 of proceeds, which include interest, are      
illustrated by a table in the Policy.                                 

D.   Lifetime Income. Proceeds are paid as equal monthly installments based on  
   the life of a named person, and continue for the lifetime of that person.
   Variations provide for guaranteed payments for a period of time or a lump
sum refund.                                                           

E.   Joint and Last Survivor Lifetime Income. Proceeds are paid as equal monthly
   installments during the joint lives of two individuals and until the last
     of them dies. Variations provide for a reduced amount of payment during the
lifetime of the surviving person.                                     

F.   Lump Sum. Proceeds are paid in one sum.

TAX MATTERS                                                                     

        The following is only general information about federal tax law and is
not intended as tax advice. Tax laws affecting the Policy are complex, may      
change and are affected by your facts and circumstances. We cannot guarantee the
tax treatment of the Policy or any transaction involving the Policy. You should 
consult your own tax adviser as to how these general rules and any applicable   
taxes will apply to you if you purchase a Policy.                               

LIFE INSURANCE QUALIFICATION; TAX TREATMENT OF DEATH BENEFIT  

   The Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code") defines a life
insurance contract for federal income tax purposes. This definition can be met  
if an insurance contract satisfies either one of two tests. The Code and related
regulations do not directly address the manner in which these tests should be   
applied to certain features of the Policy. Thus, there is some uncertainty about
how those tests apply to the Policy.                                            

   Nevertheless, we believe the Policy qualifies as a life insurance
contract for federal tax purposes, so that:                                     
o    the death benefit should be fully excludable from the  
beneficiary's gross income; and                   
         o    you should not be considered in constructive receipt of the Cash
               Surrender Value, including any increases in Cash Surrender Value,
 unless and until it is distributed from the Policy.

    We reserve the right to make such changes in the Policy as we deem
necessary to assure it qualifies as a life insurance contract under the Code and
continues to provide the tax benefits of such qualification.                    

    Modified Endowment Contracts. The Code establishes a class of life
insurance contracts designated as modified endowment contracts. The Code rules  
governing whether a Policy will be treated as a modified endowment contract are 
extremely complex. In general, a Policy is a modified endowment contract if the 
accumulated premium payments made at any time during the first seven Policy     
Years exceed the sum of the net level premium payments which would have been    
paid on or before such time if the policy provided for paid-up future benefits  
after the payment of seven level annual premiums. A Policy may also become a    
modified endowment contract because of a material change. The determination of  
whether a Policy is a modified endowment contract after a material change       
generally depends upon the relationship of the Policy's death benefit and Policy
value at the time of such change and the additional premium payments made in the
seven years following the material change. A Policy may also become a modified  
endowment contract if the death benefit is reduced.                             

This Policy's flexibility and how you tailor it to meet your needs could cause  
it to be a modified endowment contract. We recommend you consult with a tax     
adviser to determine if desired Policy transactions may cause such treatment.   
When a premium payment is credited which we believe causes the Policy to become 
a modified endowment contract, we will notify you and offer you the opportunity 
to request a refund of that premium in order to avoid such treatment. You have  
30 days after receiving such a notice to request the refund.                    

  A Policy issued in exchange for a modified endowment contract is
subject to tax treatment as a modified endowment contract. However, we believe  
that a Policy issued in exchange for a life insurance policy that is not a      
modified endowment contract will generally not be treated as a modified         
endowment contract if the death benefit of the Policy is greater than or equal  
to the death benefit of the Policy being exchanged. The payment of any premiums 
at the time of or after the exchange may, however, cause the Policy to become a 
modified endowment contract. You may, of course, choose to not make additional  
payments in order to prevent a Policy from being treated as a modified endowment
contract.                                                                       

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR CORPORATIONS                       

Premium paid by a business for a life insurance Policy is not 
deductible as a business expense or otherwise if the business is directly or    
indirectly a beneficiary of the Policy. For purposes of the alternative minimum 
tax ("AMT") that may be imposed on corporations, the death benefit from the     
Policy, even though excluded from gross income for normal tax purposes, is      
included in "adjusted current earnings" for AMT purposes. In addition, although 
increases to the Policy's cash surrender value are generally excluded from gross
income for normal income tax purposes, such increases are included in adjusted  
current earnings for income tax purposes. In recent years, Congress has adopted 
new rules relating to corporate owned life insurance. Any business contemplating
the purchase of a new life insurance contract or a change in an existing        
contract should consult a tax advisor.

TAX TREATMENT OF LOANS & OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS                                    

      Upon a surrender or lapse of the Policy, if the amount received plus
any outstanding Policy debt exceeds the total cost basis in the Policy, the     
excess will generally be treated as ordinary income subject to tax, regardless  
of whether a Policy is or is not a modified endowment contract. However, the tax
consequences of distributions from, and loans taken from or secured by, a Policy
depend on whether the Policy is classified as a modified endowment contract.    

"Cost Basis in the Policy" means:                                               
-  the total of any premium payments or other consideration paid for the Policy,
minus                                                                     
-  any withdrawals previously recovered that were not taxable.                  

Distributions from Policies Classified as Modified Endowment Contracts are      
subject to the following tax rules:                                             
1)   All distributions, including surrenders and partial withdrawals, are       
 treated as ordinary income subject to tax up to the amount equal to the
 excess (if any) of the Policy value immediately before the distribution
over the cost basis in the Policy at such time.                       
2)   Loans from or secured by the Policy are treated as distributions and taxed 
     accordingly. If you do not repay loan interest, the loan interest itself is
treated as a distribution.                                            
3)   A 10% additional income tax is imposed on the portion of any distribution  
from, or loan taken from or secured by, the Policy that is included in
    income except where the distribution or loan is made on or after the Owner
     attains age 59 1/2, is attributable to the Owner's becoming disabled, or is
    part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments for the life (or
life expectancy) of the Owner or the joint lives (or joint life       
expectancies) of the Owner and the Owner's beneficiary.               

Distributions from Policies Not Classified as Modified Endowment Contracts are  
generally treated as first recovering the cost basis in the Policy and then,    
only after the return of all such cost basis in the Policy, as distributing     
taxable income. An exception to this general rule occurs in the case of a       
decrease in the Policy's death benefit or any other change that reduces benefits
under the Policy in the first 15 years after the Policy is issued and that      
results in a cash distribution to the Owner in order for the Policy to continue 
complying with the Code's definition of life insurance. Such a cash distribution
will be taxed in whole or in part as ordinary income (to the extent of any gain 
in the Policy).                                                                 

      Loans from, or secured by, a Policy that is not a modified endowment
contract are not treated as distributions. However, it is possible that reduced 
rate loans could be treated as distributions rather than loans.                 

         Distributions (including upon surrender) and loans from, or secured by,
a Policy that is not a modified endowment contract are not subject to the 10%   
additional income tax rule. If a Policy which is not now but later becomes a    
modified endowment contract because of a reduction in benefits, then any        
distributions made from the Policy within two years prior to the change will    
become taxable pursuant to modified endowment contract rules.                   

OTHER POLICY OWNER TAX MATTERS                                

    Depending on the circumstances, the exchange of a Policy, a Policy
loan, a partial or full surrender, a lapse, a change in ownership, or an        
assignment of the Policy may have federal income tax consequences. In addition, 
federal, state and local transfer and other tax consequences of ownership or    
receipt of distributions from a Policy depends on the circumstances of each     
Owner or beneficiary.                                                           

Interest paid on Policy loans generally is not tax deductible.

      Aggregation of modified endowment contracts. Pre-death distributions
(including a loan, partial surrender, collateral assignment or full surrender)  
from a Policy that is treated as a modified endowment contract may require a    
special aggregation to determine the amount of income recognized on the Policy. 
If we or any of our affiliates issue more than one modified endowment contract  
to the same Policy Owner within any 12-month period, then for purposes of       
measuring the income on the Policy with respect to a distribution from any of   
those Policies, the income for all those Policies will be aggregated and        
attributed to that distribution.                                                

     Federal and state estate, inheritance and other tax consequences of
ownership or receipt of proceeds under the Policy depend upon your or the       
beneficiary's individual circumstance.                                          

        Diversification requirements. Investments of the Separate Account must
be "adequately diversified" for the Policy to qualify as a life insurance       
contract under the Code. Any failure to comply with diversification requirements
could subject you to immediate taxation on the incremental increases in Policy  
value plus the cost of insurance protection for the year. However, we believe   
the Policy complies fully with such requirements.                               

       Owner control. The Treasury Department stated that it anticipates the
issuance of regulations or rulings prescribing the circumstances in which your  

-26-

P-->N-630th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�30th
control of the investments of the Separate Account may cause you, rather than   
us, to be treated as the owner of the assets in the Separate Account. To date,  
no such regulations or guidance has been issued. If you are considered the Owner
of the assets of the Separate Account, income and gains from the Separate       
Account would be included in your gross income.                                 
        The ownership rights under the Policy are similar to, but different in
certain respects from, those described by the IRS in rulings in which it        
determined that owners were not owners of separate account assets. For example, 
you have additional flexibility in allocating Policy premium and Policy values. 
These differences could result in you being treated as the owner of a pro rata  
share of the assets of the Separate Account. In addition, we do not know what   
standards will be set forth in the regulations or rulings which the Treasury may
issue. We therefore reserve the right to modify the Policy as necessary to      
attempt to prevent you from being considered the Owner of the assets of the     
Separate Account.                                                               

Tax-advantaged arrangements. The Policy may be used in various
arrangements, including non-qualified deferred compensation or salary           
continuance plans, split dollar insurance plans, executive bonus plans, tax     
exempt and nonexempt welfare benefit plans, retiree medical benefit plans and   
others. The tax consequences of such plans may vary depending on the particular 
facts and circumstances of each individual arrangement. If you are contemplating
the use of the Policy in any arrangement the value of which depends in part on  
its tax consequences, you should be sure to consult a qualified tax advisor     
regarding the tax attributes of the particular arrangement and the suitability  
of this Policy for the arrangement.                                             

     Split-Dollar Arrangements. The IRS and the Treasury Department have
issued guidance that substantially affects split-dollar arrangements. Consult a 
qualified tax advisor before entering into or paying additional premiums with   
respect to such arrangements.                                                   
       Also, on July 30, 2002, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 became law and
required significant accounting and corporate governance reform. This Act       
prohibits, with limited exceptions, publicly-traded companies from extending    
many types of personal loans to their directors or executive officers. This     
prohibition may be interpreted as applying to some arrangements for split-dollar
life insurance policies for directors and executive officers of such companies, 
since such insurance may be viewed as involving a loan from the employer for at 
least some purposes. Any affected business contemplating the payment of a       
premium on an existing Policy, or the purchase of a new Policy, in connection   
with a split-dollar life insurance arrangement should consult legal counsel.    

  Tax Shelter Regulations. Prospective owners should consult a tax
advisor about the treatment of the Policy under the Treasury Regulations        
applicable to tax shelters.                                                     

     Alternative Minimum Tax. There may also be an indirect tax upon the
income in the Policy or the proceeds of a Policy under the federal corporate    
alternative minimum tax, if the owner is subject to that tax.

APPENDIX B: Optional Features                                                   

    This Appendix is intended to provide only a very brief overview of
additional benefits available to be added to your Policy by rider. Some of these
features are only available at the time the Policy is issued, and may not be    
added later. For more information, contact your registered representative or us.
Certain riders may not be available in all states. The cost for each rider, if  
any, is explained in the EXPENSES section.                                      

o    Disability Benefit Rider                                                   
    This Rider provides that during periods of the insured's total disability,
  as defined in the Rider, we will provide benefits to the Policy Owner by
   paying a benefit into the Policy as a premium, and by waiving the Cost of
     Insurance Charge for this Rider. The Owner chooses the benefit level at the
issue of the Rider.                                                   

o    Children's Protection Rider                                                
This Rider provides term life insurance protection, as defined in the 
Rider, for the insured's children.                                    

o    Other Insured Rider                                                        
This Rider provides term insurance upon an individual other than the  
insured.                                                              

o    Terminal Illness Rider                                                     
     This Rider provides for the ability to accelerate the death benefit to be a
    living benefit to withdraw value from the Policy, as defined in the Rider,
   in the event of diagnosis of a terminal illness. No extra cost. The total
     value available as a benefit is an amount less than the total death benefit
payable under the Policy.                                             

o    Legacy Asset Rider                                                         
     This Rider also provides for the ability to accelerate the death benefit to
  be a living benefit to withdraw value from the Policy, as defined in the
   Rider, in the event of a diagnosis of a terminal or chronic illness. This
 living benefit is not a qualified life insurance benefit under Internal
    Revenue Code section 7702, so the charge for this Rider must be treated as
a partial withdrawal from the Policy for income tax purposes.         

o    Waiver of Deductions Rider                                                 
This Rider is issued in conjunction with the Legacy Asset Rider and   
provides for the waiver of certain Policy charges and charges for any 
    Policy riders so long as benefits under the Legacy Asset Rider are payable
    in the event of a diagnosis of a chronic illness (and does not apply for a
terminal illness diagnosis).

DEFINED TERMS 

Accumulation Units are an accounting unit of measure used to calculate the      
Policy value allocated to Subaccounts of the Separate Account. It is similar to 
a share of a mutual fund. The Policy describes how Accumulation Units are       
calculated.                                                                     

Business Day is each day that the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading.  

Cash Surrender Value is the total Policy value less outstanding loans and loan  
interest, less any applicable surrender charge, and less any due but unpaid     
Policy charges.                                                                 

Fixed Account is an account that credits a fixed rate of interest guaranteed by 
us and is not affected by the experience of the variable investment options of  
the Separate Account. The Fixed Account is part of our general account.         

Loan Account is an account we maintain for your Policy if you have a Policy loan
outstanding. The Loan Account is credited with interest and is not affected by  
the experience of the variable investment options of the Separate Account. The  
Loan Account is part of our general account.                                    

Owner, You, Your is you -- the person(s) or legal entity who may exercise all   
rights and privileges under the Policy. If there are joint Owners, the          
signatures of both Owners are needed to exercise rights under the Policy.       

Policy Coverage Date                                                            

Policy Date is the effective date for Policy coverage. It is usually, but need  
not be, the same as the date the Policy is issued.                              

Policy Year/Month/Anniversary is measured from respective anniversary dates of  
the Policy Date of your Policy.                                                 

Planned Periodic Premium is a schedule of equal premiums payable at fixed       
intervals chosen by you, the Owner. You need not follow this schedule, nor will 
following it ensure that the Policy will remain in force unless the payments are
sufficient to keep the Guaranteed Death Benefit in effect.                      

Net Funding is the sum of these transactions during the guaranteed death benefit
period: premiums allocated to the Fixed Account, plus transfers to the Fixed    
Account, minus partial withdrawals and transfers from the Fixed Account.        

Required Funding, on the Policy issue date, is the guaranteed death benefit     
premium plus guaranteed death benefit dump-in premium, if any. On the first day 
of any new guaranteed death benefit period after the Policy issue date, Required
Funding equals the new guaranteed death benefit premium. On any Monthly         
Anniversary other than the first day of a guaranteed death benefit period,      
Required Funding equals Required Funding on the previous Monthly Anniversary    
plus one additional monthly guaranteed death benefit premium.                   

Subaccount is a variable investment option division within the Separate Account 
for which Accumulation Units are separately maintained. Each Subaccount         
corresponds to a single, underlying, non-publicly traded portfolio issued       
through a series fund.                                                          

Valuation Period is the period commencing at the close of business of the New   
York Stock Exchange on each Business Day and ending at the close of business on 
the next succeeding Business Day.

ILLUSTRATIONS                                                                   

Illustrations are tools that can help demonstrate how the Policy  
operates, given the Policy's charges, investment options and any optional       
features selected, how you plan to accumulate or access Policy value over time, 
and assumed rates of return. Illustrations may also be able to assist you in    
comparing the Policy's death benefits, Cash Surrender Values and Policy values  
with those of other variable life insurance policies based upon the same or     
similar assumptions. You may ask your sales representative or us (at our        
toll-free telephone number) to provide an illustration, without charge, based   
upon your specific situation.

MORE INFORMATION ON CHARGES 

o        Waiver of Certain Charges                                              

         When the Policy is sold in a manner that results in savings of sales or
administrative expenses, we reserve the right to waive all or part of any fee we
charge under the Policy (excluding charges charged by the portfolios). Factors  
we consider include one or more of the following: size and type of group to whom
the Policy is issued; amount of expected premiums; relationship with us         
(employee of us or an affiliated company, receiving distributions or making     
transfers from other policies we or one of our affiliates issue, or transferring
amounts held under qualified retirement plans we or one of our affiliates       
sponsor); type and frequency of administrative and sales services provided; or  
level of annual maintenance fee and withdrawal charges. Any fee waiver will not 
discriminate unfairly against protected classes of individuals and will be done 
according to our rules in effect at the time the Policy is issued. We reserve   
the right to change these rules. The right to waive any charges may be subject  
to State approval.                                                              

o        Underwriting Procedure                                                 

      The Policy's cost of insurance depends upon the insured's sex, issue
age, risk class, and length of time the Policy has been in force. The rates will
vary depending upon tobacco use and other risk factors. For the Policy 4101     
policy, guaranteed cost of insurance rates are based on the gender-distinct,    
smoker-distinct 2001 Standard Ordinary Mortality Tables, Age Nearest Birthday.  
For all other policies, the guaranteed cost of insurance rates are based on the 
insured's attained age and are equal to the 1980 Insurance Commissioners        
Standard Ordinary Male and Female Mortality Tables without smoker distinction.  
The maximum rates for the table-rated substandard insureds are based on a       
multiple (shown in the schedule pages of the Policy) of the above rates. We may 
add flat extra ratings to reflect higher mortality risk. Any change in the cost 
of insurance rates will apply to all insureds of the same age, gender, risk     
class and whose Policies have been in effect for the same length of time.       

  The cost of insurance rates, Policy charges, and payment options for
Policies issued in Montana, and perhaps other states or in connection with      
certain employee benefit arrangements, are issued on a gender-neutral (unisex)  
basis. The unisex rates will be higher than those applicable to females and     
lower than those applicable to males.                                           

       If the rating class for any increase in the specified amount of insurance
coverage is not the same as the rating class at issue, the cost of insurance    
rate used after such increase will be a composite rate based upon a weighted    
average of the rates of the different rating classes. Decreases may be reflected
in the cost of insurance rate, as discussed earlier.                            

 The actual charges made during the Policy year will be shown in the
annual report delivered to Policy owners.                                       

DISTRIBUTION OF MATERIALS                                     

     We will distribute proxy statements, updated prospectuses and other
materials to you from time to time. In order to achieve cost savings, we may    
send consolidated mailings to several owners with the same last name who share a
common address or post office box.                                              

LICENSING AGREEMENT                                           

       The Policy is not sponsored, endorsed, sold or promoted by Standard &

ADVERTISING 

     From time to time, we may advertise performance information for the
Subaccounts and their underlying portfolios. We may also advertise ratings,     
rankings or other information related to us, the Subaccounts or the underlying  
portfolios.                                                                     

 We may provide hypothetical illustrations of Policy value, Cash
Surrender Value and death benefit based on historical investment returns of the 
underlying portfolios for a sample Policy based on assumptions as to age, sex   
and risk class of the insured, and other Policy-specific assumptions.           

We may also provide individualized hypothetical illustrations 
calculated in the same manner as stated above but based upon factors particular 
to your Policy.                                                                 

PERFORMANCE DATA                                              

    From time to time, we may advertise performance for the Subaccount
variable investment options. Performance data is available on our website and is
authorized for use with prospective investors only when accompanied or preceded 
by current product and fund prospectuses containing detailed information about  
the Policy, investment, limitations and risks.                                  

   Performance returns reflect fees and charges assessed by the fund
companies and current mortality and expenses and administrative risk charges    
deducted from separate account assets. Some portfolio advisors have agreed to   
limit their expenses; without these limits, performance would have been lower.  
The returns shown on our website do not reflect the Policy's transaction fees   
and periodic charges. If these fees and charges were deducted, the performance  
quoted would be lower. Yields shown are typically "annualized" yields. This     
means the income generated during the measured seven days is assumed to be      
generated each week over a 52-week period, and not reinvested, and is shown as a
percentage of the investment.                                                   

       We encourage you to obtain a personalized illustration which reflects
all charges of the Policy and the impact of those charges upon performance;     
contact your registered representative or us to obtain an illustration, without 
charge, based upon your specific situation. See the Policy prospectus for       
detailed information about Policy charges and portfolio prospectuses for each   
portfolio's expenses.                                                           

      For periods prior to the date the Policy Subaccount began operation,
performance data will be calculated based on the performance of the underlying  
portfolio and the assumption that the Subaccounts were in existence for the same
periods as those indicated for the underlying portfolio with the level of Policy
charges that were in effect at the inception of the Subaccount.                 

    Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The return and
principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that investor's shares, when 
redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

Item 30.      Indemnification                                                   

Ameritas Variable Life Insurance Company's By-laws provide as follows:          

   "The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was, or is a party, or is
threatened to be made a party, to any threatened, pending or completed action,  
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative by 
reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer or employee of  
the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a     
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint 
venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses including attorney's fees, 
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred
in connection with such action, suit or proceeding to the full extent authorized
by the laws of Nebraska."                                                       

Section 21-2004 of the Nebraska Business Corporation Act, in general, 
allows a corporation to indemnify any director, officer, employee or agent of   
the corporation for amount paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred  
by him or her in connection with an action, suit or proceeding, if he or she    
acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or   
not opposed to the best interest of the corporation, and with respect to any    
criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her    
conduct was unlawful.                                                           

In a case of a derivative action, no indemnification shall be made in 
respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been   
adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his or 
her duty to the corporation, unless a court in which the action was brought     
shall determine that such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnify 
for such expenses which the Court shall deem proper.                            

   Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the Securities Act
of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the  
registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant   
has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission  
such indemnification is against such liabilities (other than the payment by the 
registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling   
person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or       
proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in      
connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in 
the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent,
submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such         
indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will 
be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
