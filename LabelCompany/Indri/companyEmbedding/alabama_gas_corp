Save MoneyBy Buying Natural Gas
  AppliancesBuy Natural Gas Appliances: Shopping TipsKnow what to look for when shopping for your natural gas appliance.Selecting the right natural gas appliances for your home can be overwhelming, given all the choices and features. Don’t worry. We’ve created a simple list for you to review and take with you to the store. 7 things to consider:+–Size Size matters. Where’s the appliance going? What is it going to be used for? And how much of it is needed? Whether you are shopping for a natural gas water heater, furnace, stove or dryer, the appliance size you will need depends on the available space and your consumption needs. 
Selecting the proper size can help you reduce your monthly bill by eliminating unnecessary energy use. +–Energy Efficiency Saving energy, and in turn, saving money is important to all of us. Whether it is an appliance’s Energy Factor (EF), or appliance features, not every appliance is the same and not every appliance will use the same amount of energy. Be sure and compare energy efficiencies:Water heaters compare Energy Factor (EF). 
Furnaces compare AFUE (Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency). 
Dryers compare features like moisture sensors. 
Ranges compare oven insulations. +–Additional Features Consider special features to suit your personal preferences and improve your experience. 
Look for features that make your life easier and more enjoyable. 
Additional features like moisture sensors on a dryer can help save money in the long run. +–Location & Venting optionsConsider the location where your appliance will be housed and the required venting needs.+–Price Compare features and prices to ensure you’re getting the best deal on product, installation, warranties and service support.+–Installation & Repair WarrantiesCompare installation and repair warranties. 
Ask critical questions, such as: 
Does the warranty cover equipment and installation? For how long? 
What is the product availability? 
Are certain energy efficiency-rated products discontinued? 
What is a typical cost of service and maintenance? To ensure optimal performance, always follow the manufacturer’s recommendations for use and maintenance, including regular inspections. +–ContractorsAlways obtain estimates from a qualified and reputable contractor. 
Make sure the contractor you select is licensed and insured. 
Ask your contractor if he or she installs and services products.

Alabama Byproducts Corporation - Bhamwiki


















Alabama Byproducts Corporation

From Bhamwiki


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

 ABC Coke Plant in 2006
Alabama Byproducts Corporation (also called ABC Coke) in Tarrant City is the United States' largest producer of foundry coke. The company was founded in 1920 as the North Birmingham By Products Coke Oven Plant by the Sloss-Sheffield Steel & Iron Company. The facility provided coal gas to loft the balloons participating in the 1920 International Balloon Race, which launched from the grounds near the plant.
Since 1985, it has been a division of the Drummond Company. ABC supplies all of the foundry coke for GMC's engine blocks and won that company's "Worldwide Supplier of the Year" award in 1993.
Until recently the plant burned coal to produce steam and incinerated excess gas in a large flare, visible for miles around. A project to harvest this combustion energy to power the plant has produced significant energy cost savings.
