Norman Johnson, 93, of Milnor, ND, passed away September 20, 2015 at Sanford Medical Center, Bismarck, ND.    

	Norman Emmanuel, son of Peter and Selma (Moberg) Johnson was born on the Johnson Family Farm near Milnor on November 21, 1921.  He grew up and attended school in Milnor, graduating from Milnor High School in 1939.  After his schooling, Norman farmed with his father and his brother Ardell.     

	On December 29, 1957, he married the love of his life, Delores M. Fatland at Wyndmere Lutheran Church.  His parents moved to town, and the newlyweds moved into the family farm house, where together they raised their four children; Krisselle, Bradley, Jay and Maureen.  Norman continued to farm with his brother Ardell and then later his sons, Brad and Jay, until retiring in 1983.     
     	During their retirement years, Norman and Delores enjoyed traveling.  Norman was a devoted husband to Delores, and an amazing caregiver to her.  They loved each other so much.  Norman was awarded the 1999 North Dakota Caregiver of the Year, nominated by Delores.    

	Delores passed away on February 24, 2000.  Norman remained on the farm until a fall from a grain truck in 2008.  He recovered at the home of Maureen and Rob Bentz in Bismarck.  In 2010, he moved to Edgewood Vista Living, Bismarck.  In March of this year, he moved to Edgewood Memory Care in Mandan until his recent hospitalization.    

	Norman was an active member of the Milnor United Methodist Church, Farmers Grain and Trading Elevator Board, Milnor Township Board, Masonic Lodge and Investment Club.  He also enjoyed bowling for many years in the bowling league.    

	He is survived by his family, including children, Kris and Brett Stroh, Tappen, ND, Brad Johnson, LaMoure, ND, Jay Johnson, Milnor, ND, and Maureen and Rob Bentz, Bismarck, ND; grandchildren, Scott Stroh, Mandan, Kaylyn Stroh, Fargo, Kylie Bentz, Fargo, and Jordan Bentz, Bismarck; sisters, Edna Gochnour, Bothell, WA, and Evelyn McCracken, College Place, WA; his brother, Ardell Johnson, Milnor; and numerous nieces and nephews.    

	He was preceded in death by his parents Peter and Selma Johnson, his wife Delores, sister Clara Johnson, sister-in-law Vera Johnson, and brothers-in-law Jim McCracken and Harold Gochnour.    

	Visitation will be held on Friday evening, September 25, 2015 from 6:00 to 7:00 p.m. followed by a prayer service at 7:00 p.m. at the United Methodist Church, Milnor, ND.  His funeral will be Saturday, September 26, 2015 at 10:30 a.m. also at the Milnor United Methodist Church.  Burial will be at Lakeside Cemetery, Milnor.
