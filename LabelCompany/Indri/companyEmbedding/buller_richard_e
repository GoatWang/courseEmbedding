Richard Buller, MD


Pfizer Inc.
Dr. Buller is the Vice President of Translational Oncology and Interim Head of Oncology Late Stage Clinical Development in the Pfizer Oncology Business Unit. His group is responsible for development of biomarker and companion diagnostic clinical strategies as well as proof of mechanism/pharmacology for drug candidates. Recent success is reflected by the approval of critoztinib for the treatment of ALK positive non small cell lung cancer.
Prior to joining Pfizer, Dr Buller was Vice President of Translational Medicine at Exelixis, Inc, a development-stage biotechnology company dedicated to the discovery and development of novel small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of cancer and other serious diseases. At Exelixis, his group played a central role in relating cancer drug effects in patients to drug targets and host genetics. Prior to the Exelixis position, Dr Buller was a Director in the Oncology Medicine Development Centre at GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) focusing on development and implementation of clinical strategies around the company’s portfolio of oncology drug candidates. At GSK, he co-led the successful sNDA of topotecan for the treatment of cervical cancer.
Previously, Dr. Buller was Professor, Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology & Pharmacology, and Division Director of Gynecologic Oncology at the University of Iowa College of Medicine. He received a BS in chemistry from UCLA and was awarded both the Doctor of Medicine and Doctor of Philosophy (Bert O’Malley Lab) degrees from Baylor College of Medicine before completing an OB/GYN residency at UCSF and a gynecologic oncology fellowship with Dr. Philip DiSaia at UCI. He is a board certified gynecologic oncologist with extensive clinical trials experience in all phases of drug development both as an academic and in industry. Dr Buller has authored more than 140 publications and has received numerous awards and honors including multiple year listings in the Guide to America’s Top Physicians prepared by Consumer Research Council of America.
His major laboratory research interest over the years has been the molecular genetics of ovarian cancer.
