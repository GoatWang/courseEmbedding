We love to help!Should I form my business as an LLC?Despite being a relatively new option, the limited liability company (LLC) is now one of the most popular business structures among smaller organizations. While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the regulations imposed on other types of companies, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). This means that the personal assets of an LLC's ownership cannot be collected to fulfill the debts of the business. What is involved in forming an LLC?All states require potential LLC owners to file a substantial set of documents, typically called the Articles of Organization, in order to establish their business. We can take care of this process for you, saving you time, effort, and allowing you to focus on developing your business – not filing paperwork. How should I name my LLC?The name you choose for your LLC is an important decision, as it will be how you represent yourself to potential associates and clients. With that in mind, it is advisable that you take some time to craft a name that you will be proud to have representing you and your business.Your name must be unique, and not deceptively similar, to any other trademarked name or business. It is also required that your name not be used to intentionally misrepresent the products or services you offer. For LLCs, nearly all states will also require you to add a signifier of your limited liability status, such as "LLC" or "L.L.C." to the end of your company's name. You may be able to operate under a name other than your formal LLC name by applying for and using a dba. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form an LLC?There is no minimum requirement as to the number of owners (also referred to as members) that an LLC must have. At the federal level, single-member LLCs qualify for pass-through taxation, however this is not always true at the state level.

Most large companies are formed under this structure as it offers the most tax related options for business owners. It provides the greatest level of separation between the company and its owners, and allows the company to raise capital through the issuance of publicly traded stock.

The most important of these differences is that S Corps are eligible for special pass through taxation status with the IRS.

Why Incorporate | Why You Should Incorporate Your Business | Swyft Filings Home   Starting Your Business  Why Incorporate Your Business? About Us Pricing Overview Our 5 Step Process Why Incorporate General FAQs Our GuaranteeThe Benefits of IncorporatingIncorporating your business offers a unique mix of benefits, many of which are unavailable to informal business structures such as sole proprietorships and general partnerships. If you are looking for tax flexibility, limited liability, and the option to raise capital, incorporation may be the best path for you. The following are four of the major benefits of incorporation:Increased CredibilityBeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law. By simply adding “Inc” or “LLC” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking for.Tax Benefits Corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses. These write-offs can be substantial since insurance, travel, and entertainment are deductions. Corporation owners are also free from paying certain self-employment taxes, which informal business owners must pay.Asset ProtectionIn the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts, the owners are given limited liability status. This means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts. In the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation, the owners’ personal assets are protected.Perpetual lifespan If your business is incorporated, it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership. The transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers. Informal business structures are not perpetual entities, so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell, the business typically ceases to exist in its current form.

Form an LLC in Texas.

How to Form a Texas LLC in 3 Simple Steps
Are you looking for the freedom that comes with owning your own company? An LLC is a popular choice for many
new Texas business owners. In the Lone Star State, business owners can take advantage of several tax
benefits, strong asset protection and flexible profit choices—in a state with one of the fastest growing
economies. Here’s how to start your LLC in Texas.


Step One: Choosing Your Texas LLC’s Name
The first step in forming a new LLC in Texas is to create a name. The name you choose for your Texas LLC has to
be different from other Texas business or LLC names. Here are a couple of laws unique to Texas that will impact
naming your LLC:

What you can’t do: The name can’t contain words or phrases that could give the impression that
the LLC has been organized for some purpose other than that specified in its articles, or one that’s not allowed
by state law.
What you must do: The LLC name must end in one of the following terms or its abbreviations:
“Limited Liability Company;” “LLC” or “L.L.C.;” “Limited Company;” “LC” or “L.C.”
Step Two: Creating and Filing Your Articles of Organization

Once you have a name, Texas law states that you must write up and file articles of organization for your new
LLC. The articles of organization must list:


The LLC’s name and business purpose.
The name and address of your LLC’s registered agent (see below for specific requirements for Texas
registered agents.

How long it’s planned to last (usually perpetual unless otherwise specified).
The name and addresses of the organizer(s) and their signature(s).
Whether the LLC will be managed by a manager or managers.
The name and address of each manager or initial member.
The signature of a manager, organizer, member, trustee, or fiduciary, and the signer’s position.
Any other relevant information.

Registered Agents in Texas
Texas LLCs must each have a registered agent in Texas — someone designated to receive official
correspondence from state administrative or legal agencies. A registered agent for an LLC in Texas can
be an individual resident, a Texas LLC or corporation, or an out-of-state (“foreign”) corporation or LLC
with an office in Texas. The LLC must keep a business office at the same address as its registered
office, and it must be a street address, not just a post office box or answering service.
If you need a registered agent in Texas, Incfile can provide that service.


Your LLC is “organized” when an original and one copy of the articles of organization are given to the Texas
Secretary of State’s office along with the filing fee, and their office confirms that they comply with state
requirements. Incfile will
submit these forms for you.
The Secretary of State endorses both copies, keeps the original, and returns the signed copy. The articles of
organization are effective as of the date and time they are filed unless a later date and time are
specified.
Step 3: Writing Your Operating Agreement
After you’ve filed your articles of incorporation, your LLC needs an operating agreement. This isn’t required by
state law, but it’s a critical internal document that officially explains how the LLC will operate. It
lists:

The members (see below for how membership works in a Texas LLC).
How much they have invested.
How profits are divided.
How much weight each member has when votes are taken.
It may also list standards for meetings (how much notice, what constitutes a quorum, rules for voting, etc.)
and so on, but is not required to do so.


A typical operating agreement also includes requirements mandated by the state of Texas, and can be amended or
repealed as specified by the agreement or applicable law.
How Membership Works in a Texas LLC
Texas LLCs must have at least one member, and each member must be a natural person (as opposed to a corporate entity). To become a member, an individual usually has to make a contribution, pay money, or transfer property to the LLC, or else assume an obligation to do so or render some kind of service.
A member can resign from an LLC, but only in the way specified in the articles of organization or operating agreement. These documents also usually specify a minimum period of time a member can be a member before being allowed to resign. LLCs have the option of penalizing a resigning member for damages suffered by the LLC due to his resignation.
Ongoing Requirements for LLCs in Texas - Including Taxes
Texas LLCs are required to file an annual report with the Texas Secretary of State including the following:

LLC name and the state where the LLC was organized (if not Texas).
Address of the registered office and the name of the registered agent.
Address of the principal LLC office.
Names and business addresses of the LLC’s managers.

The Texas Franchise Tax filing requirements state that you must file an annual Franchise Tax Report, and an Information Report. You must file additional forms if you take any credits on your report, file as a tiered partnership, or file as a combined group.
When you form your LLC with Incfile, we’ll send reminder emails about Texas’ ongoing requirements as the due dates approach.
How are LLC taxes handled in Texas? 
An LLC has some tax advantages when compared to a corporation, including the availability of more deductions. However, there is no requirement for an LLC to be a separate tax entity like a corporation. Instead, an LLC can be a “pass-through entity” when it comes to taxes, so that the LLC owner or owners report business losses or profits on their personal tax returns, in the same way that a partnership would.
The IRS treats single-member LLCs as sole proprietorships for tax purposes unless you choose for your LLC to be taxed as a corporation. This means the LLC itself does not pay taxes and does not have to file a tax return. The IRS treats multi-owned LLCs as partnerships for tax purposes, unless you choose for your LLC to be taxed as a corporation. This means that LLC owners each pay taxes on their lawful share of the profits on their personal income tax returns, not the LLC itself.
When starting a new LLC in Texas, you may need to obtain a federal tax identification or employment identification number (EIN). In most cases, you won’t need a separate EIN for your LLC if you are the sole owner and the LLC has no employees. However, if you are not the sole owner of the LLC, or if the LLC has employees, the LLC will need a separate EIN to open a bank account and to meet tax filing requirements.
Dissolution of an LLC in Texas
A Texas LLC is dissolved when any one of the following events occurs:

Event(s) specified in the articles of organization or operating agreement
There is an agreement to dissolve by the number or percentage of members specified in the operating
agreement

An event that makes it illegal for the LLC to continue to operate
When a member leaves the LLC, unless the remaining members agree to continue the LLC within 90 days, or the
company continues under specifications set out in the
operating agreement

Insight

                                    In a recent study, up to 60% of hospital staff uniforms were found to be contaminated with potentially pathogenic bacteria and drug-resistant organisms¹. Developing a better way to clean uniforms could lead to fewer hospital-associated infections.

This is just one of the ways we innovate the everyday.

News Release
Aramark Educational Services LLC in Lubbock, Texas, settles charges of gender and race discrimination with US Labor Department
335 class members to receive $165K in back wages, interest, benefits
DALLAS   Following an investigation by the  U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs,  Aramark Education Services LLC has entered into a conciliation agreement to  resolve claims of systemic hiring discrimination. OFCCP found that the  contractor discriminated against 335 male and African-American applicants for food  service worker positions with Aramark, a federal contractor in Lubbock.
"There are no such things as 'women's work' and 'men's  work.' There is only work, and federal contractors are well aware of their  obligation to provide equal opportunities to all employees and job applicants,"  said OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. "This settlement is a reminder that it is up  to the employee or job applicant to decide which positions to pursue, whatever  their reasons. A contractor may only evaluate whether or not an individual has  the ability to do the job."
The agreement concludes an  investigation from Aug. 16, 2008 through Aug. 16, 2010, by OFCCP that Aramark failed  to comply with Executive Order 11246, which prohibits race and sex  discrimination by federal contractors that do business with the government. Under  the agreement, Aramark will pay $165,000 in back wages, interest, and benefits  to the affected class members. The company, while not admitting liability, will  also make 53 job offers to original applicants as positions become available.  Finally, the company will review and revise its selection process and provide  better training to its hiring managers to eliminate practices that result in  gender and race stereotyping. 
Headquartered in Philadelphia, Aramark  and its subsidiaries received more than $36 million in federal contracts during  the course of the OFCCP investigation, to provide its services and products to  multiple federal departments and agencies including the Department of the Army,  Department of the Air Force, Department of the Navy, Department of Veterans  Affairs and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. 
In addition to Executive Order  11246, OFCCP enforces Section  503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam  Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974. As  amended, these three laws make it illegal for contractors and subcontractors  doing business with the federal government to discriminate in employment on the  basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity,  national origin, disability or status as a protected veteran. For more  information, please call OFCCP's toll-free helpline at 800-397-6251 or visit http://www.dol.gov/ofccp/.
OFCCP recently launched the Class Member Locator (CML). The purpose of  the CML is to identify applicants and/or workers who have been impacted by  OFCCP's compliance evaluations and complaint investigations and who may be  entitled to a portion of monetary relief and/or consideration for job placement.  If you think you may be a class member who applied between 2008 and 2010, the  period of the investigation, please visit our website at: http://www.dol.gov/ofccp/CML/index.htm, where you can also find information about other recent OFCCP  settlements.

We love to help!Should I form my business as an LLC?Despite being a relatively new option, the limited liability company (LLC) is now one of the most popular business structures among smaller organizations. While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the regulations imposed on other types of companies, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). This means that the personal assets of an LLC's ownership cannot be collected to fulfill the debts of the business. What is involved in forming an LLC?All states require potential LLC owners to file a substantial set of documents, typically called the Articles of Organization, in order to establish their business. We can take care of this process for you, saving you time, effort, and allowing you to focus on developing your business – not filing paperwork. How should I name my LLC?The name you choose for your LLC is an important decision, as it will be how you represent yourself to potential associates and clients. With that in mind, it is advisable that you take some time to craft a name that you will be proud to have representing you and your business.Your name must be unique, and not deceptively similar, to any other trademarked name or business. It is also required that your name not be used to intentionally misrepresent the products or services you offer. For LLCs, nearly all states will also require you to add a signifier of your limited liability status, such as "LLC" or "L.L.C." to the end of your company's name. You may be able to operate under a name other than your formal LLC name by applying for and using a dba. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form an LLC?There is no minimum requirement as to the number of owners (also referred to as members) that an LLC must have. At the federal level, single-member LLCs qualify for pass-through taxation, however this is not always true at the state level.

Most large companies are formed under this structure as it offers the most tax related options for business owners. It provides the greatest level of separation between the company and its owners, and allows the company to raise capital through the issuance of publicly traded stock.

The most important of these differences is that S Corps are eligible for special pass through taxation status with the IRS.

Why Incorporate | Why You Should Incorporate Your Business | Swyft Filings Home   Starting Your Business  Why Incorporate Your Business? About Us Pricing Overview Our 5 Step Process Why Incorporate General FAQs Our GuaranteeThe Benefits of IncorporatingIncorporating your business offers a unique mix of benefits, many of which are unavailable to informal business structures such as sole proprietorships and general partnerships. If you are looking for tax flexibility, limited liability, and the option to raise capital, incorporation may be the best path for you. The following are four of the major benefits of incorporation:Increased CredibilityBeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law. By simply adding “Inc” or “LLC” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking for.Tax Benefits Corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses. These write-offs can be substantial since insurance, travel, and entertainment are deductions. Corporation owners are also free from paying certain self-employment taxes, which informal business owners must pay.Asset ProtectionIn the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts, the owners are given limited liability status. This means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts. In the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation, the owners’ personal assets are protected.Perpetual lifespan If your business is incorporated, it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership. The transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers. Informal business structures are not perpetual entities, so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell, the business typically ceases to exist in its current form. Being a perpetual entity makes it easier for incorporated businesses to get bank loans and to attract investors.

Form an LLC in Texas.

How to Form a Texas LLC in 3 Simple Steps
Are you looking for the freedom that comes with owning your own company? An LLC is a popular choice for many
new Texas business owners. In the Lone Star State, business owners can take advantage of several tax
benefits, strong asset protection and flexible profit choices—in a state with one of the fastest growing
economies. Here’s how to start your LLC in Texas.


Step One: Choosing Your Texas LLC’s Name
The first step in forming a new LLC in Texas is to create a name. The name you choose for your Texas LLC has to
be different from other Texas business or LLC names. Here are a couple of laws unique to Texas that will impact
naming your LLC:

What you can’t do: The name can’t contain words or phrases that could give the impression that
the LLC has been organized for some purpose other than that specified in its articles, or one that’s not allowed
by state law.
What you must do: The LLC name must end in one of the following terms or its abbreviations:
“Limited Liability Company;” “LLC” or “L.L.C.;” “Limited Company;” “LC” or “L.C.”
Step Two: Creating and Filing Your Articles of Organization

Once you have a name, Texas law states that you must write up and file articles of organization for your new
LLC. The articles of organization must list:


The LLC’s name and business purpose.
The name and address of your LLC’s registered agent (see below for specific requirements for Texas
registered agents.

How long it’s planned to last (usually perpetual unless otherwise specified).
The name and addresses of the organizer(s) and their signature(s).
Whether the LLC will be managed by a manager or managers.
The name and address of each manager or initial member.
The signature of a manager, organizer, member, trustee, or fiduciary, and the signer’s position.
Any other relevant information.

Registered Agents in Texas
Texas LLCs must each have a registered agent in Texas — someone designated to receive official
correspondence from state administrative or legal agencies. A registered agent for an LLC in Texas can
be an individual resident, a Texas LLC or corporation, or an out-of-state (“foreign”) corporation or LLC
with an office in Texas. The LLC must keep a business office at the same address as its registered
office, and it must be a street address, not just a post office box or answering service.
If you need a registered agent in Texas, Incfile can provide that service.


Your LLC is “organized” when an original and one copy of the articles of organization are given to the Texas
Secretary of State’s office along with the filing fee, and their office confirms that they comply with state
requirements. Incfile will
submit these forms for you.
The Secretary of State endorses both copies, keeps the original, and returns the signed copy. The articles of
organization are effective as of the date and time they are filed unless a later date and time are
specified.
Step 3: Writing Your Operating Agreement
After you’ve filed your articles of incorporation, your LLC needs an operating agreement. This isn’t required by
state law, but it’s a critical internal document that officially explains how the LLC will operate. It
lists:

The members (see below for how membership works in a Texas LLC).
How much they have invested.
How profits are divided.
How much weight each member has when votes are taken.
It may also list standards for meetings (how much notice, what constitutes a quorum, rules for voting, etc.)
and so on, but is not required to do so.


A typical operating agreement also includes requirements mandated by the state of Texas, and can be amended or
repealed as specified by the agreement or applicable law.
How Membership Works in a Texas LLC
Texas LLCs must have at least one member, and each member must be a natural person (as opposed to a corporate entity). To become a member, an individual usually has to make a contribution, pay money, or transfer property to the LLC, or else assume an obligation to do so or render some kind of service.
A member can resign from an LLC, but only in the way specified in the articles of organization or operating agreement. These documents also usually specify a minimum period of time a member can be a member before being allowed to resign. LLCs have the option of penalizing a resigning member for damages suffered by the LLC due to his resignation.
Ongoing Requirements for LLCs in Texas - Including Taxes
Texas LLCs are required to file an annual report with the Texas Secretary of State including the following:

LLC name and the state where the LLC was organized (if not Texas).
Address of the registered office and the name of the registered agent.
Address of the principal LLC office.
Names and business addresses of the LLC’s managers.

The Texas Franchise Tax filing requirements state that you must file an annual Franchise Tax Report, and an Information Report. You must file additional forms if you take any credits on your report, file as a tiered partnership, or file as a combined group.
When you form your LLC with Incfile, we’ll send reminder emails about Texas’ ongoing requirements as the due dates approach.
How are LLC taxes handled in Texas? 
An LLC has some tax advantages when compared to a corporation, including the availability of more deductions. However, there is no requirement for an LLC to be a separate tax entity like a corporation. Instead, an LLC can be a “pass-through entity” when it comes to taxes, so that the LLC owner or owners report business losses or profits on their personal tax returns, in the same way that a partnership would.
The IRS treats single-member LLCs as sole proprietorships for tax purposes unless you choose for your LLC to be taxed as a corporation. This means the LLC itself does not pay taxes and does not have to file a tax return. The IRS treats multi-owned LLCs as partnerships for tax purposes, unless you choose for your LLC to be taxed as a corporation. This means that LLC owners each pay taxes on their lawful share of the profits on their personal income tax returns, not the LLC itself.
When starting a new LLC in Texas, you may need to obtain a federal tax identification or employment identification number (EIN). In most cases, you won’t need a separate EIN for your LLC if you are the sole owner and the LLC has no employees. However, if you are not the sole owner of the LLC, or if the LLC has employees, the LLC will need a separate EIN to open a bank account and to meet tax filing requirements.
Dissolution of an LLC in Texas
A Texas LLC is dissolved when any one of the following events occurs:

Event(s) specified in the articles of organization or operating agreement
There is an agreement to dissolve by the number or percentage of members specified in the operating
agreement

An event that makes it illegal for the LLC to continue to operate
When a member leaves the LLC, unless the remaining members agree to continue the LLC within 90 days, or the
company continues under specifications set out in the
operating agreement
