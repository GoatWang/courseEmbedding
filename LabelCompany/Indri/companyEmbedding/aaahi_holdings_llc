President’s Message | ASAHI GROUP HOLDINGS






























President’s Message








ESG Initiatives in the Medium-Term Management Policy
The Medium-Term Management  Policy implemented by the Asahi Group entered its second year in 2017.
This Medium-Term Management  Policy cites enhancing the ESG (Environmental, Social  and Governance) initiatives as one of the three key priorities. Through these initiatives, we  are aiming to promote CSV (Creating Shared Value) leveraging its strengths  while upgrading intangible capital in the form  of natural and social capital and human  resources.
 Engaging in ESG initiatives from the Viewpoints of Investors and Customers
The Asahi Group considers optimally  balanced coordination between its holding company Asahi Group Holdings, Ltd. and operating companies in the fields of alcoholic  beverages, soft drinks and foods to be essential  in its engagement in ESG initiatives.
While the satisfaction of stakeholders  involved in the Asahi Group needs to be pursued in ESG initiatives, the related  stakeholders differ between its holding company and operating companies. The  holding company engages in activities aimed to improve corporate value focusing  on investors etc., whereas the operating companies engage in business  activities while building close relationships with business partners and  customers.
For the Asahi Group overall to improve  corporate value, it is vital to fuse the two viewpoints of its holding company  and operating companies. This would also produce significant results for many  stakeholders of the Asahi Group.
Aiming for CSV in ways unique to Asahi
We are also aiming to realize “CSV in ways  unique to Asahi” in order to strengthen our ESG initiatives. Asahi Group  businesses are full of various resources. By identifying these from the  viewpoint of contributing to society in some way and then putting these into  our businesses, we believe that we could create “CSV in ways unique to Asahi.”
One example of this is using the yeast  leftover from manufacturing beer in developing agricultural materials. We were  able to prove that when trees that have undergone special processing of the  cell wall of yeast that has been fermented are planted, immune strength  increases, thereby improving resistance to insects and promoting root growth.
By accelerating these uniquely Asahi  initiatives, we hope to contribute to solving social issues and further enhance corporate  value.
Akiyoshi  Koji
      President and Representative Director, COO
      Asahi Group Holdings, Ltd.

(Sundiego), Ace Express Coaches, LLC (Ace Express), All Aboard Transit Services, LLC (AATS), and All Aboard America! School Transportation, LLC (AAAST) (collectively Acquisition Carriers).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
AAC states that it is a noncarrier Delaware corporation that is wholly owned by AAAHI Intermediate Holdings LLC, which is wholly owned by AAAHI Topco Corporation, which is in turn wholly owned by AAAHI Holdings LLC. According to AAC, the majority owner of AAAHI Holdings LLC is Tensile-AAAHI Holdings LLC, and the majority holder of Tensile-AAAHI Holdings LLC is Tensile Capital Partners Master Fund LP. AAC states that Tensile Capital Partners LP owns 89.6% of Tensile Capital Partners Master Fund LP. AAC further states that AAC and the above-named entities in its ownership chain (Ownership Entities) do not possess motor carrier authority, do not have USDOT Numbers or Safety Ratings, and do not have any direct or indirect ownership interest in any interstate or intrastate passenger motor carriers.
AAC states that each of the Acquisition Carriers is a direct wholly owned subsidiary of AAAHI, and AAAHI's plurality shareholder is Celerity AHI Holdings SPV, LLC (Celerity Holdings). According to AAC, Celerity Holdings is a consortium of corporate and institutional investors along with Celerity Partners IV, LLC, a private equity firm that also acts as the managing member of Celerity Holdings. AAC states that other capital providers (including Gemini Investors V, L.P., a private equity firm) do not participate in Celerity Holdings but do hold minority interests in AAAHI directly. None of AAAHI's investors currently hold a controlling interest in any regulated bus transportation provider other than the Acquisition Carriers. According to AAC, the Acquisition Carriers exercise substantial independence in running their diverse operations.
AAC provides a description of each of the Acquisition Carriers, as summarized below:

Hotard is a Louisiana corporation that provides local and regional charter services within Louisiana and Mississippi, and to and from various points in the continental United States. It holds common carrier operating authority from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) as a motor carrier of passengers (MC-143881). Hotard operates a fleet of 240 vehicles, of which 79 are full-sized motor coaches and the remainder are mid-sized buses, minibuses, and school buses. The school buses are mainly used for employee shuttle services under contract with large employers, operating interstate between Texas and Louisiana and intrastate within Louisiana.
Industrial is a New Mexico corporation that provides local and regional charter services in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. Industrial holds common carrier operating authority from FMCSA as a motor carrier of passengers (MC-133171). Its fleet consists of 80 full-sized motor coaches and 10 minibuses.
Sundiego is a California corporation that operates a fleet of 72 full-sized motor coaches and 8 minibuses. It holds common carrier operating authority from FMCSA as a motor carrier of passengers (MC-324772). Sundiego provides local and regional charter, tour, and contract shuttles services from its base in National City, Cal., and from satellite locations in San Marcos and Anaheim, Cal.
Ace Express is a Delaware limited liability company with its principal place of business in Golden, Colo. Ace Express operates charter, contract, and casino services. It holds common carrier operating authority from FMCSA as a motor carrier of passengers (MC-908184). Ace Express provides charter services with its fleet of 57 motor coaches and 17 minibuses. Other services are provided on a contract basis for corporate and municipal clients.
AATS is a Delaware limited liability company with its principal place of business in Commerce City, Colo. It provides paratransit services under a contract with Denver Rapid Transit District (RTD). AATS operates 80 paratransit vehicles that are provided by RTD. AATS provides the drivers, maintenance of vehicles, and supervision of employees involved in the paratransit service. AATS does not conduct interstate passenger operations and thus does not hold passenger carrier operating authority from FMCSA. AATS does not possess Colorado intrastate passenger carrier authority, as its operations are exempt from the need for such authority. See Colo. Rev. Stat. 40-10.1-105(e) (2011).
AAAST is a Texas limited liability company that provides transportation for school children under contract with a number of school districts in Texas. The school districts typically provide the school buses and AAAST provides the drivers, maintenance of vehicles, and supervisions of employees. AAAST currently operates 72 buses for five school districts. AAAST does not conduct interstate passenger operations and thus does not hold passenger carrier operating authority from FMCSA. AAAST does not possess Texas intrastate passenger carrier authority, as all of the school bus operations in which AAAST participates are exempt from state regulation. See Tex. Transp. Code Ann. 643.002(4), (6) (West 2007).

AAC explains that under the proposed transaction, AAC would acquire the ownership interest of AAAHI, the effect of which would be to place the Acquisition Carriers under the control of AAC. AAC states that it will assume indirect 100% control of the Acquisition Carriers.
Under 49 U.S.C. 14303(b), the Board must approve and authorize a transaction that it finds consistent with the public interest, taking into consideration at least: (1) The effect of the proposed transaction on the adequacy of transportation to the public; (2) the total fixed charges that result; and (3) the interest of affected carrier employees. AAC has submitted the information required by 49 CFR 1182.2, including information to demonstrate that the proposed transaction is consistent with the public interest under 49 U.S.C. 14303(b) and a statement that the gross operating revenues of AAC and its motor carrier affiliated companies exceeded $2 million for the preceding 12-month period. See 49 U.S.C. 14303(g).[1] 

AAC asserts that this acquisition is in the public interest. AAC states that services currently provided by the Acquisition Carriers would continue to be provided under the same names currently used to provide such services. AAC further explains that it anticipates that services to the public would be improved, because the Acquisition Carriers would continue to operate, but in the future they would operate as part of the AAC corporate family. Under this new ownership, AAC states that it intends to use its business and financial management skills, as well as its capital, to increase the efficiencies and enhance the viability of the Acquisition Carriers, thereby ensuring the continued availability of adequate passenger transportation service for the public.
AAC states that there are no fixed charges associated with the proposed transaction or the proposed acquisition of control. In addition, according to AAC, the proposed transaction would have no material impact on employees or labor conditions, as AAC intends to continue the existing operations of the Acquisition Carriers and does not Start Printed Page 75183anticipate a measurable reduction in force or changes in compensation levels or benefits.
AAC also claims that neither competition nor the public interest would be adversely affected, as the proposed transaction involves merely a transfer of one holding company to another holding company. AAC states that, because it does not currently have any ownership interest in any passenger motor carrier, there would be no net gain in market power with respect to the Acquisition Carriers under the proposed transaction. Furthermore, AAC states that the bus operations of the Acquisition Carriers are geographically dispersed and there is little or no overlap in service areas or in customer base. Thus, AAC states that the impact of the proposed transaction on the regulated motor carrier industry would be minimal and that neither competition nor the public interest would be adversely affected.

A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
