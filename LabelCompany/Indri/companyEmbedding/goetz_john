information? Does the lawyer seem interested in solving your problem?

the lawyer worked on other cases similar to yours? 
Cost - How are the lawyer's fees structured - hourly or flat
fee? Can the lawyer estimate the cost of your case? 
City - Is the lawyer's office conveniently located?

Paralegal  Tei Kano
Legal Secretary  Peggy Larkin


I like to help people who deserve help. I also like to use my skills as a lawyer to fight for what is right for my clients. For these reasons, I find it very gratifying to represent individuals and families who have suffered injuries and deaths through no fault of their own and will not receive fair treatment in the legal process unless they have a good attorney on their side.
After more than 30 years of representing hundreds of injury victims in Minnesota and neighboring states, I understand the legal and medical issues that are involved in a wide variety of cases: medical malpractice, motor vehicle collisions, defective products, and many others. Because of the success that I and my firm have had over the years, we are respected by the lawyers and insurance companies who oppose us in these cases. We can often obtain successful settlements, without trial, that attorneys with less experience and reputation would not be able to obtain.
To me one of the greatest satisfactions of being a lawyer is the appreciation of someone I was able to help at a difficult time in their life. Over the years I have been grateful to receive letters from clients with comments such as this one, from a young mother whose husband was electrocuted by an unprotected power company transformer.
"Thank you for working so hard and unselfishly to secure a future for Paige and I. It is easy to see why you are so successful. It is clear to me that you are about a lot more than business. Behind all the huge folders and legal wangling is a man with a strong sense of value and character."
My background is as follows. I was born and raised in Minneapolis and have lived there all of my life. I attended the University of Minnesota for both my undergraduate bachelor of arts (suma cum laude) and my law degree (magna cum laude and editor of the Minnesota Law Review). I teamed up with Jim Schwebel in 1979. I am certified as a civil trial specialist by the Minnesota State Bar Association. I have been recognized in the book “Best Lawyers in America” by Woodward and White from 1994 to the present and as a Super Lawyer by Minnesota Law & Politics from 2003 to the present.

Principal

Background






A trial lawyer who specializes in intellectual property litigation, Mr. Goetz’s patent practice spans an unusually wide array of technical areas, including pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, wireless communications, computer software, website design, online e-commerce, flash memory, graphics controllers, LED displays, chemicals, micro-electro-mechanical systems, navigation systems, and hybrid-electric vehicles. Mr. Goetz’s litigation expertise also includes trademark, trade dress, and trade secret cases involving retail consumer products.
Mr. Goetz has handled dozens of cases in courts nationwide (e.g., Texas, New York, California, Delaware, Virginia, and Kansas) and at the International Trade Commission (ITC), including as lead trial counsel. His pretrial experience includes preliminary injunction hearings, over 70 depositions, motion practice, and Markman hearings. His substantial trial experience includes opening statements, direct examinations, cross-examinations, and closing arguments. Whether starting a case from the beginning or taking over a case from other trial counsel, Mr. Goetz focuses the efforts of his team on actions designed to win the case at trial and through appeal, while always looking for ways to short circuit the case either by winning dispositive motions or by obtaining an early favorable settlement. Representing both plaintiffs and defendants, Mr. Goetz has invalidated patents in the Eastern District of Texas, obtained exclusion orders for patent holders at the ITC, navigated clients through the intricate Hatch-Waxman legal landscape, vigorously protected trade secrets, and defeated over-zealous allegations of trade dress. Whatever the posture, jurisdiction, or legal issue, Mr. Goetz takes pride in shepherding a case—through trial if necessary—by applying the planning, execution, discipline, and leadership skills he honed as an officer in the United States Army.
While Mr. Goetz likes to fight and win, he recognizes that his clients are in the business of business—not litigation. That’s why in addition to his trial practice, Mr. Goetz routinely advises his clients, both established and early-stage companies, on developing creative and successful strategies that implement, protect, enforce, and leverage their intellectual property assets. Mr. Goetz also regularly counsels his clients on how to identify marketplace opportunities, create valuable IP, and conduct the due diligence necessary to assess risks and move the business forward with confidence.
Mr. Goetz was born and raised in Kansas City. After attending the University of Notre Dame on a ROTC scholarship and graduating with a degree in mechanical engineering, Mr. Goetz served for four years in the United States Army’s Third Infantry Division (Fort Stewart, Georgia), where he earned the rank of Captain. After his military service, Mr. Goetz worked full-time as a Patent Examiner with the United States Patent and Trademark Office while attending law school in the evenings at the George Washington University Law School. Also while in law school, Mr. Goetz served as a judicial intern for the Honorable Randall R. Rader of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
Mr. Goetz lives with his wife and four children in New Canaan, Connecticut.
