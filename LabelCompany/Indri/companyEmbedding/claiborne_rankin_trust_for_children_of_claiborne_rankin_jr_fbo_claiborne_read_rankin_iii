Stockholder acknowledges that the Corporation and each Participating Stockholder is a beneficiary of this Amendment.  5. Amendment of
Stockholders Agreement. The Stockholders Agreement is hereby amended to add the New Participating Stockholder as a Participating Stockholder. 
6. Signature of Amendment by Trusts, Minors and Incompetents. 
(a) In order for a trust exclusively (as defined in Section 1.11 of the Stockholders Agreement) for the benefit of a
Family Member or Members to be considered a Participating Stockholder:  (i) the trustee and all adult beneficiaries of such
trusts having a current trust interest (as well as all Charitable Organization beneficiaries having a current trust interest) shall have previously signed the Stockholders Agreement or shall sign this Amendment as a Participating Stockholder;
 (ii) the trustee and a parent or legal guardian, for trusts with minor beneficiaries having a current trust interest,
shall sign this Amendment on behalf of any such minor beneficiaries; or 


(iii) the trustee and legal guardian, if any, for trusts with incompetent
beneficiaries having a current trust interest, shall sign this Amendment on behalf of any such incompetent beneficiaries. 
(b) If, at any time, any trust shall have an adult beneficiary (and such beneficiary is not incompetent) having a current trust
interest or an ascertainable Charitable Organization beneficiary having a current trust interest and if such beneficiary has not previously signed the Stockholders Agreement, then if such beneficiary shall fail or be unable to sign this
Amendment for a period of 30 calendar days following notification to such beneficiary of the terms of this Amendment and the Stockholders Agreement by the Depository and following signature of this Amendment by the trustee, the trust shall
thereupon cease to be a Participating Stockholder and Section 3.2 of the Stockholders Agreement shall then apply as if the shares of Class B Common Stock held by the trust were then to be converted. The donor of a trust that is revocable
by the donor alone, during the lifetime of such donor, shall be considered the only beneficiary thereof so long as such trust is so revocable. 
(c) In the case of Class B Common Stock held by a custodian under the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (or the practical
equivalent thereof) for the benefit of a minor Family Member, the custodian shall sign this Amendment on behalf of such minor if such minor is to be considered a Participating Stockholder. 
(d) In the case of Class B Common Stock held in the name of a minor Family Member, a parent or legal guardian of such minor
shall sign this Amendment on behalf of such minor if such minor is to be considered a Participating Stockholder.  (e) In
the case of Class B Common Stock held in the name of an incompetent Family Member, the legal guardian of such incompetent shall sign this Amendment on behalf of such incompetent if such incompetent is to be considered a Participating Stockholder.
 (f) When a minor described in Section 6(c) or (d) reaches the age of majority, or an incompetent described in
Section 6(e) is no longer impaired by such disability and has reached the age of majority, such Family Member shall execute and deliver an Amendment which has been executed and delivered by the Participating Stockholders (or their
attorney-in-fact), the Corporation and the Depository. If such Family Member shall fail or be unable to sign such Amendment for a period of 30 calendar days following notification to such Family Member of the terms of the Stockholders
Agreement by the Depository, such Family Member shall thereupon cease to be a Participating Stockholder and Section 3.2 of the Stockholders Agreement shall then apply as if the shares of Class B Common Stock were then to be converted.
 7. Power of Attorney. The undersigned New Participating Stockholder hereby constitutes and appoints Alfred M. Rankin, Jr., Dennis
W. LaBarre, Thomas C. Daniels, Charles A. Bittenbender, Suzanne Schulze Taylor and each of them, as the true and lawful attorney or attorneys-in-fact, with full power of substitution and resubstitution, for the undersigned and in the name, place and
stead of the undersigned, in any and all capacities to: 


(a) execute any and all statements under Section 13 or Section 16 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 of beneficial ownership of shares of Class B Common Stock subject to the Stockholders Agreement as amended by this Amendment, including all statements on Schedule 13D and all amendments thereto, all joint
filing agreements pursuant to Rule 13d-1(k) under such Exchange Act in connection with such statements, all initial statements of beneficial ownership on Form 3 and any and all other documents to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
and to file the same, with all exhibits thereto, and all other documents in connection therewith, with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and 
(b) execute and deliver any and all Amendments whereby a Family Member, Charitable Organization or Participating Stockholder
Organization becomes a Participating Stockholder or any other amendment to the Stockholders Agreement in accordance with Section 8 of the Stockholders Agreement, other than those amendments that (i) extend the term of the
Stockholders Agreement or (ii) amend Section 2, 3, 4 or 8 of the Stockholders Agreement, thereby granting to said attorney or attorneys-in-fact, and each of them, full power and authority to do so and to perform each and every
act and thing requisite and necessary to be done in and about the premises, as fully to all intents and purposes as the undersigned might or could do in person, hereby ratifying and confirming all that said attorney or attorneys-in-fact or any of
them, or their substitutes or resubstitutes, may lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue of this Section 7. The grant of this power of attorney shall not be affected by any disability of such undersigned New Participating Stockholder. If
applicable law requires additional or substituted language or formalities (including witnesses or acknowledgments) in order to validate the power of attorney intended to be granted by this Section 7, each New Participating Stockholder agrees to
execute and deliver such additional instruments and to take such further acts as may be necessary to validate such power of attorney.  8.
Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all of which shall constitute but one and the same instrument, without production of the others. 


IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each New Participating Stockholder, the Participating Stockholders, the
Corporation and the Depository have executed this Amendment or caused this Amendment to be executed in their respective names, all as of the date and year first above written.

terms hereof; if this Amendment is being executed on behalf of a
Participating Stockholder Organization, the person executing this
Amendment is a duly authorized representative of such Participating
Stockholder Organization with full right, power and authority to
execute and deliver this Amendment on behalf of such Participating
Stockholder Organization and to bind such Participating Stockholder
Organization to the terms hereof; the execution, delivery and
performance of this Amendment by such New Participating Stockholder
will not constitute a violation of, conflict with or result in a
default under (i) any contract, understanding or arrangement to
which such New Participating Stockholder is a party or by which
such New Participating Stockholder is bound or require the consent
of any other person or any party pursuant thereto; (ii) any

6.    
Signature of Amendment by Trusts, Minors and Incompetents
.
(a)    In
order for a trust exclusively for the benefit of a Family Member or
Members (as defined in Section 1.11 of the Stockholders’
Agreement) to be considered a Participating Stockholder:
(i)    the
trustee and all adult beneficiaries of such trusts having a current
trust interest (as well as all Charitable Organization
beneficiaries having a current trust interest) shall have
previously signed the Stockholders’ Agreement or shall sign
this Amendment as a Participating Stockholder;
(ii)    the
trustee and a parent or legal guardian, for trusts with minor
beneficiaries having a current trust interest, shall sign this
Amendment on behalf of any such minor beneficiaries; or
(iii)    the
trustee and legal guardian, if any, for trusts with incompetent
beneficiaries having a current trust interest, shall sign this
Amendment on behalf of any such incompetent
beneficiaries.
(b)    If,
at any time, any trust shall have an adult beneficiary (and such
beneficiary is not incompetent) having a current trust interest or
an ascertainable Charitable Organization beneficiary having a
current trust interest and if such beneficiary has not previously
signed the Stockholders’ Agreement, then if such beneficiary
shall fail or be unable to sign this Amendment for a period of 30
calendar days following notification to such beneficiary of the
terms of this Amendment and the Stockholders’ Agreement by
the Depository and following signature of this Amendment by the
trustee, the trust shall thereupon cease to be a Participating
Stockholder and Section 3.2 of the Stockholders’ Agreement
shall then apply as if the shares of Class B Common Stock held by
the trust were then to be converted. The donor of a trust that is
revocable by the donor alone, during the lifetime of such donor,
shall be considered the only beneficiary thereof so long as such
trust is so revocable.
(c)    In
the case of Class B Common Stock held by a custodian under the
Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (or the practical equivalent
thereof) for the benefit of a minor Family Member, the custodian
shall sign this Amendment on behalf of such minor if such minor is
to be considered a Participating Stockholder.
(d)    In
the case of Class B Common Stock held in the name of a minor Family
Member, a parent or legal guardian of such minor shall sign this
Amendment on behalf of such minor if such minor is to be considered
a Participating Stockholder.

 



 






 



 

(e)    In
the case of Class B Common Stock held in the name of an incompetent
Family Member, the legal guardian of such incompetent shall sign
this Amendment on behalf of such incompetent if such incompetent is
to be considered a Participating Stockholder.
(f)    When
a minor described in Section 6(c) or (d) reaches the age of
majority, or an incompetent described in Section 6(e) is no longer
impaired by such disability and has reached the age of majority,
such Family Member shall execute and deliver an Amendment which has
been executed and delivered by the Participating Stockholders (or
their attorney-in-fact), the Corporation and the Depository. If
such Family Member shall fail or be unable to sign such Amendment
for a period of 30 calendar days following notification to such
Family Member of the terms of the Stockholders’ Agreement by
the Depository, such Family Member shall thereupon cease to be a
Participating Stockholder and Section 3.2 of the
Stockholders’ Agreement shall then apply as if the shares of
Class B Common Stock were then to be converted.
7.    
Power of Attorney . The undersigned New Participating
Stockholder hereby constitutes and appoints Alfred M. Rankin, Jr.,
Dennis W. LaBarre, John D. Neumann, Jesse L. Adkins and Kimberly J.
Pustulka, and each of them, as the true and lawful attorney or
attorneys-in-fact, with full power of substitution and
resubstitution, for the undersigned and in the name, place and
stead of the undersigned, in any and all capacities to:
(a)    execute
any and all statements under Section 13 or Section 16 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 of beneficial ownership of shares
of Class B Common Stock subject to the Stockholders’
Agreement as amended by this Amendment, including all statements on
Schedule 13D and all amendments thereto, all joint filing
agreements pursuant to Rule 13d-1(k) under such Exchange Act in
connection with such statements, all initial statements of
beneficial ownership on Form 3 and any and all other documents to
be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and to file
the same, with all exhibits thereto, and all other documents in
connection therewith, with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
and
(b)    execute
and deliver any and all Amendments whereby a Family Member,
Charitable Organization or Participating Stockholder Organization
becomes a Participating Stockholder or any other amendment to the
Stockholders’ Agreement in accordance with Section 8 of the
Stockholders’ Agreement, other than those amendments that (i)
extend the term of the Stockholders’ Agreement or (ii) amend
Section 2, 3, 4 or 8 of the Stockholders’ Agreement, thereby
granting to said attorney or attorneys-in-fact, and each of them,
full power and authority to do so and to perform each and every act
and thing requisite and necessary to be done in and about the
premises, as fully to all intents and purposes as the undersigned
might or could do in person, hereby ratifying and confirming all
that said attorney or attorneys-in-fact or any of them, or their
substitutes or resubstitutes, may lawfully do or cause to be done
by virtue of this Section 7. The grant of this power of attorney
shall not be affected by any disability of such undersigned New
Participating Stockholder. If applicable law requires additional or
substituted language or formalities (including witnesses or
acknowledgments) in order to validate the power of attorney
intended to be granted by this Section 7, each New Participating
Stockholder agrees to execute and deliver such additional
instruments and to take such further acts as may be necessary to
validate such power of attorney.
8.    
Counterparts . This Amendment may be executed in multiple
counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all of which
shall constitute but one and the same instrument, without
production of the others.
