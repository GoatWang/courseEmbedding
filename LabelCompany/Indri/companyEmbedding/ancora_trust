Company History HomeAbout usCompany History 





Ancora, registered in Greece under Law 89/1967, was founded in 1986.
The first vessel that was managed was a handy sized bulk carrier. Over the next 10 years a variety and number of vessels were managed ranging in size from Handies through to Panamaxes.
In 1994, recognising the importance of having access to a steady supply of quality crew, Medbulk Maritime Management was established. Located in the Philippines, it is not only a source of quality crew but also is a training centre for new recruits. Today the majority of Ancora’s crews, including deck and engine officers come from Medbulk.
In 1996, Ancora decided to expand its activities to include the management of tanker vessels focussing on product carriers. Increasingly, an expertise in tankers, particularly product tankers operating in the Mediterranean and Black Sea regions, was developed and since 1998 Ancora has only managed tankers.
In 1999 Ancora relocated from Piraeus to purpose built offices in Glyfada.
In 2003 Ancora was entrusted with the commencement of a new building programme of a number  of specialised oil / chemical / product tankers. All in all, a total of 9 vessels from 2 different yards were contracted and successfully delivered, 2 of which are still under management.
Relationships have been developed with major end users, which include oil majors, state owned entities and major oil traders who employ Ancora managed vessels on a mixture of long period charters through to single voyages.
Ancora, and the vessels that it manages, are regularly vetted and approved by oil majors etc.
Today, Ancora with its 50 shore based staff, is recognised as an established and quality international manager offering both technical and commercial services for chemical / product carriers and crude oil tankers.

Ancora Investment trust, Inc.
Ancora Investment Trust Inc was founded in 1986 and was incorporated in Liberia. Today, the company is an established international manager of seaborne transportation services for refined petroleum products. Ancora's strategy is to maintain its commitment to the Product Carrier market. Through the specialization it has achieved over the years in this sector, Ancora will continue to provide the best possible service to its clients fully covering their transportation needs.





	Ancora Investment Trust Inc was founded in 1986 and was incorporated in Liberia. The company has been registered in Greece under Law 89/1967.

	 

	Ancora took management of its first vessel in November 1986, a handy sized bulk carrier. During the next 10 years 11 more handy and Panamax sized bulk carriers were brought under the management of Ancora and operated successfully. All the vessels managed by Ancora belong to separate shipowing companies.

	 

	In 1996, Ancora decided to change its strategy and move into the tanker market focusing its activities only in the management of vessels which transport petroleum products.

	 



	 

	Today, the company is an established international manager of seaborne transportation services for refined petroleum products with a fleet of 

	 

	a) Suez max

	b) double-hull MR product tankers

	c) double-hull handy-size product tankers

	d) double-hull 8.000dwt Product/Chemical IMO III tanker

	From its Glyfada operating headquarters, Ancora manages vessels which offer both short and long-term charters to customers which include major oil companies, oil traders and shippers. The Ancora product carriers fleet transports refined petroleum products such as gasoline, fuel oil, diesel oil and naphtha.

	 

	Management believes that, in recent years, Ancora has established a reputation in the international shipping community for the highest standards of safety, performance and reliability, all of which are critical factors for customers that demand dependable vessels.

	 

	Ancora has many long established customer relationships in the tanker market and believes it is well regarded within the international shipping community. Since 1996, vessels managed by Ancora have been chartered to several major oil companies and traders. Customer relationships are of paramount importance. Ancora believes that it has significant competitive advantages in the Handysize tanker market as a result of the quality and type of vessels it manages and close customer relationship.

	 

	Headquarters

	Ancora is headquartered at an owned, modern building in Glyfada, denoting its long-term commitment in its shipping business.
