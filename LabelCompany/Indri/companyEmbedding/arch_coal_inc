Improving Education
Protecting Resources
Providing Jobs

















Ports and Terminals
Increased seaborne coal demand, primarily from Asia, is creating shifts in traditional supply patterns. With the United States holding 30% of the world’s proven coal reserves, U.S. port capacity is expanding to unlock new business overseas.



Arch is expanding international coal sales with dedicated seaborne port capacity on the East, West and Gulf Coasts.







Seaborne Trade
Demand from developing Asia is putting immense pressure on global energy supplies at an unprecedented pace. Nearly 3 billion people live in developing nations with rapidly expanding economies. These nations are increasingly turning to the seaborne markets to supplement their growing energy needs. We expect U.S. coal to factor heavily in this equation.



Arch supplies coal to power producers, steel makers, manufacturing plants and other end users on five continents.







Exporters and Importers
Coal is truly a global industry. It is mined commercially in over 50 countries and used in over 70 countries. Extensive transportation systems exist to move coal to market, whether the final destination is within a country’s borders or across the globe. Two large developing nations, China and India, are driving much of the change in global coal supply flow patterns, with the potential to nearly double coal imports by 2015.



Our international sales teams in Asia-Pacific and Europe are helping grow Arch’s U.S. coal exports.







Improving Education
At Arch Coal we believe the most powerful resources for creating a better world exist in classrooms and communities. That’s why we dig deep into education-related projects with our hearts and hands. Whether we’re mentoring students in the classroom, honoring teachers on stage or hosting school tours at our mines, we’re passionate about doing our part to support quality education in our communities.



We honor 22 Arch Coal Teacher Achievement Award recipients with a total of $77,000 each year.







Protecting Resources
Arch Coal’s commitment to employee safety and environmental care is an essential and ongoing part of our business. First and foremost, we protect our human resources through education and safe work practices. And as a responsible natural resource company, we mine in a careful manner to protect our neighbors and the indigenous fauna and flora. On a global scale, the coal-based energy industry is investing billions to advance clean coal technologies, through university programs, public-private partnerships and direct investment.



Arch leads the U.S. coal industry in safety performance and environmental compliance among large, diversified producers.







Providing Jobs
The mining sector provides one of the largest job pools in the United States. Specific to coal mining, more than 500,000 American jobs rely on the U.S. coal industry either directly or indirectly. And the U.S. coal industry contributes more than $60 billion to the country’s gross domestic product each year.



Arch has more than 5,000 U.S.-based employees in nine states, plus our international marketing and sales teams in Europe and Asia.







Efficient Energy
Energy is a basic human need. Modern life is unimaginable without electricity. Access to electricity increases life expectancy, lifts people out of poverty and drives industrialization. Advances in technology and power plant efficiency are making coal use increasingly clean. Case in point, 21st century coal-fueled plants produce only 10% of the air emissions as compared to original 1970s power plants, according to NETL. More than 250 gigawatts of new coal-fueled plant capacity are under construction around the world.



As the fuel source for 7% of America’s electricity, Arch Coal is proud to play a major role in powering life.







Inherent Advantages
Coal is the backbone of many economies because it is the most affordable and abundant fossil fuel. Coal is also well-established and reliable – from stable pricing to consistent availability to safe transportation and storage.



Arch is the most diversified American coal company, providing customers with maximum sourcing flexibility.







Proven Resource
With nearly 30% of the globe’s proven and probable reserves, the United States has the most plentiful coal deposits in the world. Plentiful coal supplies translate into lower fuel prices for power generation and ultimately to lower electric bills for families and businesses. On average, Americans pay $0.11 per kilowatt-hour, whereas Japanese and Italians pay double that electricity rate.



Arch is the second largest U.S. coal reserve holder, with a coal reserve base of more than 5 billion tons.







Crude Steel
Global steel production is dependent on coal. Metallurgical grade coal is a vital ingredient in two-thirds of global steel production each year. The United States already plays a sizable and increasingly essential role in global metallurgical coal markets as the world’s second largest exporter of coking coal. Growing demand for metallurgical coal, coupled with scarcity of supply, create a premium in the marketplace for high-quality met coals.



Arch plans to significantly grow metallurgical coal volumes to capitalize on the global steel boom.







Steel Production
World crude steel production has increased 68% since 2000, and demand continues to grow robustly. The World Steel Association projects that steel consumption will climb by more than 50% by 2020. That’s where coking and PCI coals come in. The largest steel producing countries – China, Japan, India, USA and Russia – rely heavily and increasingly on metallurgical coal from the United States. Coal is vital to nearly 70% of the world’s steel production.



Arch's new Leer mine is a world-class metallurgical coal mining complex that supplies premium quality coking coal to steel makers.







Steel Use
Nations are urbanizing rapidly and building factories, railroads, power plants, bridges and office buildings in the process. This infrastructure needs steel, and lots of it. Steel use worldwide increased nearly 70% between 2000 and 2010. China increased steel use over 400% during the same 10-year time span. Because coal is a vital ingredient in the steel-making process, growth in steel demand translates to growth in metallurgical coal demand.



Arch is among the world's top 10 metallurgical coal suppliers.






















Strong. Essential. Driven.
Arch Coal (NYSE: ARCH) is a leading natural 
			resource company. We produce high-quality metallurgical and thermal 
			coal, used to manufacture steel and generate electricity. Through our 
			strong operating portfolio we are uniquely positioned to supply 
			safe, responsible and essential resources to these two distinct 
			markets.

Restructuring Information
On January 11, 2016, Arch Coal announced that it reached an 
			agreement with the majority of its senior lenders on the terms of a 
			financial restructuring that is expected to eliminate more than $4.5 
			billion in debt from Arch’s balance sheet and position the company 
			for long-term financial success. To facilitate this financial 
			restructuring, Arch elected to file for reorganization under Chapter 
			11 of the Bankruptcy Code.
			Our mining operations and customer shipments will continue in the ordinary course throughout this 
			court-supervised process.
			Arch continues to be one of the strongest competitors in the industry – supported by our large-scale 
			and low-cost operations. The court-supervised process will allow us 
			to continue to operate in the ordinary course. We fully expect to 
			continue to pay our employees, suppliers and vendors and to deliver 
			exceptional customer service, while we strengthen our position as a 
			leading miner and marketer of coal.
			Additional information, including press releases, letters, and frequently asked questions 
			(FAQs) for employees, retirees, suppliers, lessors and investors are

Key Facts[edit]

Produces low-sulfur thermal coal for power generation and metallurgical coal for steelmaking[5]
Supplies coal to customers on five continents[2]
Holds the most diversified position among U.S. coal producers with operations in every major domestic coal basin [2]
Controls more than 5 billion tons of thermal coal reserves and more than 400 million tons of metallurgical coal reserves[2]
Established the Arch Coal Foundation in 2005, which emphasizes education and teaching excellence in communities with scholarships, grants and the signature Teacher Achievement Award[4][6]
Earns national awards for responsible practices, including five U.S. Department of Interior Good Neighbor awards and six MSHA Sentinels of Safety awards[7][8]

History[edit]
Arch Coal was formed in July 1997 through the merger of publicly traded Ashland Coal, Inc. and privately held Arch Mineral Corporation. Arch Mineral had its origins in 1969, when it was formed as a partnership between Ashland Oil (now Ashland Inc.) and the H.L.Hunt family of Dallas, Texas; Ashland Coal was formed in 1975 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Ashland Oil. With the completion of the merger, Arch became the leading producer of low-sulfur coal in the eastern United States.[9]
In June 1998, Arch Coal expanded into the western United States with the acquisition of the coal assets of Atlantic Richfield. Included in this transaction were the Black Thunder Coal Mine and Coal Creek mines in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming; the West Elk longwall mine in Gunnison County, Colorado; and a 65% interest in Canyon Fuel Company, which operates three longwall mines in Utah.[10]
In October 1998, Arch added to its Powder River Basin reserves when it was the winning bidder on Thundercloud, a 412-million-ton federal reserve tract adjacent to the Black Thunder mine.[11]
In July 2004, Arch Coal solidified its position as a leading producer of high-Btu, low-sulfur western bituminous coal with the acquisition of the remaining 35% interest in Canyon Fuel Company and its 161-million-ton reserves.[12]
In August 2004, Arch again expanded its position in the Powder River Basin with the acquisition of Triton's North Rochelle mine adjacent to Arch's existing Black Thunder operation. By integrating the North Rochelle mine with Black Thunder, Arch created the premier mine in the nation's fastest growing coal supply region.[13]
In September 2004, Arch again added to its Powder River Basin reserves when it was the winning bidder on Little Thunder, a 719-million-ton federal reserve tract adjacent to the Black Thunder Coal Mine.[14]
In December 2005, Arch Coal sold select eastern assets to Magnum Coal Company to unlock the value of some of its Central Appalachian holdings, sharpened its focus in that region, and strengthened its balance sheet in preparation for future growth.[15]
In August 2006, Arch acquired a one-third interest in Knight Hawk Coal, a growing coal producer in the Illinois Basin.[16]
In October 2009, Arch acquired Rio Tinto's Jacobs Ranch mine and blended it with Black Thunder Coal Mine in the southern Powder River Basin of Wyoming, creating the single largest coal mining complex in the world.[17]
In November 2009, Arch acquired the rights to mine 731 million tons of Otter Creek coal reserves in the northern Powder River Basin of Montana.[18]
On June 15, 2011, Arch acquired International Coal Group (ICG) and cemented its place as a top five global coal supplier and a top 10 metallurgical coal producer and marketer.[19]
In December 2011, Arch Coal became the successful bidder for a 222 million ton federal coal lease known as the South Hilight tract in the southern Powder River Basin.[20]
In June 2013, Arch Coal announced the planned sale of its Canyon Fuel Company LLC subsidiary to Bowie Resources, LLC. Canyon Fuel includes the Sufco, Skyline and Dugout Canyon mines in Utah.[21][22]
In January 2016, Arch Coal filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[23] This was stated to be a part of a restructuring aiming at reducing debt by $4.5 billion.[24][25]
On October 5, 2016, Arch Coal emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company won a court approval allowing them to erase almost $5 billion in debt and left bankruptcy with $300 million in cash. Arch Coal resumed trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker ARCH. Unsecured creditors and bondholders will receive $30 million in cash along with 6% of the new shares according to court agreements. Bondholders will also have the option to receive either warrants to buy up to 12% of the company's new stock or an additional $25 million cash.[26]
Politics[edit]
Arch Coal PAC is named, along with other major coal producers, as a donor to the 2004 election campaign in West Virginia. 2004 was a record-setting year for donations made by the coal industry.[27]
Competitive status[edit]
Arch is number 564 in the 2013 Fortune 1000 list.[4] They are the second largest coal producer in the United States.[3]
Environmental impact[edit]
Mountaintop removal in Appalachia[edit]
Arch Coal practices mountaintop removal mining, which is controversial because it reduces the height of mountaintops[28]
Their West Virginia mining operations in the Appalachian Mountains were the subject of a critical documentary in 2002 on Now with Bill Moyers on PBS.[29] Arch's Dal-Tex mining operations above the town of Blair, West Virginia were the subject of a 1998 U.S. News & World Report story "Shear Madness" by Penny Loeb.[30] The story documented the impacts of mountaintop removal on communities close to the mines and their subsequent depopulation. A 1999 lawsuit brought by the West Virginia Highlands Conservancy, Bragg v. Robertson was the first successful citizen lawsuit to stop Arch's proposed mountaintop removal valley fill. The fill would have buried several miles of stream at Pigeon Roost Hollow near Blair, West Virginia.[31]
In his ruling for the plaintiffs, Judge Charles H. Haden stated that "If there is any life form that cannot acclimate to life deep in a rubble pile, it is eliminated. No effect on related environmental values is more adverse than obliteration...Under a valley fill the water quality of the stream becomes zero. Because there is no stream, there is no water quality."[32]
As of 2012, the company reported that surface mining in Appalachian mountains accounted for roughly 4 percent of its annual coal production.[2]
Colorado mining[edit]
Earthjustice, the Sierra Club, the Center for Biological Diversity and other environmental groups announced a campaign in 2015 against Arch Coal's mine project in the Sunset Roadless Area of Gunnison National Forest.[33][34]
Mine reclamation[edit]
Arch Coal used more than $1 billion in "self-bonding" to guarantee it could pay for its mine reclamation obligations under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.[35] After Arch Coal declared bankruptcy, the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality agreed to accept $75 million in place of the company’s $486 million in self-bonding liability to the state.[36]
Environmental awareness[edit]
Arch Coal’s subsidiary operations reported a water compliance rate of 99.9 percent over a 10-year period between 2002 and 2012.[37]
In 2012, Arch Coal became the first energy company to earn the Conservation Legacy Award from the National Museum of Forest Service History. The Museum of Forest Service History awarded this honor “in recognition of [Arch Coal’s] commitment to the protection of natural resources, wildlife and water quality values during mining and restoration operations”.[38]

Key Facts[edit]

Produces low-sulfur thermal coal for power generation and metallurgical coal for steelmaking[5]
Supplies coal to customers on five continents[2]
Holds the most diversified position among U.S. coal producers with operations in every major domestic coal basin [2]
Controls more than 5 billion tons of thermal coal reserves and more than 400 million tons of metallurgical coal reserves[2]
Established the Arch Coal Foundation in 2005, which emphasizes education and teaching excellence in communities with scholarships, grants and the signature Teacher Achievement Award[4][6]
Earns national awards for responsible practices, including five U.S. Department of Interior Good Neighbor awards and six MSHA Sentinels of Safety awards[7][8]

History[edit]
Arch Coal was formed in July 1997 through the merger of publicly traded Ashland Coal, Inc. and privately held Arch Mineral Corporation. Arch Mineral had its origins in 1969, when it was formed as a partnership between Ashland Oil (now Ashland Inc.) and the H.L.Hunt family of Dallas, Texas; Ashland Coal was formed in 1975 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Ashland Oil. With the completion of the merger, Arch became the leading producer of low-sulfur coal in the eastern United States.[9]
In June 1998, Arch Coal expanded into the western United States with the acquisition of the coal assets of Atlantic Richfield. Included in this transaction were the Black Thunder Coal Mine and Coal Creek mines in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming; the West Elk longwall mine in Gunnison County, Colorado; and a 65% interest in Canyon Fuel Company, which operates three longwall mines in Utah.[10]
In October 1998, Arch added to its Powder River Basin reserves when it was the winning bidder on Thundercloud, a 412-million-ton federal reserve tract adjacent to the Black Thunder mine.[11]
In July 2004, Arch Coal solidified its position as a leading producer of high-Btu, low-sulfur western bituminous coal with the acquisition of the remaining 35% interest in Canyon Fuel Company and its 161-million-ton reserves.[12]
In August 2004, Arch again expanded its position in the Powder River Basin with the acquisition of Triton's North Rochelle mine adjacent to Arch's existing Black Thunder operation. By integrating the North Rochelle mine with Black Thunder, Arch created the premier mine in the nation's fastest growing coal supply region.[13]
In September 2004, Arch again added to its Powder River Basin reserves when it was the winning bidder on Little Thunder, a 719-million-ton federal reserve tract adjacent to the Black Thunder Coal Mine.[14]
In December 2005, Arch Coal sold select eastern assets to Magnum Coal Company to unlock the value of some of its Central Appalachian holdings, sharpened its focus in that region, and strengthened its balance sheet in preparation for future growth.[15]
In August 2006, Arch acquired a one-third interest in Knight Hawk Coal, a growing coal producer in the Illinois Basin.[16]
In October 2009, Arch acquired Rio Tinto's Jacobs Ranch mine and blended it with Black Thunder Coal Mine in the southern Powder River Basin of Wyoming, creating the single largest coal mining complex in the world.[17]
In November 2009, Arch acquired the rights to mine 731 million tons of Otter Creek coal reserves in the northern Powder River Basin of Montana.[18]
On June 15, 2011, Arch acquired International Coal Group (ICG) and cemented its place as a top five global coal supplier and a top 10 metallurgical coal producer and marketer.[19]
In December 2011, Arch Coal became the successful bidder for a 222 million ton federal coal lease known as the South Hilight tract in the southern Powder River Basin.[20]
In June 2013, Arch Coal announced the planned sale of its Canyon Fuel Company LLC subsidiary to Bowie Resources, LLC. Canyon Fuel includes the Sufco, Skyline and Dugout Canyon mines in Utah.[21][22]
In January 2016, Arch Coal filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[23] This was stated to be a part of a restructuring aiming at reducing debt by $4.5 billion.[24][25]
On October 5, 2016, Arch Coal emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company won a court approval allowing them to erase almost $5 billion in debt and left bankruptcy with $300 million in cash. Arch Coal resumed trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker ARCH. Unsecured creditors and bondholders will receive $30 million in cash along with 6% of the new shares according to court agreements. Bondholders will also have the option to receive either warrants to buy up to 12% of the company's new stock or an additional $25 million cash.[26]
Politics[edit]
Arch Coal PAC is named, along with other major coal producers, as a donor to the 2004 election campaign in West Virginia. 2004 was a record-setting year for donations made by the coal industry.[27]
Competitive status[edit]
Arch is number 564 in the 2013 Fortune 1000 list.[4] They are the second largest coal producer in the United States.[3]
Environmental impact[edit]
Mountaintop removal in Appalachia[edit]
Arch Coal practices mountaintop removal mining, which is controversial because it reduces the height of mountaintops[28]
Their West Virginia mining operations in the Appalachian Mountains were the subject of a critical documentary in 2002 on Now with Bill Moyers on PBS.[29] Arch's Dal-Tex mining operations above the town of Blair, West Virginia were the subject of a 1998 U.S. News & World Report story "Shear Madness" by Penny Loeb.[30] The story documented the impacts of mountaintop removal on communities close to the mines and their subsequent depopulation. A 1999 lawsuit brought by the West Virginia Highlands Conservancy, Bragg v. Robertson was the first successful citizen lawsuit to stop Arch's proposed mountaintop removal valley fill. The fill would have buried several miles of stream at Pigeon Roost Hollow near Blair, West Virginia.[31]
In his ruling for the plaintiffs, Judge Charles H. Haden stated that "If there is any life form that cannot acclimate to life deep in a rubble pile, it is eliminated. No effect on related environmental values is more adverse than obliteration...Under a valley fill the water quality of the stream becomes zero. Because there is no stream, there is no water quality."[32]
As of 2012, the company reported that surface mining in Appalachian mountains accounted for roughly 4 percent of its annual coal production.[2]
Colorado mining[edit]
Earthjustice, the Sierra Club, the Center for Biological Diversity and other environmental groups announced a campaign in 2015 against Arch Coal's mine project in the Sunset Roadless Area of Gunnison National Forest.[33][34]
Mine reclamation[edit]
Arch Coal used more than $1 billion in "self-bonding" to guarantee it could pay for its mine reclamation obligations under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.[35] After Arch Coal declared bankruptcy, the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality agreed to accept $75 million in place of the company’s $486 million in self-bonding liability to the state.[36]
Environmental awareness[edit]
Arch Coal’s subsidiary operations reported a water compliance rate of 99.9 percent over a 10-year period between 2002 and 2012.[37]
In 2012, Arch Coal became the first energy company to earn the Conservation Legacy Award from the National Museum of Forest Service History. The Museum of Forest Service History awarded this honor “in recognition of [Arch Coal’s] commitment to the protection of natural resources, wildlife and water quality values during mining and restoration operations”.[38]

Key Facts[edit]

Produces low-sulfur thermal coal for power generation and metallurgical coal for steelmaking[5]
Supplies coal to customers on five continents[2]
Holds the most diversified position among U.S. coal producers with operations in every major domestic coal basin [2]
Controls more than 5 billion tons of thermal coal reserves and more than 400 million tons of metallurgical coal reserves[2]
Established the Arch Coal Foundation in 2005, which emphasizes education and teaching excellence in communities with scholarships, grants and the signature Teacher Achievement Award[4][6]
Earns national awards for responsible practices, including five U.S. Department of Interior Good Neighbor awards and six MSHA Sentinels of Safety awards[7][8]

History[edit]
Arch Coal was formed in July 1997 through the merger of publicly traded Ashland Coal, Inc. and privately held Arch Mineral Corporation. Arch Mineral had its origins in 1969, when it was formed as a partnership between Ashland Oil (now Ashland Inc.) and the H.L.Hunt family of Dallas, Texas; Ashland Coal was formed in 1975 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Ashland Oil. With the completion of the merger, Arch became the leading producer of low-sulfur coal in the eastern United States.[9]
In June 1998, Arch Coal expanded into the western United States with the acquisition of the coal assets of Atlantic Richfield. Included in this transaction were the Black Thunder Coal Mine and Coal Creek mines in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming; the West Elk longwall mine in Gunnison County, Colorado; and a 65% interest in Canyon Fuel Company, which operates three longwall mines in Utah.[10]
In October 1998, Arch added to its Powder River Basin reserves when it was the winning bidder on Thundercloud, a 412-million-ton federal reserve tract adjacent to the Black Thunder mine.[11]
In July 2004, Arch Coal solidified its position as a leading producer of high-Btu, low-sulfur western bituminous coal with the acquisition of the remaining 35% interest in Canyon Fuel Company and its 161-million-ton reserves.[12]
In August 2004, Arch again expanded its position in the Powder River Basin with the acquisition of Triton's North Rochelle mine adjacent to Arch's existing Black Thunder operation. By integrating the North Rochelle mine with Black Thunder, Arch created the premier mine in the nation's fastest growing coal supply region.[13]
In September 2004, Arch again added to its Powder River Basin reserves when it was the winning bidder on Little Thunder, a 719-million-ton federal reserve tract adjacent to the Black Thunder Coal Mine.[14]
In December 2005, Arch Coal sold select eastern assets to Magnum Coal Company to unlock the value of some of its Central Appalachian holdings, sharpened its focus in that region, and strengthened its balance sheet in preparation for future growth.[15]
In August 2006, Arch acquired a one-third interest in Knight Hawk Coal, a growing coal producer in the Illinois Basin.[16]
In October 2009, Arch acquired Rio Tinto's Jacobs Ranch mine and blended it with Black Thunder Coal Mine in the southern Powder River Basin of Wyoming, creating the single largest coal mining complex in the world.[17]
In November 2009, Arch acquired the rights to mine 731 million tons of Otter Creek coal reserves in the northern Powder River Basin of Montana.[18]
On June 15, 2011, Arch acquired International Coal Group (ICG) and cemented its place as a top five global coal supplier and a top 10 metallurgical coal producer and marketer.[19]
In December 2011, Arch Coal became the successful bidder for a 222 million ton federal coal lease known as the South Hilight tract in the southern Powder River Basin.[20]
In June 2013, Arch Coal announced the planned sale of its Canyon Fuel Company LLC subsidiary to Bowie Resources, LLC. Canyon Fuel includes the Sufco, Skyline and Dugout Canyon mines in Utah.[21][22]
In January 2016, Arch Coal filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[23] This was stated to be a part of a restructuring aiming at reducing debt by $4.5 billion.[24][25]
On October 5, 2016, Arch Coal emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company won a court approval allowing them to erase almost $5 billion in debt and left bankruptcy with $300 million in cash. Arch Coal resumed trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker ARCH. Unsecured creditors and bondholders will receive $30 million in cash along with 6% of the new shares according to court agreements. Bondholders will also have the option to receive either warrants to buy up to 12% of the company's new stock or an additional $25 million cash.[26]
Politics[edit]
Arch Coal PAC is named, along with other major coal producers, as a donor to the 2004 election campaign in West Virginia. 2004 was a record-setting year for donations made by the coal industry.[27]
Competitive status[edit]
Arch is number 564 in the 2013 Fortune 1000 list.[4] They are the second largest coal producer in the United States.[3]
Environmental impact[edit]
Mountaintop removal in Appalachia[edit]
Arch Coal practices mountaintop removal mining, which is controversial because it reduces the height of mountaintops[28]
Their West Virginia mining operations in the Appalachian Mountains were the subject of a critical documentary in 2002 on Now with Bill Moyers on PBS.[29] Arch's Dal-Tex mining operations above the town of Blair, West Virginia were the subject of a 1998 U.S. News & World Report story "Shear Madness" by Penny Loeb.[30] The story documented the impacts of mountaintop removal on communities close to the mines and their subsequent depopulation. A 1999 lawsuit brought by the West Virginia Highlands Conservancy, Bragg v. Robertson was the first successful citizen lawsuit to stop Arch's proposed mountaintop removal valley fill. The fill would have buried several miles of stream at Pigeon Roost Hollow near Blair, West Virginia.[31]
In his ruling for the plaintiffs, Judge Charles H. Haden stated that "If there is any life form that cannot acclimate to life deep in a rubble pile, it is eliminated. No effect on related environmental values is more adverse than obliteration...Under a valley fill the water quality of the stream becomes zero. Because there is no stream, there is no water quality."[32]
As of 2012, the company reported that surface mining in Appalachian mountains accounted for roughly 4 percent of its annual coal production.[2]
Colorado mining[edit]
Earthjustice, the Sierra Club, the Center for Biological Diversity and other environmental groups announced a campaign in 2015 against Arch Coal's mine project in the Sunset Roadless Area of Gunnison National Forest.[33][34]
Mine reclamation[edit]
Arch Coal used more than $1 billion in "self-bonding" to guarantee it could pay for its mine reclamation obligations under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.[35] After Arch Coal declared bankruptcy, the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality agreed to accept $75 million in place of the company’s $486 million in self-bonding liability to the state.[36]
Environmental awareness[edit]
Arch Coal’s subsidiary operations reported a water compliance rate of 99.9 percent over a 10-year period between 2002 and 2012.[37]
In 2012, Arch Coal became the first energy company to earn the Conservation Legacy Award from the National Museum of Forest Service History. The Museum of Forest Service History awarded this honor “in recognition of [Arch Coal’s] commitment to the protection of natural resources, wildlife and water quality values during mining and restoration operations”.[38]
