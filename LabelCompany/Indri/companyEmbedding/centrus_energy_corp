More About Us









History






 Previous







Dawn of the Atomic Age
During the Manhattan Project, scientists and engineers in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, developed and built the world’s first large-scale uranium enrichment facilities.







Atoms for Peace
In the decade after World War II, the country greatly expanded its enrichment capability.  Three huge Gaseous Diffusion Plants in Tennessee, Kentucky, and Ohio – originally built for defense purposes – were the dominant source of fuel for most of the world’s civilian nuclear reactors through the 1970s, helping advance the cause of non-proliferation.  U.S. enriched uranium exports required acceptance of nonproliferation commitments and International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards against diversion to military uses.







The U.S. Falls Behind
The United States’ role as the assured supplier of enriched uranium fuel has steadily declined since the late 1970s. While enrichment programs in Russia, Europe and China have expanded in recent years, the United States shut down its three enrichment plants in 1985, 2001 and 2013, without building a replacement that can meet U.S. national security requirements. The country now lacks a domestic enrichment capability for national security purposes for the the first time since the Manhattan project. Learn more about the national security importance of domestic enrichment capability.







Privatization
Bipartisan legislation passed in the 1990s privatized the U.S. enrichment enterprise, creating the United States Enrichment Corporation, the predecessor to Centrus.  Proceeds from the sale of the company generated $3 billion for the U.S. Treasury.







1993-2013:  Megatons to Megawatts
Under a landmark agreement between the United States and Russia, 500 metric tons of former Soviet nuclear weapons material was converted into fuel for America’s civilian power reactors.  The U.S. Government appointed USEC as its executive agent for the program, which became known as “Megatons to Megawatts.”  The fuel supplied 10% of U.S. electricity needs for two decades while permanently eliminating 20,000 warheads worth of weapons-grade material by the time the last shipment of fuel was received at the end of 2013.







2014
After a downturn in global enrichment prices driven by the ongoing market effects of the 2011 Fukushima disaster, the company filed for bankruptcy to restructure debts that were incurred to finance the development of new enrichment technology.  The company emerged from this restructuring in October 2014 as Centrus Energy Corp.  The newly reorganized company retains strong technical capabilities and long-term sales and supply contracts stretching more than a decade into the future.







Looking to the Future
Under new management, Centrus continues to book new sales and is adding to the diversity of its supply base.  As the global enrichment market recovers in the coming years, the company remains committed to restoring America’s domestic enrichment capability and meeting the needs of our customers around the world.  With world-class technical capabilities, a multibillion dollar order book, and long-term supply and sales agreements through 2026 and beyond, Centrus is well-positioned for the future.

Who We Are





Centrus Energy is a trusted supplier of enriched uranium fuel for commercial nuclear power plants in the United States and around the world. With world-class technical and engineering capabilities, Centrus is advancing the next generation of centrifuge technologies so that America can restore its domestic uranium enrichment capability in the future.
Since 1998, the company has provided our utility customers with more than 1,750 reactor years of fuel, which is equivalent to 7 billion tons of coal.  We provide value to our utility customers through the reliability and diversity of our supply sources – helping them meet the growing need for clean, affordable, carbon-free electricity. Centrus has a long-term order book extending well into the next decade and continues to innovate so that we can help our customers reduce their fuel costs with products and services tailored to their requirements.
The shutdown of the obsolete Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in 2013 left the United States without a domestically developed uranium enrichment capability for the first time since the Manhattan Project.  The U.S. Department of Energy has said this capability must be restored in the future to support America’s long-term national security, energy security and non-proliferation interests.  Centrus remains committed to supporting these important national priorities.
To that end, Centrus is working with the U.S. Department of Energy and Oak Ridge National Laboratory to develop and demonstrate advanced centrifuge uranium enrichment technology.  In 2016, the company successfully completed its three-year demonstration effort in Piketon, Ohio, and continues to advance and improve the technology at our state-of-the-art engineering and testing facilities in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.
While the global enrichment market will not support the deployment of a new, commercial-scale production facility in the near term, Centrus is committed to resuming uranium enrichment operations in the future.  We are laying the technical and economic groundwork to be a leading, low-cost producer.
Centrus is working to grow and diversify our business, leveraging our diverse supply sources and unique technical capabilities to bring value to our customers.  As the global nuclear industry expands its role in providing clean, reliable power, Centrus will be ready to fuel the next generation of reactors.  With deep technical expertise and capabilities, a multi-billion dollar order book, and long-term supply agreements through 2026 and beyond, the company is well-positioned for the future.

					Full Description



Centrus Energy Corp. (Centrus), incorporated on June 29, 1998, supplies low-enriched uranium (LEU) for commercial nuclear power plants. The Company supplies LEU to both domestic and international utilities for use in a growing fleet of nuclear reactors across the world. The Company operates in two segments, which include the LEU segment with two components, separative work units (SWU) and uranium, and the contract services segment. Centrus is engaged in the development of uranium enrichment technology and is performing research and demonstration work to support the United States energy and national security. The Company provides LEU from multiple sources, including its inventory and long-term supply contracts and spot purchases.Low Enriched UraniumThe Company's LEU segment includes sales of the SWU component of LEU, sales of both the SWU and uranium components of LEU, and sales of natural uranium. Its customers include domestic and international utilities that operate nuclear power plants. Its agreements with electric utilities are primarily long-term, fixed-commitment contracts under which its customers are obligated to purchase a specified quantity of the SWU component of LEU (or the SWU and uranium components of LEU) from it. Its agreements for natural uranium sales are generally shorter-term and fixed-commitment contracts.Contract ServicesThe Company's contract services segment includes revenue and cost of sales for American Centrifuge work that the Company performs as a contractor to UT-Battelle, LLC. The contract services segment also includes limited services provided by Centrus to Department of Energy (DOE) and its contractors at the Portsmouth site related to facilities it continues to lease for the American Centrifuge Plant (ACP).The Company competes with Urenco, Areva and Rosatom.

Poneman on Hugh Hewitt Show: Unacceptable for the U.S. to Fall Behind When It Comes to Uranium Enrichment


In an interview with nationally syndicated radio host Hugh Hewitt, Centrus President and CEO Dan Poneman called for a resurgence of U.S. leadership in nuclear energy and for restoring America’s domestic enrichment capability.

More About Us









History






 Previous







Dawn of the Atomic Age
During the Manhattan Project, scientists and engineers in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, developed and built the world’s first large-scale uranium enrichment facilities.







Atoms for Peace
In the decade after World War II, the country greatly expanded its enrichment capability.  Three huge Gaseous Diffusion Plants in Tennessee, Kentucky, and Ohio – originally built for defense purposes – were the dominant source of fuel for most of the world’s civilian nuclear reactors through the 1970s, helping advance the cause of non-proliferation.  U.S. enriched uranium exports required acceptance of nonproliferation commitments and International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards against diversion to military uses.







The U.S. Falls Behind
The United States’ role as the assured supplier of enriched uranium fuel has steadily declined since the late 1970s. While enrichment programs in Russia, Europe and China have expanded in recent years, the United States shut down its three enrichment plants in 1985, 2001 and 2013, without building a replacement that can meet U.S. national security requirements. The country now lacks a domestic enrichment capability for national security purposes for the the first time since the Manhattan project. Learn more about the national security importance of domestic enrichment capability.







Privatization
Bipartisan legislation passed in the 1990s privatized the U.S. enrichment enterprise, creating the United States Enrichment Corporation, the predecessor to Centrus.  Proceeds from the sale of the company generated $3 billion for the U.S. Treasury.







1993-2013:  Megatons to Megawatts
Under a landmark agreement between the United States and Russia, 500 metric tons of former Soviet nuclear weapons material was converted into fuel for America’s civilian power reactors.  The U.S. Government appointed USEC as its executive agent for the program, which became known as “Megatons to Megawatts.”  The fuel supplied 10% of U.S. electricity needs for two decades while permanently eliminating 20,000 warheads worth of weapons-grade material by the time the last shipment of fuel was received at the end of 2013.







2014
After a downturn in global enrichment prices driven by the ongoing market effects of the 2011 Fukushima disaster, the company filed for bankruptcy to restructure debts that were incurred to finance the development of new enrichment technology.  The company emerged from this restructuring in October 2014 as Centrus Energy Corp.  The newly reorganized company retains strong technical capabilities and long-term sales and supply contracts stretching more than a decade into the future.







Looking to the Future
Under new management, Centrus continues to book new sales and is adding to the diversity of its supply base.  As the global enrichment market recovers in the coming years, the company remains committed to restoring America’s domestic enrichment capability and meeting the needs of our customers around the world.  With world-class technical capabilities, a multibillion dollar order book, and long-term supply and sales agreements through 2026 and beyond, Centrus is well-positioned for the future.
