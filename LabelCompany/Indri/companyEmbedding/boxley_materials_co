Concrete


All of our Green Star-certified concrete plants are strategically located to assure delivery of quality Boxley concrete, on time and in spec. Our sizeable fleet, experienced personnel, and state-of-the-art dispatching ensure your quality concrete is all set to be delivered precisely when you need it — day or night.
And, our portable concrete plants enable us to produce the same quality concrete at remote or large job sites.
We offer a variety of certified mixes and the technical know-how to create a customized mix for your job. All of our plants offer hot and cold water capabilities to help keep your job on schedule regardless of the season. Our on-site quality control labs test every concrete batch, for quality, strength and durability providing peace of mind that your concrete will be the same load after load.
Concrete Mix Design
A great concrete mix results in a better finish. We balance the requirements for placeability, strength, durability, density and appearance with economy to create the right mix for your project, at the right price for your bid.
Your Boxley concrete team can create mixes for a variety of applications, including:

Flatwork such as sidewalks, footers, and foundations
Gradework
Wallwork

Concrete Additives
Concrete additives can improve the overall properties of a concrete mix, enabling you to work faster and resulting in a better-finished product.
Some of the additives we use include:
Air entrainment - helps prevent freeze/thaw cracking
Fly ash - is commonly added to the cement portion of the mix
Water reducer - gives concrete more workability without weakening the mix
Superplasticizers - improves workability, added at job site by Boxley technician
Retarder - slows the curing process for long-distance delivery or to give the contractor more time to work the concrete
Accelerators - increases the rate of early strength development and/or shortens setting time
Fiber additives - reinforces concrete and protects against plastic shrinkage and cracking

Homegrown Boxley Materials stands poised to join a list of other businesses once headquartered in the region that have been acquired by a company based elsewhere.Boxley Materials employs about 350 people in Virginia and said they will remain employed after the transition to a new owner.Established by the Boxley family in Roanoke in 1906, Boxley Materials announced Tuesday that it has signed an agreement to sell the company to Summit Materials, an international, publicly held company headquarter in Denver.Both companies’ product lines include ready-mixed concrete, crushed stone, concrete, asphalt and other construction materials.Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Summit reported that the Boxley acquisition and the separate acquisition of American Materials Co., announced Feb. 11, represented a combined investment of about $250 million.Boxley said it anticipates the transaction will close in mid-March. A news release from Boxley reported that Summit will retain Boxley’s leadership team, led by Ab Boxley, president and CEO of the family-owned business now based in Bedford County.Boxley Materials will keep its name.Ab Boxley declined to comment Tuesday about specific details regarding the sale, noting he was limited in what he could disclose about the deal until a regulatory review concludes.Boxley Materials reported in December that it planned to sell the company’s West Virginia group of facilities and was attracting interest also for Boxley’s Virginia-based assets.The sale of the West Virginia operations to Oldcastle Materials, based in Atlanta, closed Dec. 31.
Ab Boxley said in early December that as the construction industry rebounded from the Great Recession, some companies, included publicly traded ones, were looking to expand.At the time, he said any offers to buy Boxley Materials’ remaining assets would be judged by key criteria: that the sale will benefit the owners of Boxley Materials, that any such deal will provide opportunities for existing workers and that the buyer would offer good things for the region.On Tuesday, he said he feels comfortable that Summit will have the same commitment to community involvement and support that Boxley Materials has had.In recent decades, several Roanoke born-and-bred companies have been acquired by businesses headquartered elsewhere. They include Roanoke Electric Steel, Valley Bank, Dominion Bank, ADMMicro, HSMM and Interactive Achievement.Summit Materials’ stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange as SUM.
