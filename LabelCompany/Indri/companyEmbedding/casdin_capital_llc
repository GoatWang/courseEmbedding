Genetic Tests for a Heart Disorder Mistakenly Find Blacks at Risk



By DENISE GRADY Genetic tests for an inherited heart disorder are more likely to have incorrect results in black Americans than in whites, according to a new study that is likely to have implications for other minorities and other diseases, including cancer. Mistakes have been made because earlier research linking genetic traits to illness did […]

The ups and downs of data sharing in science
When doctors in Ottawa saw a child with an unusual developmental disorder last year, they were stumped. Their patient had an abnormally small head and face and had been slow to develop. They sequenced the child’s genome hoping to find a genetic explanation, but came up with too many possible candidate genes to pinpoint a […]

ExAC project pins down rare gene variants



More than one million people have now had their genome sequenced, or its protein-coding regions (the exome). The hope is that this information can be shared and linked to phenotype — specifically, disease — and improve medical care. An obstacle is that only a small fraction of these data are publicly available. In an important […]

Fixing fate



New medical cures may mean changes in drugmakers’ business models WHEN families leave the genetic institute at the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, they are still anxious.

Genetic Engineering Turns a Common Plant into a Cancer Fighter
POST DATE: 10:50 am

 








Notch another victory for synthetic biology. Researchers report today that they’ve engineered a common laboratory plant to produce the starting material for a potent chemotherapy drug originally harvested from an endangered Himalayan plant. The new work could ensure an abundant supply of the anticancer drug and make it easier for chemists to tweak the compound to come up with safer and more effective versions.
Throughout history, people have relied on plants for medicines. Even modern drugmakers get about half their new drugs from plants. But that’s harder to do when plants are slow growing and endangered, as is the Himalayan mayapple (Podophyllum hexandrum). The short, leafy plant was the original source of podophyllotoxin, a cytotoxic compound that’s the starting point for an anticancer drug called Etoposide. The drug has been on the U.S. market since 1983 and is used to treat dozens of different cancers, from lymphoma to lung cancer. Today, podophyllotoxin is mainly harvested from the more common American mayapple. But this plant is also slow growing, producing only small quantities of the compound.
Mayapples churn out podophyllotoxin to defend against would-be munchers. To do so, the plants use a step-by-step approach to synthesize their chemical defense. But because the synthetic pathway of the compound had never been worked out, no one knew precisely which genes were involved in stitching together the molecule. What researchers did know was that podophyllotoxin isn’t always present in the plant. “It’s only when the leaf is wounded that the molecule is made,” says Elizabeth Sattely, a chemical engineer at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, who led the current research effort.
Sattely and her graduate student Warren Lau reasoned that the podophyllotoxin-building proteins were likely themselves only made by the plant in response to an injury. So the pair made tiny punctures in the leaves of healthy Himalayan mayapples provided to them by a commercial nursery, testing them before and after to see which new proteins appeared around the damaged tissue. They discovered 31, which they categorized by probable function.
The pair then narrowed the likely candidates for enzymes in podophyllotoxin production by focusing on members of four classes known to carry out the right types of chemical reactions. They then spliced genes for each of these enzymes into bacteria known to infectNicotiana benthamiana, a fast-growing relative of tobacco that serves as a sort of lab rat of plant biologists. The bacteria readily infect tobacco and insert their genes into the plant tissue. Sattely and Lau inserted numerous combinations of genes for the enzymes they thought might produce their desired compound. As they report online today in Science, they eventually hit on a group of 10 enzymes that allowed the plant to make a molecule called (-)-4’–desmethyl-epipodophyllotoxin, a direct precursor to Etoposide and a potent cancer drug in its own right.
“It’s a great piece of work,” says Sarah O’Connor, a biological chemist at the John Innes Center, a plant research institute in Norwich, U.K. Eventually, the new work may give drug companies a stable, abundant supply of their cancer-fighting drug, and it may give rise to similar compounds that could work even better.

Top Tech Expert: The Next Trillion-Dollar Industry Will Be Built on Genetic Code
POST DATE: 3:26 pm

 








Alec Ross served as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s senior advisor for innovation. During that role, he earned unique insight into the changing nature of technology. In his new book, “The Industries of the Future,” Ross not only lays out the key industries that will shape the 21st century, but also provides the geopolitical, cultural and generational contexts out of which they are emerging. Berggruen Institute’s Dawn Nakagawa sat down with Ross to discuss the book.
You assert the importance of a variety of disruptive technologies from robots to genetics to coded money. What in your mind will have the most impact on the day to day lives of our children when compared to how we live?
Commercialization of genomics is going to change the lives of the vast majority of people on Earth. My kids will live longer, healthier lives because of the commercialization of genomics. Today, health care is delivered with a very small degree of customization but that is going to change as genetic screening becomes less and less expensive and we understand better and better what to look for. The last trillion-dollar industry was built on computer code. The next will be built on genetic code.
You also talk about the potential and perils of big data. What is an example of how big data could go awry?
There are a large variety of possibilities, more than we can imagine at this stage of development. But take, for example, the Good2Go app. In response to the rise of sexual violence on college campuses, this app is used to document mutual consent to sexual activity. With an add on, it can also be used to read blood alcohol levels. So you are codifying sexual activity. In the terms of service agreement, that data can be sold. So information on the best bars to hook up at can be aggregated, or where to pick up a 19 year-old. Worse, what if the information is hacked? The consequences are quite serious.
Your experience in the State Department gave you a front row seat to the U.S. foreign policy agenda. Do you believe cyber occupies the space it should in foreign policy and security policy?
I spent a lot of time in the White House Situation Room. I have seen what we have averted. We have graduated from a Cold War to the Code War. The weaponization of code is the biggest development in warfare since the invention of the atomic bomb. There is not a leader in office today who does not make cybersecurity a priority item on the national security agenda.

Boston-based 908 Devices, a provider of analytical devices for chemical analysis, has secured additional financing, raising its overall funding tally to $29 million. The investors included Casdin Capital and Dr. Martin Madaus, chairman and CEO of Ortho Clinical Diagnostics.
PRESS RELEASE
BOSTON, MA –July 1, 2015 – 908 Devices, a pioneer of purpose-built analytical devices for chemical analysis, today announced it has raised additional growth equity investment for acceleration into the life sciences market, completing its Series C funding and bringing the Company’s funding total to $29 Million. Industry leaders Casdin Capital, a leading life science investor; Dr. Martin Madaus, Chairman and CEO of Ortho Clinical Diagnostics; Paul Meister, former Chairman of the Board of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., and others join the existing investing syndicate. This funding joins investment from life science luminaries Kevin Hrusovsky, Chairman and CEO of Quanterix; Jay Flatley, CEO of Illumina and Dr. David Walt, Scientific Founder of both Illumina and Quanterix.
“We are excited to bring routine analytical answers to life science customers and see many applications on the horizon that are well suited for High-Pressure Mass Spectrometry,” said Dr. Kevin J. Knopp, President and CEO of 908 Devices. “We look forward to working closely with our new and existing investors, all of whom are visionaries and pioneers in the field, to bring game-changing solutions to a new set of customers.”

Research partners from Prof. J. Michael Ramsey’s team at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) and 908 Devices’ employees made a total of seven presentations that covered fundamental performance improvements to HPMS devices and breakthroughs in related liquid separations technologies. Co-authored work from researchers at 908 Devices, UNC-CH and the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research was presented on the rapid analysis of metabolites in biological samples.
“It’s an incredibly exciting time in life sciences with new technologies for analyzing and manipulating molecular biology helping to accelerate the transition from research insight into clinical development,” said Eli Casdin, Managing Member of Casdin Capital. “908 Devices HPMS technology is yet another technological advance, making routine mass spectrometry analysis available to a broader array of users and applications.
