Description



Product Description
Adams, John Quincy. Autograph Letter, signed “J. Q. Adams.” Washington: 7 February 1835. To “Anthony Collamore, Esq / Pemroke, Mass.”   8vo.; 1p.
John Quincy Adams writes (presumably) a constituent, sending (not present) the “declaration and discharge of Isaac Thomas.” Adams writes in a postscript, “A line acknowledging the receipt of these papers is requested.” Written in a bold, dark ink with Adams’ distinct style, just beginning to exhibit the shakiness near the end of his life.
Very good; fold lines; overall toning, except at the very edges where mat lines are evident.

Description


Additional information



Description
John Adams was a representative from Massachusetts and a signatory on the Declaration of Independence.  He was the single biggest force behind America’s fight for independence.  Adams was the first vice president and the second president, and he raised a son who also became president.  Adams was widely respected for his intellect.  He suggested Thomas Jefferson be the primary author of the Declaration of Independence.  Both Jefferson and Adams died on July 4, 1826.
This John Adams mug is part of our Declaration of Independence series profiling the 56 men who signed the Declaration of Independence.  It was on June 11, 1776, that the Second Continental Congress appointed a “Committee of Five” which included: John Adams of Massachusetts, Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania, Thomas Jefferson of Virginia, Robert Livingston of New York and Roger Sherman of Connecticut to create this declaration.  A third reading of the draft text was reviewed by the “Committee of the Whole” on July 3, 1776, which resulted in the removal of two passages, most notably the passage that included a denunciation of slavery and the slave trade.  The Declaration of Independence was adopted on July 4, 1776, and signed by two of the appointed members of the “Committee of Five”.  Most of the 56 men signed it on August 2, 1776.  Six of these men were also signatories on the US Constitution in 1787: George Clymer, Benjamin Franklin, Robert Morris, George Read, Roger Sherman and James Wilson.
The content on the mugs is crafted for a stunning visual experience and to inspire an interest to learn more about history.  Robert Compton, who developed History Mugs, colorized the hundred-year-old photographs in order to bring the individuals back to life.  Biography and images are designed and printed in Bristol, Vermont, USA.

Item Description: Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1975. Softcover. Book Condition: Fair. X, 411 pages, illustrations, pictorial wrappers, a little shelf wear otherwise very good. From the Publisher: "The lives of this remarkable couple unfold alongside events of the Revolutionary War era, a time in which John left his family for prolonged periods to serve his colony and country. Their engaging exchanges follow John's career from provincial lawyer and farmer in Braintree, Massachusetts, to delegate to the Continental Congresses in Philadelphia, to diplomatic success in Europe. John reveals himself as an ambitious, determined, and self-doubting statesman with a trusting, deeply affectionate character and an earthy sense of humor. Abigail's lively and captivating letters show the trials of an intelligent, strong, and resourceful woman who managed the family's farm and business affairs and reared the pair's four children during her husband's long absences. Her missives to John are filled with outspoken remarks on politics, public figures, and world-shaking events. An independent thinker and advocate of equal rights for women, she urged him in one spirited letter to "Remember the Ladies" in framing the new government. Abigail also vividly documents domestic life in eighteenth-century America, providing enlightening details on health problems, childbirth, education, women's activities, the difficulties of travel, and the impact of wartime inflation. The 226 letters contained in this volume are supplemented with a few to third parties and a sampling of diary entries. Altogether, the words and thoughts of these warm, if occasionally fallible, human beings richly convey the experience of the Revolutionary generation in a most personal and authentic way. " SR1636F ; 411 pages.  Bookseller Inventory # 26231

    Whiting - Brush Pages
  











           
        








Whiting - Adams Co.



 


"...THE ART OF MAKING BRUSHES" was part of the title of U.S. Patent No. 
207,786 awarded to John L. Whiting of Boston, Massachusetts on September 3,
1878 which related to certain improvements regarding flat brushes; such as 
whitewash, paste and wall brushes.  

Since the three German-born Wessling brothers, some of their children, a
cousin or two, as well as some of their in-laws worked as brushmakers for the 
Whitings, it is very likely that such an item had been crafted by them.

In 1808 Artemus Woodward founded a business in Medfield,
Massachusetts to make his own brushes and it was reported to have been a
"business new to this section of the country." At the time that his
enterprise was begun brushes were usually imported from England and were
quite expensive, although such items were lacking in quality. As a remedy,
some skilled workers from Germantown, Pennsylvania were hired and
worked under the supervision of Woodward. Seth Whiting and John
Wickliffe Adams would acquire their brush making skills from these men. 
Woodward's business, however, lasted only a few 
years.2

John Wickliffe Adams was possessed of remarkable mechanical skills, as
well as a good education. He established in 1811 at his homestead a brush
manufacturing business and for a long time he conducted a thriving
business selling the output to merchants in 
Boston.2 (Because of the War of 1812 had
caused the importation of brushes to be curtailed, his business prospered
from its inception.)

At about this same time Seth Whiting joined Adams, but their
partnership existed only for a few years and upon its dissolution (probably 
circa 1814) Whiting went to Phillipston, Massachusetts. 

Adams' son, John Jay Adams, was born in 1812 and after having
learned the brush making trade from his father went to Taunton,
Massachusetts in the early 1830's to set up his own brush business. He
would soon to relocate to Boston (He was listed in the 1838 Boston city
directory.) "where he developed and improved the brush making process
until his production stood in the front 
rank."2 His first patent for a brush was
issued in 1842. 

During the few years in Boston Adams' business was conducted at several
different locations. In the 1840's he was working at 99 Washington. There he 
remained until February of 1851 when he purchased from Edward G. Parker 
the land and building with his partners Charles Vaughn of
Cambridge, Massachusetts and William E. Abbot of 
Dorchester, Massachusetts. The purchase price was $33,000.00 and a
mortgage was given to the seller for  $17,000.00. (see 617.177, et seq.) The 
new business' address remained 99 Washington until a few years later when the 
building was expanded and then its address became 99 and 101 
Washington. 6 
In 1857 Adams' business continued to trade under the same name, but the
principles were Charles Vaughn and William M. Vaughn of Cambridge. As 
there was no mention of Adams being then in Boston, it would seem that the
partnership was reshaped.6

In 1862 Adams and his new partners entered into an agreement with their
abutters. What is interesting is that Adams gave New York City as
his address, while the 2 other partners were from the Boston area. On July
8, 1863 Adams sold his 1/3 interest in the business to his partners for 
$30,000. (see 830.221.) 

In New York City John Jay Adams carried on a  very extensive business
for many years. In reviewing the directories for New York City covering
the decade of the 1870's, Adams was listed as residing on E. 39th
St. and as having operated a brush business at 75 Beekman in which area of
the city there were a number of other brush manufacturers and suppliers of
bristles. However, a change affecting his firm occurred around 1875 as his
residence remained the same but no mention was made as to his occupation
or business. At the same time a Charles W. Mulford was in the brush
trade at 75 Beekman and Mulford's residence was on Long Island. In the
1878 New York City directory located at 75 Beekman was Charles W. Mulford & Co.

John Jay Adams died in 1879 at New York 
City.2

The directory for the year ending May 1, 1880 showed an advertisement
placed by Mulford in which he stated that he was the successor to J.J. 
Adams & Co. and the "sole manufacturers of Adams Brushes." and that 
business had 75 Beekman as its address.

The federal census of 1880 for New York shows that Charles W. Mulford
lived in Hempstead and was a Brush Manufacturer. In the same household was
a Harvey W. Hascy, age 22, and no occupation was 
provided.x

The directory for 1883/1884 continued to place Mulford's business at 75
Beekman and his residence was in Hempstead, L.I. also, Harvey
W(ickes) Hascy was associated with that business and he, too,
resided in Hempstead. In the 1885/86 directory Hascy was a manager for a
firm doing business at 75 Beekman. (The 1909/1910 directory for Hempstead
showed that both Mulford and Hascy resided on the same street.) 

Sometime in 1887 or 1888 Mulford's business was located at 94 Beekman and 
sometime around 1892 Mulford was no longer an owner of the company. In the New 
York City directory for the year ending May 1, 1893 it was Hascy who appeared 
to have been the owner and as its manager was Alexander Brawner. 
Circa 1898 J.J. Adams & Co. moved its operations to Brooklyn,
New York. 



The Brooklyn city directory for the year ending May 1, 1901 listed the
following as being connected with J.J. Adams & Co. :
   Hascy, who resided in Hempstead; 
   Brawner, who resided in Manhattan; and 
   James H. Devereux of Aspen, Colorado. 
(A James H. Devereux was shown in the New York City Directory with the
occupation of that as a mining engineer.) 
All three of these men would later become directors in the new corporation
formed by the 1908 merger of John L. Whiting & Son Co. and J.J. Adams Co. 
 

It had been previously mentioned that Seth Whiting and John W. Adams
were contemporaries and had been co-workers in the brush making business.
Whiting married Mary Kendall on November 30, 1815 in
Royalston, Massachusetts and their children were as follows.

He and his family lived at various times in Massachusetts (Phillipston
and Shrewsbury) and in New Hampshire (Rindge) until the early 1840's. They
would then return to Massachusetts, where he had begun a brush making
business in the Fayville village of Southborough. Seth
Whiting died there on April 3, 1849 at the age of 62. (His death
certificate stated that his occupation was that of a 
brushmaker.)4

The federal census of 1850 for Massachusetts showed that for the town
of Southborough that the only Whitings were Lucius H., age 25, and
John L., age 27, who were both brushmakers. The other family members
were residing in nearby Worcester. The head of that household
was Mary K., age 55; and her children, Jonas M., age 22; Anistis A.,
age 18; and Olive M., age 16.8
(Seth Whiting was born in Shrewsbury and his parents were John L. and
Olive. From about 1852 and onward Mary K. Whiting and at least 3 of her
children were living in Boston.) 

John Lake Whiting married Mary Betsey Sawin in 1852
(November or December) in Southborough, Massachusetts. He was a brushmaker
from Boston, age 29. At the time of their marriage she was 24 and residing
in Southborough. She had been born in Natick, 
Massachusetts. 9 
The children of John L. and Mary B. S. Whiting were all born at 1
Hersey Place in Boston, Massachusetts.

In the early 1850's John L. Whiting was making brushes in Boston and
most likely working for one of the several brush manufacturing firms. (He
was first mentioned in the Boston city directory of 1852/53 as a
brushmaker.) In the decade of the 1850's there were only 5 or 6 such
businesses and they were all apt to have been small partnerships employing
a small workforce. Many of these owners had apprenticed with the Adams' or
with Seth Whiting before setting out on their own. It was not possible to
determine if John L. Whiting had been employed by any particular business
but in the city directories, he was referred to a brushmaker rather than
as a brush manufacturer, which was others had been described. 

From the biography of Lew C. Hill nc
John L. Whiting had been associated with John Jay Adams in a brush factory
at Boston but he withdrew form that enterprise and founded his own
business in 1864. (Was this a consequence of Adams' sale of his interest
in the partnership to the Vaughns?) Although the city directories listed
Whiting as being in Boston from as early as 1852, at some point Whiting
must have been working in Portland, Maine; since the documentation
for the patent awarded to him on August 4, 1863 showed that city as
his address. Whiting had, in fact, been in Portland at the shop of
Darius White and left circa August of 1863 in order to
return Boston according a history of the Whiting company.
A history of Whiting's company described its development as "... the
business started in a small room on a small side street, and outgrew its
quarters several times by taking additional rooms, and three times by
changing locality."mm

Whiting was a member of a partnership, according to the Boston city
directory of 1866, operating under the name of Drinkwater (Homer
J.) & Whiting (John L.) and it was located at 3 Doane. In the
following year it had relocated to 8 Blackstone.

In the 1868 directory there was no longer any further mention of
Drinkwater but the business' address reamined 8 Blackstone until 1875 when
his business was shown as being at 144 and 146 Oliver. The business of 
John L. Whiting was something of a family concern because a
brother, Jonas Miles Whiting, was employed as brushmaker from the
outset and another brother, Lucius Henry Whiting was hired as an
agent/salesman. In 1874 Lew C. Hill was working as bookkeeper. (His
wife's uncle was John L. Whiting - Mary Kendall Whiting had married
Charles D. Marcy.xx Beginning
about 1875 William Sawin Whiting was working for his father as a
clerk.6

The business possibly experienced an expansion in 1880 as its address
was given as 132 - 146 Oliver. It seemed that business/sales offices were
at 146 Oliver and the factory was at 132 Oliver. In 1881 William
S. Whiting joined his father in the capacity of  partner and the business
became known as John L. Whiting & Son.

A major expansion took place in 1884 when a parcel of 
land containing a little more than 8,000 sq. ft. was acquired by both John
L. Whiting and William S. Whiting. This lot was bounded by Belcher Lane,
Washington Place, and High and Purchase Streets. In the city directory the
firm's address was given as being at the corner of High and Purchase. The
acquisition must not have been a simple matter as it involved the following
series of transactions.


On May 1, 1884 a parcel of land containing 3,554 sq. ft. was purchased
from the heirs of Nathaniel Brewer. (See 1640.310.) 
On June 6, 1884 a parcel of land containing 1,174 sq. ft. was
purchased from Joseph B. Glover. (See 1640.438.) 
On June 4, 1884 a parcel of land was purchased from William
Childs. (See 1642.316.) 
On May 29, 1884 a parcel of land was purchased from several members of
the Loomis family for $2,500.00. (See 1644.439.) 
On May 28, 1884 a parcel of land was purchased from the estate of
Jerome Kidder for $4,965.00. (see 1646.091.) 
On June 27, 1884 a triangular shaped parcel of land was purchased from
the City of Boston for $320.00 (See 1647.377.)


In each of the above transactions there was never any mention of there
having been structures built on any of the parcels. Perhaps, any buildings
had been destroyed by the great fire of Boston. 

It would seem that a new building was
constructed as in January of 1885 the Whitings had borrowed $55,000.00
from the Cambridge Savings Bank using "land with a brick building thereon
in Boston including engines, boilers, and other machinery or fixtures
forming part of realty." The term of the loan was 5 years and the annual
rate of interest was 4.50%. (See 1664.636 for a surveyor's
depiction of the lot's dimensions.)

"The present factory at the corner of High and Purchase Streets being
the most complete and largest factory (brush) under one roof known,
occupying an entire block with streets on four sides, with six stories and
basement for height." 6 Another comment,
made in a publication from 1894, was that it "... is now one of the leading
firms in this line (brush making) in the United States, having an
extensive factory near Rowe Wharf."pih 
For a number of illustrations of the interior of the factory, please see 
this page.

Some of the Boston city atlases referred to this property as the
"Whiting Building" whose address was 221 High Street. The new factory
enabled the Whitings to more than double their production capacity and the
number of workers increased accordingly.

The 1885 Boston city directory listed Henry Wessling as being
employed as a foreman at a business located at High Street
and Hermann Wessling was employed at the same address as a
brushmaker. In the 1876 directory Henry's occupation was that of a
brushmaker, without any business address being provided. That
same edition marked the first time that Henry had been listed in the Boston 
city directories.

In a speech given by  John L. Whiting in 1886 he discussed brush making
and how the industry had changed since the time when he had begun as an
apprentice to his father. In part he said, "it takes several men nowadays
to make a practical brushmaker, and it is true the trade is vastly more
complicated now than formerly, but 40 or 50 years ago apprentices learned
trades thoroughly; in fact, I think we have only 2 thorough, old-fashioned
brushmakers in our employ." His attitudes on well trained workmen were
also expressed in a pamphlet on brush making by stating that it "... very
much depends on the quality and proportion of stock that go into any given
batch and the skill and judgment to so prepare the stock can only be
realized by the brushmaker." In his speech Whiting went on to say that his
business had about 80 machines and many specialized tools in the factory
for brush making. For an account of how brushes were made at Whiting's
factory see Appendix I.

In 1887 Lew C. Hill was made a member of John L. Whiting &
Son. However, it was not possible to determine what percentage of the
business he had acquired. 

John L. Whiting died on June 5, 1892 in Boston and at the time of his
death his brush manufacturing business was reported to have been the
largest in the United States.11 It was
said that his business consumed 25% of all the bristles imported by
America as well as a large percentage of the supply of domestic
bristles. His wife inherited his estate which was valued at about
$400,00.00. 

John L. Whiting had been a holder of many patents. His
inventions/improvements included brush designs as well as the machinery
used in the brush making process - a device for making ferrules, a boring
tool for brush handles, and a machine for sorting and arranging
bristles. (The latter device, which had been patented in 1876, may have
been acquired through Enoch B. Whiting of St. Alban's, Vermont.) 
The royalties from the licensing of these items were a significant source
of revenue for the company. By introducing new methods in the marketing and
manufacturing of brushes his business became an important factor in the
trade. In essence, he brought an artisan enterprise, heavily dependent
on hand work, into the industrial age.12
See Appendix I for a description
of early brush making processes. 

The formula for Whiting's successful brand of products was to manufacture 
high quality brushes which were priced competitively in order to increase
market share. The elements of his business plan included: 
obtaining patents and trademarks,
lobbying for protective tariff legislation (increased duties on
imported brushes and reduced duties for imported bristles),
introducing labor saving devices and production methods,
purchasing raw materials in large quantities to reduce unit costs, and
training and retaining a skilled workforce.


Attesting to the quality of those products, Whiting received many
awards, including a Gold Medal at the Columbian Exhibition in Chicago,
from his participation in industrial expositions throughout the world. 

William S. Whiting succeeded his father as president of the company. He
married Mary C. Allen in 1884 and they were the parents of the
following children.

A change in the ownership of the property at the corner on High and
Purchase Streets took place on July 18, 1892 when William S. Whiting
conveyed his interest in same to his mother, Mary B. Whiting. On the same
date Lew C. Hill did likewise. (See 2073.175 and .481.) Hill 
was the company's treasurer at that time.6

From the records of the Massachusetts Department of Corporations and
Taxation on July 28, 1893 the John L. Whiting & Son Company was
incorporated with an authorized capital of $300,000.00 and the corporation
issued 3,000 shares, each having a par value of $1,000.00. William  S. Whiting 
was the president and treasurer. Lew C. Hill and Anna M. Whiting 
were the other incorporators. It would seem that as a result of the death of 
her husband, the partnership was dissolved by Mrs. Whiting's acquiring of
the interests of her son and of Hill. The consideration for the acquisition of
those interests was more than likely shares in the newly formed corporation. 
It is assumed that Anna M. Whiting acted as the representative of the
family's interests. 

Beginning around 1890 and ending in 1919 Boston was the most important
brush making city in the world. However, some significant events transpired 
in the early 1900's when the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. acquired
several companies - Patton Paint Co. in 1900 and Rennous, Kleine
& Co., a Baltimore based brush manufacturer. PPG's strategy was based
on expanding its distribution network. As a glass manufacturer its
products were sold through hardware stores at the retail level. Since their
sales representatives already called at such places, by offering a wider
array of products, more sales would follow. Thus paints and brushes were
added as product lines. At the same time these actions also made others
aware that competition would become more intense. 

Another factor to consider was that a change in technology was about to
occur in that around 1907 Thomas DeVilbiss was experimenting with a spray gun. 
As mass production in the manufacturing process was beginning to evolve at this 
time, the adoption of a spray gun was a major advance in the application of
paint and lacquer to those items have having wide, uniformly flat surfaces. By 
the 1920's this technology was a regular feature on the assembly lines of 
furniture and automobile manufacturers, for example. 

In 1894 Henry Wessling borrowed 
some money from Whiting's widow to purchase some land in Roxbury which he 
would subdivide. On one of the lots his brother, Hermann, had a house built 
where he and his family would live for many years. (See 2217.090.) 
Also, Henry Wessling borrowed some money from Mrs. Whiting in order to buy the 
real estate on Hawthorn Street (See 2512.539 and 2534.289.) 
Although it is not known exactly when Henry Wessling began working for Whiting, 
the sketch of him might provide a clue. The date of 1896 might coincide with
his 25th year at the company. He arrived in America on December of 1871
and he was listed in the ship's passenger manifest as a brushmaker. (One
of Henry Wessling's obituaries in
1914 referred to him as a general foreman or as a superintendant.)

The Whiting's operations continued to flourish and it expanded again on
October 22, 1903 when it acquired a parcel of land in Boston's South End
containing 40,000 sq. ft. including a brick building and the engines,
boilers, machinery and other fixtures, etc. from the trustees representing
the creditors of the Hallett & Davis Piano Manufacturing Company. This 
lot was bounded by Harrison Avenue, Canton Street, a 15' wide passageway, and 
Brookline Street. The purchase price $107,000.00 in addition to the
assumption of certain debts. (an outstanding mortgage of $55,000.00 given
to the Franklin Savings Bank, obligations in the form of bonds held by
Royal M. Pulsifer amounting to $100,000.00, as well as taxes
payable to the City of Boston.) (See 2928.578 and 1449.278.) 
A surveyor's drawing of the lot formed part of file 6058.371.

After an 1864 fire had destroyed the Hallett
& Davis factory, it would be replaced by a new building on Harrison Avenue
at the corner of Brookline Street. About 250 workers were employed there
circa 1894.pih A newspaper article 
dated in November of 1903 reported "John L. Whiting & Son have plans in
progress for alteration and possibly an addition to their brush factory, corner 
of Harrison Avenue and East Brookline Street, Boston. There will be a
private electric plant from a new steam 
plant."bb
In 1905 the officers of John L. Whiting & Son Company (incorporated in
Massachusetts) consisted of William S. Whiting, president and treasurer, and 
Lew C. Hill, secretary.

They were also directors along with Anna M. Whiting. A balance sheet as
of June 30, 1904 was included in the report (Assets/Liabilities of
$1,148,446.00 with $300,000.00 being Capital Stock) and the annual meeting
was held in July. 

From 1906 through 1908 there were no changes in the officers and
directors.

William S. Whiting died on April 6, 1908 at his home in 
Brookline.13

On May 5, 1908 the John L. Whiting Co. conveyed its interest in the
property on Harrison Avenue to Mary B. Whiting, president of the
company. (See 3280.570.) She still continued to own the property on
High Street, which had been subdivided and leased to several businesses. 

Also, on May 5, 1908 a 15 year leasing arrangement was entered into
whereby Mary B. Whiting rented the Harrison Avenue property, effective as
of June June 1, 1908, to the John L. Whiting & Son Co. for $12,000.00
per annum. Mary B. Whiting signed the document with the title of
president and Lew C. Hill signed as its treasurer. (See 3283.044.) 

The John L. Whiting & Son Co. merged with the J.J. Adams Co. and on
July 1, 1908 the new company incorporated in the State of Maine taking on
the corporate name of John Whiting - J.J. Adams Co., with its
principle place of business remaining as Boston. Its registered agent was
Harry R. Virgin, Esq. of Portland, who had been a state politician in
Maine and had served as president of the state senate in the early 1900's.
(Was there a tax advantage for incorporating in Maine?)

Regarding this merger it was stated in Hill's biography that the
"... consolidation again united the interests and resources of two concerns
that had started a century before, making it the largest brush
manufacturing business in the world with plant and headquarters in
Boston."nc

On July 15, 1908 the lease was assigned to the John L. Whiting -
J.J. Adams Co. with Lew C. Hill, vice-president, signing on behalf of 
John L. Whiting & Son Co. and Harvey W. Hascy, signing for John L. Whiting
- J.J. Adams Co. (See 3295.445.)

As a result of the merger J.J. Adams Co. moved its production capacity
to Boston from Brooklyn while retaining a sales in Manhattan. (How and
when was the merger made? Research New York documents.)

In 1909 Mary B. Whiting and her daughters, Anna M. and Susan A., lived
at 11 Washington in Newton, Massachusetts. She died there on
October 26, 1909 at the age of 81.14

Her estate was valued at slightly in excess of $1,100,000.00 and it
included 887 preferred shares and 1,036 common shares in the John L. Whiting - 
J.J. Adams Co. The property at 221 High Street was valued at $178,100.00
while the property at 700 Harrison Avenue was valued at $166,000.00 (probably 
book value of each). The assets in her estate included 2 notes, totaling 
$16,000.00, secured by mortgages given by Henry Wessling on his property at 
Hawthorn Street and by a similar note for $10,000.00 given by Hermann Wessling 
on his property at Dorr Street.14

Succeeding Mrs. Whiting as president was Lew C. Hill, who had been in
the employ of the Whitings for many years. He had come Boston in 1873 and
according to the Boston city directory of 1874 he was living at 222 Shawmut 
and was a moulder (metal worker).  Coincidentally, in the same year John L. 
Whiting's brother, Lucius, lived there as well. At that time Lucius
was a bookkeeper at a business located at 146 Oliver, the identical
address of John L. Whiting's firm.

In the federal census of 1880 for Massachusetts Lew(is) C, Hill; Clara
K., his wife; and their two children, Charles C. and Harry H., were at 56
Clarendon in Boston. They had been enumerated with her parents. Hill's
occupation was a bookkeeper.15

In the 1900 federal census Lew(is) C. Hill; his wife, Clara; and their
son, Edward, were at 236 Newbury Street in Boston. In the 1899 Boston city
directory Henry H(orace). Hill was working as a clerk and living at the
same Newbury Street address as Lew C. Hill. In 1900 Henry H. Hill 
was living in Brookline.16

In 1909 Edward Marcy Hill joined the business as a clerk. Prior
to that he had been employed as a salesman at 60 Devonshire, where he had
been working since 1903.6

Another new hiring in 1909 was that of Charles A. Sawin. Since
1898 he had been working first at the Bank of Redemption and then at the
1st National Bank of Boston, where he had been an Assistant 
Cashier.6 Sawin's father was Moses Morse
Sawin, the brother of Mary Sawin Whiting. His mother's maiden was Susan
O. Kendall. in other words, he had been a first cousin of William S. Whiting.  
In an obituary for Mary B. Whiting, Sawin was one of the pall bearers, 4
of which were grandsons and the other 4 were 
nephews.aa

Significant changes for the John L. Whiting - J.J. Adams Co. (A Maine
corporation) took place following the death of William S. Whiting and were 
reported in the 1909 directory. 
   Lew C. Hill, president 
   Harvey W. Hascy, treasurer (Hempstead, N.Y.) 
   Allen S. Whiting, secretary, (He was the son of
William S. Whiting.) 
They were also directors of the corporation in addition to James
H. Devereux of New York and Walter I.(rving) Bigelow of
Boston. 

The authorized capital had been increased to $1,250,000.00 and the
issued capital was $1,000,000.00

The origin of Bigelow's involvement is not known. Bigelow had been in
the leather business of his father, A.M. Bigelow & Co. until 1892 at
which time he formed a business broking firm in Boston. Perhaps he had a
hand in negotiating the merger or had participated in the financing of one
of the business expansions.

It seems that 2 of the directors were hold overs from J. J. Adams Co. and
2 others were tied to the intersets of the John L. Whiting & Son Co. Hill 
represented his personal ownership stake and Whiting represented the interest 
of the Whiting family members. Hascy probably represented his personal 
ownership, although the full extent of same is not known. On balance, the 
numerical advantage favors the Boston-based group if Bigelow sided
with Hill and Whiting.
1909 also marked the passage by Congress of federal tax legislation as
well as in tax legislation being enacted in Massachusetts.

An investment trust was created on January 13, 1910, named the John
L. Whiting Estate Trust, "to hold, manage, and improve certain parcels
of land." These included the land and building at the corner of High and
Purchase Streets in Boston; the land an building on Harrison Avenue in
Boston; some property in Newton, Mass. near the boundary of th the Brighton 
section of Boston; and a number of house lots in Brockton, Mass. Serving
as trustees were Charles A. Sawin and Anna M. Sawin.

This trust issued 4,560 shares with a par value $100.00 per share
representing a total value of $456,000.00. (The same properties were valued at 
about $300,000.00 in Mrs. Whiting's estate.) 1,140 shares each were subscribed
to by the 3 surviving children and the remaining 25% was divided equally among 
the children of William S. Whiting. This basic formula followed closely the 
manner in which Mrs. Whiting's estate had been settled. (See 3423.421.)

From the 1910 Directory the only changes noted were an increase in the
authorized capital to an amount $2,400,000.00 and the issued capital to 
$2,000,000.00.It was not stated if another class of stock (preferred
and/or stock with special voting rights) had been issued. It is assumed
that some sort of increased business activity took place at about this
time. Maybe these increases reflected the cost of financing the merger
with the Brooklyn company. 

On March 25, 1912 the John L. Whiting & Son Company was dissolved by
an act the Massachusetts legislature.

During the years 1911 through 1915 there were no major changes in the
management; although according to the Boston city directories of 1914 and
1915, Allen S. Whiting, secretary, was residing in Santa Barbara,
California. 

The 1916 Directory showed the following changes:
   Lew C. Hill, president; 
   Harry H. Hill, vice-president; 
   Harvey W. Hascy, treasurer; and
   Charles A. Sawin, secretary. 
They were also directors in addition to James H. Devereux and
Alexander H. Brawner, both of New York, and Walter I. Bigelow of
Boston. 

It appears that Sawin replaced Whiting in order to continue to represent 
the Whiting members and their trust. Also the board of directors was increased 
by two seats with no shift in the advantage for the Boston-based group. Hill's
son was probably added only to offset the impact of Brawner's nomination. 

Brawner had been associated with the J.J. Adams & Co. of Brooklyn
according to the New York city directory of 1916. It is known that he had
been an Adams employee as early as 1893.
From 1917 through 1919 there were no changes reported.

Anna M. Whiting died on March 1, 1920. Her estate was valued at nearly
$535,00.00 and it included 562 preferred shares and 673 common shares of
the brush company's stock. In addition she owned 1,520 shares in the 
family trust. Her position as trustee of the family trust may have been
assumed by her nephew, John Whiting Webber. He was the oldest child
of John L. Whiting's only surviving child.  

At this time the largest block of company shares were probably in
control of William S. Whiting's 3 children, whose holdings may have
increased through the bequests of their grandmother and 2 aunts and by the
terms of the family's real estate trust.

A meeting of the board of directors was held on March 16, 1921 to propose 
that a Massachusetts corporation be created.

According to the records of the Massachusetts Department of
Corporations and Taxation on May 21, 1921 the John L. Whiting - J.J. Adams
Co. was incorporated with an authorized capital of $1,000,000.00 in 
preferred shares and $1,000,000.00 in common shares. Each class of shares
had a par value of $100.00.

A special meeting of the John L. Whiting - J.J. Adams Co. was held at
Portland, Maine on May 21, 1921 as a corporation was about to be formed in
"Mass. for the purpose of buying out and continuing the business of this
corporation." That Mass. corporation was "desirous of assuming and using as
its corporate name 'John L. Whiting - J.J. Adams Co.' " The majority
of stockholders voted their assent and those votes were cast by Lew
C. Hill, Harvey W. Hascy, Henry H. Hill, Walter I. Bigelow. The clerk of
the Maine corporation was Harry R. Virgin.cc

According to the Maine corporate records the company was excused as a
corporation on May 31, 1921.

It would appear that the Whiting family was no longer active in the day
to day operations after about 100 years with that responsibility now having 
shifted to the Hill family. The company itself, probably reached its zenith 
several years ago coinciding with the end of the World War.

The 1921 Directory was not available and the Directory for 1922-23 the
names of the officers and directors remained unchanged. However in the 
Directory for 1923-24 the office of president was vacant.

Lew C. Hill died on August 25, 1923 in Boston. From his 
obituarync it was learned that he had been 
born in Fair Haven, Vermont, the son of Clark P.Hill and Eliza M. (Pratt) Hill.
He spent his boyhood, Fair Haven; Saratoga, New York; and Hammonton, New 
Jersey. After public school he worked as an iron moulder and in 1873 he went 
to Boston. He married Clara Kendall Marcy of Boston, who had died
in 1916. He was a member of the Exchange and Home Market Clubs in Boston
as well as having belonged to the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic
Association. He was survived by his second wife, Lillian J. Fischer
of Brooklyn, New York, whom he married in 1917 (She had been born on April 6,  
1881 in Brooklyn.) and the 2 sons from his first marriage, Henry Horace and 
Edward Marcy. He had owned a summer home in Swampscott, Massachusetts and a 
farm in East Holliston, Massachusetts.

The next president was Harvey W. Hascy, though the only reference to his 
having been so named was some correspondence in which the company's
stationery had been used.jfw

In 1925 Stanley Cunningham was with the Whiting - Adams Co. He
had been a note broker as well as a mechanical engineer. In 1915 he had
been employed by The Russell Co., General Managers. In the
following year he was appointed a vice-president and a director with that
firm. In 1920 he was working at The Industrial Company, which had 
strong ties with a highly prominent Boston law firm - Herrick, Smith,
Donald & Farley, where Arthur H. Weed would later become one of 
the partners. The Industrial Company, consulting engineers with a role in 
financing commercial ventures, was organized in 1916 by John Wells 
Farley of Herrick, Smith. In the 1920 Directory Cunningham was with the 
Industrial Company and was associated with the Ayer-Houston Corp. as its 
president and a director in addition to being a vice-president and director of 
the Merrimac Hat Corp. Both of the latter firms were clients of Herrick, Smith.

Later, C.L. Stevens would become connected with some of the
businesses managed by The Industrial Company. (It seems that The
Industrial Company and others like it existed to rehabilitate problem
businesses in order to sell them to others, thereby profiting from the
gain on the sale owing to their equity participation as well as through
revenues derived from management fees. Frequently, a law firm would
act an intermediary between the troubled business and the consultants.
And it would not be unheard of if the law firm had an ownership in the
consulting firm.

The 1926 Directory showed the following changes:
   Henry H. Hill, president, 
   Edward M. Hill, vice-president and secretary,
and
   Stanley Cunningham, treasurer.
They were also directors along with Walter I. Bigelow of Boston and James
H. Devereux; Alex H. Tomes an owner of an import/export business
in New York; and X.M. Audibert, a member of Gude, Winmill &
Co., a stock brokerage in New York. 

William S. Whiting's daughter, Elizabeth, was married to Tomes and his
daughter, Natalie, was the wife of Audibert.

Brawner was no longer a director and he may have died at about that
time. (He may have been born 1858.)

It appears that the Whiting - Adams Co. had run into some financial
difficulties and had hired an outside manager to analyze its weaknesses. 
Perhaps with the deaths of 3 officers/directors, a declining order book,
and stronger competition it was time for the new board of directors to seek
a different corporate strategy. While Cunningham, an outsider, held the 
corporate purse strings; his role was probably to implement and oversee
cost control measures. 

Following a long illness Harvey W. Hascy died on March 21, 1927 in
Brookline at the age of 70.

The 1927 Directory showed the following changes:
   Henry H. Hill, president and general manager,
   Edward M. Hill, vice-president, and
   Stanley Cunningham, treasurer and secretary.
The other directors were the same as in the previous year.

According to the records of the Massachusetts Department of
Corporations and Taxation on August 3, 1927 the John L. Whiting - J.J. Adams 
Company's corporate name became the Whiting - Adams Company. Given
the recent death of Hascy, maybe this change reflects how is interest in
the business was transferred. 

As a result of a meeting of  the Whiting stockholders on February 8,
1929 15,000 common shares were reserved and The Muskegon Corp. was
given an option to purchase those shares. However, that option had never
been exercised and no shares had ever been issued. The Muskegon Corp.,
managing engineers, had been created as a Massachusetts corporation on
September 29, 1924 as a result of the renaming of the Stevens Investment
Company, which had been organized on February 18, 1924. On that same
date the C.L. Stevens Company was organized as a Massachusetts 
corporation. On December 5, 1930 The Muskegon Corp. was renamed as The 
Stevens Company which became The Stevens Corporation on January 
5, 1931.  

(Charles Leigh Stevens was born on May 24, 1895 in Muskegon, Michigan.
After attending Cornell University he began his business career with 
Charles Bedaux, who had achieved prominence as an important figure
in the 'scientific management' movement of the early 20th century. Stevens
died on October 6, 1962 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.)

In 1929 Stevens had his offices on the same floor of a Boston office
building as did Herrick, Smith and Steven occupied the space formerly leased 
to Saco-Lowell Shops whose president was Robert F. Herrick and 
a director of Saco-Lowell had been Stevens. (The 1924 Directory mentioned 
Stevens for the first time as being the president of C.L. Stevens 
Company, consulting engineers, located at 1 Federal Street in Boston.)

In 1929 the officers of the Whiting - Adams Co. were the same but Sawin
was replaced as a director by C.L. Stevens of Boston.

With all the events happening within the company in 1929 as well as the 
collapsing of the national economy, it seems that the control of the
active management of the company has been assigned to Stevens. 

In 1930 C. L. Stevens became the preident of the Whiting -
Adams Co. and Edward M. Hill was its treasurer. Neither Henry H. Hill nor
Stanley Cunningham were mentioned.

Although Stevens was the president of the brush company, his office was
at 75 Federal Street in Boston and he was also president of the following.

The Stevens Corp. (Inc. 1924)
C.L. Stevens Co., consulting engineers (Inc. 1924)
Devon Mfg. Co. (Inc. 1929)
Stevens Associates (Inc. 1930) 

Also, in 1930 there were 2 new directors. - Arthur W. Weed of
Boston, an attorney with Herrick, Smith and Mrs. Mary A. Whiting,
the widow of William S. Whiting. 

The company's Capital Stock had been increased to 40,000 shares and the
shares had no par value. Probably, on account of the company being in dire
financial straits, it was forced to borrow $390,000.00 from the 1st
National Bank of Boston. 

As respects the directors of 1931 there were 2 changes - Bigelow was no
longer a director and Devereux had died on June 13, 1931 in Northhampton,
Massachusetts at age 74. 

At a meeting of the directors on March 11, 1932 the directors C.L. Stevens, 
E.M. Hill, Mary A. Whiting,  A.H. Tomes, and  X.M. Audibert voted 
to increase of Capital Stock by another 45,000 shares. Previously, the total 
stood at 55,000 shares. "26,371 shares, being at a majority, approved the
increase." 
Of the 55,000 shares 15,000 shares were intended to be used for the
conveyance of the Harrison Avenue property to the Whiting - Adams Co. (It had 
been in a family trust.) 20,000 were to be used for payment to The Stevens
Corp. pursuant to the terms and conditions of a management contract which
would become effective February 1, 1932. And 20,000 shares were to be made
available to the stockholders of record as of March 11, 1932. Such a sale
was to be one on a proportional basis at $200.00 per share and the option
must be exercised within 2 months. 

In the 1931 Directory Arthur H. Weed was a director of Whiting - Adams
as well as a director of Ayer - Houston Corp. and of Merrimac Hat Corp.

Weed had been associated with the Reed - Prentice Corp. as its
president in the years 1922 - 1917 and in 1931 C.L. Steven was the president of
Reed-Prentice while Weed was one of its directors. 
Weed was also a director of Devon Mfg. Co. as was Stevens, who was its
president in the 1930's.

The 1932 Directory showed the following for Whiting - Adams:
   C.L. Stevens, president (office at 75 State
Street in Boston) and

   Edward M. Hill, treasurer and secretary. 
The other directors were Alexander H. Tomes, X.M. Audibert, and
Mrs. Mary A. Whiting, all of whom were from New York.

In September of 1932 the Whiting trustees agreed to transfer the
Harrison Avenue property to the Whiting - Adams Co. as the the bankk was
demanding more surity for its loan. (The original loan amount had now been
reduced to $330,000.00.) At the same time the Whiting trust lent to the
brush company $210,000.00 which was to be paid back over a 5 year period. 

The trustees were Charles A. Sawin, Tomes, and Audibert.

In 1933 there were no changes regarding the officers and directors.
It was noted that the Capital Stock stood at 55,000 shares.

At this same time the New York City directory showed that Stevens had
an office in New York with his representative being Louis C. Farley. 

In 1935 there were no changes.

In 1936 the following were the officers and directors:
   C.L Stevens, president; 
   Arthur W. Leavitt, vice-president and general
manager; and
   Edward M. Hill, treasurer and secretary.
The directors were Mrs. M.A. Whiting, A.H. Tomes, and X.M. Audibert, 
all of whom were from New York.

The 1935 and 1936 editions of the city directory had Stevens living in
New York.

According to the 1937 Directory the position of president was vacant. 
However, the president may have Leavitt in 1937 and in 1938. (In 1938
Stevens was in Baltimore.)

Thus the Stevens has certainly come to an end. Further evidence was
seen in the 1939 Directory. 
   X.M. Audibert, president, and
   Edward M. Hill, treasurer and secretary. 
The directors were Mrs. Mary A. Whiting and Alexander H. Tomes.

Highlighting the severity the company's financial plight was that even
though the
Capital Stock was valued at $2,040,000.00, there was Surplus Deficit of 
$1,266,955.00. 

In a letter to the Commonwealth's Corporations Department Edward M. Hill, 
treasurer, stated that at a meeting of the stockholders on January 28, 1939 
the directors gave their assent to a new business which would be known as 
Whiting - Adams Company, Inc. Also, on the same date the directors
changed the corporate names to the Marten Corporation.

The directors of the Marten Corp. were 
   Irving L. Redfield, president
   Edward M. Hill, 
   Roger C. Damon (an Assistant Cashier at the 1st
National Bank), 
   Eugene T. Connolly (an attorney with the firm of
Herrick, Smith, Donald & Farley), and 
   Charles J. Winkler (an attorney with the firm of 
Bingham, Dana & Gould).

It would seem that the Marten Corp. was created as a vehicle to pave
the way for the disposition of the assets of the brush company with the
bank and other possible creditors in control. 

"The Star Brush Manufacturing Co. of Long Island City, New York
and the Whiting - Adams Co. of Boston effected a consolidation of
interests, unifying executive, sales, and production; but will continue
under their individual corporate names."nyt 
All manufacturing of Star Brush was transferred to Boston. (Star Brush 
was started in 1917 and was mainly a producer of inexpensive brushes.)

Alexander Schumann president of Star Brush became the president
of Whiting - Adams and L.R. Schumann became the executive vice-president. 
Retained were E.M. Hill, treasurer, and Charles Darby, vice-president 
of sales.17

On October 30, 1939 the Harrison Avenue property was sold at public
auction for $75,000.00 subject to the terms and conditions of an existing
lease between the Whiting - Adams Co. and Star Brush Manufacturing
Co. dated February 8, 1939. (See 5822.242, et seq. regarding the
foreclosure and sale and 5771.081 regarding the lease.) 

At about the same time of the Whiting acquisition, Star Brush bought the 
business of J.C. Pushee & Sons of Boston (Pushee had been a brushmaker 
in Boston as early as the 1840's and previous to that in Landisburg, New York.)
, further consolidating its position as a major producer of brushes. Their
product mix was such that Pushee made nylon bristle brushes, Whiting - Adams 
made brushes for professional use, and Star Brush continued to produce a line 
of inexpensive brushes. 
In 1943 a student research paper was written by an M.I.T. undergraduate
in which a motion study was conducted using Star Brush's factory as the
subject. The manufacturing process of "heavy-line wall brushes" was
described and it was mentioned that this type of brush was intended for
industrial use and had represented the most important brush in the product
line.

BIRMINGHAM, Alabama -The former Chief Financial Officer for Birmingham-based Adams Produce, which closed and filed for bankruptcy in 2012, pleaded guilty Wednesday to a charge of withholding information about a scheme to defraud the federal government of $481,000 on a fruits and vegetables contract.
John Stephen Alexander, who was CFO for Adams Produce from 2007 until the company closed in April 2012, pleaded guilty during a hearing before U.S. District Court Judge Virginia Hopkins.
Alexander had been charged in a May 2 indictment with one count of conspiracy and 32 counts of aiding and abetting wire fraud. But in a plea agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office, Alexander pleaded guilty to one count of misprision - withholding information on a crime.
In exchange for his plea and cooperation with prosecutors, the U.S. Attorney's Office agreed to drop the charges in the indictment.
"The plea agreement and today's guilty plea evidence Mr. Alexander's acceptance of his responsibility in the sequence of events at Adams Produce Company," Alexander's attorney, Augusta Dowd, stated in a prepared release.
"Mr. Alexander has been fully cooperative with the government's investigation into the wrongdoing at Adams Produce," Dowd stated.
Alexander provided assistance to both the internal investigation and to the government and was one of the first Adams Produce officers to voluntarily meet with the U.S. Attorney's office.
Assistant U.S. Attorney George Martin declined to comment after Wednesday's hearing.
Attorneys for former COO Steven Craig Finberg, who also was indicted earlier this year also were monitoring Wednesday's hearing. The attorneys said that Finberg maintains he is innocent of the charges.
Five other former Adams Produce officials have pleaded guilty to charges and have been sentenced to prison or probation in the investigation in the past year. Four of the men were also ordered by judges to jointly pay $481,000 restitution to the government. Alexander, under his plea agreement, also will be jointly responsible for paying the restitution.
The more than century-old company was counted among Birmingham's oldest and largest. It had expanded to four states by the time the Adams family sold it to groups of investors in 2010. Within two years the company had filed for bankruptcy, had laid off more than 400 employees, and its top executives had come under federal investigation related to an alleged government fraud scheme.
According to the plea agreements the scheme went like this:
Adams Produce had contracts with the Defense Logistics Agency for the Defense Supply Center in Philadelphia to provide fruits and vegetables for use at military bases and schools. The federal government would pay a certain price above what it would cost Adams Produce to get the produce from its suppliers. Adams Produce was required to submit proof of its costs.
According to the indictment and other court documents, certain Adams Produce officers and employees between August 2011 and November 2011 arranged transactions with the Georgia location of T.L.C. (Tom Lange Company), a major nationwide wholesale produce company, to create fraudulent purchase orders reflecting a higher cost to Adams Produce of purchasing fruits and vegetables.
Adams officials then submitted the fraudulent purchase orders to the Defense Logistics Agency as proof of what the produce cost.
On Oct. 26, 2011 Alexander instructed Kirkland and O'Brien - general manager for the Adams Produce distribution center in Pensacola, Fla. - "to gradually end the scheme to defraud - telling them to bring it in for a soft landing - rather than ending it immediately so as to avoid raising red flags and better avoid detection by DLA," according to the indictment.
After the company filed bankruptcy, a lawsuit was filed by Adams Produce shareholders against the accounting firm of Frost Cummings Tidwell Group, which had audited the books of Adams Produce. The suit claims the audit made the company seem healthier that it was, inducing the investment firm to buy a majority stake in the company for $20 million.
A trial in the lawsuit was to begun Sept. 29, but two weeks before it was to have begun attorneys notified U.S. District Judge Madeline Haikala that they had reached a settlement in the case. The judge gave both side until Nov. 14 to file a joint stipulation of dismissal or a joint report updating the court on the status of their settlement.
Note: Alexander's attorney notified the judge at Wednesday's hearing that his middle name is "Stephen." Court documents had misspelled it, she said.
