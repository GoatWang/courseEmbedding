Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati Key Developments

Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati Reports Unaudited Earnings Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017
Apr 25 17
Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati reported unaudited earnings results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter, the company reported total interest income of $344 million against $302 million a year ago. Net interest income was $103 million against $89 million a year ago. Net income was $65 million against $57 million a year ago. Return on average equity was 5.25% against 4.50% a year ago. Return on average assets was 0.26% against 0.20% a year ago. The increase in net income and ROE was primarily the result of higher net interest income, which was mostly driven by higher net spreads earned on LIBOR-indexed assets and the growth in mortgage loans held for portfolio. These benefits were partially offset by higher non-interest losses due to losses on derivatives and hedging activities in 2017 compared to gains in 2016.

The increase in net income and ROE in both comparison periods was primarily the result of higher net interest income and an increase in non-interest income, which included $39 million in gains from the sale of securities during the fourth quarter of 2016. Net interest income was $363 million compared to $327 million a year ago. Return on average assets was 0.25% compared to 0.24% a year ago.
