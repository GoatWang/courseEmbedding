Best brands of solar panels
To find the best brands of solar panels you can use America's most trusterd solar panel comparison and reviews website, SolarReviews.
However, reviews of solar panels can be a bit meaningless because most consumer owners have not had any issues and so whilst solar company reviews are very important when choosing solar installers they are of less use when choosing solar panels.
For more information to help you make an informed decision about this topic, I would recommend this article about buying solar panels.

How much electricity will solar panels produce in California
Solar panels produce different amounts of energy in different locations.
Around the Sacramento area solar panels installed on a south facing 29 degree pitch roof will typically produce:
1,550 kWh per year per 1kw of peak DC (direct current) capacity
For more information about how your location, roof direction and roof tilt affects solar power production use the solar panels calculator and enter your address below.









What rebates, solar tax credits and other solar incentives are available in California
What solar incentives and tax credits are available in California?
The main incentives to install solar in California is the 30% federal solar tax credit and the net metering law.
The upfront utility based incentives from each of the main publically owned utilities are now exhausted for residential customers and almost exhausted for commercial customers.
However, the investment case for buying solar panels for your home has never been stronger because reductions in the price of solar systems has more than compensated for the loss of some upfront rebates.
 

 
Net Metering in California
The California Public Utility Commission voted by a narrow majority of 3 to 2 to extend the ability of residential energy customers in California to be credited with full retail rates for excess solar power that they generate and feed back into the grid at times when the electrical loads in their house are less than their solar production.
Whilst this didn't affect people that had already had installed solar panels on their homes in California it was a massive win for the millions of Californian homeowners who are yet to install the solar panels.
The reason net metering law is so important is that solar systems by their nature produce most power in the middle of the day when most homeowners are at work and using little power.
This is a very generous incentive and should not be taken for granted.
It means you can now install solar panels and sign a contract with your utility (known as a net metering agreement) where the utility guarantees to pay you a retail rate for exported solar power, usually for 10 or 15 years.
Each of the major utilities may offer slightly different net metering contracts but they are similar in nature.
To see more visit www.cpuc.ca.gov/General.aspx?id=3800
 

 
Is a purchase, lease or PPA agreement best?
Generally speaking you will make the largest savings over time if you purchase your solar panels outright yourself (whether you use cash you have at hand or finance secured against your home).
 However this is not always the case.
If you are in a position where you do not have a federal income tax liability then you will not be able to take advantage of the 30% federal solar tax credit.
In this case you may be better off with a third party owned solar lease where the solar company retains the right to this tax credit.
 

 
What is the payback period from installing solar panels in California?
The payback period from installing solar panels in California is usually between 4 and 8 years depending on the size of the system, the brand of solar panels you buy, the amount you were previously paying for power and whether you lease or buy your system.
This represents an excellent low risk investment.
 

 
Why analysis of solar savings and payback periods can be difficult in California
As California has net metering then the value of a solar power system is simply the annual production multiplied by the rate for power.
However, working this out can be difficult for two reasons.
Firstly for people on time of use metering the value power value changes with the time of day that the solar power is generated.
The second issue relates to the tiered rates of power prices.
With most utilities the amount you are charged for power increases as your usage increases.

Smart Load Center™ - Koolbridge Solar




























































Koolbridge Solar
Smart Load Center™
The Smart Load Center™ is a solar and utility energy breaker box or panel box that can automatically select the use of utility power or solar-derived power independently for each of a number of load circuits based on smart algorithms. The automatic selections of power uses a microcontroller to control the dynamic switching of each breaker circuit.
The Smart Load Center™ microcontroller is programmed to achieve a number of important functions:

It maximizes the use of solar power, thereby consuming less utility power and reduces the homeowner’s electric bill.
It keeps the battery sufficiently charged so that there is power available at night or for emergencies when the utility power goes out.
It allows all, except big loads such as HVAC or Hot Tubs, to be useable even during a utility outage.
It provides a glitch-free, zero break changeover, between power sources.

The Smart Load Center™ uses today’s technology to increase efficiencies and decrease energy costs in one of the fastest growing segments of the market –Solar.  We believe that we’ve eliminated any reasons for the homeowner to not pursue a solar solution.

Best brands of solar panels
To find the best brands of solar panels you can use America's most trusterd solar panel comparison and reviews website, SolarReviews.
However, reviews of solar panels can be a bit meaningless because most consumer owners have not had any issues and so whilst solar company reviews are very important when choosing solar installers they are of less use when choosing solar panels.
For more information to help you make an informed decision about this topic, I would recommend this article about buying solar panels.

How much electricity will solar panels produce in California

Around the Sacramento area solar panels installed on a south facing 29 degree pitch roof will typically produce:
1,550 kWh per year per 1kw of peak DC (direct current) capacity
For more information about how your location, roof direction and roof tilt affects solar power production use the solar panels calculator and enter your address below.









What rebates, solar tax credits and other solar incentives are available in California
What solar incentives and tax credits are available in California?
The main incentives to install solar in California is the 30% federal solar tax credit and the net metering law.
The upfront utility based incentives from each of the main publically owned utilities are now exhausted for residential customers and almost exhausted for commercial customers.
However, the investment case for buying solar panels for your home has never been stronger because reductions in the price of solar systems has more than compensated for the loss of some upfront rebates.
 

 
Net Metering in California
The California Public Utility Commission voted by a narrow majority of 3 to 2 to extend the ability of residential energy customers in California to be credited with full retail rates for excess solar power that they generate and feed back into the grid at times when the electrical loads in their house are less than their solar production.
Whilst this didn't affect people that had already had installed solar panels on their homes in California it was a massive win for the millions of Californian homeowners who are yet to install the solar panels.
The reason net metering law is so important is that solar systems by their nature produce most power in the middle of the day when most homeowners are at work and using little power.
This is a very generous incentive and should not be taken for granted.
It means you can now install solar panels and sign a contract with your utility (known as a net metering agreement) where the utility guarantees to pay you a retail rate for exported solar power, usually for 10 or 15 years.
Each of the major utilities may offer slightly different net metering contracts but they are similar in nature.
To see more visit www.cpuc.ca.gov/General.aspx?id=3800
 

 
Is a purchase, lease or PPA agreement best?
Generally speaking you will make the largest savings over time if you purchase your solar panels outright yourself (whether you use cash you have at hand or finance secured against your home).
 However this is not always the case.
If you are in a position where you do not have a federal income tax liability then you will not be able to take advantage of the 30% federal solar tax credit.
In this case you may be better off with a third party owned solar lease where the solar company retains the right to this tax credit.
 

 
What is the payback period from installing solar panels in California?
The payback period from installing solar panels in California is usually between 4 and 8 years depending on the size of the system, the brand of solar panels you buy, the amount you were previously paying for power and whether you lease or buy your system.
This represents an excellent low risk investment.
 

 
Why analysis of solar savings and payback periods can be difficult in California
As California has net metering then the value of a solar power system is simply the annual production multiplied by the rate for power.
However, working this out can be difficult for two reasons.
Firstly for people on time of use metering the value power value changes with the time of day that the solar power is generated.
The second issue relates to the tiered rates of power prices.
With most utilities the amount you are charged for power increases as your usage increases.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:

How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
