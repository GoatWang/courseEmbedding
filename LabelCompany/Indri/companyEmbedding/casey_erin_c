About





They say home is where the heart is.

But what is home? To us, home is more than a roof over your head. It's the community we live in. It's family and friends and a familiar face. It's the memory of simpler times. Home is where we feel most comfortable and where we always feel welcome. It's where we belong and it makes us who we are.





The first Casey's opened in July 1968

The very first Casey's General Store was a converted three-bay garage that opened in Boone, Iowa in July of 1968. At the time, the population of Boone was around 12,468. The Casey's store carried a limited list of products — two kinds of gasoline, common grocery items and 10-cent cups of coffee.





In towns across America

There's a Casey's waiting for you with:


A warm smile.
Some good conversation.
A hot cup of joe.
A fresh donut.


A hot and ready sandwich.
A cold drink.
A famous handmade pizza.
Or whatever you need.







In 1985 famous homemade pizza is introduced.

In Waukee, Iowa, Casey's famous homemade pizza is introduced. And it quickly becomes a favorite in towns all over the Midwest. Now Casey's is the 5th largest pizza chain in the US, and people come from all over to experience Casey's famous pizza. Today, there are over 19 million pizzas made each year, and Casey's is the 4th largest convenience store chain.





Home is where there's a Casey's



A community gathering place
A mom-and-pop shop
A gas station


A pizza parlor
A bakery
A convenience store
