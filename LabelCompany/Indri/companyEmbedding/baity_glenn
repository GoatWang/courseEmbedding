Welcome! 

I’m Glen, and this is my home on the web.
I put it together so I’d have a modest place for the work I’ve done over my 12+ year professional career. More than that, it’s a place I’ll be using to teach myself how to use WordPress more effectively, and to sharpen my CSS skills. I’ll be doing all sorts of tinkering here, so if anything looks…unusual, it’s all part of the learning process.
Feel free to have a look around, and if you’d like to know more, get in touch.
