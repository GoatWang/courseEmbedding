Saving the Lives of Animals in Need
With every purchase, together, we can save animals in need. HomeOur StoryOur StoryHendrick & Co. was founded in 2011 simply to save animals in need. With every shirt, hoodie, bracelet or dog accessory purchased, Hendrick & Co. delivers a $10 donation to save animals. More than 600 rescues, shelters and sanctuaries in the U.S. and Canada have partnered with Hendrick & Co. and to date, Hendrick & Co. has donated more than $1 million. 
"I started Hendrick & Co. for one reason only – to save animals in need. And, it begins with you. Only together can we save those who have been abused, those who need a voice and those who just need love."- David Hendrickson, H&C Founder 
 
Nearly 7 years ago, Hendrick & Co. founder David Hendrickson met a 6-month-old Chihuahua puppy at the local shelter. David soon learned that the puppy had been poisoned via his mother who had ingested household chemicals. William, as he would be called, was not expected to live for long. David adopted William that same day, if only to give him the best last few weeks of his life. Now, William is healthy, happy and the inspiration behind Hendrick & Co.Wanting to help the same shelters and rescues that saved William, David Hendrickson founded Hendrick & Co. in 2011. What began with a simple idea that one rescue tee can save an animal in need has grown into a powerful movement, with hundreds of products, that support more than 600 local animal shelters, rescues and sanctuaries across the nation.

Every product, from rescue tees and tanks to bracelets,totes, dog hoodies and leashes, triggers a $10 donation to save animals and support local animal rescues and shelters.Based in Anaheim, California, Hendrick & Co. is a vehicle that connects local animal nonprofits with people, from all walks of life, who want to join in our sole mission to save animals in need. Through the purchase of human and animal apparel and accessories, Hendrick & Co. has given more than $1 million to save animals, especially those who have fallen victim to severe abuse, neglect, torture and abandonment.Saving animals has never looked so good! Gifts that give back and gifts that save animals is at the heart of what we do.
  David Hendrickson
Born and raised in Northern San Diego, David Hendrickson is the Chief Animal Saver at Hendrick & Co. His love of animals started early in life when, at the age of 7, his family adopted their first rescue dog. A triplet, David and his brothers frequently volunteered at local animal shelters and grew up with 5 rescues that became a part of his family and a way of life. David soon realized the amazing role local animal shelters and rescue programs play on the front lines of saving animals.Inspired by his own rescue dog William, David Hendrickson started Hendrick & Co. with the simple idea that a shirt can save an animal in need. Initially partnering with local nonprofits in Southern California, David has expanded the network of nonprofit partners nationally -- now over 600 strong. He makes frequent trips to schools to

carry the message of saving animals to a younger generation. And, he has been sought after and featured in the likes of the Los Angeles Times, Entrepreneur Magazine, Fast Company, Modern Dog, Rescue Magazine and NBC.On top of overseeing the entire Hendrick & Co. operations and strategy, David continues to design the company's shirts and manage DailyMutt.com, an online news portal aimed at raising awareness of the issues affecting animals wordwide.David lives in Orange County, California with his three rescue dogs, William, Oliver and Tayler.

Comfort Level - Are you comfortable telling the lawyer personal
information? Does the lawyer seem interested in solving your problem? 
Credentials - How long has the lawyer been in practice? Has
the lawyer worked on other cases similar to yours? 
Cost - How are the lawyer's fees structured - hourly or flat
fee? Can the lawyer estimate the cost of your case? 
City - Is the lawyer's office conveniently located?
Not sure what questions to ask a lawyer?Here are a few to get you started:

How long have you been in practice?
How many cases like mine have you handled?
How often do you settle cases out of court?
What are your fees and costs?
What are the next steps?
