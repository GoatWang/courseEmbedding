JPF ENSEMBLE PROTECTOR
JPF SEPARATE ACCOUNT A
 FLEXIBLE PREMIUM VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE POLICY
 JEFFERSON PILOT FINANCIAL INSURANCE COMPANY
One Granite Place, Concord, New Hampshire 03301  Telephone No.: 1-800-258-3648

This Prospectus describes the JPF Ensemble Protector Variable Life Insurance    
Policy ("Ensemble Protector" or "the Policy"), a flexible premium variable life 
insurance policy issued and underwritten by Jefferson Pilot Financial Insurance 
Company ("we" or "JP Financial" or "the Company"). The Policy provides life     
insurance and pays a benefit, as described in this Prospectus, upon the         
Insured's death or surrender of the Policy. The Policy allows flexible premium  
payments, Policy Loans, Withdrawals, and a choice of Death Benefit Options. Your
account values may be invested on either a fixed or variable or combination of  
fixed and variable basis. You may allocate your Net Premiums to JPF Separate    
Account A ("Separate Account A" or the "Separate Account"), and/or the General  
Account, or both Accounts. The Divisions of Separate Account A support the      
benefits provided by the variable portion of the Policy. The Accumulation Value 
allocated to each Division is not guaranteed and will vary with the investment  
performance of the associated Portfolio. Net Premiums allocated to the General  
Account will accumulate at rates of interest we determine; such rates will not  
be less than 3% per year. Your Policy may lapse if the Surrender Value is       
insufficient to pay a Monthly Deduction. For the first five Policy Years,       
however, if you pay the Minimum Annual Premium, your Policy will not lapse,     
regardless of changes in the Surrender Value. The Policy also has a coverage    
protection provision. We will send premium reminder notices for Planned Premiums
and for premiums required to continue the Policy in force. If the Policy lapses,
you may apply to reinstate it.                                                  

The Policy has a free look period during which you may return the Policy. We    
will refund your Premium (See "Right of Policy Examination").                   

This Prospectus also describes the Divisions used to fund the Policy through the
Separate Account. Each Division invests exclusively in one of the following     
Portfolios:

APPENDIX A--ILLUSTRATIONS OF ACCUMULATION VALUES, CASH VALUES AND DEATH BENEFITS  A-1

THIS PROSPECTUS DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN OFFER IN ANY JURISDICTION IN WHICH SUCH  
OFFERING MAY NOT BE LAWFULLY MADE. NO DEALER, SALESMAN OR OTHER PERSON IS       
AUTHORIZED TO GIVE ANY INFORMATION OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS IN CONNECTION    
WITH THIS OFFERING OTHER THAN THOSE CONTAINED IN THIS PROSPECTUS, AND, IF GIVEN 
OR MADE, SUCH OTHER INFORMATION OR REPRESENTATIONS MUST NOT BE RELIED UPON. THE 
PURPOSE OF THIS VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE POLICY IS TO PROVIDE INSURANCE          
PROTECTION. LIFE INSURANCE IS A LONG-TERM INVESTMENT. POLICYOWNERS SHOULD       
CONSIDER THEIR NEED FOR INSURANCE COVERAGE AND THE POLICY'S LONG-TERM INVESTMENT
POTENTIAL. NO CLAIM IS MADE THAT THE POLICY IS ANY WAY SIMILAR OR COMPARABLE TO 
AN INVESTMENT IN A MUTUAL FUND.                                                 
POLICY BENEFITS/RISKS SUMMARY                                                   
-  POLICY BENEFITS                                                              

This summary describes the Policy's important benefits and risks. The sections  
in the prospectus following this summary discuss the Policy's benefits and other
provisions in greater detail. The Definitions Section (pages 11-12 below)       
defines certain words and phrases used in this prospectus.                      

The Policy is a flexible premium variable universal life insurance contract. The
Policy is built around its Accumulation Value, which changes based on the       
investment experience of the Portfolios underlying the Divisions or the amount  
of interest credited to the General Account. Premiums increase Accumulation     
Value. Charges we assess, cash you withdraw and policy loans decrease the       
Policy's Accumulation Value. Your choice of the timing and amount of premiums   
you pay, investment options and your use of partial withdrawal and loan         
privileges will influence the Policy's performance. The choices you make will   
directly impact how long the Policy remains in effect, its tax status and the   
amount of cash available for use. Declines in market value of the Portfolios    
underlying the Divisions, as well as decreases in the Policy's Accumulation     
Value due to charges assessed, cash withdrawals and policy loans may require you
to make additional premium payments in order to keep the Policy in force and/or 
to meet your cash Accumulation Value goals.                                     

-  ISSUANCE AND UNDERWRITING                                                    

We will issue a Policy on the life of a prospective Insured who meets our Age   
and underwriting standards.                                                     

-  DEATH BENEFIT                                                                

P-->N-66th�Page�of�64TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�6th
The primary benefit of your Policy is life insurance coverage. A secondary      
benefit is cash value accumulation. While the Policy is in force, we pay a Death
Benefit to the Beneficiary when the Insured dies and we receive due proof of    
death at our Service Office.                                                    

CHOICE OF DEATH BENEFIT OPTION: At the time you purchase the Policy, you must   
choose between the three available Death Benefit Options. We will reduce the    
amount of any Death Benefit payable by the amounts of any loans, unpaid loan    
interest and withdrawals.                                                       

COVERAGE PROTECTION GUARANTEE: If your total premiums paid (less withdrawals,   
and Policy Debt) exceed the cumulative required coverage protection premiums,   
and the coverage protection guarantee was available at the time you purchased   
your Policy, we guarantee that the Policy will stay in force throughout the     
guarantee period for your Policy, even if the Surrender Value is insufficient to
provide the monthly deduction. The guarantee period varies by Issue Age and may 
not exceed 20 years. The terms and availability of the coverage guarantee differ
in certain states.                                                              

-  ACCESS TO CASH VALUE                                                         

LOANS: You may borrow up to 90% of the Policy's Cash Value at the end of the    
Valuation Period during which we receive the loan request. We will deduct any   
outstanding loan balance and unpaid interest from any Death Benefit proceeds.   

PARTIAL WITHDRAWALS: You may make a written request to withdraw part of your    
Surrender Value. We charge the lesser of $50 or 2% of the withdrawal. A         
withdrawal may have tax consequences.                                           

SURRENDERS: At any time while the Policy is in force and the Insured is living, 
you may make a written request to surrender your Policy. You will receive your  
Policy's Accumulation Value less any applicable Surrender Charge and outstanding
Policy Debt. A surrender may have tax consequences.                             

-  FLEXIBILITY OF PREMIUMS                                                      

After you pay the initial premium, you may pay subsequent premiums at any time  
and in any amount, subject to some restrictions. While there are no scheduled   
premium due dates, we may schedule planned periodic premiums and send you       
billing statements for the amount you select. You may also choose to make       
pre-authorized automatic monthly premium payments. The amount of premium you pay
and the timing of your premium payments will have an impact on how long the     
policy will remain in force and the amount of the Policy's Death Benefit and    
Cash Value.                                                                     

-  "FREE LOOK" PERIOD                                                           

You have the right to examine and cancel your Policy by returning it to our     
Service Office no later than 10 days after you receive it. (Some states allow a 
longer period of time during which a Policy may be returned.) The free look     
period begins when you receive your Policy. We will refund your premium or      
Accumulation Value, as required by state law.                                   

-  OWNERSHIP RIGHTS                                                             

While the Insured is living and the Policy is in force, you, as the owner of the
Policy, may exercise all of the rights and options described in the Policy,     
subject to the terms of any assignment of the Policy. These rights include      
selecting and changing the Beneficiary, naming a successor owner, allocating and
reallocating Accumulation Values among the Divisions and to or from the General 
Account, changing the Specified Amount of the Policy and assigning the Policy.  

-  SEPARATE ACCOUNT                                                             

The Separate Account is an investment account separate from the General Account.
You may direct the Accumulation Value in your Policy to any of the Divisions of 
the Separate Account. Each Division invests in the one of the corresponding     
Portfolios listed on the cover of and described in this prospectus. Accumulation
Values allocated to the Separate Account will vary according to the investment  
performance of the Portfolios in which the Divisions invest. There is no        
guaranteed minimum division cash value.                                         

-  GENERAL ACCOUNT                                                              

You may place all or a portion of your Accumulation Value in the General Account
where it earns a minimum of 3% annual interest. We may declare higher interest  
rates, but are not obligated to do so.                                          

-  TRANSFERS                                                                    

GENERAL: You may transfer Accumulation Value among the Divisions and the General
Account up to 20 times in each Policy Year. You will not be charged for the     
first 12 transfers in a Policy Year. We currently charge $25 for each additional
transfer during a Policy Year. The charge for each transfer in excess of 12 in a
Policy Year is guaranteed not to exceed $50. Special limitations apply to       
transfers from the General Account. We reserve the right to modify transfer     
privileges and charges.                                                         

DOLLAR COST AVERAGING: You may make periodic automatic transfers of specified   
amounts from the Money Market Division or the General Account to any other      
Division or the General Account.                                                

PORTFOLIO REBALANCING: We will automatically readjust the allocation between the
Divisions and the General Account on a quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis at
no additional charge.                                                           

-  SETTLEMENT OPTIONS                                                           

P-->N-67th�Page�of�64TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�7th
There are several ways of receiving the Policy's Death Benefit proceeds other   
than in a lump sum. Proceeds distributed according to a settlement option do not
vary with the investment experience of the Separate Account.                    

-  CASH VALUE                                                                   

Your Policy's Cash Value equals the Accumulation Value (the total amount that   
your Policy provides for investment plus the amount held as collateral for      
Policy Debt) less any Surrender Charge.                                         

-  TAX BENEFITS                                                                 

Under current law you are not taxed on any gain under the Policy until you      
withdraw Accumulation Value from your Policy. The result may be different if the
Policy is owned by other than a natural person or if the current tax laws       
change.                                                                         

-  SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFITS AND RIDERS                                             

We offer several optional insurance benefits and riders that provide            
supplemental benefits under the Policy. There is a charge associated with these 
benefits and riders.                                                            

POLICY RISKS                                                                    
-  INVESTMENT RISK                                                              

If you invest your Accumulation Value in one or more Divisions, you will be     
subject to the risk that investment performance of the Divisions will be        
unfavorable and that the Accumulation Value will decrease. You could lose       
everything you invest and your Policy could lapse without value, unless you pay 
additional premiums. If you allocate premiums to the General Account, then we   
credit your Accumulation Value (in the General Account) with a stated rate of   
interest. You assume the risk that the rate may decrease, although it will never
be lower than a guaranteed minimum of 3% per year.                              

-  SUITABILITY                                                                  

Variable life insurance is designed for long-term financial planning. It is not 
suitable as a vehicle for short-term savings. While the amount of the Surrender 
Charge decreases over time, it may be a substantial portion of or even exceed   
your Accumulation Value less any Policy Debt. Accordingly, you should not       
purchase the Policy if you will need your Surrender Value in a short period of  
time.                                                                           

-  RISK OF LAPSE                                                                

If your monthly charges exceed your Surrender Value, your Policy may enter a    
61-day (in most states) Grace Period and may lapse. When you enter the Grace    
Period, we will notify you that your Policy will lapse (that is, terminate      
without value) if you do not send us payment for the amount stated in the notice
by a specified date. Your Policy generally will not lapse (1) if you make timely
premium payments sufficient to cover the Monthly Deduction; or (2) if you make  
timely payment of the minimum premium amount during the minimum premium period; 
or (3) if you satisfy the coverage protection guarantee test during the coverage
protection guarantee period. Subject to certain conditions you may reinstate a  
lapsed Policy.                                                                  

-  TAX RISKS                                                                    

Under certain circumstances (usually if your premium payments in the first seven
years or less exceed specified limits), your Policy may become a modified       
endowment contract ("MEC"). Under federal tax law, loans, withdrawals and other 
pre-death distributions received from a MEC Policy are includable in gross      
income on an income first basis. Also, if you receive these distributions before
you have attained age 59 1/2, you may be subject to a 10% penalty.              

Existing tax laws that benefit this Policy may change at any time.              

-  WITHDRAWAL AND SURRENDER RISKS                                               

A Surrender Charge applies during the first ten Policy Years after the Policy   
Date and for ten years after each increase in Specified Amount. It is possible  
that you will receive no Surrender Value if you surrender your Policy. You      
should purchase the Policy only if you have the financial ability to keep it in 
force for a substantial period of time. You should not purchase the Policy if   
you intend to surrender all or part of the Surrender Value in the near future.  
We designed the Policy to meet long-term financial goals. The Policy is not     
suitable as a short-term investment.                                            

A partial withdrawal will reduce Surrender Value, Death Benefit and the amount  
of premiums considered paid to meet the coverage protection guarantee premium   
requirement. Partial withdrawals may be subject to a pro rata Surrender Charge  
and a partial withdrawal charge.                                                

A surrender or partial withdrawal may have tax consequences.                    

-  LOAN RISKS                                                                   

Taking a loan from your Policy may increase the risk that your Policy will      
terminate. It will have a permanent effect on the Policy's Surrender Value      
because the Accumulation Value held as security for the loan does not           
participate in the performance of the Divisions. In addition, if you do not pay 
loan interest when it comes due, the accrued interest will be added to the      
amount of the loan and will reduce the Surrender Value of your Policy. Both of  
these consequences may increase your Policy's risk of lapse. A loan will also   

P-->N-68th�Page�of�64TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�8th
reduce the Death Benefit. If your Policy is surrendered or if it lapses with an 
outstanding loan, you may incur adverse tax consequences.                       

PORTFOLIO RISKS                                                                 

Each Division invests in shares of one of the Portfolios. We do not promise that
the Portfolios will meet their investment objectives. Amounts you have allocated
to the Divisions may grow in value, decline in value, or grow less than you     
expect, depending on the investment performance of the Portfolios in which the  
Divisions invest. You bear the investment risk that the Portfolios possibly will
not meet their objectives.                                                      

The type of investments that a Portfolio makes entail specific types of risks. A
comprehensive discussion of the risks of each Portfolio in which the Divisions  
may invest may be found in the Funds' prospectuses. Please refer to the         
prospectuses for the Funds for more information. You should read the            
prospectuses for each of the Funds carefully before investing. If you do not    
have a prospectus for a Portfolio, please contact us at the address or telephone
number provided on the front cover of this prospectus and we will send you a    
copy.

(1) The cost of insurance charge varies based on Attained Age, sex, tobacco     
status, underwriting class of the Insured, and duration of the Policy. We       
determine the current Cost of Insurance charge, but we guarantee we will never  
charge you a higher rate than the guaranteed rate shown in your Policy. We      
calculate a separate Cost of Insurance charge for any increase in the Specified 
Amount, based on the Insured's circumstances at the time of the increase. For   
more information about the calculation of the Cost of Insurance charge, see     
"Cost of Insurance", beginning on page 26.                                      

(2) The rate shown in the table is determined as follows. The acquisition charge
is charged for the first two Policy Years. It is 1% of the Load Basis Amount in 
Policy Years 1 and 2. The Load Basis Amount is a percentage of the Specified    
Amount. The Load Basis Amount varies based on the sex, Issue Age, and rating    
class of the Insured. It does not vary by the amount of premium paid. The       
current maximum Load Basis Amount is $66.65 per thousand dollars of Specified   
Amount. The Load Basis Amount for a 42-year old male, non-tobacco user,         
Preferred Plus rating class is $12.28 per thousand. We calculate a separate     
acquisition charge for any increase in the Specified Amount based on the        
Insured's circumstances at the time of the increase. For more information about 
the acquisition charge, see "Acquisition Charge", beginning on page 26.         

(3) The rates given are effective annual rates.

attributable to the operations of the Separate Account. We reserve the right to 
do so in the future. See "Charges and Fees Assessed Against the Separate Account

Portfolio assets, including management fees, distribution (12b-1) fees,and                     
other expenses), with contractual waivers and expense reimbursements                           

(1) The fees and expenses reflected in this table are expressed as a percentage 
of average net assets for the year ended December 31, 2003 for the Portfolios in
which the Variable Account invests.                                             

The advisers and/or other service providers of certain Portfolios have agreed to
reduce their fees and/or reimburse the Portfolios' expenses to keep the         
Portfolios' expenses below specified limits. The range of expenses in the first 
row above does not include the effect of any fee reduction or expense           
reimbursement arrangement. The range of expenses in the second row above shows  
the effect of contractual fee reduction and expense reimbursement arrangements  
that will remain in effect at least through December 31, 200_. The _____%       
maximum Total Annual Portfolio Operating Expenses, after contractual waivers and
expense reimbursements are taken into consideration, is for three Portfolios,   
and the expense limits are terminable after December 31, 200_. These            
arrangements are described in more detail in the Expense table and footnotes on 
the following page and in the relevant Portfolios' prospectuses. Other          
Portfolios have voluntary fee reduction and/or expense reimbursement            
arrangements that may be terminated at any time, and which are not reflected in 
the above chart. Taking these arrangements into consideration, the maximum and  
minimum Total Annual Portfolio Operating Expenses were _____% and 0.__%,        
respectively. Each fee reduction and expense reimbursement arrangement is       
described in the notes to the table below and the relevant Portfolio's          
prospectus.                                                                     

The Portfolios' expenses are assessed at the Portfolio level and are not direct 
charges against the Divisions or the Policy's Accumulated Value. These expenses 
are taken into account in computing each Portfolio's per share net asset value, 
which in turn is used to compute the corresponding Division's Accumulation Unit 
Value.                                                                          

Each Division purchases shares of the corresponding Portfolio at net asset      
value. The net asset value reflects the investment advisory fees and other      
expenses that are deducted from the assets of the Portfolio. The advisory fees  
and other expenses are not fixed or specified under the terms of the Policy and 
they may vary from year to year.                                                

The figures in the following table show expense ratios for the individual       
Portfolios for the year ended December 31, 2002, except where otherwise noted.  
The expense of certain Portfolios reflect contractual fee reductions and expense
reimbursement, as indicated in their prospectuses.

Note: The Portfolio expense information was provided by the Portfolios and has  
not been independently verified by us. See the prospectuses or statements of    
additional information of the Portfolios for further details. Certain of the    
Portfolios' advisers reimburse the Company for administrative costs incurred in 
connection with administering the Portfolios as variable funding options under  
the Policies. Such reimbursement is consistent with the services we provide or  
the cost savings resulting from the arrangement and therefore may differ among  
Portfolios. Such reimbursement typically is calculated as a percentage of the   
Separate Account assets invested in the relevant Portfolio and generally may    
range up to .25% annually of net assets. The reimbursements, which generally are
paid by the advisers and are not charged to owners, are separate from the       
expenses of the Portfolio. We receive 12b-1 fees or service fees directly from  
some of the Portfolios for providing certain services primarily intended to     
assist in the account servicing of the Portfolios' shares held by corresponding 
Divisions.

THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT 

The Separate Account underlying the Policy is JPF Separate Account A. Net       
premiums and Accumulation Values allocated to the Separate Account are invested 
in the Portfolios. Each Portfolio is a series of an open-end management         
investment company whose shares are purchased by the Separate Account to fund   
the benefits provided by the Policy. The Portfolios, including their investment 
objectives and their investment advisers, are described in this Prospectus.     
Complete descriptions of the Portfolios' investment objectives and restrictions 
and other material information relating to the Portfolios are contained in the  
Funds' prospectuses, which are delivered with this Prospectus.                  

Separate Account A was established under New Hampshire law on August 20, 1984   
and is now governed by the laws of the State of Nebraska as a result of the     
Company's redomestication to Nebraska on June 12, 2000. Under Nebraska Insurance
Law, the income, gains or losses of the Separate Account are credited without   
regard to the other income, gains or losses of the Company. These assets are    
held for our variable life insurance policies and variable annuities. Any and   
all distributions made by the Portfolios with respect to shares held by the     
Separate Account will be reinvested in additional shares at net asset value.    

The assets maintained in the Separate Account will not be charged with any      
liabilities arising out of any other business we conduct. We are, however,      
responsible for meeting the obligations of the Policy to the Policyowner.       

No stock certificates are issued to the Separate Account for shares of the      
Portfolios held in the Separate Account. Ownership of Portfolio shares is       
documented on the books and records of the Portfolios and of the Company for the
Separate Account.                                                               

The Separate Account is registered with the SEC as a unit investment trust under
the Investment Company Act of 1940 and meets the definition of separate account 
under the federal securities laws. Such registration does not involve any       
approval or disapproval by the Commission of the Separate Account or our        
management or investment practices or policies. We do not guarantee the Separate
Account's investment performance.                                               

DIVISIONS. The Policies presently offer thirty-___ Divisions but may add or     
delete Divisions. We reserve the right to limit the number of Divisions in which
you may invest over the life of the Policy. Each Division will invest           
exclusively in shares of a single Portfolio.                                    

INVESTMENT AND FIXED ACCOUNT OPTIONS                                            

You may allocate all or a part of your Net Premiums and Accumulation Value to   
the Divisions currently available under your Policy to the General Account.     

SELECTING INVESTMENT OPTIONS                                                    

-  CHOOSE OPTIONS APPROPRIATE FOR YOU. Your sales representative can help you   
evaluate which investment options may be appropriate for your financial   
goals.                                                                    

-  UNDERSTAND THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE OPTIONS YOU CHOOSE. Some Divisions  
 invest in Portfolios that are considered more risky than others. Portfolios
with additional risks are expected to have values that rise and fall more 
rapidly and to a greater degree than other Portfolios. For example,       
Portfolios investing in foreign or international securities are subject to
risks not associated with domestic investments, and their investment      
   performance may vary accordingly. Also, Portfolios using derivatives in their
investment strategy may be subject to additional risks.                   

-  BE INFORMED. Read this prospectus and the Portfolio prospectuses before      
choosing your investment options.

An investment in the JPVF Money Market Portfolio is neither insured nor         
guaranteed by the U.S. Government or the FDIC or any other agency.              

Some of the above Portfolios may use instruments known as derivatives as part of
their investment strategies, as described in their respective prospectuses. The 
use of certain derivatives such as inverse floaters and principal on debt       
instruments may involve higher risk of volatility to a Portfolio. The use of    
leverage in connection with derivatives can also increase risk of losses. See   
the prospectus for the Portfolio for a discussion of the risks associated with  
an investment in those Portfolios. You should refer to the accompanying         
prospectuses of the Portfolios for more complete information about their        
investment policies and restrictions.                                           

Some of the Portfolios are managed by investment advisers who also manage       
publicly offered mutual funds having similar names and investment objectives.   
While some of the Portfolios may in some ways resemble, and may in fact be      
modeled after publicly offered mutual funds, you should understand that the     
Portfolios are not otherwise directly related to any publicly offered mutual    
fund. Consequently, the investment performance of publicly offered mutual funds 
and any similarly named Portfolio may differ substantially.                     

We automatically reinvest all dividends and capital gains distributions from the
Portfolios in shares of the distributing Portfolio at their net asset value. The
income and realized and unrealized gains or losses on the assets of each        
Division are separate and are credited to or charged against the particular     
Division without regard to income, gains or losses from any other Division or   
from any other part of our business. We will use the net premiums you allocate  
to a Division to purchase shares in the corresponding Portfolio and will redeem 
shares in the Portfolios to meet Policy obligations or make adjustments in      
reserves. The Portfolios are required to redeem their shares at net asset value 
and to make payment within seven days.                                          

-  MIXED AND SHARED FUNDING; CONFLICTS OF INTEREST                              

Shares of the Portfolios are available to insurance company separate accounts   
which fund variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies,     
including the Policy described in this Prospectus. Because Portfolio shares are 
offered to separate accounts of both affiliated and unaffiliated insurance      
companies, it is conceivable that, in the future, it may not be advantageous for
variable life insurance separate accounts and variable annuity separate accounts
to invest in these Portfolios simultaneously, since the interests of such       
Policyowners or contractholders may differ. Although neither the Company nor the
Funds currently foresees any such disadvantages either to variable life         
insurance or to variable annuity Policyowners, each Fund's Board of             
Trustees/Directors has agreed to monitor events in order to identify any        
material irreconcilable conflicts which may possibly arise and to determine what
action, if any, should be taken in response thereto. If such a conflict were to 
occur, one of the separate accounts might withdraw its investment in a          
Portfolio. This might force that Portfolio to sell portfolio securities at      
disadvantageous prices. Policy owners will not bear the attendant expense.      

-  FUND ADDITIONS, DELETIONS OR SUBSTITUTIONS                                   

We reserve the right, subject to compliance with appropriate state and federal  
laws, to add, delete or substitute shares of another Portfolio or Fund for      
Portfolio shares already purchased or to be purchased in the future for the     
Division in connection with the Policy. We may substitute shares of one         
Portfolio for shares of another Portfolio if, among other things, (a) it is     
determined that a Portfolio no longer suits the purpose of the Policy due to a  
change in its investment objectives or restrictions; (b) the shares of a        
Portfolio are no longer available for investment; or (c) in our view, it has    
become inappropriate to continue investing in the shares of the Portfolio.      
Substitution may be made with respect to both existing investments and the      
investment of any future premium payments. However, no substitution, addition or
deletion of securities will be made without prior notice to Policyowners, and   
without such prior approval of the SEC or other regulatory authorities as may be
necessary, all to the extent required and permitted by the Investment Company   
Act of 1940 or other applicable law.                                            

We also reserve the right to make the following changes in the operation of the 
Separate Account and the Divisions;

-  GENERAL ACCOUNT                                                              

Interests in the General Account have not been registered with the SEC in       
reliance upon exemptions under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and the   
General Account has not been registered as an investment company under the 1940 
Act. However, disclosure in this Prospectus regarding the General Account may be
subject to certain generally applicable provisions of the federal securities    
laws relating to the accuracy and completeness of the statements. Disclosure in 
this Prospectus relating to the General Account has not been reviewed by the    
SEC.                                                                            

The General Account is a fixed funding option available under the Policy. We    
guarantee a minimum interest rate of 3.0% on amounts in the General Account and 
assume the risk of investment gain or loss. The investment gain or loss of the  
Separate Account or any of the Portfolios does not affect the General Account   
Value.                                                                          

The General Account is secured by our general assets. Our general assets include
all assets other than those held in separate accounts sponsored by us or our    
affiliates. We will invest the assets of the General Account in those assets we 
choose, as allowed by applicable law. We will allocate investment income of such
General Account assets between ourself and those policies participating in the  
General Account.                                                                

We guarantee that, at any time, the General Account Value of your Policy will   
not be less than the amount of the Net Premiums allocated to the General        
Account, plus any monthly accumulation value adjustment, plus interest at an    
annual rate of not less than 3.0%, less the amount of any withdrawals, Policy   
Loans or Monthly Deductions, plus interest at an annual rate of not less than   
3.0%.                                                                           

If you do not accept the Policy issued as applied for or you exercise your "free
look" option, no interest will be credited and we will retain any interest      
earned on the initial Net Premium.                                              

POLICY CHOICES                                                                  
-  GENERAL                                                                      

The Policy is designed to provide the Insured with lifetime insurance protection
and to provide you with flexibility in amount and frequency of premium payments 
and level of life insurance proceeds payable under the Policy. It provides life 
insurance coverage on the Insured with a Death Benefit payable on the Insured's 
death. You are not required to pay scheduled premiums to keep the Policy in     
force and you may, subject to certain limitations, vary the frequency and amount
of premium payments.                                                            

To purchase a Policy, you must complete an application and submit it to us      
through the agent selling the Policy. You must furnish satisfactory evidence of 
insurability. The Insured under the Policy must generally be under age 85 at the
time the application for the Policy is submitted. For ages 15 and over, the     
Insured's tobacco status is reflected in the current cost of insurance rates.   
Policies issued in certain States will not directly reflect the Insured's sex in
either the premium rates or the charges or values under the Policy. We may      
reject an application for any reason.                                           

The minimum Specified Amount at issue is $100,000. We reserve the right to      
revise our rules to specify different minimum Specified Amounts at issue. We may
reinsure all or a portion of the Policy.                                        

-  PREMIUM PAYMENTS                                                             

The Policy is a flexible premium life insurance policy. This means that you may 
decide when to make premium payments and in what amounts. You must pay your     
premiums to us at our Service Office or through one of our authorized agents for
forwarding to us. There is no fixed schedule of premium payments on the Policy  
either as to amount or frequency. You may determine, within certain limits, your
own premium payment schedule. We will not bill premium payments for less than   
$250, nor more frequently than quarterly, semi-annually or annually. ($50 for   
electronic fund transfers).                                                     

If you pay the Minimum Annual Premium during the minimum premium period, we     
guarantee that the Policy will stay in force throughout the minimum premium     
period, even if the Surrender Value is insufficient to pay a Monthly Deduction. 
The minimum premium period is five years. The minimum initial premium will equal
the Minimum Annual Premium, divided by 6.                                       

COVERAGE PROTECTION GUARANTEE???                                                

We may require evidence of insurability if payment of a premium will result in  
an immediate increase in the difference between the Death Benefit and the       
Accumulation Value.                                                             

In order to help you obtain the insurance benefits you desire, we will state a  
Planned Periodic Premium and Premium Frequency in the Policy. This premium will 
generally be based on your insurance needs and financial abilities, the         
Specified Amount of the Policy and the Insured's age, sex and risk class. You   
are not required to pay Planned Periodic Premiums. If you do not pay a Planned  
Periodic Premium, your Policy will not lapse, so long as the Policy's Surrender 
Value is sufficient to pay the Monthly Deduction. Payment of the Planned        
Periodic Premiums will not guarantee that your Policy will remain in force. (See
"Grace Period")                                                                 

-  MODIFIED ENDOWMENT CONTRACT                                                  

The Policy will be allowed to become a MEC under the Code only with your        
consent. If you pay a premium that would cause your Policy to be deemed a MEC   
and you do not consent to MEC status for your Policy, we will either refund the 
excess premium to you or, if the excess premium exceeds $250, offer you the     
alternative of instructing us to hold the excess premium in a premium deposit   
fund                                                                            

P-->N-620th�Page�of�64TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�20th
and apply it to the Policy later in accordance with your instructions. We will  
credit interest at an annual rate that we may declare from time to time on      
advance premium deposit funds.                                                  

If the excess premium had been applied to your Policy before we notify you, we  
will adjust your Policy Value as though the excess premium had not been applied 
to your Policy and offer to refund the excess premium plus interest credited at 
a rate equal to the annual rate credited to the advance premium deposit fund. If
you instruct us to hold that amount, we will apply it to a premium deposit fund 
and thereafter credit interest as described above.                              

We will pay any refund no later than 60 days after the end of the relevant      
Policy Year, in accordance with the requirements of the Code. We may also notify
you of other options available to you to keep the Policy in compliance          

-  COMPLIANCE WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE                                    

The Policy is intended to qualify as a "contract of life insurance" under the   
Code. The Death Benefit provided by the Policy is intended to qualify for       
exclusion from federal income taxation. If at any time you pay a premium that   
would exceed the amount allowable for such qualification, we will either refund 
the excess premium to you or, if the excess premium exceeds $250, offer you the 
alternative of instructing us to hold the excess premium in a premium deposit   
fund and apply it to the Policy later in accordance with your instructions. We  
will credit interest at an annual rate that we may declare from time to time on 
advance premium deposit funds.                                                  

If the excess premium had been applied to your Policy before we notify you, we  
will adjust your Policy Value as though the excess premium had not been applied 
to your Policy and offer to refund the excess premium plus interest credited at 
a rate equal to the annual rate credited to the advance peremium deposit fund.  
If you instruct us to hold that amount, we will apply it to a premium deposit   
fund and thereafter credit interest as described above                          

We will pay any refund no later than 60 days after the end of the relevant      
Policy Year, in accordance with the requirments of the Code.                    

We also reserve the right to refuse to make any change in the Specified Amount  
or the Death Benefit Option or any other change if such change would cause the  
Policy to fail to qualify as life insurance under the Code.                     

-  BACKDATING                                                                   

Under limited circumstances, we may backdate a Policy, upon request, by         
assigning a Policy Date earlier than the date the application is signed but no  
earlier than six months prior to approval of the Policy in the state where the  
Policy is issued. Backdating may be desirable so that you can purchase a        
particular Specified Amount for a lower cost of insurance rate based on a       
younger Insured age. For a backdated Policy, we will assess Policy fees and     
charges from the Policy Date even though you did not have coverage under the    
Policy until the Policy's Issue Date. Backdating of your Policy will not affect 
the date on which your premium payments are credited to the Separate Account.   

ALLOCATION OF PREMIUMS                                                          

We will allocate premium payments, net of the premium tax charge, Federal income
tax charge and Premium Load, plus interest earned prior to the Allocation Date, 
among the General Account and the Divisions in accordance with your directions  
to us. The minimum percentage of any net premium payment allocated to any       
division or the General Account is 5%. Allocation percentages must be in whole  
numbers only. Your initial premium (including any interest) will be allocated,  
as you instructed, on the Allocation Date. Your subsequent premiums will be     
allocated as of the date they are received in our Service Office. Prior to the  
Allocation Date, the initial Net Premium, and any other premiums received, will 
be allocated to the General Account. (See "Right of Policy Examination")        

You may change your premium allocation instructions at any time. Your request   
may be written, by telephone or via the internet, so long as the proper         
telephone authorization is on file with us. Allocations must be changed in whole
percentages. The change will be effective as of the date of the next premium    
payment after you notify us. We will send you confirmation of the change. (See  
"Transfers and Allocations to Funding Options")                                 

-  DEATH BENEFIT OPTIONS                                                        

At the time of purchase, you must choose between the available Death Benefit    
Options. The amount payable upon the Death of the Insured depends upon which    
Death Benefit Option you choose.                                                

OPTION I: The Death Benefit will be the greater of (i) the current Specified    
Amount or (ii) the Accumulation Value on the death of the Insured multiplied by 
the corridor percentage, as described below.                                    

OPTION II: The Death Benefit equals the greater of (i) the current Specified    
Amount plus the Accumulation Value on the death of the Insured or (ii) the      
Accumulation Value on the date of death multiplied by the corridor percentage,  
as described below.                                                             

OPTION III: The Death Benefit equals the greater of (i) the current Specified   
Amount plus the total premiums paid less any withdrawals to the date of death or
(ii) the Accumulation Value multiplied by the corridor percentage as described  
below. If the total of the withdrawals exceeds the premiums paid then the Death 
Benefit will be less than the Specified Amount.                                 

The corridor percentage is used to determine a minimum ratio of Death Benefit to
Accumulation Value. This is required to qualify the Policy as life insurance    
under the Code.                                                                 

DEATH BENEFIT QUALIFICATION TEST                                                

P-->N-621st�Page�of�64TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�21st
You will also choose between the two Death Benefit qualification tests, the cash
value accumulation test and the guideline premium test. Once you have made your 
choice, the Death Benefit qualification test cannot be changed.                 

The guideline premium test limits the amount of premium payable for an Insured  
of a particular age and sex. It also applies a prescribed corridor percentage to
determine a minimum ratio of Death Benefit to Accumulation Value.               

Following are the Corridor Percentages under the Guideline Premium Test:        

CORRIDOR PERCENTAGES
 (ATTAINED AGE OF THE INSURED AT THE
 BEGINNING OF THE CONTRACT YEAR)

                                                                [Download Table]

AGE   %      AGE    %      AGE    %      AGE     %    
                                                      
0-40   250%     50   185%     60   130%     70    115%
41     243      51   178      61   128      71    113 
42     236      52   171      62   126      72    111 
43     229      53   164      63   124      73    109 
44     222      54   157      64   122      74    107 
45     215      55   150      65   120   75-90    105 
46     209      56   146      66   119      91    104 
47     203      57   142      67   118      92    103 
48     197      58   138      68   117      93    102 
49     191      59   134      69   116      94    101 
                                            95+   100 

The cash value accumulation test requires that the Death Benefit be sufficient  
to prevent the Accumulation Value, as defined in Section 7702 of the Code, from 
ever exceeding the net single premium required to fund the future benefits under
the Policy. If the Accumulation Value is ever greater than the net single       
premium at the Insured's age and sex for the proposed Death Benefit, the Death  
Benefit will be automatically increased by multiplying the Accumulation Value by
a corridor percentage that is defined as $1000 divided by the net single        
premium.                                                                        

The tests differ as follows:                                                    

(1) the guideline premium test limits the amount of premium that you can pay    
into your Policy; the cash value accumulation test does not.                    

(2) the factors that determine the minimum Death Benefit relative to the        
Policy's Accumulation Value are different. Required increases in the minimum    
Death Benefit due to growth in Accumulation Value will generally be greater     
under the cash value accumulation test.                                         

(3) If you wish to pay more premium than is permitted under the guideline       
premium test, for example to target a funding objective, you should consider the
cash value accumulation test, because it generally permits higher premium       
payments. However, the higher corridor percentage might cause you to pay higher 
cost of insurance charges. Payment of higher premiums could also cause your     
Policy to be deemed a MEC.                                                      

(4) If your primary objective is to maximize the potential for growth in        
Accumulation Value, or to conserve Accumulation Value, generally the guideline  
premium test will better serve this objective. Since the corridor percentages   
are lower, the smaller required Death Benefit generally results in lower cost of
insurance charges.                                                              

You should consult with a qualified tax adviser before choosing the Death       
Benefit Qualification Test.                                                     

The following example demonstrates the Death Benefits under Options I, II and   
III for the cash value accumulation test and the guideline premium test. The    
example shows an Ensemble Protector Policy issued to a male, non-smoker, Age 45,
at the time of calculation of the Death Benefit. The Policy is in its 10th      
Policy Year and there is no outstanding Policy Debt.                            

                                                                [Download Table]

Death Benefit Option III              157,500     140,000 

Under any of the Death Benefit Options, the Death Benefit will be reduced by a  
withdrawal. (See "Withdrawals") The Death Benefit payable under any of the      
Options will also be reduced by the amount necessary to repay the Policy Debt in
full and, if the Policy is within the Grace Period, any payment required to keep
the Policy in force.                                                            

Beginning on the Policy Anniversary nearest the Insured's Attained Age 100, the 
Death Benefit then in effect will remain in effect.

After the Policy has been in force for not less than 12 months and so long as   
you have not reached Age 100, you may, subject to certain restrictions, change  
the Death Benefit selection by sending us a request in writing. If you change   
the Death Benefit Option from Option II to Option I, the Specified Amount will  
be increased by the Policy's Accumulation Value on the effective date of the    
change. If you change the Death Benefit Option from Option I to Option II, the  
Specified Amount will be decreased by the Policy's Accumulation Value on the    
effective date of the change. If you change the Death Benefit Option from Option
III to Option II, the Specified Amount will be increased by the Premiums paid to
the date of the change less any withdrawals and then will be decreased by the   
Accumulation Value in the date of the change. If you change the Death Benefit   
from Option III to Option I, the Specified Amount will be increased by the      
Premiums paid less any withdrawals, to the date of the change. You may not      
change from Options I or II to Option III. If a change would result in an       
immediate increase in the Death Benefit, such change will be subject to evidence
of insurability.                                                                

-  TRANSFERS AND ALLOCATIONS TO FUNDING OPTIONS                                 

You may transfer all or part of the Accumulation Value to any other Division or 
to the General Account at any time. Funds may be transferred between the        
Divisions or from the Divisions to the General Account. We currently permit 12  
transfers per year without imposing any transfer charge. For each transfer over 
12 in any Policy Year, we currently impose a transfer charge of $25 (which      
charge is guaranteed not to exceed $50 per transfer), which we will deduct on a 
pro rata basis from the Division or Divisions or the General Account into which 
the amount is transferred, unless you specify otherwise. We will not impose a   
transfer charge on the transfer of any Net Premium payments received prior to   
the Allocation Date, plus interest earned, from the General Account to the      
Divisions on the Allocation Date, or on loan repayments. We will not impose a   
transfer charge for transfers under the Dollar Cost Averaging or Portfolio      
Rebalancing features. You may currently make up to 20 transfers per Policy Year.
We reserve the right to modify transfer privileges and charges.                 

You may at any time transfer 100% of the Policy's Accumulation Value to the     
General Account and choose to have all future premium payments allocated to the 
General Account. After you do this, the minimum period the Policy will be in    
force will be fixed and guaranteed. The minimum period will depend on the amount
of Accumulation Value, the Specified Amount, the sex, Attained Age and rating   
class of the Insured at the time of transfer. The minimum period will decrease  
if you choose to surrender the Policy or make a withdrawal. The minimum period  
will increase if you choose to decrease the Specified Amount, make additional   
premium payments, or we credit a higher interest rate or charge a lower cost of 
insurance rate than those guaranteed for the General Account.                   

Except for transfers in connection with Dollar Cost Averaging, Automatic        
Portfolio Rebalancing and loan repayments, we allow transfers out of the General
Account to the Divisions only once in every 180 days and limit their amount to  
the lesser of (a) 25% of the Accumulation Value in the General Account not being
held as loan collateral, or (B) $100,000. Any other transfer rules, including   
minimum transfer amounts, also apply. We reserve the right to modify these      
restrictions.                                                                   

We will not impose a transfer charge for a transfer of all Accumulation Value in
the Separate Account to the General Account. A transfer from the General Account
to the Divisions will be subject to the transfer charge unless it is one of the 
first 12 transfers in a Policy Year and except for the transfer of any Net      
Premium payments received prior to the Allocation Date, plus interest earned,   
from the General Account and loan repayments.                                   

We reserve the right to refuse or restrict transfers made by third-party agents 
on behalf of the Policyowner or pursuant to market timing services when we      
determine that such transfers will be detrimental to the Portfolios,            
Policyowners or you. If we refuse or restrict a transfer, we will notify you    
promptly in writing or by telephone.                                            

-  TELEPHONE AND INTERNET TRANSFERS, LOANS AND REALLOCATIONS                    

You, your authorized representative, or a member of his/her administrative staff
may request a transfer of Accumulation Value or reallocation of premiums        
(including allocation changes relating to existing Dollar Cost Averaging and    
Automatic Portfolio Rebalancing programs) either in writing, by telephone or via
the internet. In order to make telephone or internet transfers, you must        
complete the appropriate authorization form and return it to us at our Service  
Office. All transfers must be in accordance with the terms of the Policy. If the
transfer instructions are not in good order, we will not execute the transfer   
and you will be notified. Internet transfers may not always be available.       

We may also permit loans to be made by telephone, provided that your            
authorization form is on file with us. Only you may request loans by telephone. 

We will use reasonable procedures, such as requiring identifying information    
from callers, recording telephone instructions, and providing written           
confirmation of transactions, in order to confirm that instructions are genuine.
Any instructions which we reasonably believe to be genuine will be your         
responsibility, including losses arising from any errors in the communication of
instructions. As a result of this procedure, you will bear the risk of loss. If 
we do not use reasonable procedures, as described above, we may be liable for   
losses due to unauthorized instructions.                                        

-  AUTOMATED TRANSFERS (DOLLAR COST AVERAGING AND PORTFOLIO REBALANCING)        

Dollar Cost Averaging describes a system of investing a uniform sum of money at 
regular intervals over an extended period of time. Dollar Cost Averaging is     
based on the economic fact that buying a security with a constant sum of money  
at fixed intervals results in acquiring more units when prices are low and fewer
when prices are high.                                                           

You may establish automated transfers of a specific dollar amount (the "Periodic
Transfer Amount") on a monthly, quarterly or semi-annual basis from the Money   
Market Division or the General Account to any other Division or to the General  
Account. You must have                                                          

P-->N-623rd�Page�of�64TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�23rd
a minimum of $3,000 allocated to either the Money Market Division or the General
Account in order to enroll in the Dollar Cost Averaging program. The minimum    
Periodic Transfer Amount is $250. A minimum of 5% of the Periodic Transfer      
Amount must be transferred to any specified Division. There is no additional    
charge for the program.                                                         

You may elect an Automatic Portfolio Rebalancing feature which provides a method
for reestablishing fixed proportions among your allocations to your Policy's    
investment options on a systematic basis. Under this feature, we will           
automatically readjust the allocation between the Divisions and the General     
Account to the desired allocation, subject to a minimum of 5% per Division or   
General Account, on a quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis. There is no       
additional charge for the program.                                              

You may select Dollar Cost Averaging or Automatic Portfolio Rebalancing when you
apply for your Policy or at any time by submitting a written request to our     
Service Center. Contact us at the address or telephone number on the first page 
of this prospectus for forms or more information. You may stop participation by 
contacting us at our Service Center. You must give us at least 30 days advance  
notice to change any automated transfer instructions that are currently in      
place. We reserve the right to suspend or modify automated transfer privileges  
at anytime.                                                                     

You may not elect Dollar Cost Averaging and Automatic Portfolio Rebalancing at  
the same time. We will make transfers and adjustments pursuant to these features
on the Policy's Monthly Anniversary Date in the month when the transaction is to
take place, or the next succeeding business day if the Monthly Anniversary Date 
falls on a holiday or weekend. We must have an authorization form on file before
either feature may begin. Transfers under these features are not subject to the 
transfer fee and do not count toward the 12 free transfers or the 20 transfer   
maximum currently allowed per year.                                             

Before participating in the Dollar Cost Averaging or Automatic Portfolio        
Rebalancing programs, you should consider the risks involved in switching       
between investment Divisions available under the Policy. Dollar Cost Averaging  
requires regular investments regardless of fluctuating price levels, and does   
not guarantee profits or prevent losses. Automatic Portfolio Rebalancing is     
consistent with maintaining your allocation of investments among market         
segments, although it is accomplished by reducing your Accumulation Value       
allocated to the better performing segments. Therefore, you should carefully    
consider market conditions and each Fund's investment policies and related risks
before electing to participate in the Dollar Cost Averaging or Automatic        
Portfolio Rebalancing programs.                                                 

POLICY VALUES                                                                   
-  ACCUMULATION VALUE                                                           

The Accumulation Value of your Policy is determined on a daily basis.           
Accumulation Value is the sum of the values in the Divisions plus the value in  
the General Account. We calculate your Policy's Accumulation Value in the       
Divisions by units and unit values under the Policies. Your Policy's            
Accumulation Value will reflect the investment experience of the Divisions      
investing in the Portfolios, any additional Net Premiums paid, any withdrawals, 
any policy loans, and any charges assessed in connection with the Policy. We do 
not guarantee Accumulation Values in the Separate Account as to dollar amount.  

On the Allocation Date, the Accumulation Value in the Separate Account (the     
"Separate Account Value") equals the initial premium payments, less the premium 
load and the Premium Tax and Federal Income Tax Charges, plus interest earned   
prior to the Allocation Date, and less the Monthly Deduction for the first      
policy month. We will establish the initial number of units credited to the     
Separate Account for your Policy on the Allocation Date. At the end of each     
Valuation Period thereafter, the Accumulation Value in a Division is            

(i) the Accumulation Value in the Division on the preceding Valuation Date      
multiplied by the Net Investment Factor, described below, for the current       
Valuation Period, PLUS                                                          

(ii) any Net Premium we receive during the current Valuation Period which is    
allocated to the Division, PLUS                                                 

(iii) all Accumulation Value transferred to the Division from another Division  
or the General Account during the current Valuation Period, MINUS               

(iv) the Accumulation Value transferred from the Division to another Division or
the General Account and Accumulation Value transferred to secure a Policy Debt  
during the current Valuation Period, MINUS                                      

(v)  all withdrawals from the Division during the current Valuation Period.     

Whenever a Valuation Period includes the Monthly Anniversary Date, the Separate 
Account Value at the end of such period is reduced by the portion of the Monthly
Deduction.                                                                      

See "Policy Loans" for a description of Type B loans.                           

-  UNIT VALUES                                                                  

We credit Units to you upon allocation of Net Premiums to a Division. Each Net  
Premium payment you allocate to a Division will increase the number of units in 
that Division. We credit both full and fractional units. We determine the number
of units and fractional units by dividing the Net Premium payment by the unit   
value of the Division to which you have allocated the payment. We determine each
Division's unit value on each Valuation Date. The number of units credited to   
your Policy will not change because of subsequent changes in unit value. The    
number is increased by subsequent contributions or transfers allocated to a     
Division, and decreased by                                                      

P-->N-624th�Page�of�64TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�24th
charges and withdrawals from that Division. The dollar value of each Division's 
units will vary depending on the investment performance of the corresponding    
Portfolio, as well as any expenses charged directly to the Separate Account.    

The initial Unit Value of each Division's units was $10.00. Thereafter, the Unit
Value of a Division on any Valuation Date is calculated by multiplying the      
Division's Unit Value on the previous Valuation Date by the Net Investment      
Factor for the Valuation Period then ended.                                     

-  NET INVESTMENT FACTOR                                                        

The Net Investment Factor measures each Division's investment experience and is 
used to determine changes in Unit Value from one Valuation Period to the next.  
We calculate the Net Investment Factor by dividing (1) by (2) and subtracting   
(3) from the result, where:                                                     

(1) is the sum of:                                                              

(a) the Net Asset Value of a Portfolio share held in the Separate Account for   
that Division determined at the end of the current Valuation Period; plus       

(b) the per share amount of any dividend or capital gain distributions made for 
Portfolio shares held in the Separate Account for that Division if the          
ex-dividend date occurs during the Valuation Period;                            

(2) is the Net Asset Value of a Portfolio share held in the Separate Account for
that Division determined as of the end of the preceding Valuation Period; and   

(3) is the daily charge representing the Mortality & Expense Risk Charge. This  
charge is equal, on an annual basis, to a percentage of the average daily Net   
Asset Value of Portfolio shares held in the Separate Account for that Division. 

Because the Net Investment Factor may be greater than, less than or equal to 1, 
values in a Division may increase or decrease from Valuation Period to Valuation
Period.                                                                         

The General Account Value reflects amounts allocated to the General Account     
through payment of premiums or transfers from the Separate Account, plus        
interest credited to those amounts. Amounts allocated to the General Account,   
and interest thereon, are guaranteed; however there is no assurance that the    
Separate Account Value of the Policy will equal or exceed the Net Premiums paid 
and allocated to the Separate Account.                                          

You will be advised at least annually as to the number of Units which remain    
credited to the Policy, the current Unit Values, the Separate Account Value, the
General Account Value, and the Accumulation Value.                              

-  SURRENDER VALUE                                                              

The Surrender Value of the Policy is the amount you can receive in cash by      
surrendering the Policy. The Surrender Value will equal (a) the Accumulation    
Value on the date of surrender; less (b) the Surrender Charge; less (c) the     
Policy Debt. (See "Charges Deducted Upon Surrender.")                           

CHARGES & FEES                                                                  
-  CHARGES & FEES ASSESSED AGAINST PREMIUM                                      
PREMIUM CHARGES                                                                 

Before a premium is allocated to any of the Divisions of Separate Account A and 
the General Account, we will deduct the following fees and charges:             

-  a premium tax charge of 2.5% unless otherwise required by state law (1.0% Tax
Charge Back rate in Oregon and 2.35% in California. In Puerto Rico, no premium  
tax charge is assessed). - a federal income tax charge of 1.25% ("Federal Income
Tax Charge") which reimburses us for our increased federal tax liability under  
the federal tax laws.                                                           

-  a Premium Load, which is guaranteed not to exceed 3% of premium in all Policy
Years (in Puerto Rico 5.5% for the first 10 Policy Years, 2.5% after Policy Year
10), which reimburses us for a portion of our distribution expenses.            

The premium charges are also applied to premiums received pursuant to           
replacements or exchanges under Section 1035 of the Code.                       

The premium tax charge reimburses us for taxes and other assessments we pay to  
states and municipalities in which the Policy is sold and represents an         
approximate average of actual taxes we pay. The amount of tax assessed by a     
state or municipality may be more or less than the charge. We may impose the    
premium tax charge in states which do not themselves impose a premium tax. State
premium tax rates vary from 0% to 4%. The current North Carolina premium tax    
rate is 1.9%. Subject to state law, we reserve the right to increase these tax  
charges due to changes in the state or federal tax laws that increase our tax   
liability.                                                                      

-  CHARGES & FEES ASSESSED AGAINST ACCUMULATION VALUE                           

Charges and fees assessed against the Policy's Accumulation Value can be        
deducted from any one of the Divisions, the General Account, or pro rata from   
each of the Divisions and the General Account. If you do not designate one      
Division, we will deduct the charges pro rata from each of the Divisions and the
General Account.

MONTHLY DEDUCTION                                                               

On each Monthly Anniversary Date and on the Policy Date, we will deduct from the
Policy's Accumulation Value an amount to cover certain expenses associated with 
start-up and maintenance of the Policy, administrative expenses, the Cost of    
Insurance for the Policy and any optional benefits added by rider.              

The Monthly Deduction equals:                                                   

i) the Cost of Insurance for the Policy (as described below), plus              

ii) a Monthly Administrative Fee of $10, plus                                   

iii) a monthly Acquisition Charge during the first two Policy Years equal to 1% 
of the Load Basis Amount per month, plus                                        

iv) a monthly Unit Expense Charge equal to $0.015 per thousand of Specified     
Amount, plus                                                                    

v) the cost of optional benefits provided by rider.                             

vi) a monthly Acquisition Charge during the first 24 months following any       
increase in Specified Amount.                                                   

COST OF INSURANCE. The Cost of Insurance charge is related to our expected      
mortality cost for your basic insurance coverage under the Policy, not including
any supplemental benefit provisions that you may elect through a Policy rider.  

The Cost of Insurance charge equals (i) multiplied by the result of (ii) minus  
(iii) where:                                                                    

i) is the current Cost of Insurance Rate as described in the Policy;            

ii) is the death benefit at the beginning of the policy month divided by        
1.002466 (to arrive at the proper values for the beginning of the month assuming
the guaranteed interest rate of 3%); and                                        

iii) is the Accumulation Value at the beginning of the policy month, prior to   
the monthly deduction for the Cost of Insurance.                                

The current Cost of Insurance Rate is variable and is based on the Insured's    
Issue Age, sex (where permitted by law), rating class, Policy Year and Specified
Amount. Because the Accumulation Value and the Death Benefit of the Policy may  
vary from month to month, the Cost of Insurance charge may also vary on each day
a Monthly Deduction is taken. In addition, you should note that the Cost of     
Insurance charge is related to the difference between the Death Benefit payable 
under the Policy and the Accumulation Value of the Policy. An increase in the   
Accumulation Value or a decrease in the Death Benefit may result in a smaller   
Cost of Insurance charge while a decrease in the Accumulation Value or an       
increase in the Death Benefit may result in a larger cost of insurance charge.  

The Cost of Insurance rate for standard risks will not exceed those based on the
1980 Commissioners Standard Ordinary Mortality Tables Male or Female (1980      
Tables). Substandard risks will have monthly deductions based on Cost of        
Insurance rates which may be higher than those set forth in the 1980 Tables. A  
table of guaranteed maximum Cost of Insurance rates per $1,000 of the Amount at 
Risk will be included in each Policy. We may adjust the monthly Cost of         
Insurance rates from time to time. Adjustments will be on a class basis and will
be based on our estimates for future factors such as mortality experience,      
investment earnings, expenses (including reinsurance costs), taxes and the      
length of time Policies stay in force. Any adjustments will be made on a        
nondiscriminatory basis. The current Cost of Insurance rate will not exceed the 
applicable maximum Cost of Insurance rate shown in your Policy.                 

MONTHLY ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE CHARGE. The Monthly Deduction amount also        
includes a monthly administration fee of $10.00. This fee may not be increased. 

UNIT EXPENSE CHARGE. We will deduct a onthly Unit Expense Charge equal to $.015 
per $1000 of Specified Amount in Policy Years 1 through 10 ($.18 per $10000) on 
a current assumption basis. The Unit Expense Charge is guaranteed not to exceed 
$.015 per $1000 of Specified Amount in all Policy Years.                        

ACQUISITION CHARGE. We will deduct from the Accumulation Value a monthly        
acquisition charge equal to 1% of the Load Basis Amount in the first and second 
Policy Years. The Load Basis Amount is an amount per $1000 of Specified Amount, 
which varies by sex, Issue Age and rating class of the Insured. The maximum load
Basis Amount is $66.65, resulting in a maximum Acquisition Charge of $0.67 per  
month per $1000 of Specified Amount. This charge does not vary with the amount  
of premium paid. We reserve the right to increase or decrease this charge for   
policies not yet issued in order to correspond with changes in distribution     
costs of the Policy. The charge compensates us for the cost of selling the      
Policy, including, among other things, agents' commissions, advertising and     
printing of prospectuses and sales literature. Normally this charge, plus the   
Premium Load and the Surrender Charge, discussed below, compensate us for total 
sales expenses for the year.                                                    

To the extent sales expenses in any Policy Year are not recovered by the        
Acquisition Charges, the Unit Expense Charge, the Premium Load and the Surrender
Charges we collect, we may recover sales expenses from other sources, including 
profits from the Mortality and Expense Risk Charges.                            

CHARGES FOR OPTIONAL BENEFITS. If you elect any optional benefits by adding     
riders to the Policy, an optional benefits charge will be included in the       
Monthly Deduction amount. The amount of the charge will vary depending upon the 
actual optional benefits selected and is described on each applicable Policy    
rider.

We will assess a charge on a daily basis against each Division at a current     
annual rate of 0.60% in Policy Years 1 through 15 and 0.10% in Policy Years 16  
and later of the value of the Divisions to compensate us for mortality and      
expense risks we assume in connection with the Policy. We reserve the right to  
increase this charge, but guarantee that it will not exceed 0.85% in Policy     
Years 1 through 15 and 0.60% in Policy Years 16 and thereafter. The mortality   
risk we assume is that Insureds, as a group, may live for a shorter period of   
time than estimated and that we will, therefore, pay a Death Benefit before     
collecting a sufficient Cost of Insurance charge. The expense risk assumed is   
that expenses incurred in issuing and administering the Policies and operating  
the Separate Account will be greater than the administrative charges assessed   
for such expenses.                                                              

The Separate Account is not subject to any taxes. However, if taxes are assessed
against the Separate Account, we reserve the right to assess taxes against the  
Separate Account Value.                                                         

ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGE FOR TRANSFERS OR WITHDRAWAL                               

We may impose an Administrative Fee of $25 for each transfer among the Divisions
or the General Account, after the first 12 transfers in a Policy Year (up to a  
maximum of 20). This fee is guaranteed not to exceed $50 per transfer. We will  
also charge an Administrative Fee on withdrawals equal to the lesser of 2% of   
the withdrawal amount or $50.                                                   

-  CHARGES DEDUCTED UPON SURRENDER                                              

If you surrender the Policy, reduce the Specified Amount, or the Policy lapses  
during the first ten Policy Years, we will assess a contingent deferred sales   
charge, which will be deducted from the Policy's Accumulation Value. This charge
is imposed in part to recover distribution expenses and in part to recover      
certain first year administrative costs.                                        

The initial Surrender Charge is the Surrender Charge we would assess if you     
surrendered the Policy on the Issue Date. It equals your Policy's Specified     
Amount times a rate per $1,000 of Specified Amount, which varies based on the   
Issue Age, risk classification and, in most states, sex of the Insured. The     
initial maximum Surrender Charge will be specified in your Policy and will be in
compliance with each state's nonforfeiture law.                                 

For the first five Policy Years, the amount we charge you on surrender will     
equal the initial Surrender Charge. It will then decrease annually, decreasing  
to zero in the eleventh Policy Year. The Surrender Charge in any given Policy   
Year will equal the following percentage of the initial Surrender Charge:       

                                                                [Download Table]

*May be lower at some ages                                            

For example, if your Policy's Specified Amount were $100,000, and the applicable
rate were $_______ per thousand, your initial Surrender Charge would be $1,228  
for a 42 year old male non tobacco user. The Surrender Charge applicable in any 
Policy Year therefore would be as follows:                                      

We will not assess a Surrender Charge after the eleventh Policy Year unless     
there is an increase in Specified Amount.                                       

The Surrender Charge on an increase in Specified Amount is described in         
"Surrender Charges on Increase in Specified Amount" below.                      

The maximum Surrender Charge that we will assess is $51.74 per $1000 of         
specified amount. This is the Surrender Charge on a surrender in the first      
Policy Year for a male non tobacco user, Standard Rating Class, age 71.         

A pro rata portion of any Surrender Charge will be assessed upon withdrawal or  
reduction in the Specified Amount. The Policy's Accumulation Value will be      
reduced by the amount of any withdrawal or from a reduction in Specified Amount 
plus any applicable pro rata Surrender Charge.                                  

-  SURRENDER CHARGES ON SURRENDERS AND WITHDRAWALS                              

All applicable Surrender Charges are imposed on Surrenders.                     

We will impose a partial Surrender Charge on withdrawals. The pro rata Surrender
Charge will equal the amount of the Specified Amount reduction associated with  
the withdrawal divided by the Specified Amount before the reduction times the   
then-current                                                                    

P-->N-627th�Page�of�64TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�27th
Surrender Charge. We will reduce any applicable remaining Surrender Charges by  
the same proportion. A transaction charge equal to the lesser of 2% of the      
withdrawal amount or $50 will be deducted from the amount of each withdrawal.   
(See "Withdrawals") The Surrender Charge does not apply to Policy loans.        

We will also impose a partial Surrender Charge on decreases in Specified Amount.
It will equal the amount of the decrease in Specified Amount divided by the     
Specified Amount before the decrease times the then-current Surrender Charge.   

-  SURRENDER CHARGES ON INCREASES IN SPECIFIED AMOUNT                           

Increases in Specified Amount will be subject to a new Surrender Charge. The    
Surrender Charge on the increase will equal one-half the Surrender Charge we    
would assess if you were purchasing a new Policy, rather than increasing the    
Specified Amount of your existing Policy.                                       

The Surrender Charge on the increase will be determined based on the Insured's  
circumstances at the time of the increase. The Surrender Charge will apply for  
nine years from the effective date of the increase, and will decrease over that 
period just as initial Surrender Charges decrease.                              

OTHER CHARGES                                                                   

We reserve the right to charge the assets of each Division to provide for any   
income taxes or other taxes payable by us on the assets attributable to that    
Division. Although we currently make no charge, we reserve the right to charge  
you an administrative fee, not to exceed $50, to cover the cost of preparing any
additional illustrations of current Cash Values and current mortality           
assumptions which you may request after the Policy Date.                        

POLICY RIGHTS                                                                   
-  SURRENDERS                                                                   

By Written Request, you may surrender or exchange the Policy under Code Section 
1035, for its Surrender Value at any time while the Insured is alive. All       
insurance coverage under the Policy will end on the date of the surrender. All  
or part of the Surrender Value may be applied to one or more of the Settlement  
Options described in this Prospectus or in any manner to which we agree and that
we make available. When we receive your written request in good order, the      
values in the Divisions will be moved into the General Account. If you decide to
keep your Policy, you must send us a letter notifying us of your decision and   
instructing us on how you wish the values to be allocated to the Divisions. (See
"Right to Defer Payment", "Policy Settlement" and "Payment of Benefits".)       

-  WITHDRAWALS                                                                  

By written request, you may, at any time after the expiration of the Free Look  
Period, make withdrawals from the Policy. A charge equal to the lesser of $50 or
2% of the withdrawal will be deducted from the amount of the Cash Value which   
you withdraw. We will also deduct a pro rata Surrender Charge. The minimum      
amount of any withdrawal after the charge is applied is $500. The amount you    
withdraw cannot exceed the Surrender Value.                                     

Withdrawals will generally affect the Policy's Accumulation Value, Cash Value   
and the life insurance proceeds payable under the Policy as follows:            

-  The Policy's Cash Value will be reduced by the amount of the withdrawal plus 
the $50 charge;                                                                 

-  The Policy's Accumulation Value will be reduced by the amount of the         
withdrawal, the $50 charge plus any applicable pro rata Surrender Charge;       

-  The Death Benefit will be reduced by an amount equal to the reduction in     
Accumulation Value.                                                             

The withdrawal will reduce the Policy's values as described in the "Charges     
Deducted Upon Surrender" section.                                               

If the Death Benefit Option for the Policy is Option I, a withdrawal will reduce
the Specified Amount. However, we will not allow a withdrawal if the Specified  
Amount will be reduced below $25,000.                                           

If the Death Benefit Option for the Policy is Option II, a withdrawal will      
reduce the Accumulation Value, usually resulting in a dollar-for-dollar         
reduction in the Death Benefit.                                                 

If the Death Benefit Option for the Policy is Option III, a withdrawal will     
result in a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the Death Benefit.                   

You may allocate a withdrawal among the Divisions and the General Account. If   
you do not make such an allocation, we will allocate the withdrawal among the   
Divisions and the General Account in the same proportion that the Accumulation  
Value in each Division and the General Account, less any Policy Debt, bears to  
the total Accumulation Value of the Policy, less any Policy Debt. ("See Right to
Defer Payment", "Policy Changes" and "Payment of Benefits".)                    

-  GRACE PERIOD                                                                 

Generally, on any Monthly Anniversary Date, if your Policy's Surrender Value is 
insufficient to satisfy the Monthly Deduction, we will allow you 61 days of     
grace for payment of an amount sufficient to continue coverage. We call this    
"lapse pending status". During the first five Policy Years, however, if you have
paid the required cumulative minimum premiums, your Policy will not enter the   
Grace Period regardless of declines in the Surrender Value.                     

P-->N-628th�Page�of�64TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�28th
Written notice will be mailed to your last known address, according to our      
records, not less than 61 days before termination of the Policy. This notice    
will also be mailed to the last known address of any assignee of record.        

The Policy will stay in force during the Grace Period. If the Insured dies      
during the Grace Period, we will reduce the Death Benefit by the amount of any  
Monthly Deduction due and the amount of any outstanding Policy Debt.            

If payment is not made within 61 days after the Monthly Anniversary Date, the   
Policy will terminate without value at the end of the Grace Period.             

-  COVERAGE PROTECTION GUARANTEE                                                

A coverage protection guarantee provision is available at no charge to you. The 
Policy will not enter the Grace Period regardless of declines in the Surrender  
Value so long as cumulative premiums paid less cumulative withdrawals to date,  
less Policy Debt exceed cumulative required coverage protection premiums.       
Consult your Policy for minimum premium requirements and coverage protection    
guarantee periods.                                                              

There is a maximum guarantee period of 20 years. The guarantee period varies by 
Issue Age. The guarantee does not apply in the following situations:            

-  if you have selected Death Benefit Option III;                               

-  if you have selected the Automatic Increase Rider;                           

-  if you change your Death Benefit from Option I to Option II;                 

-  if your Policy lapses and is subsequently reinstated.                        

-  REINSTATEMENT OF A LAPSED OR TERMINATED POLICY                               

If the Policy terminates as provided in its Grace Period provision, you may     
apply to reinstate it. To reinstate the Policy, the following conditions must be
met:                                                                            

-  The Policy has not been fully surrendered.                                   

-  You must apply for reinstatement within 5 years after the date of termination
and before the Insured's Attained Age 100.                                      

-  We must receive evidence of insurability satisfactory to us.                 

-  We must receive a premium payment sufficient to keep the Policy in force for 
the current month plus two additional months.                                   

-  If a loan was outstanding at the time of lapse, we will require that either  
you repay or reinstate the loan.                                                

-  Supplemental Benefits will be reinstated only with our consent. (See "Grace  
Period" and "Premium Payments".)                                                

-  COVERAGE BEYOND INSURED'S ATTAINED AGE 100                                   

At the Insured's Attained Age 100, if the Policy is not in the Grace Period and 
is not in force as a result of the overloan protection endorsement, we will make
several changes to your Policy as follows:                                      

- Your Policy will continue in force for the lifetime of the Insured unless you 
surrender the Policy;                                                           

-  The Death Benefit Option in effect may not be changed;                       

-  No further premiums will be accepted;                                        

-  No further Monthly Deductions will be taken;                                 

-  The interest rate charged to Type A and B Policy Loans will be set equal to  
the rate credited to the portion of the Accumulation Value in the General       
Account being held as collateral on the Policy Loan; and                        

-  Any riders attached to the Policy will terminate as stipulated in the riders'
termination provision.                                                          

-  RIGHT TO DEFER PAYMENT                                                       

Payments of any Separate Account Value will be made within 7 days after our     
receipt of your written request. However, we reserve the right to suspend or    
postpone the date of any payment of any benefit or values for any Valuation     
Period (1) when the New York Stock Exchange is closed (except holidays or       
weekends); (2) when trading on the Exchange is restricted; (3) when an emergency
exists as determined by the SEC so that disposal of the securities held in the  
Funds is not reasonably practicable or it is not reasonably practicable to      
determine the value of the Funds' net assets; or (4) during any other period    
when the SEC, by order, so permits for the protection of security holders. For  
payment from the Separate Account in such instances, we may defer payment of    
full surrender and withdrawal values, any Death Benefit in excess of the current
Specified Amount, transfers and any portion of the Loan Value.                  

Payment of any General Account Value may be deferred for up to six months,      
except when used to pay amounts due us.                                         

-  POLICY LOANS                                                                 

We will grant loans at any time after the expiration of the Right of Policy     
Examination. The amount of the loan will not be more than the Loan Value. Unless
otherwise required by state law, the Loan Value for this Policy is 90% of Cash  
Value at the end of the                                                         

P-->N-629th�Page�of�64TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�29th
Valuation Period during which the loan request is received. The maximum amount  
you can borrow at any time is the Loan Value reduced by any outstanding Policy  
Debt.                                                                           

We will usually disburse loan proceeds within seven days from the Date of       
Receipt of a loan request, although we reserve the right to postpone payments   
under certain circumstances. See "OTHER MATTERS--Postponement of Payments". We  
may, in our sole discretion, allow you to make loans by telephone if you have   
filed a proper telephone authorization form with us. So long as your Policy is  
in force and the Insured is living, you may repay your loan in whole or in part 
at any time without penalty.                                                    

Accumulation Value equal to the loan amount will be maintained in the General   
Account to secure the loan. You may allocate a policy loan among the Divisions  
and the existing General Account Value that is not already allocated to secure a
policy loan, and we will transfer Separate Account Value as you have indicated. 
If you do not make this allocation, the loan will be allocated among the        
Divisions and the General Account in the same proportion that the Accumulation  
Value in each Division and the Accumulation Value in the General Account less   
Policy Debt bears to the total Accumulation Value of the Policy, less Policy    
Debt, on the date of the loan. We will make a similar allocation for unpaid loan
interest due. A policy loan removes Accumulation Value from the investment      
experience of the Separate Account, which will have a permanent effect on the   
Accumulation Value and Death Benefit even if the loan is repaid. General Account
Value equal to Policy Debt will accrue interest daily at an annual rate of 3%.  

We will charge interest on any outstanding Policy Debt with the interest        
compounded annually. There are two types of loans available. A Type A loan is   
charged interest at an effective annual rate of 5.25%. The interest credited to 
the amount of the Accumulation Value held in the General Account to secureType A
loans is 5.00%. The amount available at any time for a Type A loan is the       
maximum loan amount, less the Guideline Single Premium at issue, adjusted on a  
pro rata basis for increases in Specified Amount, as set forth in the Code, less
any outstanding Type A loans. Any other loans are Type B loans. A Type B loan is
charged an effective annual interest rate of 6.00% and the interest credited to 
the amount of the Accumulation Value held in the General Account to secure Type 
B loans is 5.00%%. One loan request can result in both a Type A and a Type B    
loan. A loan request will first be granted as a Type A loan, to the extent      
available, and then as a Type B loan. All loans become Type A loans at attained 
age 100. Otherwise, once a loan is granted, it remains a Type A or Type B loan  
until it is repaid. Interest is due and payable at the end of each Policy Year  
and any unpaid interest due becomes loan principal.                             

If Policy Debt exceeds Cash Value, we will notify you and any assignee of       
record. You must make a payment within 61 days from the date Policy Debt exceeds
Cash Value or the Policy will lapse and terminate without value (See "Grace     
Period"). If this happens, you may be taxed on the total appreciation under the 
Policy. However, you may reinstate the Policy, subject to proof of insurability 
and payment of a reinstatement premium. See "Reinstatement of a Lapsed Policy". 

OVERLOAN PROTECTION GUARANTEE???                                                

You may repay the Policy Debt, in whole or in part, at any time during the      
Insured's life, so long as the Policy is in force. The amount necessary to repay
all Policy Debt in full will include any accrued interest. If there is any      
Policy Debt, we will apply payments received from you as follows: we will apply 
payments as premium in the amount of the Planned Periodic Premium, received at  
the premium frequency, unless you specifically designate the payment as a loan  
repayment. We will apply payments in excess of the Planned Periodic Premium or  
payments received other than at the premium frequency, first as policy loan     
repayments, then as premium when you have repaid the Policy Debt.               

Upon repayment of all or part of the Policy Debt, we will transfer the Policy's 
Accumulation Value securing the repaid portion of the debt in the General       
Account to the Divisions and the General Account in the same proportion in which
the loan was taken.                                                             

An outstanding loan amount will decrease the Surrender Value available under the
Policy. If a loan is not repaid, the decrease in the Surrender Value could cause
the Policy to lapse. In addition, the Death Benefit will be decreased because of
an outstanding policy loan. Furthermore, even if you repay the loan, the amount 
of the Death Benefit and the Policy's Surrender Value may be permanently        
affected since the Accumulation Value securing the loan is not credited with the
investment experience of the Divisions.                                         

OVERLOAN PROTECTION ENDORSEMENT                                                 

The Overloan Protection Endorsement, if available, will protect you against     
lapse of your Policy due to Policy Debt exceeding Cash Value. Under this        
Endorsement, your Policy will not lapse if:                                     

-  Your Policy has been in force for at least 20 policy years;        

-  The Insured's Attained Age is at least 65;                         

 -  Your Policy's Surrender Value is insufficient to cover the cost of a
Monthly Deduction;                                              

-  The Policy Debt is greater than the Specified Amount.              

-  You have selected Death Benefit Option I.                          

-  You have selected the Guideline Premium Test

P-->N-630th�Page�of�64TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�30th
However, the following changes will be made to your Policy:                     

-    Any Riders will terminate;

    -    Cost of Insurance Charges, Monthly Administrative Charges and Monthly

               (a)  is the Accumulation Value on the Date of Death multiplied by
the corridor factor; and                

         (b)  is the Policy Debt on the Insured's date of death plus
$10,000.                                

 -    No further premium payments, withdrawals, Policy Loans, changes in
         Specified Amount, changes in Death Benefit Option, or transfers among
investment Divisions will be permitted; and                 

-    Interest will be credited to the Loan Collateral and any unloaned
          funds in the General Account, and interest will continue to be charged
to the Loan Amount.                                         

-    The Accumculation Value will not be less than zero.              

If the Policy is in force under the Overloan Protection Endorsement when the    
Insured reaches Attained Age 100, then the following changes also will occur:   

    -    Interest credited on both Type A and Type B loans will be at the rate
         of 5.0%, and interest charged on all Policy Loans will be at the rate
of 5.0%;                                                    

-    No further Monthly Deductions will be made.                      

-  POLICY CHANGES                                                               

You may make changes to your Policy, as described below, by submitting a written
request to our Service Office. Supplemental Policy Specification pages and/or a 
notice confirming the change will be sent to you once the change is completed.  

INCREASE OR DECREASE IN SPECIFIED AMOUNT                                        

You may increase or decrease the Specified Amount of this Policy after the 1st  
Policy Year. You must send us a written request and the Policy to our Service   
Office. However:                                                                

-  Any increase or decrease must be at least $25,000.                           

-  Any increase or decrease will affect your cost of insurance charge.          

-  Any increase or decrease may affect the monthly Accumulation Value           
Adjustment.                                                               

-  We may require evidence of insurability for an increase.                     

-  You must be under Attained Age 86 at the time you apply for an increase.     

-  You may only request an increase or decrease once every 12 months.           

-  Any increase will be effective on the Monthly Anniversary Date that coincides
with or next follows the approval of the increase.                        

-  We will assess a new Acquisition charge against the Accumulation Value on the
Monthly Anniversary Date that an increase takes effect. This charge is an amount
per $1000 of increase in Specified Amount, which varies by sex, Attained Age,   
and rating class of the Insured at the time of the increase. The charge will be 
in effect for the 120 months following the increase.                            

-  Any increase will result in a new Surrender Charge.                          

-  We will assess a pro rata Surrender Charge on decreases.                     

-  Any decrease may result in federal tax implications (See "Federal Tax        
Matters").                                                                

-  No decrease may decrease the Specified Amount below $25,000.                 

-  Any decrease will first apply to coverage provided by the most recent        
increase, then to the next most recent, and so on, and finally to the coverage  
under the original application.                                                 

-  We will allow increases in Specified Amount at any time, so long as the      
Policy is issued as a 1035 exchange and the increase is needed to avoid the     
Policy becoming a MEC because of additional 1035 exchange money we receive after
the Policy is issued.                                                           

CHANGE IN DEATH BENEFIT OPTION                                                  

Any change in the Death Benefit Option is subject to the following conditions:  

-  The change will take effect on the Monthly Anniversary Date on or next       
following the date on which your written request is received.                   

P-->N-631st�Page�of�64TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�31st
-  There will be no change in the Surrender Charge.                             

-  Evidence of insurability may be required if the change would result in an    
increase in the difference between the Death Benefit and the Accumulation Value.

-  If you change from Option I to Option II the Specified Amount will be        
decreased by the Accumulation Value.                                            

-  If you change from Option II to Option I, the Specified Amount will be       
increased by the Accumulation Value.                                            

-  If you change from Option III to Option I, the Specified Amount will be      
increased by the total premiums paid less any withdrawals.                      

-  If you change from Option III to Option II, the Specified Amount will be     
increased by the total premiums paid less any withdrawals, and decreased by the 
Accumulation Value.                                                             

-  Changes from Option I or II to Option III are not allowed.                   

We will not require evidence of insurability for a change, so long as the       
Specified Amount is adjusted to make the difference between the Death Benefit   
and the Accumulation Value after the change in Death Benefit Option the same as 
it was before the change.                                                       

If the change decreases the Specified Amount below $25,000, we will increase the
Specified Amount to $25,000.                                                    

-  RIGHT OF POLICY EXAMINATION ("FREE LOOK PERIOD")                             

The Policy has a free look period during which you may examine the Policy. If   
for any reason you are dissatisfied, you may return the Policy to us at our     
Service Office or to our representative within 10 days of delivery of the Policy
to you (or within a different period if required by State law). Return the      
Policy to Jefferson Pilot Financial Insurance Company at One Granite Place,     
Concord, New Hampshire 03301. Upon its return, the Policy will be deemed void   
from its beginning. We will return to you within seven days all payments we     
received on the Policy. Prior to the Allocation Date, we will hold the initial  
Net Premium, and any other premiums we receive, in our General Account. We will 
retain any interest earned if the Free Look right is exercised, unless otherwise
required by State law.                                                          

-  SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFITS                                                        

The supplemental benefits currently available as riders to the Policy include   
the following:                                                                  

-  ACCELERATED BENEFIT RIDER--pays a portion of the Death Benefit upon          
occurrence of terminal illness or nursing home confinement, subject to the terms
of the rider. The availability of Accelerated Benefit Rider is restricted by    
underwriting class.                                                             

-  ACCIDENTAL DEATH BENEFIT RIDER--provides a benefit in the event of accidental
death, subject to the terms of the rider.                                       

-  AUTOMATIC INCREASE RIDER--allows for scheduled annual increases in Specified 
Amount of from 1% to 7%, subject to the terms of the rider.                     

-  CHILDREN'S TERM INSURANCE RIDER--provides increments of level term insurance 
on the Insured's children. Under the terms of this rider, JP Financial will pay 
the death benefit set forth in the rider to the named beneficiary upon receipt  
of proof of death of the insured child. Upon receipt of proof of death of the   
Insured, the rider will continue in force under its terms without additional    
monthly charges.                                                                

-  DISABILITY WAIVER OF DEDUCTIONS--In the event of disability of the Insured   
after Attained Age 5 and before age 65, we will waive the Monthly Deduction for 
the Policy. If any other benefit or coverage rider is included in the Policy,   
its monthly cost will also be waived. For disability occurring on or after age  
56 and before age 65, the maximum benefit period is 15 years. Eligible issue    
ages for this rider are 0-60. The charge for this rider is equal to a percentage
of the Monthly Deduction for the Policy, plus the monthly deduction for any     
other riders (except for the Death Benefit Maintenance Rider). The percentage   
increases each year with Attained Age. The charge for this rider is taken as a  
monthly deduction from the Policy.                                              

-  DISABILITY WAIVER OF SPECIFIED PREMIUM--If the Insured is disabled before age
65, we will pay a specified monthly premium into the Policy beginning with the  
Monthly Anniversary Date following the commencement of total disability. We will
pay the specified monthly premiums after the beginning of and during the        
continuance of such disability. The charges for this rider may vary by age, sex 
and underwriting class and increases each year with Attained Age. The charge is 
taken as a monthly deduction from the Policy.                                   

-  GUARANTEED DEATH BENEFIT RIDER--guarantees that the Policy will stay in force
during the guarantee period with a Death Benefit equal to the Specified Amount  
provided that a cumulative minimum premium requirement is met. The premium      
requirement is based on Issue Age, sex, tobacco status, underwriting class,     
Specified Amount and Death Benefit Option. If the Specified Amount is increased,
an additional premium, based on Attained Age, will be required for such         
increase. There is a monthly charge of $.01 per $1000 of Specified Amount for   
this rider, which will be deducted from the Policy's Accumulation Value.        

- GUARANTEED INSURABILITY RIDER--allows the Policyowner to purchase increases in
Specified Amount, without providing evidence of insurability, during 60-day     
periods which end on regular specified option dates. The minimum increase is    
$10,000, the maximum increase is the lesser of $50,000 or the original Specified
Amount of the Policy. There is a monthly cost of insurance charge for the rider 
per $1,000 of rider issue amount, which is based on Issue Age and which remains 
level throughout the entire rider coverage period. The charge is deducted from  
the Accumulation Value of the base Policy.                                      

-  SPOUSE TERM RIDER--provides term insurance coverage on the spouse of the     
Insured up to age 95, subject to the terms of the rider. Rider features and     
availability will vary by state.                                                

P-->N-632nd�Page�of�64TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�32nd
Other riders for supplemental benefits may become available under the Policy    
from time to time. The charges for each of these riders are described in your   
Policy.                                                                         

DEATH BENEFIT                                                                   

The Death Benefit under the Policy will be paid in a lump sum unless you or the 
Beneficiary have elected that they be paid under one or more of the available   
Settlement Options.                                                             

Payment of the Death Benefit may be delayed if the Policy is being contested.   
You may elect a Settlement Option for the Beneficiary and deem it irrevocable.  
You may revoke or change a prior election. The Beneficiary may make or change an
election within 90 days of the death of the Insured, unless you have made an    
irrevocable election.                                                           

All or part of the Death Benefit may be applied under one of the Settlement     
Options, or such options as we may choose to make available in the future.      

If the Policy is assigned as collateral security, we will pay any amount due the
assignee in a lump sum. Any excess Death Benefit due will be paid as elected.   

(See "Right to Defer Payment" and "Policy Settlement") The Death Benefit under  
the Policy will be paid in a lump sum unless you or the Beneficiary have elected
that they be paid under one or more of the available Settlement Options.        

POLICY SETTLEMENT 

We will pay proceeds in whole or in part in the form of a lump sum or the       
Settlement Options available under the Policy upon the death of the Insured or  
upon Surrender.                                                                 

A written request may be made to elect, change or revoke a Settlement Option    
before payments begin under any Settlement Option. This request will take effect
upon its filing at our Service Office. If you have not elected a Settlement     
Option when the Death Benefit becomes payable to the Beneficiary, that          
Beneficiary may make the election.                                              

-  SETTLEMENT OPTIONS                                                           

The following Settlement Options are available under the Policy:                

OPTION A--INSTALLMENTS OF A SPECIFIED AMOUNT. Payments of an agreed amount to be
made monthly until the proceeds and interest are exhausted.                     

OPTION B--INSTALLMENTS FOR A SPECIFIED PERIOD. Payments to be made monthly for  
an agreed number of years.                                                      

OPTION C--LIFE INCOME. Payments to be made each month for the lifetime of the   
payee. We guarantee that payments will be made for a minimum of 10, 15 or 20    
years, as agreed upon.                                                          

OPTION D--INTEREST. We will pay interest on the proceeds we hold, calculated at 
the compound rate of 3% per year. We will make interest payments at 12, 6, 3 or 
1 month intervals.                                                              

OPTION E--INTEREST: RETAINED ASSET ACCOUNT (PERFORMANCE PLUS ACCOUNT). We will  
pay interest on the proceeds we hold, based on the floating 13-week U.S.        
Treasury Bill rate fixed quarterly. The payee can write checks against such     
account at any time and in any amount up to the total in the account. The checks
must be for a minimum of $250.                                                  

The interest rate for Options A, B and D will not be less than 3% per year. The 
interest rate for Option C will not be less than 2.5% per year. The interest    
rate for Option E will not be less than 2% per year.                            

Unless otherwise stated in the election of any option, the payee of the Policy  
benefits shall have the right to receive the withdrawal value under that option.
For Options A, D and E, the withdrawal value shall be any unpaid balance of     
proceeds plus accrued interest. For Option B, the withdrawal value shall be the 
commuted value of the remaining payments. We will calculate this withdrawal     
value on the same basis as the original payments. For Option C, the withdrawal  
value will be the commuted value of any remaining guaranteed payments. If the   
payee is alive at the end of the guarantee period, we will resume the payment on
that date. The payment will then continue for the lifetime of the payee.        

If the payee of Policy benefits dies before the proceeds are exhausted or the   
prescribed payments made, a final payment will be made in one sum to the estate 
of the last surviving payee. The amount to be paid will be calculated as        
described for the applicable option in the Withdrawal Value provision of the    
Policy.                                                                         

At least $25,000 of Policy proceeds must be applied to each settlement option   
chosen. We reserve the right to change payment intervals to increase payments to
$250 each.                                                                      

CALCULATION OF SETTLEMENT OPTION VALUES                                         

The value of the Settlement Options will be calculated as set forth in the      
Policy.

We will maintain all records relating to the Separate Account. At least once in 
each Policy Year, we will send you an Annual Summary containing the following   
information:

-  RIGHT TO INSTRUCT VOTING OF FUND SHARES                                      

In accordance with our view of present applicable law, we will vote the shares  
of the Funds held in the Separate Account in accordance with instructions       
received from Policyowners having a voting interest in the Funds. Policyowners  
having such an interest will receive periodic reports relating to the Fund,     
proxy material and a form for giving voting instructions. The number of shares  
you have a right to vote will be determined as of a record date established by  
the Fund. The number of votes that you are entitled to direct with respect to a 
Portfolio will be determined by dividing your Policy's Accumulation Value in a  
Division by the net asset value per share of the corresponding Portfolio in     
which the Division invests. We will solicit your voting instructions by mail at 
least 14 days before any shareholders meeting.                                  

We will cast the votes at meetings of the shareholders of the Portfolio and our 
votes will be based on instructions received from Policyowners. However, if the 
1940 Act or any regulations thereunder should be amended or if the present      
interpretation should change, and as a result we determine that we are permitted
to vote the shares of the Portfolio in our right, we may elect to do so.        

We will vote Portfolio shares for which we do not receive timely instructions   
and Portfolio shares which are not otherwise attributable to Policyowners in the
same proportion as the voting instruction which we receive for all Policies     
participating in each Portfolio through the Separate Account.                   

-  DISREGARD OF VOTING INSTRUCTIONS                                             

When required by state insurance regulatory authorities, we may disregard voting
instructions if the instructions require that the shares be voted so as to cause
a change in the sub-classification or investment objectives of a Portfolio or to
approve or disapprove an investment advisory contract for a Portfolio. We may   
also disregard voting instructions initiated by a Policyowner in favor of       
changes in the investment policy or the investment adviser of the Portfolio if  
we reasonably disapprove of such changes.                                       

We only disapprove a change if the proposed change is contrary to state law or  
prohibited by state regulatory authorities or if we determine that the change   
would have an adverse effect on the Separate Account if the proposed investment 
policy for a Portfolio would result in overly speculative or unsound            
investments. In the event that we do disregard voting instructions, a summary of
that action and the reasons for such action will be included in the next annual 
report to Policyowners.                                                         

-  STATE REGULATION                                                             
Jefferson Pilot Financial Insurance Company is governed under the laws of the   
State of Nebraska. An annual statement is filed with the Nebraska Insurance     
Commission on or before March 1 of each year covering the operations and        
reporting on the financial condition of the Company as of December 31 of the    
preceding year. Periodically the Commissioner examines the assets and           
liabilities of the                                                              

P-->N-634th�Page�of�64TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�34th
Company and the Separate Account and verifies their accuracy and a full         
examination of the Company's operations is conducted by the Commissioner at     
least every five years.                                                         

In addition, the Company is subject to the insurance laws and regulations of    
other states in which it is licensed to operate. Generally, the insurance       
department of any other state applies to the laws of the state of domicile in   
determining permissible investments.                                            

The Policy will be offered for sale in all jurisdictions where we are authorized
to do business and where the Policy has been approved by the appropriate        
Insurance Department or regulatory authorities. Individual Policy features may  
not be available in all states or may vary by state. Any significant variations 
from the information appearing in this Prospectus which are required due to     
individual state requirements are contained in your Policy.                     

-  LEGAL MATTERS                                                                

We know of no pending material legal proceedings pending to which either the    
Separate Account or the Company is a party or which would materially affect the 
Separate Account. The legal validity of the securities described in the         
prospectus has been passed on by our Counsel. The law firm of Jorden Burt, LLP, 
1025 Thomas Jefferson Street, Suite 400, East Lobby, Washington, DC 20007-5201, 
serves as our Special Counsel with regard to the federal securities laws.       

-  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                                         

The financial statements of the Separate Account as of December 31, 2002 and for
each of the periods in the two years then ended, the financial statements of    
Jefferson Pilot Financial Insurance Company as of December 31, 2002 and for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003, and the accompanying  
independent auditors' reports, appear in the Statement of Additional            
Information. Our financial statements which are included in the Statement of    
Additional Information should be considered only as bearing on our ability to   
meet our obligations under the Policy. They should not be considered as bearing 
on the investment experience of the assets held in the Separate Account.        

-  EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT PLANS                                                     

Employers and employee organizations should consider, in connection with        
counsel, the impact of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 on the purchase
of a Policy in connection with an employment-related insurance or benefit plan. 
The U.S. Supreme Court held, in a 1983 decision, that, under Title VII, optional
annuity benefits under a deferred compensation plan could not vary on the basis 
of sex.                                                                         

TAX MATTERS                                                                     
-  GENERAL                                                                      

Following is a discussion of the federal income tax considerations relating to  
the Policy. This discussion is based on our understanding of federal income tax 
laws as they now exist and are currently interpreted by the Internal Revenue    
Service. These laws are complex and tax results may vary among individuals.     
Anyone contemplating the purchase of or the exercise of elections under the     
Policy should seek competent tax advice.                                        

-  FEDERAL TAX STATUS OF THE COMPANY                                            

We are taxed as a life insurance company in accordance with the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 as amended ("Code"). For federal income tax purposes, the          
operations of each Separate Account form a part of our total operations and are 
not taxed separately, although operations of each Separate Account are treated  
separately for accounting and financial statement purposes. Both investment     
income and realized capital gains of the Separate Account are reinvested without
tax since the Code does not impose a tax on the Separate Account for these      
amounts. However, we reserve the right to make a deduction for such tax should  
it be imposed in the future.                                                    

-  LIFE INSURANCE QUALIFICATION                                                 

The Policy contains provisions not found in traditional life insurance policies.
However, we believe that it should qualify under the Code as a life insurance   
contract for federal income tax purposes, with the result that all Death        
Benefits paid under the Policy will generally be excludable from the gross      
income of the Policy's Beneficiary.                                             

Section 7702 of the Code includes a definition of life insurance for tax        
purposes. The definition provides limitations on the relationship between the   
Death Benefit and the account value. If necessary, we will increase your death  
benefit to maintain compliance with Section 7702.                               

The Policy is intended to qualify as life insurance under the Code. The Death   
Benefit provided by the Policy is intended to qualify for the federal income tax
exclusion. If at any time you pay a premium that would exceed the amount        
allowable for such qualification, we will either refund the excess premium to   
you or, if the excess premium exceeds $250, offer you the alternative of        
instructing us to hold the excess premium in a premium deposit fund and apply it
to the Policy later in accordance woth your instructions. We will credit        
interest at an annual rate that we may declare from time to time on advance     
premium deposit funds.                                                          

If the excess premium had been applied to your Policy before we notify you, we  
will adjust your Policy Value as though the excess premium had not been applied 
to your Policy and offer to refund the excess premium plus interest credited at 
a rate equal to the annual rate credited to the advance premium deposit fund. If
you instruct us to hold that amount, we will apply it to a premium deposit fund 
and thereafter credit interest as described above.                              

P-->N-635th�Page�of�64TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�35th
We will pay any refund no later than 60 days after the end of the relevant      
Policy Year, in accordance with the requirements of the Code. We also reserve   
the right to refuse to make any change in the Specified Amount or the Death     
Benefit Option of any other change if such change would cause the Policy to fail
to qualify as life insurance under the Code.                                    

A modified endowment contract is a life insurance policy which fails to meet a  
"seven-pay" test. In general, a Policy will fail the seven-pay test if the      
cumulative amount of premiums paid under the Policy at any time during the first
seven Policy Years exceeds a calculated premium level. The calculated seven-pay 
premium level is based on a hypothetical Policy issued on the same insured and  
for the same initial Death Benefit which, under specified conditions (which     
include the absence of expense and administrative charges), would be fully paid 
for after seven years. Your Policy will be treated as a modified endowment      
contract unless the cumulative premiums paid under your Policy, at all times    
during the first seven Policy Years, are less than or equal to the cumulative   
seven-pay premiums which would have been paid under the hypothetical Policy on  
or before such times.                                                           

The Policy will be allowed to become a MEC under the Code only with your        
consent. If you pay a premium that would cause your Policy to be deemed a MEC   
and you do not consent to MEC status for your Policy, we will either refund the 
excess premium to you or, if the excess premium exceeds $250, offer you the     
alternative of instructing us to hold the excess premium in a premium deposit   
fund and apply it to the Policy later in accordance with your instructions. We  
will credit interest at an annual rate that we may declare from time to time on 
advance premium deposit funds.                                                  

If the excess premium had been applied to your Policy before we notify you, we  
will adjust your Policy Value as though the excess premium had not been applied 
to your Policy and offer to refund the excess premium plus interest credited at 
a rate equal to the annual rate credited to the advance premium deposit fund. If
you instruct us to hold that amount, we will apply it to a premium deposit fund 
and thereafter credit interest as described above.                              

We will pay any refund no later than 60 days after the end of the relevent      
Policy Year, in accordance with the requirements of the Code. We may also notify
you of other options available to you to keep the Policy in compliance.         

Whenever there is a "material change" under a Policy, it will generally be      
treated as a new contract for purposes of determining whether the Policy is a   
modified endowment contract, and subject to a new seven-pay premium period and a
new seven-pay limit. The new seven-pay limit would be determined taking into    
account, under a prospective adjustment formula, the Policy Account Value of the
Policy at the time of such change. A materially changed Policy would be         
considered a modified endowment contract if it failed to satisfy the new        
seven-pay limit. A material change could occur as a result of a change in the   
death benefit option, the selection of additional benefits, the restoration of a
terminated Policy and certain other changes.                                    

If the benefits under your Policy are reduced, for example, by requesting a     
decrease in Specified Amount, or in some cases by making partial withdrawals,   
terminating additional benefits under a rider, changing the death benefit       
option, or as a result of Policy termination, the calculated seven-pay premium  
level will be redetermined based on the reduced level of benefits and applied   
retroactively for purposes of the seven-pay test. If the premiums previously    
paid are greater than the recalculated seven-pay premium level limit, the Policy
will become a modified endowment contract unless you request a refund of the    
excess premium, as outlined above. We also may offer you the choice of moving   
the excess premium to an advance premium deposit fund account, as outlined      
above. Generally, a life insurance policy which is received in exchange for a   
modified endowment contract or a modified endowment contract which terminates   
and is restored, will also be considered a modified endowment contract.         

If a Policy is deemed to be a modified endowment contract, any distribution from
the Policy will be taxed in a manner comparable to distributions from annuities 
(i.e., on an "income first) basis); distributions for this purpose include a    
loan, pledge, assignment or partial withdrawal. Any such distributions will be  
considered taxable income to the extent Accumulation Value under the Policy     
exceeds investment in the Policy.                                               

A 10% penalty tax will also apply to the taxable portion of such a distribution.
No penalty will apply to distributions (i) to taxpayers 59 1/2 years of age or  
older, (ii) in the case of a disability which can be expected to result in death
or to be of indefinite duration or (iii) received as part of a series of        
substantially equal periodic payments for the life (or life expectancy) of the  
taxpayer or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the taxpayer and his
beneficiary.                                                                    

To the extent a Policy becomes a modified endowment contract, any distribution, 
as defined above, which occurs in the Policy Year it becomes a modified         
endowment contract and in any year thereafter, will be taxable income to you.   
Also, any distributions within two years before a Policy becomes a modified     
endowment contract will also be income taxable to you to the extent that        
Accumulation Value exceeds investment in the Policy, as described above. The    
Secretary of the Treasury has been authorized to prescribe rules which would    
similarly treat other distributions made in anticipation of a Policy becoming a 
modified endowment contract. For purposes of determining the amount of any      
distribution includible in income, all modified endowment contracts which are   
issued by the same insurer, or its affiliates, to the same policyowner during   
any calendar year are treated as one contract.                                  

We believe the Policy will continue to qualify as life insurance under the Code;
however, there is some uncertainty regarding this treatment. It is possible,    
therefore, that you would be viewed as constructively receiving the Surrender   
Value in the year in which the Insured attains age 100 and would realize taxable
income at that time, even if the Policy proceeds were not distributed at that   
time.                                                                           

The foregoing summary does not purport to be complete or to cover all           
situations, and, as always, there is some degree of uncertainty with respect to 
the application of the current tax laws. In addition to the provisions discussed
above, Congress may consider other legislation which, if enacted, could         
adversely affect the tax treatment of life insurance policies. Also, the        
Treasury Department may amend current regulations or adopt new regulations with 
respect to this and other Code provisions. Therefore, you are advised to        

P-->N-636th�Page�of�64TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�36th
consult a tax adviser for more complete tax information, specifically regarding 
the applicability of the Code provisions to your situation.                     

Under normal circumstances, if the Policy is not a modified endowment contract, 
loans received under the Policy will be construed as your indebtedness. You are 
advised to consult a tax adviser or attorney regarding the deduction of interest
paid on loans.                                                                  

Even if the Policy is not a modified endowment contract, a partial withdrawal   
together with a reduction in death benefits during the first 15 Policy Years may
create taxable income for you. The amount of that taxable income is determined  
under a complex formula and it may be equal to part or all of, but not greater  
than, the income on the contract. A partial withdrawal made after the first 15  
Policy Years will be taxed on a recovery of premium-first basis, and will only  
be subject to federal income tax to the extent such proceeds exceed the total   
amount of premiums you have paid that have not been previously withdrawn.       

If you make a partial withdrawal, surrender, loan or exchange of the Policy, we 
may be required to withhold federal income tax from the portion of the money you
receive that is includible in your federal gross income. A Policyowner who is   
not a corporation may elect not to have such tax withheld; however, such        
election must be made before we make the payment. In addition, if you fail to   
provide us with a correct taxpayer identification number (usually a social      
security number) or if the Treasury notifies us that the taxpayer identification
number which has been provided is not correct, the election not to have such    
taxes withheld will not be effective. In any case, you are liable for payment of
the federal income tax on the taxable portion of money received, whether or not 
an election to have federal income tax withheld is made. If you elect not to    
have federal income tax withheld, or if the amount withheld is insufficient,    
then you may be responsible for payment of estimated tax. You may also incur    
penalties under the estimated tax rules if the withholding and estimated tax    
payments are insufficient. We suggest that you consult with a tax adviser as to 
the tax implications of these matters.                                          

In the event that a Policy is owned by the trustee under a pension or profit    
sharing plan, or similar deferred compensation arrangement, tax consequences of 
ownership or receipt of proceeds under the Policy could differ from those stated
herein. However, if ownership of such a Policy is transferred from the plan to a
plan participant (upon termination of employment, for example), the Policy will 
be subject to all of the federal tax rules described above. A Policy owned by a 
trustee under such a plan may be subject to restrictions under ERISA and a tax  
adviser should be consulted regarding any applicable ERISA requirements.        

The Internal Revenue Service imposes limitations on the amount of life insurance
that can be owned by a retirement plan. Clients should consult their tax        
advisors about the tax consequences associated with the sale or distribution of 
the Policy from the qualified plan and the potential effect of IRS Notice 89-25.

The Policy may also be used in various arrangements, including nonqualified     
deferred compensation or salary continuation plans, split dollar insurance      
plans, executive bonus plans and others, where the tax consequences may vary    
depending on the particular facts and circumstances of each individual          
arrangement. A tax adviser should be consulted regarding the tax attributes of  
any particular arrangement where the value of it depends in part on its tax     
consequences.                                                                   

Federal estate and local estate, inheritance and other tax consequences of      
ownership or receipt of policy proceeds depend upon the circumstances of each   
Policyowner and Beneficiary.                                                    

Current Treasury regulations set standards for diversification of the           
investments underlying variable life insurance policies in order for such       
policies to be treated as life insurance. We believe we presently are and intend
to remain in compliance with the diversification requirements as set forth in   
the regulations. If the diversification requirements are not satisfied, the     
Policy would not be treated as a life insurance contract. As a consequence to   
you, income earned on a Policy would be taxable to you in the calendar quarter  
in which the diversification requirements were not satisfied, and for all       
subsequent calendar quarters.                                                   

The Secretary of the Treasury may issue a regulation or a ruling which will     
prescribe the circumstances in which a Policyowner's control of the investments 
of a segregated account may cause the Policyowner, rather than the insurance    
company, to be treated as the owner of the assets of the account. The regulation
or ruling could impose requirements that are not reflected in the Policy,       
relating, for example, to such elements of Policyowner control as premium       
allocation, investment selection, transfer privileges and investment in a       
division focusing on a particular investment sector. Failure to comply with any 
such regulation or ruling presumably would cause earnings on a Policyowner's    
interest in Separate Account A to be includible in the Policyowner's gross      
income in the year earned. However, we have reserved certain rights to alter the
Policy and investment alternatives so as to comply with such regulation or      
ruling. We believe that any such regulation or ruling would apply prospectively.
Since the regulation or ruling has not been issued, there can be no assurance as
to the content of such regulation or ruling or even whether application of the  
regulation or ruling will be prospective. For these reasons, Policyowners are   
urged to consult with their own tax advisers.                                   

The foregoing summary does not purport to be complete or to cover all           
situations, including the possible tax consequences of changes in ownership.    
Counsel and other competent advisers should be consulted for more complete      
information.                                                                    

-  CHARGES FOR JP FINANCIAL INCOME TAXES                                        

We are presently taxed as a life insurance company under the provisions of the  
Code. The Code specifically provides for adjustments in reserves for variable   
policies, and we will include flexible premium life insurance operations in our 
tax return in accordance with these rules.                                      

Currently no charge is made against the Separate Account for our federal income 
taxes, or provisions for such taxes, that may be attributable to the Separate   
Account. We may charge each Division for its portion of any income tax charged  
to us on the Division or its assets. Under present laws, we may incur state and 
local taxes (in addition to premium taxes) in several states. At present these  
taxes

are not significant. However, if they increase, we may decide to make charges   
for such taxes or provisions for such taxes against the Separate Account. We    
would retain any investment earnings on any tax charges accumulated in a        
Division. Any such charges against the Separate Account or its Divisions could  
have an adverse effect on the investment experience of such Division.           

MISCELLANEOUS POLICY PROVISIONS                                                 
-  THE POLICY                                                                   

The Policy which you receive, the application you make when you purchase the    
Policy, any applications for any changes approved by us and any riders          
constitute the whole contract. Copies of all applications are attached to and   
made a part of the Policy.                                                      

Application forms are completed by the applicants and forwarded to us for       
acceptance. Upon acceptance, the Policy is prepared, executed by our duly       
authorized officers and forwarded to you.                                       

We reserve the right to make a change in the Policy; however, we will not change
any terms of the Policy beneficial to you.                                      

-  PAYMENT OF BENEFITS                                                          

All benefits are payable at our Service Office. We may require submission of the
Policy before we grant Policy Loans, make changes or pay benefits.              

-  SUICIDE AND INCONTESTABILITY                                                 

SUICIDE EXCLUSION--In most states, if the Insured dies by suicide, while sane or
insane, within 2 years from the Issue Date of this Policy, this Policy will end 
and we will refund premiums paid, without interest, less any Policy Debt and    
less any withdrawal. If the Insured commits suicide within 2 years of the       
effective date of any Increase in Specified Amount, our only liability with     
regard to the Increase will be for the sum of the Monthly Deductions for such   
Increase in Specified Amount.                                                   

INCONTESTABILITY--We will not contest or revoke the insurance coverage provided 
under the Policy after the Policy has been in force during the lifetime of the  
Insured for two years from the date of issue or reinstatement.                  

-  PROTECTION OF PROCEEDS                                                       

To the extent provided by law, the proceeds of the Policy are not subject to    
claims by a Beneficiary's creditors or to any legal process against any         
Beneficiary.                                                                    

-  NONPARTICIPATION                                                             

The Policy is not entitled to share in our divisible surplus. No dividends are  
payable.                                                                        

-  CHANGES IN OWNER AND BENEFICIARY; ASSIGNMENT                                 

Unless otherwise stated in the Policy, you may change the Policyowner and the   
Beneficiary, or both, at any time while the Policy is in force. A request for   
such change must be made in writing and sent to us at our Service Office. After 
we have agreed, in writing, to the change, it will take effect as of the date on
which your written request was signed.                                          

The Policy may also be assigned. No assignment of Policy will be binding on us  
unless made in writing and sent to us at our Service Office. We will use        
reasonable procedures to confirm that the assignment is authentic. Otherwise, we
are not responsible for the validity of any assignment. Your rights and the     
Beneficiary's interest will be subject to the rights of any assignee of record. 

-  MISSTATEMENTS                                                                

If the age or sex of the Insured has been misstated in an application, including
a reinstatement application, we will adjust the benefits payable to reflect the 
correct age or sex.

APPENDIX A                                                                      
-  ILLUSTRATIONS OF ACCUMULATION VALUES, CASH VALUES AND DEATH BENEFITS         

Following are a series of tables that illustrate how the Accumulation Values,   
Cash Values and Death Benefits of a Policy change with the investment           
performance of the Portfolios. The tables show how the Accumulation Values, Cash
Values and Death Benefits of a Policy issued to an Insured of a given age and   
given premium would vary over time if the return on the assets held in each     
Portfolio were a constant gross annual rate of 0%, 6%, and 12%. The gross rates 
of return do not reflect the deduction of the charges and expenses of the       
Portfolios. The tables on pages A-3 through A-13 illustrate a Policy issued to a
male, age 45, under a standard rate non-smoker underwriting risk classification.
The Accumulation Values, Cash Values and Death Benefits would be different from 
those shown if the returns averaged 0%, 6%, and 12% over a period of years, but 
fluctuated above and below those averages for individual Policy Years.          

The amount of the Accumulation Value exceeds the Cash Value during the first ten
Policy Years due to the Surrender Charge. For Policy Years eleven and after, the
Accumulation Value and Cash Value are equal, since the Surrender Charge has been
reduced to zero.                                                                

P-->N-640th�Page�of�64TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�40th
The second column shows the Accumulation Value of the premiums paid at the      
stated interest rate. The third and sixth columns illustrate the Accumulation   
Values and the fourth and seventh columns illustrate the Cash Values of the     
Policy over the designated period. The Accumulation Values shown in the third   
column and the Cash Values shown in the fourth column assume the monthly charge 
for cost of insurance is based upon the current cost of insurance rates as      
discounted and that the mortality and expense risk charge and Premium Load are  
charged at current rates. The current cost of insurance rates are based on the  
sex, issue age, policy year, and rating class of the Insured, and the Specified 
Amount of the Policy. The Accumulation Values shown in the sixth column and the 
Cash Values shown in the seventh column assume the monthly charge for cost of   
insurance is based upon the maximum cost of insurance rates allowable, which are
based on the Commissioner's 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table, and upon the
maximum mortality and expense risk charges and premium load provided in the     
Policy, as described below. The current cost of insurance rates are different   
for Specified Amounts below $100,000 and above $100,000. The fifth and eighth   
columns illustrate the Death Benefit of a Policy over the designated period on a
current and guaranteed basis, respectively. The illustrations of Death Benefits 
reflect the same assumptions as the Accumulation Values and Cash Values. The    
Death Benefit values also vary between tables, depending upon whether Option I, 
Option II or Option III Death Benefits are illustrated.                         

The amounts shown for the Death Benefit, Accumulation Values, and Cash Values   
reflect the fact that the net investment return of the Divisions is lower than  
the gross return on the assets in the Divisions, as a result of expenses paid by
the Portfolios and charges levied against the Divisions.                        

The policy values shown take into account a daily investment advisory fee       
equivalent to the maximum annual rate of .__% of the aggregate arithmetic       
average daily net assets of the Portfolios, plus a charge of .__% of the        
aggregate arithmetic average daily net assets to cover expenses incurred by the 
Portfolios for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. The investment        
advisory fee is an arithmetic average of the individual investment advisory fees
of the thirty-two Portfolios. The .__% expense figure is an arithmetic average  
of the annual expenses of the Jefferson Pilot Variable Fund Portfolios, the AFIS
Portfolios, the American Century VP Portfolios, the Ayco Portfolio, the Franklin
Templeton Portfolios, the Fidelity VIP Portfolios, the MFS Portfolios, the PIMCO
Total Return Portfolio, the ProFunds, the Scudder VIT Portfolio and the Vanguard
VIF Portfolios. Portfolio fees and expenses used in the illustrations do not    
reflect any expense reimbursements or fee waivers, which are terminable by the  
Portfolios and/or their investment advisors as described in the Policy          
prospectus under Fee table and in the prospectuses for the Portfolios. Expenses 
for the unaffiliated Portfolios were provided by the investment managers for    
these Portfolios and JP Financial has not independently verified such           
information. The policy values also take into account a daily charge to each    
Division for the Mortality and Expense Risks Charge, which is equivalent to a   
charge at an annual rate of 0.60% (0.85% guaranteed) of the average daily net   
assets of the Divisions in Policy Years 1 through 15 and 0.10% (0.60%           
guaranteed) thereafter. After deduction of these amounts, the illustrated gross 
investment rates of 0%, 6%, and 12% correspond to approximate net annual rates  
of -____%, ____% and _____%, respectively, on a current basis, and -____%, ____%
and _____% on a guaranteed basis.                                               

The assumed annual premium used in calculating Accumulation Value, Cash Value,  
and Death Benefits is net of the 2.5% Premium Tax charge, the 1.25% federal     
income tax charge and the Premium Load, which is 3% in Policy Years 1 through 10
only on a current basis and 3% in all years on a guaranteed basis. It also      
reflects deduction of the Monthly Deduction. As part of the Monthly Deduction,  
the Monthly Acquisition Charge of 1% of the Load Basis Amount per month in      
Policy Years 1 and 2 has been deducted. The Load Basis Amount varies by sex,    
Issue Age and rating class of the Insured.                                      

The hypothetical values shown in the tables do not reflect any charges for      
federal income taxes or other taxes against Separate Account A since JP         
Financial is not currently making such charges. However, if, in the future, such
charges are made, the gross annual investment rate of return would have to      
exceed the stated investment rates by a sufficient amount to cover the tax      
charges in order to produce the Accumulation Values, Cash Values and Death      
Benefits illustrated.                                                           

The tables illustrate the policy values that would result based on hypothetical 
investment rates of return if premiums are paid in full at the beginning of each
year, if all net premiums are allocated to Separate Account A, and if no policy 
loans have been made. The values would vary from those shown if the assumed     
annual premium payments were paid in installments during a year. The values     
would also vary if the Policyowner varied the amount or frequency of premium    
payments. The tables also assume that the Policyowner has not requested an      
increase or decrease in Specified Amount, that no withdrawals have been made and
no surrender charges imposed, and that no transfers have been made and no       
transfer charges imposed.                                                       

Upon request, we will provide a comparable illustration based upon the proposed 
Insured's age, sex and rating class, the Specified Amount requested, the        
proposed frequency and amount of premium payments and any available riders      
requested. Existing Policyowners may request illustrations based on existing    
Cash Value at the time of request. We reserve the right to charge an            
administrative fee of up to $50 for such illustrations.

 JEFFERSON PILOT FINANCIAL INSURANCE COMPANY

Effective April 30, 1997, the Company, then known as Chubb Life Insurance       
Company of America, was acquired by Jefferson-Pilot Corporation from The Chubb  
Corporation. Effective May 1, 1998, the Company changed its name to Jefferson   
Pilot Financial Insurance Company.                                              

Effective August 1, 2000, Alexander Hamilton Life Insurance Company of America  
("Alexander Hamilton Life") and Guarantee Life Insurance Company ("GLIC") merged
with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving entity. Both       
Alexander Hamilton Life and GLIC were affiliates of the Company. Alexander      
Hamilton Life was a stock life company initially organized under the laws of the
State of North Carolina in 1981, and reincorporated in the State of Michigan in 
September 1995. GLIC was a stock life insurance company incorporated under the  
laws of the State of Nebraska. GLIC originally was organized in 1901 as a mutual
assessment association and, after a period as a mutual life insurance company,  
became a stock life insurance company on December 26, 1995.                     

Upon the merger, the existence of Alexander Hamilton Life and GLIC ceased, and  
the Company became the surviving company. At the time of the merger, the Company
assumed all of the variable annuity contracts issued by Alexander Hamilton and  
the applicable separate account became a separate account of the Company. GLIC  
did not have separate accounts or insurance contracts registered with the SEC.  

In approving the merger on July 14, 2000, the boards of directors of the        
Company, Alexander Hamilton Life and GLIC determined that the merger of three   
financially strong stock life insurance companies would result in an overall    
enhanced capital position and reduced expenses, which together, would be in the 
long-term interests of their respective contract owners. On July 14, 2000, the  
respective 100% stockholders of the Company, Alexander Hamilton Life and GLIC   
voted to approve the merger. In addition, the Nebraska Department of Insurance  
approved the merger.                                                            

 MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE POLICY
GROUP OR SPONSORED ARRANGEMENTS                                                 

Policies may be purchased under group or sponsored arrangements. A group        
arrangement includes a program under which a trustee, employer or similar entity
purchases individual Policies covering a group of individuals on a group basis. 
A sponsored arrangement includes a program under which an employer permits a    
group solicitation of its employees or an association permits group solicitation
of its members for the purchase of Policies on an individual basis.             

We may modify, or provide one time or periodic credits which have the effect of 
modifying, the following types of charges for Policies issued in connection with
group or sponsored arrangement: the cost of insurance charge, surrender or      
withdrawal charges, administrative charges, charges for withdrawal or transfer  
and charges for optional rider benefits. We may also issue Policies in          
connection with group or sponsored arrangements on a "non-medical" or guaranteed
issue basis; actual monthly cost of insurance charges may be higher than the

identical Policies that are medically underwritten. We may also specify         
different minimum Specified Amounts at issue for Policies issued in connection  
with group or sponsored arrangements.                                           

We may also modify or provide one time or periodic credits which have the effect
of modifying, certain charges or modify or eliminate certain underwriting       
requirements for Policies issued in connection with an exchange of another JP   
Financial policy or a policy of any JP Financial affiliate.                     

The amounts of any reduction or credit, the charges to be reduced or credits to 
be provided, the elimination or modification of underwriting requirements and   
the criteria for applying a reduction, credit, elimination, or modification will
generally reflect the reduced sales administrative effort, costs and differing  
mortality experience appropriate to the circumstances giving rise to the        
reduction, credit, elimination, or modification. No reduction, credit,          
elimination, or modification will be made where prohibited by law or which would
be unfairly discriminatory.                                                     

ADMINISTRATION

The Company or its affiliates will provide administrative services. The services
provided by the Company or its affiliates include issuance and redemption of the
Policy, maintenance of records concerning the Policy and certain Owner services.

If the Company or its affiliates do not continue to provide these services, the 
Company will attempt to secure similar services from such sources as may then be
available. Services will be purchased on a basis which, in the Company's sole   
discretion, affords the best service at the lowest cost. The Company, however,  
reserves the right to select a provider of services which the Company, in its   
sole discretion, considers best able to perform such services in a satisfactory 
manner even though the costs for the service may be higher than would prevail   
elsewhere.

 ADMINISTRATOR

Jefferson Pilot Investment Advisory Corporation, an affiliate of the Company,   
maintains records of all purchases and redemptions of Portfolio shares by each  
of the Divisions.                                                               

 PRINCIPAL UNDERWRITER

The Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of the Separate Account, entered   
into an Agreement with Jefferson Pilot Variable Corporation ("JPVC"), One       
Granite Place, Concord, NH to serve as principal underwriter for the continuous 
offering of the Policies. JPVC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Jefferson-Pilot  
Corporation and is an affiliate of the Company. During the years ended December
31, 2002 and December 31, 2003, JPVC received $41,564,380 and $____________,    
respectively, in brokerage commissions and did not retain any of these          
commissions.                                                                    

DISTRIBUTION OF THE POLICY

The Policy will be sold by individuals who, in addition to being licensed as    
Life insurance agents for us, are also registered representatives of            
broker-dealers who have entered into written sales agreements with JPVC. Any    
such broker-dealers will be registered with the SEC and will be members of the  
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. We may also offer and sell     
policies directly.                                                              

We will pay commissions under various schedules and accordingly commissions will
vary with the form of schedule selected. In any event, commissions to registered
representatives are not expected to exceed 95% of first year target premium and 
5% of first year excess premium, and 5% of target premium for the second through
the tenth Policy Years for both renewals and excess premium. Compensation       
arrangements vary among broker-dealers. The Target premium varies by sex, Issue 
Age, rating class of the Insured and Specified Amount. Override payments,       
expense allowances and bonuses based on specific production levels may be paid. 
Alternative Commission Schedules will reflect differences in up-front           
commissions versus ongoing compensation. Except as described in the prospectus, 
no separate deductions from premiums are made to pay sales commissions or sales 
expenses.                                                                       

 PERFORMANCE DATA AND CALCULATIONS

From time to time we may include in our marketing materials performance of the  
Divisions as described below. Please remember that past performance is not an   
estimate or guarantee of future performance and does not necessarily represent  
the actual experience of amounts invested by a particular Policy owner. Also    
please note that performance figures shown do not reflect any applicable taxes. 

MONEY MARKET DIVISION YIELD                                                     

We may include the yield of the Money Market Division in our marketing          
materials. The Yield of the Money Market Division for a seven-day period is     
calculated using a standardized method described in the rules of the            

P-->N-650th�Page�of�64TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�50th
Securities and Exchange Commission. Under this method, the yield quotation is   
computed by determining the net change, exclusive of capital changes, in the    
value of a hypothetical pre-existing account having a balance of one            
Accumulation Unit of the Money Market Division at the beginning of such         
seven-day period, subtracting a hypothetical charge reflecting deductions from  
Policyowner accounts, and dividing the difference by the value of the account at
the beginning of the base period to obtain the base period return, and          
multiplying the base period return by (365/7) with the resulting yield figure   
carried to at least the nearest 100th of 1%. Not included in the calculation is 
the monthly deduction, which consists of the cost of insurance charge, an       
administrative expense charge, an acquisition charge, and the cost of any       
optional benefits. Seven-day yield also does not include the effect of the      
premium tax charge, federal DAC tax charge, the premium load deducted from      
premium payments, any applicable surrender charge, or the guaranteed monthly    
accumulation value adjustment. If the yields shown included those charges, the  
yield shown would be significantly lower.                                       

The seven-day yield of the Money Market Division as of December 31, 2003 was    
0.__%.                                                                          

The yield on amounts held in the Money Market Division normally will fluctuate  
on a daily basis. Therefore, the disclosed yield for any given past period is   
not an indication or representation of future yields or rates of return. The    
Money Market Division's actual yield is affected by changes in interest rates on
money market securities, average portfolio maturity of the JPVF Money Market    
Portfolio, the types and quality of portfolio securities held by the JPVF Money 
Market Portfolio, and its operating expenses.                                   

DIVISION TOTAL RETURN CALCULATIONS                                              

The Company may from time to time also disclose average annual total returns for
one or more of the Divisions for various periods of time. The following table   
reflects the performance of the Divisions, including deductions for management  
and other expenses of the Divisions. It is based on an assumed initial          
investment of $10,000. A Division's total return represents the average annual  
total return of that Division over a particular period. The performance is based
on each Division's unit value and includes a mortality and expense risk charge  
and underlying Portfolio charges. Not included in the calculation is the monthly
deduction, which consists of the cost of insurance charge, an administrative    
expense charge, an acquisition charge, and the cost of any optional benefits.   
This calculation of total return also does not include the effect of the premium
tax charge, federal DAC tax charge, the premium load deducted from premium      
payments, any applicable surrender charge, or the guaranteed monthly            
accumulation value adjustment. If the returns shown included such charges, the  
returns shown would be significantly lower. Total return figures for periods    
less than one year are not annualized.                                          

The total rate of return (T) is computed so that it satisfies the formula:      

 P(1+T)(TO THE POWER OF n) = ERV

where:                                                                    

P    =   a hypothetical initial payment of $10,000.00

ERV    =   ending redeemable value of a hypothetical $10,000.00 payment made at 
the beginning of the one, three, five, or ten-year period as of the end of the  
period (or fractional portion thereof).

(1) The Inception Date is the date of inception of the underlying Portfolios,   
which may be prior to the date the Separate Account or a Division thereof       
commenced operations. The performance for a Division prior to the inception date
of the Division is calculated on a hypothetical basis by applying the Policy    
charges at the rates currently charged to the historical performance of the     
corresponding Portfolio as if the Policy has been in existence back to the      
inception date of the Portfolio.                                                

(2) The total returns of these Portfolios reflect that the investment adviser   
waived all or part of its fee or reimbursed the Portfolio for a portion of its

Item 29.  PERSONS CONTROLLED BY OR UNDER COMMON CONTROL WITH DEPOSITOR OR       
REGISTRANT 

       See Annual Report on Form 10-K of Jefferson-Pilot Corporation, File
No. 1-5955, filed March 27, 2003.                                               

Item 30.  INDEMNIFICATION                                                       

          The following provisions regarding the indemnification of underwriters
and affiliated persons of Registrant are applicable:                            

         Section 21-2004 of the Nebraska Business Corporation Act, in general,
allows a corporation to indemnify any director, officer, employee or agent of   
the corporation for amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred 
by him or her in connection with an action, suit or proceeding, if he or she    
acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or   
not opposed to the best interest of the corporation, and, with respect to any   
criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her    
conduct was unlawful. In a case of a derivative action, no indemnification shall
be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall  
have been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance 
of his or her duty to the corporation, unless a court in which the action was   
brought shall determine that such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to   
indemnify for such expenses which the Court shall deem proper.                  

    Article 6 of the Amended and Restated Charter of Jefferson Pilot
Financial Insurance Company states: "The Corporation shall have the power to    
indemnity its directors to the fullest extent permitted by law."                

      Under the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, Depositor agrees to
indemnify the distributor for any liability that the latter may incur to a      
Policyowner or party-in-interest under a Policy (a) arising out of any act or   
omission in the course of or in connection with rendering services under such   
Agreement, or (b) arising out of the purchase, retention or surrender of a      
Policy; provided that the Depositor will not indemnify the Distributor for any  
such liability that results from the latter's willful misfeasance, bad faith or 
gross negligence, or from the reckless disregard by the latter of its duties and
obligations under the Underwriting Agreement.                                   

         The By-laws of the Distributor, Jefferson Pilot Variable Corporation,
provide that the corporation will indemnify a director, officer, employee or    
agent of the corporation to the full extent of North Carolina law.              

         Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the Securities
Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") may be permitted to directors, officers, or  
controlling persons of the Company pursuant to the foregoing                    

P-->N-661st�Page�of�64TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�61st
provisions, or otherwise, the Company has been advised that in the opinion of   
the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public   
policy as expressed in the 1933 Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the    
event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the 
payment by the Company of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or   
controlling person of the Company in the successful defense of any action, suit 
or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer, or controlling person in  
connection with the securities being registered, the Company will, unless, in   
the opinion of its counsel, the matter has been settled by controlling          
precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question of whether
such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the         
Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

    What is Flexible Premium Adjustable Life Insurance?




























Flexible premium adjustable life insurance allows the most flexibility of the types of whole life insurance in regards to both investment and monthly premiums.






Whole life insurance is different from term as beneficiaries receive payment no matter what age the policy holder passes away.






The amount that a flexible premium adjustable life insurance policyholder pays in ultimately affects how much income she or he will earn from the life insurance policy.

Flexible premium adjustable life insurance is a type of whole life insurance policy that offers individuals the greatest amount of flexibility in terms of their investment choice and monthly premiums. It provides both a death benefit and an investment vehicle. Many individuals opt for such a policy because it provides a form of forced savings for retirement, while also protecting dependents in the event of premature death. 
The first key to understanding this type of insurance is understanding whole life insurance policies. Whole life policies are distinct from term life because the death benefit on a whole life policy is paid no matter when the insured dies. With term policies, the death benefit is paid only during a set period; for example, for his beneficiaries to collect the death benefit on a 30-year term, the insured would have to die within the 30-year period that the policy was active. 
With a whole life policy, premium payments continue for life and the death benefit is paid no matter when the insured dies. Premiums for this type of policy are generally more expensive than those for a term policy. They are also more expensive because the insured pays another fee, over and above the cost of insurance, which is invested in various types of investment vehicles.  

Ad


The payments are invested in one of two ways: the investor may have control over the investments and receive a variable rate of return, or he may have no control over the investment and receive a fixed rate of return. In other words, an investor with a variable policy pays extra premiums that are invested, and then gets to direct the course of that investment, ideally growing his policy, and the amount he is eventually paid. An investor with a fixed rate policy, on the other hand, pays extra premiums in and earns a fixed rate of return, while the insurance company invests those premiums. 
A flexible premium adjustable life insurance policy is an alternative fixed rate policy that gives investors greater freedom. Instead of paying the same premiums every month, the insured can choose to pay within a range. The amount he pays in ultimately affects how much income he will earn from the life insurance policy. 
He also has discretion to direct the investment of his money within the terms of the policy. The money eventually paid out to him in the form of withdrawals or dividends fluctuates based both on how much he paid on a monthly basis and based on how well his investments perform. Some policies may contain a guaranteed minimum rate of return when a policy is purchased, as long as a minimum amount of premiums are paid.

Make sure the financial strength rating is high according to A.M. Best. They rate the best insurance companies. Only 3 percent out of the 3,000 insurances companies in the U.S. have an A+ superior rating. So find one of those, because legally, life insurance companies can wait six months to pay out a death benefit and the average one waits 4.7 months. Also make sure that you are getting what you want out of the program. Lump sum or monthly installments? Income replacement or final expenses? All good things to consider. I would recommend a straight whole life policy that gets locked in at a young age to take care of final expenses and some term with a high face amount to cover your liabilities.

I had an ordinary whole life level premium plan for $750K. My agent passed away and in the fourth year his 'replacement' called to say they had a new and better deal for me. It was called flexible premium adjustable life insurance. The only description he provided was that it provided a surplus or reserve premium to be invested in a variety of capital gain and income producing vehicles.
I told him to leave my original policy untouched, but he could write an additional policy to reach total $1 million. 
Instead, he rewrote entire policy for the "better" policy and collected a $10K commission. I did not know these details until 20 years later, because the new policy was mailed
                            


                                 to the trustee of the family trust who was named the beneficiary. 
The trustee received the policy and simply placed it in our trust file. It was uncovered only 20 years later when we were told premiums had reached a level twice what we had been paying ($21K/year).
In the course of our subsequent communication with the insurer, they admitted a significant error in calculation of the premiums from 20 years ago.
They are now recalculating and, you can imagine, things are a bit tense around here. I guess I should have had the decency to die younger, but at 87 I am now in something of a bind. I can't pay current $44K out of social security.

When shopping for life insurance, it's basically the same thing as shopping around for any product or service - you compare rates and coverage from different life insurance companies.When we had our first child, I started getting life insurance quotes online to see what was available. One site was a good resource. It gave me rates, companies, and coverage options, and by getting a few quotes from three or four companies, I began to learn generally what a good price for certain coverage was. They also have tons of articles, but let's face it: you can't get specific prices without picking what specific coverage you want.Good luck, Alchemy. Hope this helps a bit in your search.

How do I tell if I am paying a good price for life insurance?  If buying life insurance is anything like buying automobile insurance, then prices can vary widely.  I am getting married soon, and I want to buy a motorcycle.  The only way my fiancée will let me have a motorcycle is if I buy some type of life insurance.  Riding bikes can be dangerous in Arizona, and we have a two-year-old daughter so I can agree with her point of view.  My only problem is I don’t know where to start shopping.  Does anyone have any good advice for a relatively young person shopping for life insurance?

Are premiums for a charitable gift of life insurance tax deducible, payable in a lump-sum only, and taxable to the charity after the gift is made?
