St. Mary’s Hospital President, Frank D. Byrne, MD, Announces Plans for Retirement
After ten years of mission and values-driven service, Dr. Frank Byrne announced today he plans to retire from his position as president of St. Mary’s Hospital on January 30, 2015. However, he will remain a member of the board of directors of St. Mary’s Hospital Foundation.
Under Frank’s leadership, St. Mary’s nearly doubled in size with the 2008 completion of its expansion project. St. Mary’s and Dean began their journey toward HIMSS Stage 7 status with the transition to Epic’s electronic health record system. And St. Mary’s Sun Prairie Emergency center opened as a department of St. Mary’s Hospital to serve one of the area’s fastest-growing populations.
During Frank’s tenure St. Mary’s Hospital has flourished; achieving high patient satisfaction as well as exceptional safety and quality standards. In addition, St. Mary’s received numerous awards and recognitions including being named one of the 100 Top Hospitals in 2006, one of the 100 Best Hospitals for Patient Engagement by Becker’s Hospital Review in 2013, one of the nation’s 50 Top Cardiovascular Hospitals in 2014 by Truven Health Analytics, as well as a Press Ganey Guardian of Excellence and Beacon of Excellence in 2014. 
“I want to thank Frank personally for his leadership, both in the hospital and in the community. He is certainly irreplaceable and we wish him, his wife Cindy and their family the very best,” said Damond Boatwright, President of Hospital Operations for SSM Health Care of Wisconsin, the parent organization of St. Mary’s Hospital in Madison, St. Mary’s Janesville Hospital and St. Clare Hospital in Baraboo.
While Frank’s work inside the hospital is impressive, equally as important is the impact he’s made on the Madison area. Frank’s ability to connect with people and forge relationships has created a strong and vibrant reputation for St. Mary’s in Madison. And his volunteerism and willingness to support St. Mary’s in the community has meant he’s been no stranger to Madison’s many celebrations. In addition, he currently serves on the boards of the Madison Community Foundation, the Greater Madison Chamber of Commerce, the Urban League of Greater Madison, the Wisconsin Hospital Association and the Wisconsin Medical Society.
“We’re not originally from the Madison area, but my wife Cindy and I love it here,” expressed Frank Byrne. “The decision to retire was not an easy one for me, but I know it’s the right decision. SSM Health Care, Dean and St. Mary’s have some great ideas for continuing to improve upon the already exceptional care that’s provided. I can leave confident knowing things are headed in the right direction.”
Frank has been active in a number of professional organizations over the years, which included serving on the Board of Governors of the American College of Healthcare Executives (ACHE) and the board of the American College of Physician Executives (now the American Association for Physician Leadership), which inducted him as a Distinguished Fellow. In 2011, he was recognized by Modern Healthcare and Modern Physician magazines as one of the 50 Most Influential Physician Executives in Healthcare; by the University of Wisconsin Department of Family Medicine with the John H. Renner MD “Wisconsin Idea” Award; as well as the ACHE Senior Executive Regents Award. He was inducted into the InBusiness Madison-area Business Hall of Fame in 2012, and was designated a “Champion in Women’s Health” by the Wisconsin Women’s Health Foundation in 2013. Most recently he was named “Citizen of the Year” by the Glacier’s Edge Council of the Boy Scouts.
Prior to coming to St. Mary’s in 2004, Dr. Byrne held a variety of clinical, administrative and governance leadership roles at Parkview Health in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Early in his career, he practiced pulmonary and critical care medicine in Fort Wayne. During his time in Indiana, he was recognized as a Sagamore of the Wabash, the highest honor bestowed by Indiana’s governor, and the Otis R. Bowen MD Distinguished Leadership Award by the Indiana University School of Medicine.  
“I may be retiring but I won’t be slowing down,” said Frank. “I look forward to more time to focus on my other passions including music, in addition to continuing to take advantage of all the Madison area has to offer.”
SSM Health Care will begin a national search for Frank’s replacement immediately.
