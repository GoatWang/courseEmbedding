Product Review


























































Published November 19, 2012
Product Review
A look at some of the latest product offerings in eye care.
By RO Staff


Diagnostic Testing
TearScan
TearScan from Advanced Tear Diagnostics can provide a one-step ocular diagnostic test by measuring tear lactoferrin—the only available diagnostic biomarker to determine aqueous deficiency. The company believes that tear fluid holds the source material needed to identify aqueous deficient dry eye, assist in diagnostic differentiation between aqueous-deficient and evaporative dry eye, and develop effective treatments. 


TearScan also provides data that enables the provider to grade the level of dry eye severity and monitor the effectiveness of treatment. The test, which uses reflectance photometry, takes approximately four minutes and provides measurements with 98% specificity, the company says.

AdenoPlus


Need reassurance in differential diagnosis of conjunctivitis? A new in-office test may help. The FDA-approved, CLIA-waived AdenoPlus is now available in the United States. Using human tears on the inside of the lower eyelid, it detects adenovirus—which is responsible for 90% of all viral conjunctivitis and 25% of acute conjunctivitis cases. 


A technician or physician can perform the test when a patient presents with a red eye or other symptoms of conjunctivitis. The simple four-step test has 90% sensitivity and 96% specificity, takes two minutes to complete, and provides a definite result in less than 10 minutes, according to the company.

Contact Lenses
Astera Multifocal Toric
Launched at Academy 2012 Phoenix, the Astera multifocal toric soft 
lens from Alden Optical features dual elliptical stabilization for 
improved orientation and rotational stability, and center-near 
multifocal optics with large stabilized zones at near and distance. This
 unique approach to stabilization is available in custom prescriptions 
and multiple replacement cycles, including conventional, quarterly, 
bimonthly and monthly. Made with hioxifilcon D, Astera has a 54% water 
content and also is available without cylinder for spherical wearers who
 require custom lens prescriptions or designs.
Visit 

www.aldenoptical.com.  


iSee Ortho-k
Looking for an ortho-k lens to correct patients with high myopic 
powers? You might be able to use the new iSee lens from GP Specialists. 
It incorporates a more aggressive treatment zone that allows 
practitioners to treat patients with higher degrees of myopia, thus 
increasing the number of likely candidates for ortho-k treatment, the 
company says.
iSee brand ortho-k lenses are FDA 
approved up to -3.00D, while extended powers are manufactured as 
doctor-customized designs. The company claims iSee’s corneal reshaping 
design provides faster results and promotes healthy long-term wear for 
the patient.

Optical Design


Video Monitors
If you need to ramp up your sales in the optical, some new video monitors might help you catch more attention from customers. Eye Designs introduces video monitors to promote styles and brands, communicate current trends in fashions and increase product awareness to customers in the optical. 


Displays with motion can increase sales by up to 317%, according to the Point of Purchase and Advertising Institute. As a product option for the Milan collection, Eye Designs currently offers video monitors preloaded with general marketing video content. Eye care professionals also can create and upload their own video content, which can be brand specific and tailored to their opticals.

Eyeglasses
Leonardo Collection 
If you have patients who are tired of carrying around multiple pairs of glasses for different tasks or activities, the Superfocus Leonardo collection might be an option for them. Users can adjust the focus on these eyeglasses for clarity at any distance with an easy-to-use wheel located on the bridge of the frames. 


To avoid distortion, blurriness or “jump” in the wearer’s field of view, Superfocus lenses have no zones or lines. Currently, they are available in light or dark tortoise and may be ordered with clear, tinted or Transitions front lenses. 


Visit 

superfocus.com.
Tablet App


CV-Tablet 
With the new CV-Tablet, you can have full wireless control of Topcon’s CV-5000 automated phoropter and CC-100 digital chart directly from your Android or iPad. This unique app allows you to provide wireless subjective refraction, while giving you the flexibility to move to other exam rooms. 

With the swipe of a finger, you can quickly import, export and print data from Topcon lensmeters, autorefractors and autokeratometers. The CV-Tablet incorporates all refractive tests and visual acuity formats, including LogMar, decimal and feet.

www.topcon-medical.com. 


Sean John Fall/Winter 2012 Collection 
With a variety of patterns, stripes and diagonals, the fall/winter 2012 Sean John eyewear collection has a linear theme. Patterns are milled down into the double-laminate zyl temples to reveal the second color beneath, giving the frames some depth and dimension. 

SJ4058. The flat metal front gives this classic rectangular shape a more modern look. Colors include light gun, navy, brown and black. 

SJ2056. A linear pattern of stripes and diagonals decorate the zyl temples, revealing contrasting color accents. This studious-looking frame is available in black, gray, brown and navy. 

SJ1037. The metal temples on this classic frame are highlighted with a cutout linear pattern, adding contrast. The style is offered in masculine hues, such as gunmetal, brown, olive and black. 

SJ2053. This feminine zyl frame comes in rich hues of red, navy, black and brown that complement its soft rectangular shape.
