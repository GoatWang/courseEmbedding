NCI Building Systems Names Mark W. Dobbins Chief Operating Officer, Bradley D. Robeson and John L. Kuzdal Promoted



Published on 2008-04-01. Author :
SpecialChem









  

 HOUSTON -- NCI Building Systems, Inc. has announced
the promotion of Executive Officers Mark W. Dobbins, Bradley D. Robeson
and John L. Kuzdal. Dobbins, who previously served as President of the
NCI Buildings division, has been named Executive Vice President and Chief
Operating Officer of the Company. In his new role, Dobbins will be responsible
for the day-to-day operations of NCI's business segments, which include
Metal Coil Coatings, Metal Components and Engineered Building Systems.
The presidents of each of NCI's operating divisions will report directly
to Dobbins who, in turn, will report to Norman C. Chambers, NCI's Chairman,
President and Chief Executive Officer. Replacing Dobbins as President
of the NCI Buildings division is Robeson, formerly the President of the
Metal Coil Coatings business segment. Kuzdal, currently Vice President
of Operations, has been promoted to President of the Metal Coil Coatings
segment.

Dobbins, who joined the company in 1988, has held several key leadership
positions, which included a move from Metal Components to the Engineered
Building Systems division in January 2006. As President of NCI Buildings,
he developed a more efficient, customer-centric organization, which resulted
in increased sales, higher profits and improved operating income. "Mark
Dobbins' considerable experience in operations, including business, plant
and staff management, as well as his tenure in both the Metal Components
and Engineered Building Systems segments, will provide tremendous value
to this critical role," said Chambers. "He will be responsible
for the implementation of our strategy, which has been developed with
a goal of doubling our 2007 EBITDA within five years.
"Furthermore, I am confident that Brad Robeson is an exceptional
replacement as President of the NCI Buildings division." Robeson
has more than 20 years of industry experience in various positions of
increasing responsibility. Under his leadership, the Metal Coil Coatings
division has continuously made important operational and strategic advancements
in a changing business environment. He has considerable industry knowledge,
having previously worked in our Engineered Building Systems segment, and
a proven record for profitable business performance.
Since 1986, Kuzdal has worked in the metal coil industry and has been
with Metal Coaters since 1998. In 2006, Kuzdal was promoted to Vice President
of Operations for the Metal Coil Coatings segment. As a result, Kuzdal
was responsible for monitoring the daily operations of the metal coil
companies and was instrumental in implementing best practices throughout
the division which lead to significant improvements in line speeds and
efficiency. His involvement in many of the principal advancements introduced,
along with his close working relationship with Robeson, should provide
a seamless transition of responsibilities.
In addition, NCI announces the resignation of Kelly Ginn, Executive Vice
President of Operations. "Although I am sorry to see Kelly Ginn's
departure, I appreciate his efforts on behalf of NCI and wish him the
best in his future endeavors. As a result of our long-term succession
planning strategies, I am pleased that NCI can turn to experienced individuals
in Mark and the business unit presidents - Kuzdal, Wayne Dickinson, Keith
Fischer and Robeson - who are all extremely capable, knowledgeable, highly-effective
individuals and who have continuously excelled in the most challenging
roles."
About NCI Building Systems, Inc.:
NCI Building Systems, Inc. is one of North America's largest integrated
manufacturers of metal products for the nonresidential building industry.
The Company operates 43 manufacturing and distribution facilities located
in 18 states, as well as Mexico and Canada.
This release contains forward-looking statements concerning NCI's business
and operations and industry conditions, including among others industry
trends, steel pricing, growth expectations and margin expansion. These
statements and other statements identified by words such as "guidance,"
"potential," "expect," "should" and similar
expressions are forward looking statements within the meaning of the "safe
harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks
and uncertainties that may cause NCI's actual performance to differ materially
from that projected in such statements. Among the factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially are the possibility that the anticipated
benefits from the RCC acquisition cannot be fully realized; the possibility
that costs or difficulties related to the integration of the RCC operations
into the Company's operations will be greater than expected; industry
cyclicality and seasonality; fluctuations in demand and prices for steel;
the financial condition of NCI's raw material suppliers; competitive activity
and pricing pressure; ability to execute NCI's acquisition strategy; and
general economic conditions affecting the construction industry. Item
1A "Risk Factors" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended October 28, 2007, identifies other important
factors, though not necessarily all such factors, that could cause future
outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in the forward- looking
statements. NCI expressly disclaims any obligation to release publicly
any updates or revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect
any changes in its expectations.
