True to Our Heritage
Appleton Partners was founded on the same principle it follows today: the best approach to achieving a client’s specific objectives is through separate account management. Since 1986, we have stayed true to our belief in managing every relationship and each account to meet the unique needs of our clients. We are the antithesis of a one-size-fits-all mentality, offering objective advice and customized portfolios to address the specific assets and aspirations of our client.


Longevity and Legacy
Our portfolio managers average more than 25 years of investment experience, having executed investment strategies in some of the most challenging economic environments. Empowered by familiarity with market complexities and dynamics, our seasoned team of market professionals leverages its collective experience, skills and wisdom to manage portfolio strategies to meet the long-term objectives of our clients.




Established Relationships
The longevity of our client relationships, many of whom are multi-generational, is a testament to the trust and confidence our clients instill in us as partners in wealth management. We manage over $8 billion in client assets for high-net worth-individuals, corporations, foundations, and pension and profit-sharing plans in 45 states and abroad.


In the Community
We realize that a critical element of our longevity and success is our dedication to a principle-based work environment, sensitive to our clients' needs, and our support of what's important to them, their families and their businesses. Similarly, we have devoted ourselves to the charitable efforts of the Community we serve with this awareness. Appleton is committed to giving back through corporate, and individual colleagues' efforts, in philanthropy, volunteer opportunities and sponsorships.

Active, Disciplined Account Management



















We support a comprehensive investment management offering to meet the specific needs of our clients, who range from individual to institutional investors, from family offices to foundations.




> Active Management 

Research and Customization 
 







Active Account Management
Our experienced team of portfolio managers actively manages accounts to take advantage of opportunities as financial markets and economic trends evolve. While our goal of maximizing growth and minimizing volatility remains steadfast, we seek investment solutions that reflect the ever-changing marketplace and meet our clients' dynamic investment goals. To make our investment decisions, we use both technical and fundamental analyses and consider the impact of economic cycles.




Disciplined Investment Management and Monitoring
From initial portfolio construction to monitoring, our investment approach is deliberate and dynamic. Our portfolios are built with strict buy/sell disciplines and are proactively rebalanced based on evolving client objectives and our fundamental outlook on individual securities, investment markets and global economies. We monitor portfolios through fundamental market changes, routinely assessing new market information in the context of historical norms as part of a long-term strategy. In addition, teams overseeing each investment management strategy periodically review the individual portfolios to ensure they are strictly adhering to their set guidelines and strategic objectives.





Investment Management Styles



Municipal Fixed Income

The municipal market, with 1.4 million issues, offers managers myriad ways to customize portfolios to preserve capital, grow principal and provide competitive tax-free returns. We invest primarily in defensive, intermediate bonds, emphasizing very high quality and reduced interest rate risk.

Taxable Fixed Income Market

With the goal of preservation of capital and long-term growth of principal and income, we invest primarily in bonds with intermediate maturities to maintain consistent returns and a conservative risk profile.

Short-term Investments

This short-term investment strategy is designed to simultaneously provide principal preservation, liquidity and tax-efficient total return for cash reserves for individuals, corporations, public funds, endowments and pension plans.

Large Cap Equity

In addition to considering factors influencing the global and domestic markets, we focus on stocks with accelerating profits, unit growth, relative pricing power, high or improving margins, and companies with strong positions. We select investments with the most opportunity based on a client's objectives and risk tolerance.

Income Advantage

This strategy seeks to offer a balanced single investment solution to conservatively generate income with added potential for capital appreciation.  Our balanced account structure generally allows for tax efficiency and customization, utilizing a blend of liquid investment grade taxable or municipal bonds, with high dividend yielding stocks and ETFs. 

Value Opportunities Equity

This strategy seeks to employ a bottom-up, fundamental investment philosophy with a goal of identifying equity securities trading at prices well below their intrinsic value. We believe our key advantages include portfolio concentrated in our highest conviction names, flexible investment mandate, long-term orientation and an ability to hold cash until the market presents opportunities. 

Balanced Asset Management

Our balanced portfolios combine equity and fixed income to deliver long-term growth and income while minimizing risk and tax liabilities. Guided by a client's asset allocation, portfolios feature a blend of stocks and bonds.

            Appleton Partners, established in 2000, is a diversified, no-load, open-end management investment company. It seeks long-term growth of capital by investing primarily in common stock. The firm declares and pays dividends each year that are at least 98 percent of its net investment income and net realized capital gains, in order to prevent the imposition of excise tax that would be otherwise applicable. The firm has its office in Boston.
