Savings and Loan Association Also found in: Dictionary, Thesaurus, Financial, Encyclopedia, Wikipedia.
		

Savings and Loan AssociationA financial institution owned by and operated for the benefit of those using its services. The savings and loan association's primary purpose is making loans to its members, usually for the purchase of real estate or homes. The savings and loan industry was first established in the 1830s as a building and loan association. The first savings and loan association was the Oxford Provident Building Society in Frankfort, Pennsylvania. As a building and loan association, Oxford Provident received regular weekly payments from each member and then lent the money to individuals until each member could build or purchase his own home. Building and loan associations were financial intermediaries, which acted as a conduit for the flow of investment funds between savers and borrowers. Savings and loan associations may be state or federally chartered. When formed under state law, savings and loan associations are generally incorporated and must follow the state's requirements for incorporation, such as providing articles of incorporation and bylaws. Although it depends on the applicable state's law, the articles of incorporation usually must set forth the organizational structure of the association and define the rights of its members and the relationship between the association and its stockholders. A savings and loan association may not convert from a state corporation to a federal corporation without the consent of the state and compliance with state laws. A savings and loan association may also be federally chartered. Federal savings and loan associations are regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision. Members of a savings and loan association are stockholders of the corporation. The members must have the capacity to enter into a valid contract, and as stockholders they are entitled to participate in management and share in the profits. Members have the same liability as stockholders of other corporations, which means that they are liable only for the amount of their stock interest and are not personally liable for the association's Negligence or debts. Officers and directors control the operation of the savings and loan association. The officers and directors have the duty to organize and operate the institution in accordance with state and federal laws and regulations and with the same degree of diligence, care, and skill that an ordinary prudent person would exercise under similar circumstances. The officers and directors are under the common-law duty to exercise due care as well as the duty of loyalty. Officers and directors may be held liable for breaches of these common-law duties, for losses that result from violations of state and federal laws and regulations, or even for losses that result from a violation of the corporation's bylaws. The responsibilities of the officers and directors of a savings and loan association are generally the same as the responsibilities of officers and directors of other corporations. They must select competent individuals to administer the institution's affairs, establish operating policies and internal controls, monitor the institution's operations, and review examination and audit reports. Furthermore, they also have the power to assess losses incurred and to decide how the institution will recover those losses. Prior to the 1930s, savings and loan associations flourished. However, during the Great Depression the savings and loan industry suffered. More than 1,700 institutions failed, and because depositor's insurance did not exist, customers lost all of the money they had deposited into the failed institutions. Congress responded to this crisis by passing several banking acts. The Federal Home Loan Bank Act of 1932, 12 U.S.C.A. §§ 1421 et seq., authorized the government to regulate and control the financial services industry. The legislation created the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) to oversee the operations of savings and loan institutions. The Banking Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 162, created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to promote stability and restore and maintain confidence in the nation's banking system. In 1934, Congress passed the National Housing Act, 12 U.S.C.A. §§ 1701 et seq., which created the National Housing Administration (NHA) and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC). The NHA was created to protect mortgage lenders by insuring full repayment, and the FSLIC was created to insure each depositor's account up to $5,000. The banking reform in the 1930s restored depositors' faith in the savings and loan industry, and it was once again stable and prosperous. However, in the 1970s the industry began to feel the impact of competition and increased interest rates; investors were choosing to invest in money markets rather than in savings and loan associations. To boost the savings and loan industry, Congress began deregulating it. Three types of deregulation took place during this time. The first major form of deregulation was the enactment of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 (94 Stat. 132). The purpose of this legislation was to allow investors higher rates of return, thus making the savings and loan associations more competitive with the money markets. The industry was also allowed to offer money-market options and provide a broader range of services to its customers. The second major form of deregulation was the enactment of the Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982 (96 Stat. 1469). This act allowed savings and loan associations to diversify and invest in other types of loans besides home construction and purchase loans, including commercial loans, state and municipal Securities, and unsecured real estate loans. The third form of deregulation decreased the amount of regulatory supervision. This deregulation was not actually an "official" deregulation; instead it was the effect of a change in required accounting procedures. The Generally Accepted Accounting Principles were changed to Regulatory Accounting Procedures, which allowed savings and loan associations to include speculative forms of capital and exclude certain liabilities, thus making the thrifts appear to be in solid financial positions. This resulted in more deregulation. In the 1980s, the savings and loan industry collapsed. By the late 1980s at least one-third of the savings and loan associations were on the brink of insolvency. Eight factors were primarily responsible for the collapse: a rigid institutional design, high and volatile interest rates, deterioration of asset quality, federal and state deregulation, fraudulent practices, increased competition in the financial services industry, and tax law changes. In an effort to restore confidence in the thrift industry, Congress enacted the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) (103 Stat. 183). The purpose of FIRREA, as set forth in Section 101 of the bill, was to promote a safe and stable system of affordable housing finance; improve supervision; establish a general oversight by the Treasury Department over the director of the Office of Thrift Supervision; establish an independent insurance agency to provide deposit insurance for savers; place the Federal Deposit Insurance System on sound financial footing; create the Resolution Trust Corporation; provide the necessary private and public financing to resolve failed institutions in an expeditious manner; and improve supervision, enhance enforcement powers, and increase criminal and civil penalties for crimes of Fraud against financial institutions and their depositors. FIRREA increased the enforcement powers of the federal banking regulators and conferred a wide array of administrative sanctions. FIRREA also granted federal bank regulators the power to hold liable "institution-affiliated parties" who engage in unsound practices that harm the insured depository institution. The institution-affiliated parties include directors, officers, employees, agents, and any other persons, including attorneys, appraisers, and accountants, participating in the institution's affairs. FIRREA also allows federal regulators to seize the institution early, before it is "hopelessly insolvent" and too expensive for federal insurance funds to cover. Criminal penalties were also increased, in 1990, by the crime control act, 104 Stat. 4789, which included the Comprehensive Thrift and Bank Fraud Prosecution and Taxpayer Recovery Act of 1990 (104 Stat. 4859). This act increased the criminal penalties "attaching" to crimes related to financial institutions. FIRREA created the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) and the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). FIRREA eliminated the FHLBB and created the OTS to take its place. The RTC was created solely to manage and dispose of the assets of thrifts that failed between 1989 and August 1992. In addition, the FSLIC was eliminated, and the FDIC, which oversaw the banking industry, began dealing with the troubled thrifts. The RTC was in existence for six years, closing its doors on December 31, 1996. During its existence, it merged or closed 747 thrifts and sold $465 billion in assets, including 120,000 pieces of property. The direct cost of resolving the failed thrifts amounted to $90 billion; however, analysts claim that it will take approximately 30 years to fully bail out the savings and loan associations at a cost of approximately $480.9 billion.

L DEVELOPMENTS IN THE U.S. FINANCIAL SYSTEM SINCE THE MID-1970S 

Some of the most profound financial changes in U.S. history have occurred since the end of 1976, including new kinds of investment and credit arrangements that have been accompanied by derivative in-struments such as financial futures, options, and swaps. 

14

 TREASURY AND FEDERAL RESERVE FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPERATIONS 

The dollar came under heavy downward pressure in mid-August and again in Octo-ber to close the three-month period under review down 7 to 8 percent on balance against major foreign currencies. 

18

 INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION 

Industrial production increased an esti-mated 0.6 percent in October.

 STATEMENTS TO CONGRESS 

Alan Greenspan, Chairman, Board of Gov-ernors, presents the views of the Board on modernizing our financial system to adapt it to the important changes in technology and competition that have already transformed financial markets here and abroad, before the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions Supervision, Regulation and Insurance of the House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs, November 18, 1987. 27 Martha R. Seger, Member, Board of Gov-ernors, discusses the rapid expansion of home equity lines of credit and says that the Board shares with the Congress the goal that consumers receive adequate informa-tion when they contract for home equity loans, before the Subcommittee on Con-sumer Affairs of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, No-vember 18, 1987. 31 H. Robert Heller, Member, Board of Gov-ernors, discusses criminal misconduct and insider abuse in our nation's financial insti-tutions and says that significant progress has been made in dealing with these prob-lems, before the Subcommittee ori Com-merce, Consumer and Monetary Affairs of the House Committee on Government Op-erations, November 19, 1987.

 RECORD OF FOLIC Y ACTIONS OF THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE 

At its meeting on September 22, 1987, all of the members of the Committee indicated that they preferred or could accept a direc-tive that called for maintaining the slightly firmer degree of reserve pressure that had been sought in recent weeks. With regard to possible adjustments during the intermeet-ing period, the members indicated that somewhat greater reserve restraint or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable depending on developments re-lating to inflation, the strength of the busi-ness expansion, and the performance of the 
























 

dollar in foreign exchange markets, while also taking account of the behavior of the monetary aggregates. The contemplated provision of reserves was expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 at annual rates of around 4 percent and around 6 percent respectively, for the four-month period from August to December. Growth in Ml was expected to remain relatively slow over the same period. Because of the unusual uncertainty relating to the behavior of Ml and in keeping with the decision not to set a longer-run target for this aggregate, the Committee decided to continue the practice of not specifying a numerical ex-pectation for its short-run growth. The members agreed that the intermeeting range for the federal funds rate should be raised from 4 to 8 percent to 5 to 9 percent.

 STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE IN THE CURRENT EXPANSION

Proposal for new regulation to carry out provisions of the Expedited Funds Avail-ability Act; proposal to amend Regulation Z to require increased disclosures about home equity lines of credit much earlier in the credit-granting process. Proposed revisions to official staff commen-taries on Regulations B, E, and Z. Admission of seven state banks to member-ship in the Federal Reserve System.

 RECORD OF POLICY ACTIONS OF THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE 

-A 

At the FOMC meeting on November 3, 1987, all of the members indicated their support of a directive that called for main-taining the degree of reserve pressure that had been sought in recent days. The mem-bers recognized that the volatile conditions 
























 

in financial markets and related uncertain-ties in the business outlook might continue to indicate the need for special flexibility in the conduct of open market operations. Such an approach to policy implementation would depend in particular on the strength of demands for liquidity stemming from recent and prospective developments in fi-nancial markets. To the extent that the functioning of those markets permitted a return to more normal open market opera-tions, the members indicated that some-what lesser reserve restraint would be ac-ceptable, while slightly greater reserve restraint might be acceptable, depending on the strength of the business expansion, in-dications of inflation, the performance of the dollar in foreign exchange markets, with account also taken of the behavior of the monetary aggregates. The members be-lieved that the outlook for monetary growth over the months ahead was subject to un-usual uncertainty, but the contemplated re-serve conditions were thought likely to be consistent with somewhat faster growth in M2 and M3 than had been expected earlier; such growth might center on annual rates of around 6 to 7 percent for the period from September through December. Largely re-flecting the bulge in October, growth in Ml in the fourth quarter as a whole was ex-pected to be well above its average pace in the previous several months. However, be-cause of the very substantial uncertainty that still surrounded the outlook for Ml, the Committee decided to continue its practice of not specifying a numerical expectation for its growth. The members agreed that the intermeeting range for the federal funds rate, which provides a mechanism for initi-ating consultation of the Committee when its boundaries are persistently exceeded, should be reduced from 5 to 9 percent to 4 to 8 percent.

savings and loan (redirected from Federal Savings and Loan Association)Also found in: Dictionary, Thesaurus, Financial, Acronyms, Encyclopedia.Related to Federal Savings and Loan Association: Building and Loan Associations


savings and loann. a banking and lending institution, chartered either by a state or the Federal government.  Savings and loans only make loans secured by real property from deposits, upon which they pay interest slightly higher than that paid by most banks.  In the early 1980s savings and loans were "de-regulated," allowing them to make loans for speculative land development, removing high reserve funds requirements, and in allowing savings and loans' funds to participate in competition with banks.  The result was use of many savings and loans for speculative and dishonest investments, lack of controls, and tremendous losses to thousands of depositors.  However, a properly-managed, conservative savings and loan which concentrates on real estate loans guaranteed by the FHA (Federal Housing Administration) and/or sold in the secondary mortgage market can be safe, profitable, and provide a valuable channel for savings into the home finance market.

New York: Industrial Hemp Farmer Promotes Crop As Sustainable Option

Mon, 07/10/2017 - 18:48 - restore



New York hemp farmer believes industrial hemp could be crop that puts the North Country on the map
By Michael Bachara
Hemp News
An Ellisburg company, one of six around the state to be awarded a permit to grow industrial hemp for research, believes hemp will flourish in New York.
Mark Privitera, an industrial hemp farmer, believes hemp can be used as house insulation and the wood core can be carbonized to store energy. Privitera's ultimate goal would be an industrial hemp processing plant in Watertown within 3-5 years, which would produce industrial hemp products for commercial sale.

North Dakota: Industrial Hemp Production Expands, Farmers Excited For Future

Wed, 06/14/2017 - 20:57 - restore



By Michael Bachara
Hemp News
Over the past few years, North Dakota's hemp production has grown into the third-largest in the nation behind Kentucky and Colorado. This year, there were 3,124 acres accepted for North Dakota’s 2017 industrial hemp program. In 2016, 70 acres of hemp were planted. The boom brought interest from processing plants, with several scheduled to open by harvest.
At the moment, Healthy Oilseeds, located in Carrington, is the only processing plant certified to handle hemp in the state. The processing plant offers milling, roasting and cold press. "There’s a possibility the new plant could be built yet this year in an effort to get in on part of this season’s production", according to Healthy Oilseeds President Roger Gussiaas.

Kentucky: University of Louisville Studying Industrial Hemp for Fuel

Thu, 05/18/2017 - 21:50 - restore



By Michael Bachara
Hemp News
For a second consecutive year, the University of Louisville's Conn Center for Renewable Energy is planting industrial hemp at the school’s Belknap Campus. The university is planting two types of hemp and kenaf to research their potential as renewable energy resources. 
The study will focus on the potential for the crops to fulfill energy needs and become a replacement source for biofuels, fibers and 3-D printer applications.
The research will be included in the Kentucky Department of Agriculture's Industrial Hemp Research Pilot Program.
Interim president of U of L, Greg Postel, stated that researchers are seeking "unusual answers to renewable energy questions."
“Having the crops grow on campus actually raises awareness about the research that we have going on at Conn Center,” said Assistant Director Andrew Marsh.
"What we do with this plant matter is actually convert it into substances that will help solve energy problems, so the mission of the center is to work on technologies to lessen our dependence on fossil fuels, and this industrial hemp and kenaf planting is one of those research directions," said Marsh.
Many farmers in Kentucky believe hemp could help revitalize Kentucky’s agricultural sector, and the hope is the research at Conn will help students and scientists study the crop’s potential as a fuel.

South Dakota: Bill Seeks To Allow Hemp Cultivation (HB 1054)

Mon, 02/01/2016 - 20:52 - restore



By Michael Bachara, Hemp News
Earlier this month, Rep. Mike Verchio (R-Hill City) along with a bipartisan coalition of 39 cosponsors introduced House Bill 1054 (HB 1054). The legislation would allow people to apply to the state Department of Agriculture for a license to grow industrial hemp, if they pass background checks. 
"Cultivation of the plant could be a force for economic development in South Dakota if misconceptions about hemp can be dispelled," said Republican Rep. Mike Verchio, the proposal's sponsor. 
Verchio sees benefits from allowing cultivation beyond the producers who grow it. "Hemp fields could feed manufacturing facilities to turn the plant into products ranging from mortar to fiberboard," he said.
"Industrial hemp is a farm crop, and it offers great benefits to industry," said North American Industrial Hemp Council Chairman Erwin Sholts, who has promoted hemp for decades.
HB 1054 was referred to the House Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee. It's first step will be getting out of the committee by a majority vote before moving on to the full House for a vote. The committee hearing is scheduled for Tuesday, Feb. 2.
South Dakota Attorney Genera Marty Jackley has not taken a position on the measure.
The bill is patterned after North Dakota's industrial hemp law.

Maine: Cultivating Hemp for Fiber, Food, Fuel, Moving Forward

Mon, 02/01/2016 - 18:05 - restore



By Michael Bachara, Hemp News
Because of hemp's value as a cash crop, states such as Maine have turned to hemp to help farmers prosper. The state is one of the most recent to join the nationwide effort to research hemp farming, which gained momentum when the federal government eased restrictions with the 2014 Farm Bill.
In 2015, after Gov. LePage vetoed LD 4, an act to promote industrial hemp, state lawmakers showed their support for the bill by overriding his veto. The House voted for the bill 135-6, with 10 members absent. The Senate approved it 28-6.
In 2015, Jon Olson of the Maine Farm Bureau testified in front of the state's legislative committee on Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, that his organization opposed the federal ban on hemp farming and saying of the state's farmers: "This could be a value-added crop that could help them," he testified.
John Jemison, an agricultural specialist at the University of Maine Cooperative Extension, is among several researchers in New England investigating hemp as a crop that could be grown for everything from fishing ropes to insulation and seeds rich in nutrients and protein.
“It has the potential to be a really good rotation crop,” Jemison told farmers at the Maine Potato Conference this month at the Caribou Inn and Convention Center.
Hemp and marijuana are varieties of the cannabis plant, which has “been domesticated about as long as we’ve had agriculture,” according to Jemison.

Kentucky: First Legal Hemp Crop In 70 Years Harvested

Wed, 09/24/2014 - 02:30 - steveelliott



By Steve Elliott
Hemp News
The first legal hemp harvest in Kentucky in 70 years has begun at the University of Kentucky. Researchers on Tuesday cut their test plot, which will now remain in the field for two weeks.
The 10-foot stalks will remain on the ground at Spindletop Farm for "retting," the process through which they break apart, said David Williams, an agronomist at the UK College of Agriculture, reports Janet Patton at the Herald-Leader.
"Microbes break down the tissues of the stem," Williams said. "The outside tissues form the bast fibers and the inside form the hurd fibers."
Thirteen varieties of hemp were sown this spring at the University; each will be evaluated for fiber and seed production. More test plots are at other universities in the state, including Murray State.
"It was a good growing season for many crops, not just hemp," Williams said. "Precipitation was excellent this year and more than adequate for growth.
"The only downside to the growing season was that we planted a little bit late, but I don't think that had much effect on the crop," he said.
The seeds had been held up for two weeks in Louisville by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which blocked them because the Kentucky Department of Agriculture didn't have a controlled substance import permit.

United States: Hemp for Fuel, Fiber and Freedom 

Tue, 07/23/2013 - 21:17 - paulstanford



By D. Paul Stanford, CRRH, Executive Director
Marijuana prohibition is really about suppressing hemp fuel and hemp fiber from competition with capital intensive, environmentally-harmful, mostly synthetic alternatives. This simple oil lamp demonstrates why they made up the 'marijuana' myth to stop competition to petrochemical fuels. We don't need to fight wars for petroleum because we can replace petroleum with hemp seed oil for fuel, plastics and most everything else. Marijuana prohibition is really about money, power and the further centralization of economic and political control. It is really about social and economic justice.

Canada: Hemp helped British colonialism take root

Sun, 02/12/2012 - 00:48 - restore


By Susan Mcguire, The Gazette
Photograph by William Eaves, Jr. 
 Hemp breakfast cereal, hemp clothing, hemp hand cream - all available in perfectly respectable stores. Is this the same hemp that is illegal to grow in Canada? No, not at all.
These products come from what is called industrial hemp (Cannabis sativa L), a distant cousin of the marijuana plant. Both are part of a diverse plant species of more than 500 varieties that includes the hops used to make beer.
Farmers have been cultivating industrial hemp for 10,000 years, starting in Mesopotamia (Iraq) and in China's Yellow River Valley. For centuries, people used hemp fibre to make clothes, rope, sails and paper; they stewed, roasted and milled the grain for food; and used the oil for cosmetics, lighting, paints and varnishes.
In the 1660s and 1670s, Jean Talon encouraged the farmers of New France to grow hemp by giving them free seed, which they had to plant immediately and replace with seed from their next year's crop. So important was hemp that he confiscated all the thread in the colony and gave it back only in return for hemp. Women needed thread, and he knew that would put pressure on their husbands to grow the crop. However, production collapsed when Talon went back to France.

United States: More states want federal government's OK to grow hemp

Sat, 11/05/2011 - 04:12 - restore


It hasn't gotten the attention of medical marijuana, but a growing number of states have passed laws authorizing the growth of hemp and are attempting to get the federal government to make it legal nationwide.
By Tim Johnson and Adam Silverman, USA TODAY
 Hemp can be cultivated for fiber or oilseed, and it is used to make thousands of products worldwide, including clothing and auto parts. From 1999 through last year, 17 states have enacted measures that would either permit controlled cultivation or authorize research of industrial hemp, according to the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML).
Colorado was the most recent to authorize research in 2010. Maine, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon, Vermont and West Virginia have passed laws authorizing cultivation, according to NORML.
Hemp and marijuana are different varieties of the same species of plant, Cannabis Sativa. Industrial hemp has lower THC content, the primary psychoactive component of marijuana.
The federal government classifies all cannabis plants as marijuana and places strict controls on the cultivation of hemp. Industrial hemp was an American staple in colonial times. The output peaked during World War II.

Oregon: Naturally Advanced Technologies and Carhartt Enter Into Development Agreement

Naturally Advanced Technologies Inc. develops renewable and environmentally sustainable biomass resources from flax, hemp and other bast fibers.
By Michael Bachara, Hemp News Correspondent
 Naturally Advanced Technologies Inc. (NAT) announced that it has entered into a short-term Crailar Flax fiber development agreement with Carhartt to support evaluation of processing Crailar Flax fiber in premium grade work wear.  
Established in 1889 and based in Dearborn, Michigan, Carhartt is a global work wear brand with a heritage of developing rugged apparel for workers on and off the job.
"Carhartt aligns perfectly with our current portfolio and we are excited to add them to our growing mix of partner brands," said Ken Barker, CEO of Naturally Advanced Technologies.
"Our testing to-date has demonstrated significant qualities that will be beneficial to the work wear market, including increased tensile strength, reduced shrinkage and high dye uptake that can reduce chemical usage," Barker continued. 
"Perhaps most important is Crailar's ability to wick moisture, which provides Carhartt with a performance advantage by ensuring consumers stay cooler in hot summer months. We look forward to demonstrating this during our development period with Carhartt," explained Barker

Canada: Government Investing in Opportunities for Hemp Farmers

Canada is investing in innovation that will help develop new bio-composites derived from hemp fibers.

By Michael Bachara, Hemp News Correspondent
 SASKATCHEWAN - Members of Parliament have pledged funding for the Composites Innovation Centre (CIC) to study hemp fibers with the goal of making composites that perform better than fiberglass and plastic.
"Finding new and innovative uses for our flax and hemp will greatly benefit farmers and the economy in Western Canada," said MP Bruinooge. "This investment will enable farmers to adapt their growth and harvesting regimes to optimize fibre performance, increasing the demand for their crops and resulting in increased profitability."
The investment through the Canadian Agricultural Adaptation Program (CAAP) is designed to study the sub-molecular structure of hemp fibers. 
"This exciting collaboration between the CIC and our world-class Canadian synchrotron facility will provide our local and national biomass industries with a key competitive edge in a growing international marketplace," says CIC Manager of Product Innovation Simon Potter. "The information we generate with the Canadian Light Source will support the high penetration of agricultural fibers into building materials and composites for automotive and aerospace products."

Germany: BMW Betting on Electric Lounge Car With Hemp Floor to Hold Off VW’s Audi

Mon, 08/08/2011 - 21:22 - restore


By Chris Reiter, Bloomberg
 Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) will give a new electric-powered city car a lounge feel with bench seats, naturally tanned “mocha brown” leather and hemp fibers in the floor covering to hold off Volkswagen AG (VOW)’s Audi.
BMW for the first time showed concept versions of the i3 electric city car and the i8 hybrid supercar, which Chief Executive Officer Norbert Reithofer said will cost more than 100,000 euros ($143,000), in Frankfurt today. The models, developed from scratch, will anchor BMW’s new “i” sub-brand.
“The majority of current electric vehicles are so-called conversions of traditional vehicles but conversions are always compromises,” development chief Klaus Draeger said. “We wanted to bring e-mobility to the streets without compromise.”
BMW is betting that the 530 million euros investment to set up production of the vehicles will pay off in the race with Audi, which overtook Daimler AG (DAI)’s Mercedes-Benz this year and has vowed to topple the Munich-based carmaker as the luxury-car leader by 2015. Initial volumes for the models could be in the “tens of thousands,” with the potential to grow rapidly depending on market and regulatory developments, sales chief Ian Robertson told Bloomberg TV.

Global: Canadian EV to be Pimped Out with Hemp Bio Composite Interior

Fri, 07/08/2011 - 23:35 - restore


By Silvia Pikal, Mobile Mag
 While hemp can be used for food, textiles, paper, fabric, and fuel oil, the misunderstood crop breeds fear amongst politicians in the United States and has led to the crop being illegal to grow without a DEA permit, which is pretty hard to get. But growing hemp is legal in Canada. Canadian company Motive Industries has taken advantage of this, and have been working on an electric car made of hemp plastic. Touted as Canada’s first bio composite electric car, the Motive Kestrel’s top speed is 135 km/h, with a range of 160 km. The ultralight car is a 3 door 4 passenger electric vehicle, and packs 16 kWh of lithium battery juice to keep the car going 160 kilometers per charge.
Now Motive has announced that bio composite materials derived from hemp and flax fibre will also be used in the car’s interior. They will be used to create the headliner, door panels, door trim, floor tub and center tunnel, instrument panel and the center console panel. The prototype should be coming out sometime this year, with a production goal of 2012.

United States: From the HEART - Feral Hemp Makes 35 Tons of Fiber and Four Tons of Seeds Per Acre

Thu, 04/21/2011 - 18:18 - restore



By Paul Stanford, Hemp News Director
 Hemp seeds produce more oil and protein than any other plant per land area cultivated. Hemp protein and oil are rich in the essential fatty acids (EFAs) that our brain and cardiovascular system need, Omega 3 & 6, in the perfect ratio for optimal human health. Hemp protein has all 8 amino acids, again, in just the right balance to meet humans' nutritional needs.
Per acre, according to a study published in the Notre Dame University journal, The American Midland Naturalist, wild hemp here in the USA produces 8,500 pounds of seed per acre. The study is called: An Ecological Study of Naturalized Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) in East-Central Illinois, by Alan Haney and Benjamin B. Kutscheid at the University of Indiana at Urbana, Department of Biology.

Canada: Canola, flax aren't just for eating, anymore

Fri, 04/15/2011 - 20:52 - restore


By Gabrielle Giroday, Winnepeg Free Press
 Bet you never thought a bus part might be made with hemp, canola and flax.
But Helena Marak, Manitoba Rural Adaptation Council program coordinator, sees possibilities for the products you might be more used to encountering on the shelves of your local health-food store.
Marak stood Saturday morning with a brown University of Manitoba prototype at the Agriculture in the City event at The Forks.
"People have really found this interesting. They marvel at the strength of it. It's really, really strong, it's durable and, of course, it's made with natural fibres that are grown right here in Manitoba, so that's a big bonus," said Marak.
She said hemp fibres left over from making food products can be used for other purposes, like products for the transportation or aerospace industry such as car door panels.
The three-day event is dedicated to educating the public about farmers, agriculture science and research, and uses for Manitoba crops beyond the table.
Event organizer Reg Sims said it started in 2003 and is expected to draw thousands of people.
"At one time, everybody in the city had an uncle or a grandparent that lived on a farm. They'd go to the farm, they knew their milk came from cows, their hamburgers came from cows," said Sims. He said he believes farmers are "the greatest stewards of our land."
"Agriculture is a lot more than food," he said.

Oregon: Hemp Medium Density Fiberboard - Hemp Equals Jobs

Thu, 03/31/2011 - 05:11 - restore


Oregon Hemp History, Connecting the Past to the Future

By Michael Bachara, Hemp News Correspondent
 In the early 1990's, C & S Specialty Builder's Supply (namely Bill Conde, Dave Seber, Barry Davis, and Tim Pate) in Harrisburg, Oregon, imported regulated bales of hemp and began working on a medium density fiberboard (MDF). The evolution of hemp MDF as a viable building supply option began when Bill Conde of C & S took their hemp fiber research and ideas to Paul Maulberg, the head of Washington State University's Wood Engineering Laboratory.
Conde explains in a 2005 Mycotopia blog, "We asked if [Maulberg] would consider trying some hemp fiber to make some experimental hemp MDF, and his reply was, 'You bet, hemp is the King Cong of fiber. I would love a chance to work with some."
Excitedly, Conde and team began the process working with Maulberg on creation and testing of the hemp MDF. It was soon discovered how strong the hemp fiber truly was, as the full-length hemp fibers jammed both of the processing machines and brought things to a standstill. The process for breaking down the fibers was redesigned and restarted with ultimate success.

United States: Naturally Advanced Strikes Deal with Hanes

Wed, 12/01/2010 - 20:25 - restore


By Christina Williams, Sustainable Business Oregon
 Naturally Advanced Inc. announced Wednesday that Hanesbrands Inc. will buy as much as $375,000 worth of the natural-fiber company's new Crailar Flax material for testing in its products.
Both companies recently finished trials of Naturally Advanced's new Crailar Flax product, which is being developed by the company to follow its Crailar Hemp offering, which was purchased by Hanes earlier this year.
Naturally Advanced is led by Portland-based CEO Ken Barker, a former Adidas executive. Barker said in a press release, "We believe this next step is a significant validation of our technology and we look forward to bringing Crailar Flax fiber to consumers in 2011."
Naturally Advanced had been focusing its business on a hemp-based fiber, with operations based in Vancouver, Canada, where laws don't restrict the use of hemp. In the last year, the company has focused on proving its technology with flax fiber, which is more readily available in the U.S., said Naturally Advanced spokeswoman Erin Brunner.
The company also has a processing facility in South Carolina.
Brunner said that flax is a winter crop in South Carolina that rotates well with cotton, soybeans and tobacco, allowing farmers there to double-crop their land and increase their income.
Naturally Advanced, which is traded over the counter under the symbol NADVF, raised $1.4 million in a private placement in May.

Canada: Firms Plan to Try to Make Car From Hemp

Fri, 09/03/2010 - 18:12 - restore


By USA Today Staff
 Now if your car breaks down and you're stuck by the side of the road, you can try to break off a piece and smoke it.
Well, not really. But the thought -- and the jokes -- are sure to arise over the hemp-fiber car that a group of Canadian companies will try to make, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reports.
The companies are collaborating on a car called the Kestrel that will have a body made of resin-impregnated industrial hemp, a tough fiber that comes from the cannabis family member that also results in marijuana. Unlike marijuana, hemp has a very low content of THC, the chemical that makes dope smokers high. Even so, it's illegal to grow in the U.S., so the Canadians think they might have an edge.
It's not a completely new idea. That Lotus Eco Elise from 2008, shown above, also has a hemp body.
The compact electric Kestrel will be prototyped and tested later by Calgary-based Motive Industries.
The CBC says Henry Ford first built a car made of hemp fiber and resin more than half a century ago.

Canada: Cannabis Car

Fri, 09/03/2010 - 18:04 - restore


By Nikki Gordon-Bloomfield, Fox News
 As we're faced with an increasingly large world population and ever-dwindling resources the race is on to produce cars that not only produce zero tailpipe emissions, but ones that are green to manufacture too.
But what is the ultimate material for cars? Steel is strong, but hardly light enough to make ultra-efficient vehicles. Many plastics are based on oil, and composite materials like carbon fibre are difficult and costly to manufacture and repair.
Enter the Kestrel. Designed and engineered by Motive Industries, a Canadian firm based in Alberta, the fully electric car features a body shell made of hemp--which may be better known as Cannabis Sativa L.
The hemp for the Kestrel's body is grown by Alberta Innovates Technology Futures (AITF) under license from the Canadian government.
Unlike the cannabis Californians may find available at their local medical marijuana dispensaries, hemp grown by AITF ends up on a production line, where it is turned into a composite material that has the impact resistance of fiberglass.
But unlike fiberglass, the hemp bio-composite is cheaper to produce and has fewer health risks connected with its manufacture.  It is also significantly lighter than glass-based composites traditionally used in racing cars.

Important News for our First Federal Savings Bank/Central Kentucky Federal Savings Bank website users.  We have now transitioned our website address to ffsbky.bank. Now that the transition has been completed, emails sent to ffsbfrankfort.com will be forwarded to the new dot bank address for a period of time.  Please update your favorites to reflect the change in the website names.

We chose this transition because the “dot bank” extension offers a more secure environment for our customers.  Domains with this extension are carefully vetted by the American Bankers Association and users can be assured that when dealing with a website that includes the dot bank extension, they are indeed dealing with a legitimate bank website.  Please note that online banking users will still be directed, through our website to online.ffsbfrankfort.com. 



 
Welcome to our website!  We encourage you to set this web page in your browser bookmarks to make us easy to find.
Our business is customer service. And we are good at it.  It's pretty simple... we treat you just like we would like to be treated.  With friendly personal service aimed at meeting your unique needs and goals.  Whether you need information about purchasing a home or the best savings plan for you, we are here to help. Local people.  Local service.  We invite you to browse our site and to come in to talk with us one on one.
