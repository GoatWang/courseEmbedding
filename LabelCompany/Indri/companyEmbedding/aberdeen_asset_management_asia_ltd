Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
Bank of America, N.A. and the U.S. Trust Company of Delaware (collectively the "Bank") do not serve in a fiduciary capacity with respect to all products or services.

The CPF interest rate for the Ordinary Account (‘OA’) is based on the 12-month fixed deposit and month-end savings rates of the major local banks. Under the CPF Act, the CPF Board pays a minimum interest of 2.5% per annum when this interest formula yields a lower rate.
In addition, the CPF Board pays an extra interest rate of 1% per annum on the first $60,000 of a CPF member's combined balances, including up to $20,000 in the OA. From January 2016, CPF members aged 55 and above will also earn an additional 1% extra interest on the first $30,000 of their combined balances (with up to $20,000 in the OA). This is paid over and above the current extra 1% interest that is earned on the first $60,000 of their combined balances. The first $20,000 in the OA will not be allowed to be invested under the CPF Investment Scheme.

								Aberdeen proudly sponsors Extreme Sailing Series™ - Singapore




In partnership with the Singapore Sports Council and the Singapore Tourism Board, Extreme Sailing Series™ (ESS) signed a three-year deal to stage the Extreme Sailing Series in Singapore from 2013-2015 .
Aberdeen is proud to participate as the event main partner for this period. Last year we brought in ‘Team Aberdeen Singapore’ with a couple of Singapore’s most promising young sailors on board; this year they competed against the world’s best.
A brand new international fixture on the Singapore sports calendar, the Extreme Sailing Series features fleets of at least eight international teams competing in identical Extreme 40s catamarans against the skyline of Singapore Marina Bay. The event is part of an eight-act global tour spanning Asia, Europe and the Middle East.
Videos and event photos for 2015
Highlight: Team Aberdeen in Extreme Sailing Series 2015
Team Aberdeen Singapore and seven other boats competed for line honours in Act 1 of the Extreme Sailing Series in Singapore over February 6-8. With the event into its third year, it's clear Singapore has taken to the Extremes.

About ESS — Extreme Sailing Series
Since 2007, the award-winning Extreme Sailing SeriesTM has become a benchmark in the sailing world, steadily growing and attracting the biggest names in the sport.
With some of the most respected skippers helming state-of-the-art multihulls on demanding courses, the creators of the Extreme Sailing SeriesTM have set new standards, both in terms of high level competition and sporting entertainment.
Uniquely, spectators get to see all the action close-up because of the use of tight courses close to shore. Singapore Marina Bay is the perfect stadium!

		                                    Here today -here tomorrow.
There's a saying - if you don't want to hold an investmentin a year, then you shouldn't be holding it today.





















								Equities




How we invest
Our equity process dates from the early 1990s. We believe its advantage lies in the consistency of its approach, irrespective of market conditions.
Key points:

Bottom-up investment style, emphasising company fundamentals
Team approach, with asset managers based in the regions where we invest
Low portfolio turnover, buying stocks and holding them for the long term
First-hand company research
No investment made without having interviewed the company’s management first
We aim to add value by identifying good quality stocks that are attractively priced and avoid businesses that we do not understand

History[edit]
The company was established in 1983 through a management buy-out of an investment trust.[2] It was then listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1991.[2] In recent years, it has seen significant growth from acquisitions. In 2000 it acquired Murray Johnstone, followed by Edinburgh Fund Managers in 2003, parts of Deutsche Asset Management in 2005 and 2007,[3][4] Glasgow Investment Managers in 2007, Goodman Property Investors in 2008, certain investment businesses of Credit Suisse Asset Management in 2009, and certain contracts and assets from RBS Asset Management in 2010.[2]
In November 2013, Lloyds Banking Group sold Scottish Widows Investment Partnership (SWIP) to Aberdeen Asset Management in a £660m deal.[5] The deal made Aberdeen Asset Management the second largest listed fund manager in Europe after Schroders, currently managing £308.1bn [6] In May 2015, the firm agreed to acquire its US counterpart Flag Capital Management for an undisclosed deal that would double the private equity assets under the company’s control.[7]

History[edit]
The company was established in 1983 through a management buy-out of an investment trust.[2] It was then listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1991.[2] In recent years, it has seen significant growth from acquisitions. In 2000 it acquired Murray Johnstone, followed by Edinburgh Fund Managers in 2003, parts of Deutsche Asset Management in 2005 and 2007,[3][4] Glasgow Investment Managers in 2007, Goodman Property Investors in 2008, certain investment businesses of Credit Suisse Asset Management in 2009, and certain contracts and assets from RBS Asset Management in 2010.[2]
In November 2013, Lloyds Banking Group sold Scottish Widows Investment Partnership (SWIP) to Aberdeen Asset Management in a £660m deal.[5] The deal made Aberdeen Asset Management the second largest listed fund manager in Europe after Schroders, currently managing £308.1bn [6] In May 2015, the firm agreed to acquire its US counterpart Flag Capital Management for an undisclosed deal that would double the private equity assets under the company’s control.[7]
The Company sponsored The Boat Race between 1999 and 2001.[8] In 2010 it signed a four-year sponsorship agreement with the Dad Vail Regatta to be title sponsor until 2013, the event’s 75th Anniversary. The agreement has helped to keep the famous college rowing regatta in Philadelphia, the Group's North American headquarters.[9] In March 2012 it took over sponsorship of golf's Scottish Open for the following three years. Other sponsorships include the Cowes Week sailing regatta, Aberdeen Brunei Senior Masters Golf Tournament,[10] Edinburgh Rugby club,[11] professional golfers Colin Montgomerie and Paul Lawrie,[12] and Formula One driver Paul di Resta.[13]
In March 2017, Aberdeen Asset Management reached an agreement to merge with Standard Life, in an all-share merger.[14]

								Fixed Income




How we invest
Global expertise, local insight and fundamental research underpin our fixed income process. We create long-term value by running high conviction portfolios informed by our own security analysis. We don’t chase yield and see loss avoidance as more crucial to returns than identifying winners.
Key points:

Global reach with experienced teams around the world
Own in-depth, forward-looking research
Security focus on value relative to fundamental quality
Emphasis on risk oversight to reduce losses and protect income
Longstanding Asian presence supports insight into emerging markets

 





















                    What sets us apart?
Fundamental research
We believe fundamental analysis is key to creating long-term value. This demands first-hand research coupled with a clear, disciplined approach to value and risk.
Our teams in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific enable us to cover the bond market in extraordinary depth, with research into government bonds, currencies, credit and asset-backed securities including investment grade, high yield, convertible and loan markets. Our macro analysts cover the majority of country issuers worldwide.
Discipline on valuations
As most fixed income securities have limited upside, our investment analysis starts with a valuation framework, with price targets for all the investments in the portfolio.
A strong buy and sell discipline means we consistently seek to add attractive securities into our portfolios and reduce our holding of expensive ones.
A standardised approach to risk
To achieve strong risk-adjusted returns, we use a set of measures that enhance our ability to assess the investment upside together with downside risk in our portfolios.

*Please note that the content on this page refers to Aberdeen globally, while Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Limited Shanghai Representative Office does not make any investment, provide any investment advice, or develop, distribute or sell any investment products.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.

History[edit]
The company was established in 1983 through a management buy-out of an investment trust.[2] It was then listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1991.[2] In recent years, it has seen significant growth from acquisitions. In 2000 it acquired Murray Johnstone, followed by Edinburgh Fund Managers in 2003, parts of Deutsche Asset Management in 2005 and 2007,[3][4] Glasgow Investment Managers in 2007, Goodman Property Investors in 2008, certain investment businesses of Credit Suisse Asset Management in 2009, and certain contracts and assets from RBS Asset Management in 2010.[2]
In November 2013, Lloyds Banking Group sold Scottish Widows Investment Partnership (SWIP) to Aberdeen Asset Management in a £660m deal.[5] The deal made Aberdeen Asset Management the second largest listed fund manager in Europe after Schroders, currently managing £308.1bn [6] In May 2015, the firm agreed to acquire its US counterpart Flag Capital Management for an undisclosed deal that would double the private equity assets under the company’s control.[7]
The Company sponsored The Boat Race between 1999 and 2001.[8] In 2010 it signed a four-year sponsorship agreement with the Dad Vail Regatta to be title sponsor until 2013, the event’s 75th Anniversary. The agreement has helped to keep the famous college rowing regatta in Philadelphia, the Group's North American headquarters.[9] In March 2012 it took over sponsorship of golf's Scottish Open for the following three years. Other sponsorships include the Cowes Week sailing regatta, Aberdeen Brunei Senior Masters Golf Tournament,[10] Edinburgh Rugby club,[11] professional golfers Colin Montgomerie and Paul Lawrie,[12] and Formula One driver Paul di Resta.[13]
In March 2017, Aberdeen Asset Management reached an agreement to merge with Standard Life, in an all-share merger.[14]
Operations[edit]

Its headquarters are in the city of Aberdeen, where Group functions including legal, group information and human resources are located, and has its major investment desks in London, Philadelphia and Singapore.[15]

History[edit]
The company was established in 1983 through a management buy-out of an investment trust.[2] It was then listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1991.[2] In recent years, it has seen significant growth from acquisitions. In 2000 it acquired Murray Johnstone, followed by Edinburgh Fund Managers in 2003, parts of Deutsche Asset Management in 2005 and 2007,[3][4] Glasgow Investment Managers in 2007, Goodman Property Investors in 2008, certain investment businesses of Credit Suisse Asset Management in 2009, and certain contracts and assets from RBS Asset Management in 2010.[2]
In November 2013, Lloyds Banking Group sold Scottish Widows Investment Partnership (SWIP) to Aberdeen Asset Management in a £660m deal.[5] The deal made Aberdeen Asset Management the second largest listed fund manager in Europe after Schroders, currently managing £308.1bn [6] In May 2015, the firm agreed to acquire its US counterpart Flag Capital Management for an undisclosed deal that would double the private equity assets under the company’s control.[7]
The Company sponsored The Boat Race between 1999 and 2001.[8] In 2010 it signed a four-year sponsorship agreement with the Dad Vail Regatta to be title sponsor until 2013, the event’s 75th Anniversary. The agreement has helped to keep the famous college rowing regatta in Philadelphia, the Group's North American headquarters.[9] In March 2012 it took over sponsorship of golf's Scottish Open for the following three years. Other sponsorships include the Cowes Week sailing regatta, Aberdeen Brunei Senior Masters Golf Tournament,[10] Edinburgh Rugby club,[11] professional golfers Colin Montgomerie and Paul Lawrie,[12] and Formula One driver Paul di Resta.[13]
In March 2017, Aberdeen Asset Management reached an agreement to merge with Standard Life, in an all-share merger.[14]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
