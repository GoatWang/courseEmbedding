10 BEST MUTUAL FUNDS
The best mutual funds for the rest of 2016 will likely share two overlapping themes — defense and diversification.The worst enemy of capital markets is uncertainty. We know this from history, but the markets received a stark reminder of this reality via a swift shift to risk-off mode in the wake of the surprise Brexit result.The initial shock and uncertainty faded, with stocks resuming the modestly positive climb we saw prior to the Brexit. But more uncertainty is looming ahead — namely, whether we will see another interest rate hike in 2016, not to mention the result of November’s presidential election.There’s plenty to make investors jittery.In this kind of environment, it’s wise not to make big bets on any one asset type, industrial sector or niche area of stocks or bonds. And moving everything to cash won’t likely be the best move either.With all that advice in mind, here are (in no particular order) the best mutual funds for the rest of 2016.Best Mutual Funds for the Rest of 2016:Hussman Strategic Total Return Fund (HSTRX)Expenses: 0.69%Minimum Initial Investment: $1,000Uncertain times and the volatility and downside pressure that come along with them are the right kind of conditions for hedge fund-like mutual funds, such as Hussman Strategic Total Return Fund(MUTF:HSTRX).HSTRX is one of the best mutual funds in times of economic uncertainty and challenging market conditions — which sounds an awful lot like most of 2016 — and may continue to excel for the foreseeable future. Portfolio manager John Hussman is ahead of 97% of tactical allocation funds with a gain of more than 11% near the end of 2016’s first half.The portfolio consists primarily of fixed-income securities, but Hussman’s hedge fund-like tactics will have him moving significant amounts of fund assets to cash, stocks or commodity-based securities when he sees opportunities for gains in volatile markets. Right now, he likes minersNewmont Mining Corp (NYSE:NEM) and Barrick Gold Corporation (USA) (NYSE:ABX).Vanguard Wellesley Income Fund (VWINX)Expenses: 0.23%Minimum Initial Investment: $3,000If you’re looking for a more conventional means of limiting downside pressure while still capturing decent gains should the market continue its climb in the second half of 2016 … well, Vanguard Wellesley Income (MUTF:VWINX) is a solid choice.With the broad market stock indices mostly sitting on low-single-digit gains on the year and the Federal Reserve’s next move looking more and more uncertain, a fund with the right mix of stocks and bonds can produce market-beating returns.A conservative blend of high-quality bonds and large-cap stocks like MicrosoftCorporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has VWINX beating the S&P 500 in 2016.If the remainder of the year looks anything like the first six months, or if the market turns negative, VWINX should prove to be among the best mutual funds you should be holding on to for 2016’s second half.Fidelity Select Healthcare Portfolio (FSPHX)Expenses: 0.73%Minimum Initial Investment: $2,500While it won’t usually pay to be too concentrated right now, there are a couple of specific shots that investors can take right now.The healthcare sector has had a tough 2016, but don’t let that dissuade you from defensive stock funds like Fidelity Select Health Care Portfolio (MUTF:FSPHX).Healthcare products and services are essential to most consumers, which is why the health sector is considered be a defensive one. Although the sector has been beaten down by falling biotechnology stocks, and the tough political talk on pharmaceutical pricing has pushed down prices, the long-term attributes of an aging population and advances in medical technology remain attractive.Therefore, now can be a good time to pick up bargain-priced shares of funds like FSPHX, which focuses on healthcare stocks like Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), Amgen, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMGN) and Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX).Vanguard Mid Cap Index (VIMSX)Expenses: 0.2%Minimum Initial Investment: $3,000If you’re looking to avoid large caps because of a strong dollar and small caps should the market shift back to risk-off mode, one of the best mutual funds to hold now might be right in the middle: theVanguard Mid Cap Index (MUTF:VIMSX).As plenty of research has shown, mid-cap stocks are in the “sweet spot” of the market capitalization spectrum when it comes to risk-adjusted returns. And if the bull market has more room to run, mid-cap stocks tend to beat large-caps in the latter phase of the business cycle.If you already hold a large-cap stock fund, a passively managed mid-cap stock fund like VIMSX won’t have much overlap with it. But keep in mind that in a big market correction, mid-cap stocks like top holdings Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Fiserv Inc (NASDAQ:FISV) andElectronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA) can decline as much or more than large caps.Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (VTSMX)Expenses: 0.16%Minimum Initial Investment: $3,000In uncertain times, diversification is key, and Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (MUTF:VTSMX) is one of the best funds on the market to diversify a portfolio.Although S&P 500 index funds are great diversifiers and solid core holdings, a strong dollar will weigh heavier on the large-cap stocks that dominate the S&P 500. Therefore a low-cost total stock index fund like VTSMX looks like a better idea in 2016.Yes, VTSMX does hold large-cap stocks like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), AlphabetInc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft, but it also holds mid- and small-cap stocks for a more diverse, complete coverage of the U.S. total stock market.Fidelity Select Gold Portfolio (FSAGX)Expenses: 0.94%Minimum Initial Investment: $2,500As the Brexit and the first half of 2016 recently reminded us, when investors are fearful about the global economic environment, they increasingly buy gold bullion and funds like the Fidelity Select Gold Portfolio (MUTF:FSAGX).Conditions that can support higher gold include a weak U.S. dollar, weak global economies, high demand for physical gold and low or falling interest rates.But one overriding factor that trumps all of them is uncertainty … and that should be in largesupply in the second half of 2016.Uncertainty over the strength of the European economy, uncertainty over interest rates and currencies, uncertainty over the result of the U.S. presidential election. These could press more investors into buying more tangible assets like gold, which means higher prices for FSAGX top holdings Randgold Resources Ltd. (ADR) (NASDAQ:GOLD), Goldcorp Inc. (USA)(NYSE:GG) and Newmont Mining.Vanguard Total Bond Market Index (VBMFX)Expenses: 0.16%Minimum Initial Investment: $3,000To extend the diversification theme to the fixed income portion of your portfolio, Vanguard Total Bond Market Index (MUTF:VBMFX) may be the best bond fund to do it.VBMFX tracks the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Float Adjusted Index, which covers more than 8,000 bonds in the U.S. bond market.Some investors and many financial media pundits don’t like bond index funds when rates are expected to rise, but how many times have the pundits, and even many of the best fixed income portfolio managers in the world, predicted what rates would do over the past three or four years?The conventional thinking is that active fund managers can shift their portfolios to bonds with lower sensitivity to interest rates or even to cash, whereas index funds are forced to passively fall off of the proverbial price cliff as rates rise.For recent history on the failure of active bond fund managers, VBMFX has beaten nearly two-thirds of intermediate-term bond funds for past three years and nearly 90% for the past year.Vanguard Short-Term Investment-Grade (VFSTX)Expenses: 0.2%Minimum Initial Investment: $3,000Investors betting that the Fed will continue their tightening in the second half of 2016 may want to consider buying a mutual fund likeVanguard Short-Term Investment-Grade (MUTF:VFSTX).If rates resume their rise, it’s an indication that the U.S. economy is still in growth mode, albeit at a modest pace. And since, in a rising interest rate environment, bonds of longer duration usually fall in price more than those of shorter duration, short-term bond funds like VFSTX can do better than the long-term bond funds and probably better than bond index funds.And with a moderately strong economy, investment-grade bonds that make up the VFSTX portfolio can perform better, or at least put up higher yields, than high-quality bonds.USA Mutuals Barrier Fund Investor Class Shares (VICEX)Expenses: 1.44%Minimum Initial Investment: $2,000One of the best mutual funds that focuses on defensive stocks isUSA Mutuals Barrier Fund Investor Class Shares (MUTF:VICEX) — more commonly known as the Vice Fund.The Vice Fund holds stocks that can fall under the unofficial equity categorization of “sin stocks” because they include companies in the gaming, tobacco and alcoholic beverage industries, though VICEX also includes aerospace and defense stocks.VICEX makes a solid defensive stock fund because sin stocks can hold up better than the major market indices during challenging economic times thanks to widespread underpricing thanks to the less-than-desirable nature of their businesses — and in the case of tobacco stocks, high dividends. Year-to-date, VICEX is beating well more than 90% of category peers and is crushing the S&P 500 index.Top holdings for the vice fund were recently Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM),Reynolds American, Inc. (NYSE:RAI), and Altria Group Inc (NYSE:MO).Vanguard Energy (VGENX)Expenses: 0.37%Minimum Initial Investment: $3,000Oil and energy stocks have seen some volatility in 2016, especially in the wake of the Brexit, but energy sector funds like Vanguard Energy (MUTF:VGENX) can be good buys now.2016 has been the best year to buy oil-related stocks in the past seven years or so. With the price of oil hitting a multiyear low in 2015, and strong performance in 2016 that looks to provide more momentum in the coming months, the best energy funds could outperform major market indices for the rest of 2016.Also, VGENX doesn’t hold the riskier small-cap energy stocks, and instead the portfolio consists of high-quality large-cap names like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX).

Overview






Investment Approach
BlackRock MuniHoldings California Quality Fund, Inc.’s (MUC) (the 'Fund') investment objective is to provide shareholders with current income exempt
from federal and California income taxes. The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in municipal obligations exempt from
federal income taxes (except that the interest may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax) and California income taxes. Under normal market
conditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of its assets in investment grade municipal obligations with remaining maturities of one year or more at the time
of investment. The Fund may invest directly in such securities or synthetically through the use of derivatives.No assurance can be given that the Fund's investment objective will be achieved.

The performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. 
Returns are shown net of advisory fees paid by the fund and net of the fund’s operating fees and expenses. Investors who purchase shares of the fund through an investment adviser or other financial professional may separately pay a fee to that service provider. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

Total Distribution Current year distributions are not classified as “Income,” “Short-Term Capital Gains,” “Long-Term Capital Gains,” or “Return of Capital” until calendar year-end.











Past distributions are not indicative of future distributions.

If a Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains in the current fiscal year; a portion of its distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of a shareholder's investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect a Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with 'yield' or 'income'. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Fund's net asset value per share. Although the character of income will not be determined until the end of the fund’s fiscal year, please refer to the 'Closed-End Fund Resources' section of the BlackRock website for Section 19 notices that provide estimated amounts and sources of the fund's distributions, which should not be not be relied upon for tax reporting purposes. A Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year will be sent to shareholders to illustrate how the Fund’s distributions should be reported for federal income tax purposes.

Premium/Discount
The amount the Fund is trading above or below the reported NAV expressed as a percentage of NAV. When the Fund’s closing price is greater than the Fund’s NAV, it is said to be trading at a &quot;Premium&quot; and the percentage is expressed as a positive number. When the Fund’s closing price is less than the Fund’s NAV, it is said to be trading at a &quot;Discount&quot; and the percentage is expressed as a negative number. Closing price is determined using the last traded price on the Fund’s listed exchange and NAV is calculated daily (usually 4:00pm eastern time).

Portfolio Characteristics 

 
Portfolio Characteristics 



Distribution Rate
The annual yield an investor would receive if the most recent fund distribution and current fund price stayed the same going forward. It is calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution and dividing by the fund&#39;s market price from the as-of-date. The distribution rate may include a return of capital. Please refer to the &quot;Closed-End Fund Resources&quot; section of the BlackRock website for Section 19 notices that provide estimated amounts and sources of the fund&#39;s distributions, which should not be relied upon for tax reporting purposes.

Tax Equiv. Yield
Tax equivalent yield (TEY) is used by investors to compare yields on taxable and tax-exempt securities after accounting for taxes. TEY represents the yield a taxable bond would have to earn in order to match, after taxes, the yield available on a tax-exempt municipal bond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tax Equivalent Yield (TEY) = Tax Free Municipal Bond Yield/(1 - Tax Rate*)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, an investor in the 43.4% tax bracket would have to earn a yield of 3.53% on a taxable bond to match a 2.00% yield on a tax-exempt security.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The highest Federal individual income tax rate of 43.4% is assumed.

as of 20-Jul-2017



10.25%




Yield to Maturity
Yield to Maturity (YTM) is the discount rate that equates the present value of a bond&#39;s cash flows with its market price (including accrued interest). The Fund Average YTM is the weighted average of the fund&#39;s individual bond holding YTMs based upon Net Asset Value (&#39;NAV&#39;). The measure does not include fees and expenses. For callable bonds, YTM is the yield-to-worst.

Effective Duration
Effective Duration measures the sensitivity of the price of a bond with or without embedded options to changes in interest rates, taking into account the likelihood of the bond being called, put and/or sunk prior to its final maturity date while incorporating after-tax impacts on the bond. The options-based duration model used by BlackRock employs certain assumptions and may differ from other fund complexes. Effective Duration is measured at the individual bond level, aggregated to the portfolio level, and adjusted for leverage, hedging transactions and non-bond holdings, including derivatives.&lt;br /&gt;As the method for calculating duration in municipal bond funds changed as of Sept. 26, please see the &#39;Literature&#39; section for more information on that measure.

% Notional Value
% of Notional Exposures is a breakdown designed to represent a fund’s ownership of both traditional fixed income securities and derivatives including, but not limited to, futures, options and swap contracts. For traditional fixed income securities, there is no difference between the market value and the notional exposure. For derivatives, the notional exposure represents the exposure to the underlying assets plus the value of the financing (or lending) associated with the implementation of these derivatives. The sum of all exposures (both market value and notional exposure) is equal to the fund’s net asset value (open-end) or net managed assets (closed-end). Net Derivatives represents the approximate net notional value of the longs less the short derivatives held in the fund.

% Notional Value
% of Notional Exposures is a breakdown designed to represent a fund’s ownership of both traditional fixed income securities and derivatives including, but not limited to, futures, options and swap contracts. For traditional fixed income securities, there is no difference between the market value and the notional exposure. For derivatives, the notional exposure represents the exposure to the underlying assets plus the value of the financing (or lending) associated with the implementation of these derivatives. The sum of all exposures (both market value and notional exposure) is equal to the fund’s net asset value (open-end) or net managed assets (closed-end). Net Derivatives represents the approximate net notional value of the longs less the short derivatives held in the fund.

The fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency. Credit quality ratings on underlying securities of the fund are received from S&P, Moody’s and Fitch and converted to the equivalent S&P major rating category. This breakdown is provided by BlackRock and takes the median rating of the three agencies when all three agencies rate a security the lower of the two ratings if only two agencies rate a security and one rating if that is all that is provided. Unrated securities do not necessarily indicate low quality. Below investment-grade is represented by a rating of BB and below. Ratings and portfolio credit quality may change over time.

Notional value represents a fund’s use of derivatives, including but not limited to futures, options, and swaps. This value captures the fund exposures as if the derivative was replaced with the underlying asset and the corresponding financing or lending, such that all exposures sum to the net asset value. For non-derivatives, the market value and the notional value are identical. Allocations are subject to change.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the SEC Edgar database. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


Common shares for most of the closed-end funds identified above are only available for purchase and sale at current market price on a stock exchange. A closed-end fund’s dividend yield, market price and NAV will fluctuate with market conditions. The information for these funds is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell Fund shares.


Performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. All returns assume reinvestment of all dividends. The market value and net asset value (NAV) of a fund's shares will fluctuate with market conditions. Closed-end funds may trade at a premium to NAV but often trade at a discount.  The fund is actively managed and its characteristics will vary. Stock and bond values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions. International investing involves special risks including, but not limited to political risks, currency fluctuations, illiquidity and volatility. These risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets. Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments. Principal of mortgage- or asset-backed securities normally may be prepaid at any time, reducing the yield and market value of those securities. Obligations of US govt. agencies are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the US govt. Non-investment-grade debt securities (high-yield/junk bonds) may be subject to greater market fluctuations, risk of default or loss of income and principal than higher rated securities. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative and are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns. In addition, many emerging securities markets have lower trading volumes and less liquidity. The fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns. Derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. The Fund is subject to numerous risks, including investment risks. Shares of closed-end funds often trade at a discount from their net asset value. The Fund is not a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.  The amounts and sources of distributions reported in any notices are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. Yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the Fund's NAV at the end of the end of the period.  Some investors may be subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT).   Some BlackRock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end. Those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields. There is no assurance that a fund will repeat that yield in the future. Subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary income or capital gains in the form of dividends will likely be lower.


The Funds are distributed by BlackRock Investments, LLC (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”).

  The Best Mutual Funds for You

The Best Mutual Funds for You
Author: Admin | Apr062016 Posted in Mutual Funds  No comments




Mutual funds have been around for many years. Your parents and grandparents may have used mutual funds to diversify portfolios or hire professional asset managers for a relatively low fee. When compared to more recent exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that trade on the stock exchange, you might wonder why mutual funds still command so much attention in the financial news. 





The answer is relatively simple. More than USD 15 trillion in assets under management (AUM) are invested in mutual funds. The best mutual funds have recently returned nothing short of amazing returns of greater than 40 percent per year. Of course, higher returns can imply higher risks and fees as well.
Buying the Best Mutual Funds
Before buying any mutual fund, it’s essential to do your research. Last year’s highest performing technology mutual fund is likely to give back some returns if the broad market or the tech sector consolidates. Consider your financial goals, time horizon, and risk appetite before buying any mutual fund. The best mutual funds are those you’re comfortable with.
Let’s review some basic information about mutual funds.
Mutual Fund Investments
Mutual funds represent a simple concept of combining groups of companies’ stocks and packaging them as a single investment. A mutual fund may be part of a family of funds or a financial company. The label, mutual fund, refers to the practice of pooling many investors’ funds to purchase a variety of stocks.
Some mutual fund portfolios include hundreds of thousands of individual stock names. Because most investors don’t have the financial wherewithal or management expertise to manage a large stock portfolio, mutual funds fit neatly into most investors’ retirement plans or investment portfolios.
Mutual Fund Function
Stock investors know that the nominal prices of many stocks are costly. If a stock price costs hundreds or thousands of dollars per share, most investors won’t consider it as an outright purchase:

By investment in the best mutual funds, investors purchase fractional shares and have access to the shares of many different companies in a variety of industry groups.
The best mutual funds offer MPT-recommended asset allocation as well as portfolio diversification. The mutual fund may diversify within an industry sector or diversify across the broad U.S. or global stock market.
Mutual fund investors buy fractional shares and have the opportunity to invest their money in a specified field of public companies. Even if you make a small investment in the mutual fund, you own a tiny amount of the total mutual fund portfolio and have the benefit of professional management.
Owning the best mutual funds can help you stay calm and focused on long-term results. Even if you can afford buying shares of each company in the mutual fund portfolio, keeping track of each stock position is challenging. Fund management assumes the task of making buy and sell decisions.

Best Mutual Fund Types
There are two primary mutual fund distinctions. Before deciding on the best mutual funds, you’ll need to understand the difference between managed mutual funds vs. unmanaged mutual funds:

A managed fund employs one or more fund managers who use research and opinions to make buy and sell decisions.
If the mutual fund manager makes mostly good decisions, the mutual fund might outperform the broad market or the sector of the market it’s focused on.
If the manager of the mutual fund makes poor decisions, the mutual fund is likely to perform less well than the market. If this result occurs, the manager’s underperformance can result in investors’ decisions to take their money elsewhere.

Managed mutual funds typically charge higher fees to pay management salaries. Paying for management can cut into investor returns.
In contrast, unmanaged mutual funds don’t rely on a fund manager to select stocks. Instead, the fund is assembled as a mirror of a stock market index such as the S&P 500 or the Russell 2000. Because these funds are mirrors of indices, they’re called index funds.
People buy unmanaged index funds because they have a long-term desire to participate in the direction of a particular index:

If you’re a conservative long-term investor, buying the S&P 500 allows you to achieve the exact return of the S&P 500 index.
Your index fund can’t underperform or outperform the actual market index.
Because human decision-making is eliminated from the unmanaged index fund, it may seem less exciting. The broad index probably won’t match the juiciest big returns of the hot tech fund. However, your index fund is less risky than a mutual fund managed by humans.
Investors in index funds don’t need to pay for human management because, once the mutual fund portfolio is built, it’s only adjusted when individual companies are dropped. Lower fees can translate to higher investor returns.

Popular Mutual Funds
As you can see, mutual funds are popular with stock market investors. Concerns about picking the right stocks, evaluating risks, and making buy and sell decisions are just some of the reasons long-term investors buy stock mutual funds. However, with so many stock mutual funds available, how do you pore over the thousands of available mutual funds to decide the best mutual funds?
Each mutual fund states its investment objectives along with the fees it charges and risks investors assume by purchasing them.
Investing in Your Best Mutual Funds
Distinguishing between managed and unmanaged mutual funds is important to your decision-making process, but it’s only the start. Mutual fund portfolios contain stocks from one or several asset classes.

The mutual fund can be designed to include large capitalization, small capitalization, value, or growth stocks in the U.S. or international markets. The mutual fund can include real estate, bonds, or other types of corporate assets and debt.
Some asset classes are considered riskier than others, but take your time to evaluate risk in current market conditions.
For instance, bond investments are generally considered less risky than stocks over a long-term horizon. Over the past few years, though, low bond yields have prompted many investors to explore potentially higher returns in stocks and real estate.

Some mutual funds offer greater tax efficiency, too. Learn about the stocks or assets contained in any mutual fund and weigh all the variables to determine the best mutual funds for you.

10 BEST MUTUAL FUNDS
The best mutual funds for the rest of 2016 will likely share two overlapping themes — defense and diversification.The worst enemy of capital markets is uncertainty. We know this from history, but the markets received a stark reminder of this reality via a swift shift to risk-off mode in the wake of the surprise Brexit result.The initial shock and uncertainty faded, with stocks resuming the modestly positive climb we saw prior to the Brexit. But more uncertainty is looming ahead — namely, whether we will see another interest rate hike in 2016, not to mention the result of November’s presidential election.There’s plenty to make investors jittery.In this kind of environment, it’s wise not to make big bets on any one asset type, industrial sector or niche area of stocks or bonds. And moving everything to cash won’t likely be the best move either.With all that advice in mind, here are (in no particular order) the best mutual funds for the rest of 2016.Best Mutual Funds for the Rest of 2016:Hussman Strategic Total Return Fund (HSTRX)Expenses: 0.69%Minimum Initial Investment: $1,000Uncertain times and the volatility and downside pressure that come along with them are the right kind of conditions for hedge fund-like mutual funds, such as Hussman Strategic Total Return Fund(MUTF:HSTRX).HSTRX is one of the best mutual funds in times of economic uncertainty and challenging market conditions — which sounds an awful lot like most of 2016 — and may continue to excel for the foreseeable future. Portfolio manager John Hussman is ahead of 97% of tactical allocation funds with a gain of more than 11% near the end of 2016’s first half.The portfolio consists primarily of fixed-income securities, but Hussman’s hedge fund-like tactics will have him moving significant amounts of fund assets to cash, stocks or commodity-based securities when he sees opportunities for gains in volatile markets. Right now, he likes minersNewmont Mining Corp (NYSE:NEM) and Barrick Gold Corporation (USA) (NYSE:ABX).Vanguard Wellesley Income Fund (VWINX)Expenses: 0.23%Minimum Initial Investment: $3,000If you’re looking for a more conventional means of limiting downside pressure while still capturing decent gains should the market continue its climb in the second half of 2016 … well, Vanguard Wellesley Income (MUTF:VWINX) is a solid choice.With the broad market stock indices mostly sitting on low-single-digit gains on the year and the Federal Reserve’s next move looking more and more uncertain, a fund with the right mix of stocks and bonds can produce market-beating returns.A conservative blend of high-quality bonds and large-cap stocks like MicrosoftCorporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has VWINX beating the S&P 500 in 2016.If the remainder of the year looks anything like the first six months, or if the market turns negative, VWINX should prove to be among the best mutual funds you should be holding on to for 2016’s second half.Fidelity Select Healthcare Portfolio (FSPHX)Expenses: 0.73%Minimum Initial Investment: $2,500While it won’t usually pay to be too concentrated right now, there are a couple of specific shots that investors can take right now.The healthcare sector has had a tough 2016, but don’t let that dissuade you from defensive stock funds like Fidelity Select Health Care Portfolio (MUTF:FSPHX).Healthcare products and services are essential to most consumers, which is why the health sector is considered be a defensive one. Although the sector has been beaten down by falling biotechnology stocks, and the tough political talk on pharmaceutical pricing has pushed down prices, the long-term attributes of an aging population and advances in medical technology remain attractive.Therefore, now can be a good time to pick up bargain-priced shares of funds like FSPHX, which focuses on healthcare stocks like Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), Amgen, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMGN) and Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX).Vanguard Mid Cap Index (VIMSX)Expenses: 0.2%Minimum Initial Investment: $3,000If you’re looking to avoid large caps because of a strong dollar and small caps should the market shift back to risk-off mode, one of the best mutual funds to hold now might be right in the middle: theVanguard Mid Cap Index (MUTF:VIMSX).As plenty of research has shown, mid-cap stocks are in the “sweet spot” of the market capitalization spectrum when it comes to risk-adjusted returns. And if the bull market has more room to run, mid-cap stocks tend to beat large-caps in the latter phase of the business cycle.If you already hold a large-cap stock fund, a passively managed mid-cap stock fund like VIMSX won’t have much overlap with it. But keep in mind that in a big market correction, mid-cap stocks like top holdings Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Fiserv Inc (NASDAQ:FISV) andElectronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA) can decline as much or more than large caps.Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (VTSMX)Expenses: 0.16%Minimum Initial Investment: $3,000In uncertain times, diversification is key, and Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (MUTF:VTSMX) is one of the best funds on the market to diversify a portfolio.Although S&P 500 index funds are great diversifiers and solid core holdings, a strong dollar will weigh heavier on the large-cap stocks that dominate the S&P 500. Therefore a low-cost total stock index fund like VTSMX looks like a better idea in 2016.Yes, VTSMX does hold large-cap stocks like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), AlphabetInc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft, but it also holds mid- and small-cap stocks for a more diverse, complete coverage of the U.S. total stock market.Fidelity Select Gold Portfolio (FSAGX)Expenses: 0.94%Minimum Initial Investment: $2,500As the Brexit and the first half of 2016 recently reminded us, when investors are fearful about the global economic environment, they increasingly buy gold bullion and funds like the Fidelity Select Gold Portfolio (MUTF:FSAGX).Conditions that can support higher gold include a weak U.S. dollar, weak global economies, high demand for physical gold and low or falling interest rates.But one overriding factor that trumps all of them is uncertainty … and that should be in largesupply in the second half of 2016.Uncertainty over the strength of the European economy, uncertainty over interest rates and currencies, uncertainty over the result of the U.S. presidential election. These could press more investors into buying more tangible assets like gold, which means higher prices for FSAGX top holdings Randgold Resources Ltd. (ADR) (NASDAQ:GOLD), Goldcorp Inc. (USA)(NYSE:GG) and Newmont Mining.Vanguard Total Bond Market Index (VBMFX)Expenses: 0.16%Minimum Initial Investment: $3,000To extend the diversification theme to the fixed income portion of your portfolio, Vanguard Total Bond Market Index (MUTF:VBMFX) may be the best bond fund to do it.VBMFX tracks the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Float Adjusted Index, which covers more than 8,000 bonds in the U.S. bond market.Some investors and many financial media pundits don’t like bond index funds when rates are expected to rise, but how many times have the pundits, and even many of the best fixed income portfolio managers in the world, predicted what rates would do over the past three or four years?The conventional thinking is that active fund managers can shift their portfolios to bonds with lower sensitivity to interest rates or even to cash, whereas index funds are forced to passively fall off of the proverbial price cliff as rates rise.For recent history on the failure of active bond fund managers, VBMFX has beaten nearly two-thirds of intermediate-term bond funds for past three years and nearly 90% for the past year.Vanguard Short-Term Investment-Grade (VFSTX)Expenses: 0.2%Minimum Initial Investment: $3,000Investors betting that the Fed will continue their tightening in the second half of 2016 may want to consider buying a mutual fund likeVanguard Short-Term Investment-Grade (MUTF:VFSTX).If rates resume their rise, it’s an indication that the U.S. economy is still in growth mode, albeit at a modest pace. And since, in a rising interest rate environment, bonds of longer duration usually fall in price more than those of shorter duration, short-term bond funds like VFSTX can do better than the long-term bond funds and probably better than bond index funds.And with a moderately strong economy, investment-grade bonds that make up the VFSTX portfolio can perform better, or at least put up higher yields, than high-quality bonds.USA Mutuals Barrier Fund Investor Class Shares (VICEX)Expenses: 1.44%Minimum Initial Investment: $2,000One of the best mutual funds that focuses on defensive stocks isUSA Mutuals Barrier Fund Investor Class Shares (MUTF:VICEX) — more commonly known as the Vice Fund.The Vice Fund holds stocks that can fall under the unofficial equity categorization of “sin stocks” because they include companies in the gaming, tobacco and alcoholic beverage industries, though VICEX also includes aerospace and defense stocks.VICEX makes a solid defensive stock fund because sin stocks can hold up better than the major market indices during challenging economic times thanks to widespread underpricing thanks to the less-than-desirable nature of their businesses — and in the case of tobacco stocks, high dividends. Year-to-date, VICEX is beating well more than 90% of category peers and is crushing the S&P 500 index.Top holdings for the vice fund were recently Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM),Reynolds American, Inc. (NYSE:RAI), and Altria Group Inc (NYSE:MO).Vanguard Energy (VGENX)Expenses: 0.37%Minimum Initial Investment: $3,000Oil and energy stocks have seen some volatility in 2016, especially in the wake of the Brexit, but energy sector funds like Vanguard Energy (MUTF:VGENX) can be good buys now.2016 has been the best year to buy oil-related stocks in the past seven years or so. With the price of oil hitting a multiyear low in 2015, and strong performance in 2016 that looks to provide more momentum in the coming months, the best energy funds could outperform major market indices for the rest of 2016.Also, VGENX doesn’t hold the riskier small-cap energy stocks, and instead the portfolio consists of high-quality large-cap names like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
