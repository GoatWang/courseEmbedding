(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or Form 10-Q, and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended October 30, 2016, or fiscal year 2016, included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2016, or 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to "Broadcom," "we," "our" and "us" mean Broadcom Limited and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Broadcom Cayman L.P. References to the "Partnership" mean Broadcom Cayman L.P. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Financial information and results of operations presented in this Form 10-Q for periods prior to February 1, 2016 relate to Avago Technologies Limited, our predecessor, or Avago, and relate to Broadcom and the Partnership for the period after February 1, 2016, the date of completion of our acquisition of Broadcom Corporation, or BRCM, and Avago. This Form 10-Q may contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties, which are made under the safe harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. These forward-looking statements may include projections of financial information; statements about historical results that may suggest trends for our business; statements of the plans, strategies, and objectives of management for future operations; statements of expectation or belief regarding future events (including any acquisitions we may make), technology developments, our products, product sales, expenses, liquidity, cash flow and growth rates, customer concentration and relationships, or enforceability of our intellectual property rights, or IP; and the effects of seasonality on our business. Such statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections of our or industry performance and macroeconomic conditions, based on management's judgment, beliefs, current trends and market conditions, and involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. We derive most of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are based upon many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. Accordingly, we caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations are disclosed under "Risk Factors" in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, and in other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. All of the forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors listed above and those discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" below. We undertake no intent or obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law. Overview We are a leading designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor based devices and analog III-V based products. We have a history of innovation and offer thousands of products that are used in end products such as enterprise and data center networking, home connectivity, set-top boxes, broadband access, telecommunication equipment, smartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. We have four reportable segments: wired infrastructure, wireless communications, enterprise storage and industrial & other, which align with our principal target markets. Broadcom Cayman L.P., or the Partnership, is an exempted limited partnership formed under the laws of the Cayman Islands in order to effect the business combination between Avago and BRCM. Broadcom is the Partnership's sole General Partner and currently owns a majority interest (by vote and value) in the Partnership. The acquisition of BRCM, or the Broadcom Merger, closed on February 1, 2016. Recent Developments and Highlights Highlights during the fiscal quarter ended January 29, 2017 include the following: Our cash and cash equivalents were $3,536 million at January 29, 2017, compared with $3,097 million at October 30, 2016.   We generated $1,353 million of cash from operations during the fiscal quarter ended January 29, 2017.   Broadcom paid aggregate cash dividends on its ordinary shares of $408 million, and the Partnership made aggregate distributions of $23 million on its restricted exchangeable limited partnership units, or Partnership REUs, during the fiscal quarter ended January 29, 2017.   On January 19, 2017, two Broadcom subsidiaries completed the issuance and sale of senior unsecured notes, or the Senior Notes, in an aggregate principal amount of $13,550 million. The net proceeds, together with cash on hand,  Table of Contents  were used to repay all of the outstanding term loans under our guaranteed, collateralized credit agreement entered into on February 1, 2016, or the 2016 Credit Agreement, in the aggregate amount of $13,555 million. As a result, during fiscal quarter ended January 29, 2017, we wrote-off $159 million of debt issuance costs, which were included in loss on extinguishment of debt in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Acquisition & Divestitures  Table of Contents  Critical Accounting Estimates  Table of Contents  Results of Operations Fiscal Quarter Ended January 29, 2017 Compared to Fiscal Quarter Ended January 31, 2016 The following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented: Fiscal Quarter Ended January 29, January 31, January 29, January 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (In millions) (As a percentage of net revenue) Statements of Operations Data: Net revenue $ 4,139 $ 1,771 100 % 100 % Cost of products sold: Cost of products sold 1,573 699 38 40 Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 559 130 14 7 Restructuring charges 6 1 - - Total cost of products sold 2,138 830 52 47 Gross margin 2,001 941 48 53 Research and development 808 267 19 15 Selling, general and administrative 201 114 5 6 Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 440 54 11 3 Restructuring, impairment and disposal charges 46 31 1 2 Total operating expenses 1,495 466 36 26 Operating income $ 506 $ 475 12 % 27 %  Net Revenue  Table of Contents  The following tables set forth net revenue by segment for the periods presented:   Fiscal Quarter Ended Net Revenue January 29, 2017 January 31, 2016 $ Change % Change (In millions, except for percentages) Wired infrastructure $ 2,084 $ 386 $ 1,698 440 % Wireless communications 1,175 578 597 103 % Enterprise storage 707 678 29 4 % Industrial & other 173 129 44 34 % Total net revenue $ 4,139 $ 1,771 $ 2,368 134 % Fiscal Quarter Ended January 29, January 31, % of Net Revenue 2017 2016 Wired infrastructure 50% 22% Wireless communications 29 33 Enterprise storage 17 38 Industrial & other 4 7 Total net revenue 100% 100%  Total net revenue increased primarily due to the contributions from acquired BRCM products. Net revenue from our wired infrastructure and wireless communications segments increased primarily due to the contributions from acquired BRCM products included in these segments. Net revenue from our enterprise storage segment increased primarily due to an increase in demand for our hard disk drive, or HDD, products and custom solid state drive controller products. Net revenue from our industrial & other segment increased primarily due to an increase in demand for our optocoupler products. Our total net revenue also included $119 million from development arrangements and sales and licensing of IP, compared to $82 million in the corresponding prior year period, which primarily benefited our wired infrastructure segment. Gross Margin  Table of Contents  Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets recognized in operating expenses was $440 million for the fiscal quarter ended January 29, 2017, compared to $54 million for the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2016. This increase was almost entirely attributable to an increase in amortizable intangible assets resulting from the Broadcom Merger. We expect to incur additional amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets in future periods as a result of any further acquisitions, particularly the pending Brocade Acquisition.   Fiscal Quarter Ended Operating Income January 29, 2017 January 31, 2016 $ Change % Change (In millions, except for percentages) Wired infrastructure $ 933 $ 135 $ 798 591 % Wireless communications 427 265 162 61 % Enterprise storage 375 309 66 21 % Industrial & other 61 63 (2 ) (3 )% Unallocated expenses (1,290 ) (297 ) (993 ) 334 % Total operating income $ 506 $ 475 $ 31 7 %  Operating income from our wired infrastructure and wireless communications segments increased primarily due to contributions from acquired BRCM products. Operating income from our enterprise storage segment increased due to contributions from our HDD products. Operating income from our industrial & other segment increased primarily due to an increase in revenue from our optocoupler products as a result of an increase in demand for these products. Unallocated expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, restructuring, impairment and disposal charges, acquisition-related costs, and other costs that are not used in evaluating the results of, or in allocating resources to, our segments. Unallocated expenses increased 334% in the fiscal quarter ended January 29, 2017 compared with the corresponding prior fiscal year period, primarily due to increases in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, restructuring, impairment and disposal charges, and costs incurred in connection with the Broadcom Merger. Additionally, share-based compensation increased due to RSUs assumed in, and integration equity awards granted to employees acquired in, the Broadcom Merger.  Table of Contents  Our provision for income taxes in future periods is likely to change as a result of the impact of internal restructuring and reorganizations, excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies from share-based awards, and changes in tax regulation.

The
information contained in Item 2.02 and Item 7.01 of this report,
including Exhibit 99.1 (other than with respect to information also
contained in Item 8.01), shall not be incorporated by reference
into any filing of the registrants, whether made before or after

Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This
announcement contains forward-looking statements (including within
the meaning of Section 21E of the United States Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the United States
Securities Act of 1933, as amended) concerning Broadcom. These
statements include, but are not limited to, statements that address
our expected future business and financial performance and
statements about (i) the expected benefits of our acquisition (the
“Acquisition”) of Broadcom Corporation
(“BRCM”), (ii) our plans, objectives and intentions
with respect to future operations and products, (iii) our
competitive position and opportunities, (iv) the impact of the
transaction on the market for our products, (v) other statements
identified by words such as “will”,
“expect”, “intends”, “believe”,
“anticipate”, “estimate”,
“should”, “intend”, “plan”,
“potential”, “predict”
“project”, “aim”, and similar words,
phrases or expressions. These forward-looking statements are based
on current expectations and beliefs of the management of Broadcom,
as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available
to, such management, current market trends and market conditions
and involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the
Company’s and management’s control, and which may cause
actual results to differ materially from those contained in
forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not place undue
reliance on such statements.

Particular
uncertainties that could materially affect future results include
any risks associated with our recent acquisition of BRCM, and other
acquisitions we may make, including delays, challenges and expenses
associated with integrating BRCM and other acquired companies with
our existing businesses and our ability to achieve the


 


 


benefits,
growth prospects and synergies expected from BRCM and other
acquisitions we may make; loss of our significant customers and
fluctuations in the timing and volume of significant customer
demand; our ability to accurately estimate customers’ demand
and adjust our manufacturing and supply chain accordingly; the
significant indebtedness incurred by us in February 2016 in
connection with the Acquisition, including the need to generate
sufficient cash flows to service and repay such debt; our ability
to improve our manufacturing efficiency and quality; increased
dependence on a small number of markets; our ability to timely
increase our internal manufacturing capacity to meet customer
demand; quarterly and annual fluctuations in operating results;
cyclicality in the semiconductor industry or in our target markets;
global economic conditions and concerns; our competitive
performance and ability to continue achieving design wins with our
customers, as well as the timing of those design wins; rates of
growth in our target markets; our dependence on contract
manufacturing and outsourced supply chain and our ability to
improve our cost structure through our manufacturing outsourcing
program; prolonged disruptions of our or our contract
manufacturers’ manufacturing facilities or other significant
operations; our dependence on outsourced service providers for
certain key business services and their ability to execute to our
requirements; our ability to maintain or improve gross margin; our
ability to maintain tax concessions in certain jurisdictions; our
ability to protect our intellectual property and the
unpredictability of any associated litigation expenses; any
expenses or reputational damage associated with resolving customer
product and warranty and indemnification claims; dependence on and
risks associated with distributors of our products; our ability to
sell to new types of customers and to keep pace with technological
advances; market acceptance of the end products into which our
products are designed; and other events and trends on a national,
regional and global scale, including those of a political,
economic, business, competitive and regulatory
nature.

Our
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”), which you may obtain for free at the
SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov, discuss some of the
important risk factors that may affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition. We undertake no intent or
obligation to publicly update or revise any of these forward
looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise, except as required by law.

SAN JOSE,
Calif., and SINGAPORE – September 1, 2016 –

periods prior to the Acquisition relate solely to the
Company’s predecessor, Avago. Unless the context otherwise
requires, references in this press release to
“Broadcom,” “the Company,”
“we,” “our,” “us” and similar
terms are to Broadcom Limited from and after the effective time of
the Acquisition and, prior to that time, to its predecessor, Avago.

	SAN JOSE, Calif., and SINGAPORE 
	March




	 1, 2017 

	Broadcom Limited (Nasdaq:

	AVGO

	), a leading semiconductor device supplier to the wired, wireless, enterprise storage, and industrial end markets, today reported financial results for its first
	quarter of fiscal year 2017, ended January 29, 2017, provided guidance for the second quarter of its fiscal year 2017 and announced a quarterly interim dividend.



	Basis of Presentation



	Broadcom Limited is the successor
	to Avago Technologies Limited (Avago). Following Avagos acquisition of Broadcom Corporation (BRCM) on February 1, 2016 (the Acquisition), Broadcom Limited became the ultimate parent company of Avago and
	BRCM. Financial results for the fiscal periods prior to the Acquisition relate solely to the Companys predecessor, Avago. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this press release to Broadcom, the Company,
	we, our, us and similar terms are to Broadcom Limited from and after the effective time of the Acquisition and, prior to that time, to its predecessor, Avago. The financial results from businesses that have been
	classified as discontinued operations in the Companys financial statements are not included in the results presented below, unless otherwise stated.



	First Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 GAAP Results



	Net revenue
	was $4,139 million, slightly higher than the $4,136 million in the previous quarter and an increase of 134 percent from $1,771 million in the same quarter last year.


	Gross margin was $2,001 million, or 48.3 percent of net revenue. This compares with gross margin of $2,171 million, or 52.5 percent of net
	revenue, in the prior quarter, and gross margin of $941 million, or 53.1 percent of net revenue, in the same quarter last year.


	Operating
	expenses were $1,495 million. This compares with $1,790 million in the prior quarter and $466 million in the same quarter last year.


	Operating income was $506 million, or 12.2 percent of net revenue. This compares with operating income of $381 million, or 9.2 percent of
	net revenue, in the prior quarter, and operating income of $475 million, or 26.8 percent of net revenue, in the same quarter last year.


	Net
	income, which includes the impact of discontinued operations, was $252 million, or $0.57 per diluted share. This compares with net loss of $668 million, or $1.59 per diluted share, in the prior quarter, and net income of $377 million,
	or $1.30 per diluted share, in the same quarter last year.






	Net income attributable to ordinary shares was $239 million. Net income attributable to the noncontrolling
	interest (restricted exchangeable limited partnership units (REUs)) in the Companys subsidiary, Broadcom Cayman L.P. (the Partnership), was $13 million.

	Non-GAAP

	Financial
	Measures



	In addition to GAAP reporting, Broadcom provides investors with net revenue, net income, operating income, gross margin, operating expenses
	and other data on a

	non-GAAP

	basis. This

	non-GAAP

	information includes the effect, where applicable, of purchase accounting on revenues, and excludes amortization of
	acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, restructuring, impairment and disposal charges, acquisition-related costs, including integration costs, purchase accounting effect on inventory, debt-related costs, gain (loss)
	on extinguishment of debt, gain (loss) on disposition of assets, income (loss) from discontinued operations and income tax effects of

	non-GAAP

	reconciling adjustments. Management does not believe that these
	items are reflective of the Companys underlying performance. However, internally, these

	non-GAAP

	measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of evaluating the core operating
	performance of the Company, establishing internal budgets, calculating return on investment for development programs and growth initiatives, comparing performance with internal forecasts and targeted business models, strategic planning, evaluating
	and valuing potential acquisition candidates and how their operations compare to the Companys operations, and benchmarking performance externally against the Companys competitors. The presentation of these and other similar items in
	Broadcoms

	non-GAAP

	financial results should not be interpreted as implying that these items are

	non-recurring,

	infrequent or unusual. Broadcom believes this

	non-GAAP

	financial information provides additional insight into the Companys

	on-going

	performance and has therefore chosen to provide this information to investors for a
	more consistent basis of comparison and to help them evaluate the results of the Companys

	on-going

	operations and enable more meaningful period to period comparisons. These

	non-GAAP

	measures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP and

	non-GAAP

	financial data is included in the supplemental financial data attached to this press release.

	(1)


	For the fiscal quarters ended January 29, 2017 and October 30, 2016, basic income (loss) per share numerators are reduced by the amount of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest, which is
	approximately 5.4% of net income (loss) for each of the fiscal quarters ended January 29, 2017 and October 30, 2016. The noncontrolling interest is related to the restricted exchangeable partnership units of Broadcom Cayman L.P.
	(Partnership REUs), of which Broadcom Limited is the General Partner.






	(2)


	For the fiscal quarters ended January 29, 2017 and October 30, 2016, diluted income (loss) per share numerators and denominators include the impact of the noncontrolling interest, which assumes conversion of
	Partnership REUs to Broadcom ordinary shares. The diluted income (loss) per share calculations include 23 million Partnership REUs for each of the fiscal quarters ended January 29, 2017 and October 30, 2016, representing an assumed
	conversion of 100% of the Partnership REUs under the if converted method.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/27/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
