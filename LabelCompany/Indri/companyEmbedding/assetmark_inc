What are analysts saying about Illinois Tool Works stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Illinois Tool Works stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "In the last three months, Illinois Tool's shares have outperformed the Zacks categorized Machinery-General Industrial market. Over the long run, the company’s organic and inorganic growth tactics, its long-term Enterprise Strategy and sound capital allocation schemes will prove beneficial. For 2017, it increased its earnings guidance to $6.20-$6.40 per share. Organic revenue growth is expected to be 2-4%, an improvement over the prior forecast of 1.5-3.5%. Total revenue is anticipated to come within $13.9-$14.1 billion range. Over the last 60 days, earnings estimates on the stock increased for 2018. " (7/12/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "ITW hosted an Investor Day in New York this morning and provided initial guidance for 2017. Organic revenue growth of 1.5-3.5% and 100bps of EBIT expansion from Enterprise Initiatives are projected to yield EPS in the range of $6.00-$6.20 (Consensus at $6.14 on revenue growth of 3%). With a strong history of execution and low drama, we continue to view ITW as a core holding. Bottom Line: 2017 another year of stable growth. ITW’s preliminary forecast for organic revenue growth of 1.5-3.5% for 2017 compares to current consensus forecast of ~3% but assumes no improvement in end market trends. The guidance includes roughly 50bps of headwind from Product Line Simplification (PLS) actions, lower than the 100bps headwind since 2014-16. ITW’s targeted EPS range of $6.00-$6.20 compares to current consensus of $6.14. Of note: ITW’s 2017 EBIT margin target is 23.5%, 100bps above the 2016 target, and indeed management noted the target could be conservative." (12/5/2016)

Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings.

Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 5 Hold Ratings, 6 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.55)Consensus Price Target: $152.00 (7.31% upside)

AssetMark Investment Services, Inc. and Genworth Life and Annuity Insurance Company Introduce New Guaranteed Income Annuity for Managed Accounts
- Innovative New Product Reduces Market Risks To Retirement Income - 

PRNewswire-FirstCall
RICHMOND, Va.



AssetMark Investment Services, Inc. and Genworth Life and Annuity Insurance Company today announced the introduction of LifeHarbor(SM), a group guaranteed income annuity product. LifeHarbor helps protect an investor's retirement plan by providing an income guarantee while allowing investors to remain invested in a Mutual Fund or Exchange Traded Fund portfolio on AssetMark's managed account platform. The product is designed to meet the needs of consumers who have planned well for retirement, but remain at risk of outliving their retirement savings due to market fluctuations, longevity, inflation and other unforeseen events. LifeHarbor certificates are registered securities. AssetMark Investment Services, Inc. and Genworth Life and Annuity Insurance Company are subsidiaries of Genworth Financial, Inc. .
LifeHarbor enables investors who have a disciplined investment strategy to add an annuity, which provides an income guarantee. With LifeHarbor, investors will receive income for life, even if the markets have depleted their portfolio below the specified account minimum by participating in a group annuity that will guarantee income for life beginning at age 65. Purchasing LifeHarbor today, a 65-year-old investor may withdraw up to 5% of their account value annually. In addition, the income guarantee may increase, subject to certain conditions.
"The concept of taking an insurance guarantee and adding it to a managed account product is at the forefront of our industry. Investors get the best of both worlds - the income stream from the insurance guarantee and the disciplined investment approach with our managed account product," stated Ronald Cordes, Chairman of AssetMark Investment Services. "LifeHarbor is a great by-product of bringing together two pioneering organizations like we have done with AssetMark and Genworth."
AssetMark has partnered with independent broker/dealers to sell this new product through their advisors. "We think this is a revolutionary new investment product that is clearly the next step in the evolution of managed account solutions," stated James Poer, Senior Vice President of National Financial Partners, a leading independent distributor of financial services products.
The minimum investment for an AssetMark account with LifeHarbor is $50,000 for a Mutual Fund investment model and $100,000 for an Exchange Traded Fund investment model. All guarantees paid under LifeHarbor are based on the claims paying ability of Genworth Life and Annuity Insurance Company provided all terms of the certificate are met.
The prospectus for the LifeHarbor guaranteed income annuity contains information regarding the risk factors, fees and charges, as well as other important information about the product that should be considered prior to investing. A prospectus may be obtained at no charge by calling 1.866.447.2530 or going to www.genworth.com/LifeHarbor.

    AssetMark Acquires $1.75 Billion in Assets of Clark Capital’s TAMP   
The deal will also add nearly 700 advisors and Clark’s Personal UMA to AssetMark platform, bringing its total assets to $27 billion








"Clark Capital wants to focus on investment management," Goldman says.





AssetMark Inc. announced today that it had agreed to acquire the turnkey asset management program (TAMP) assets of Philadelphia-based Clark Capital Management Group, adding 670 advisors to the AssetMark platform. The deal will also give AssetMark’s 6,500 advisor platform users access to several Clark Capital investment products, through Clark’s PUMA (Personal Unified Management Account) SMA. 
Clark Capital has $1.75 billion in assets under management in its TAMP program, and $1.55 billion more in assets to which it acts as an asset manager. The deal is expected to close in 2015’s third quarter, after which AssetMark said it will have about $27 billion in total assets.






In an interview Wednesday, AssetMark CEO Charles Goldman declined to provide any financial details of the transaction, but instead said “the way the transaction is being structured is unique: Clark will continue to manage money” for its existing clients and “the TAMP itself and its advisors will become part of” AssetMark’s platform. Clark Capital will also continue to provide relationship management to its existing clients, adding to the “100 relationship managers,” said Goldman, that AssetMark “has in the field.” About 125 of AssetMark’s advisors currently use both the Clark and AssetMark platforms, “and hopefully many more” will do so, said Goldman, the former Schwab and Fidelity RIA custodian executive. 
Those 670 advisors are “all independent advisors,” said Goldman, meaning RIAs and independent broker-dealer advisors, “no employee advisors.” As such, he said there was a “great cultural fit between the two firms.” The transaction provides scale to Clark Capital, and allows its advisors access to AssetMark’s technology, while the “Clark family remains entrepreneurial and can continue to grow” its business under the AssetMark umbrella.
In a statement, Clark Capital Chairman and CEO Harry Clark said the deal “allows us to focus on what we’ve been doing best for nearly 30 years – developing a combination of innovative and traditional strategies that can help clients stay on track to reach their goals.”
Goldman said that the deal reflects the changing nature of the TAMP business, where smaller entrepreneurs are seeing the limitations of their size. “Clark wants to focus on investment management, and they wanted a great home for those nearly 700 advisors.”
Goldman said AssetMark is “going to do more of these kinds of deals – maybe one or two a year.”

January 1, 2017
April 10, 2017
January 1, 2018
It varies depending on whether a Best Interest Contract (BIC) Exemption has been signed




Which of the following does not require a Best Interest Contract (BIC) Exemption or a one-time disclosure?
Recommendation for a client to invest in one of several available front load mutual funds in an IRA, each with different potential share classes and commission rates

Providing general market data including performance, trading volumes, or prospectuses
Discussing service providers in an educational manner such as record-keepers and third-party administrators
Providing education about retirement savings and general investment information
None of the above




Under the final DOL rule, “grandfathering” accounts permits:
A client’s investments with non-level compensation to the advisor to remain in the current portfolio or account until January 1, 2018
A client’s investments with non-level compensation to the advisor to remain in the current portfolio or account subject to fiduciary obligations, if the recommendation was made prior to April 10, 2017 and requiring a negative consent letter
The advisor to continue non-level compensation perpetually, subject to a client’s negative consent
Non-level compensation to remain invested in the non-level product, but requires a Best Interest Contract Exemption
