John C. Carson Jr. Weds Suki Stone, Official at a Bank
Published: March 1, 1987









                    Susan Jane Stone, a daughter of Lieut. Col. William Leete Stone 3d, United States Army, retired, and Mrs. Stone of Bel Air, Md., was married yesterday to John Congleton Carson Jr., a son of Dr. and Mrs. Carson of La Jolla, Calif. The Rev. James F. Madison performed the ceremony at the Episcopal Church of the Holy Trinity in Churchville, Md.        

                    Sarah Ann Stone was her sister's maid of honor. David Bradford Carson was best man for his brother.        

                    Mrs. Carson, who is known as Suki, is an assistant treasurer in the capital markets section of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York. She received B.A. and M.B.A. degrees from the University of Virginia.        

                    Mr. Carson, a bond trader for Morgan Stanley & Company in New York, graduated from Dartmouth College and received an M.B.A. degree from Harvard University. His father is a cardiologist at the Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla and an associate clinical professor of medicine at the University of California at San Diego. His mother, Elizabeth Carson, is president of the La Jolla Civic Center Corporation. The bridegroom is a grandson of the late Frank L. Carson of Wichita, Kan., a chairman of the First National Bank in Wichita, and of the late Dr. Lee Forrest Hill of Des Moines, a president of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Board of Pediatrics.

Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksFind a Local LawyerAll Types - We have a legal expert!Call Now!www.services-connect.comDivorceEmploymentPersonal InjuryCriminal DefenseBankruptcyAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection1. John D Cates Jr Atty312 Scott StMontgomery, AL 36104(334) 262-4887AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection2. John M Bolton Atty425 S Perry StMontgomery, AL 36104(334) 834-7600AttorneysCriminal Law AttorneysServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection3. John A Henig Jr Atty444 S Perry StMontgomery, AL 36104(334) 834-1180AttorneysGeneral Practice AttorneysWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection4. John F Andrews Atty150 S Perry StMontgomery, AL 36104(334) 241-8040AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection5. John S Plummer Atty60 Commerce StMontgomery, AL 36104(334) 834-5290AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection6. John R Bradwell Atty105 Tallapoosa StMontgomery, AL 36104(334) 264-9472AttorneysGeneral Practice AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection7. Hooper John Scott Atty4001 Carmichael RdMontgomery, AL 36106(334) 215-8585AttorneysLegal Service PlansAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection8. John Scott Hooper Atty8325 Crossland LoopMontgomery, AL 36117(334) 271-1555AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection9. John A Little Atty2660 Eastchase LnMontgomery, AL 36117(334) 409-2247AttorneysGeneral Practice AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection10. John R Moody Atty50 Wisteria PlMillbrook, AL 36054(334) 285-1976AttorneysBusinesses in related categories to AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collectionPREFERRED11. McPhillips Shinbaum LLP516 S Perry StMontgomery, AL 36104(334) 262-1911AttorneysWebsiteDirectionsServicesMore InfoFrom Business: We can help you!Add to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collectionPREFERRED12. Weston David Attorney at Law(1)BBB Rating: A+7515 Halcyon Pointe DrMontgomery, AL 36117(334) 517-0268AttorneysBankruptcy Law AttorneysWebsiteDirectionsServicesMore Infovery nice, well mannered, strong Christian.Add to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collectionPREFERRED13. Chambless Math Carr PCBBB Rating: A+5720 Carmichael RdMontgomery, AL 36117(334) 272-2230AttorneysWebsiteDirectionsMore InfoFrom Business: Chambless Math & Carr is a law firm that provides client services in various practice areas.
