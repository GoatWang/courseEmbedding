Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Minnesota:













Does Anderson, Adam D carry a valid contracting license?



Licenses are required for all residential building contractors and residential remodelers who contract with a homeowner to construct or improve dwellings by offering more than one special skill. Owners working on their own property must also be licensed if they build or remodel for the sole purpose of speculation or resale.











How important is contractor licensing in Minnesota?



Contractors acting as sole proprietors, or qualifying persons for a construction related business entity, must pass a two part exam. The first section tests building code compliance knowledge. Section two tests a candidate's understanding of Minnesota business and law.











Your liability risk when hiring Anderson, Adam D



Licensed contractors in Minnesota must carry both active workers' compensation and general liability insurance policies. Request a copy of the insurance certificate for each before any work begins. 











Financial recourse when hiring Anderson, Adam D



The purpose of the Minnesota Contractor Recovery Fund is to compensate consumers who have suffered losses due to a licensed contractor's fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest practices, conversion of funds, or failure to perform. All licensed contractors are required to pay a fee to the fund. The total amount that can be paid out against any one licensed contractor is $75,000. If multiple claims are filed against the same contractor, they are prorated. In these situations, you may not be able to recover your entire loss. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Minnesota, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Business Wire




Dec 18, 2014 8:00 AM EST













 




























































  UnitedHealthcare announced the winners of the second annual UnitedHealthcare Medication Adherence Targeted Intervention Program (TIP ®) Challenge benefiting the National Association of Chain Drug Stores (NACDS) Foundation. The company presented a $90,000 donation to the foundation on behalf of the winning pharmacies at the 16 th annual NACDS Foundation Dinner in New York City earlier this month.   At the National Association of Chain Drug Store Foundation's annual dinner in New York City, representatives from UnitedHealthcare presented a donation to the foundation on behalf of the winners of the second annual UnitedHealthcare Medication Adherence TIP Challenge. From left: Adam Wilson, vice president, Medicare Part D product, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement; Steven C. Anderson, IOM, CAE, chairman, NACDS Foundation Board of Directors, president and CEO, National Association of Chain Drug Stores; Kary Graser, director of account management, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement; John Carlo, senior vice president, pharmacy, Wegmans; Marty Reyhons, director of strategic alliances, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement; Kathleen Jaeger, president, NACDS Foundation; and Andrew Frederick, director of strategic alliances, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement (Photo: Michael Zilz).   UnitedHealthcare created the challenge last year to recognize the pharmacies in its network that have been most successful at helping its Medicare Advantage-Part D plan members take their prescription medications appropriately, thereby helping to enhance their health and well-being.  The company donated $15,000 to the NACDS Foundation on behalf of each of the winning pharmacies - three in the large retail pharmacy chain category, and three in the small retail pharmacy chain and independent community pharmacy category.  The winning pharmacies in the large retail pharmacy chain category are:   Giant Eagle   Publix Super Markets, Inc.   fred's Pharmacies    The winning pharmacies in the small retail pharmacy chain and independent community pharmacy category are:   Wegmans, Rochester, New York   LI Script, West Babylon, New York   Kohll's Pharmacies, Omaha, Nebraska    The 2014 UnitedHealthcare Medication Adherence TIP ® Challenge winners markedly improved medication adherence among a group of UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage-Part D plan members.  Using its analytics, UnitedHealthcare identified members who were at risk for medication non-adherence and then notified the participating pharmacies of those customers who could benefit from pharmacists' medication therapy management services. For example, customers with a pattern of not filling prescriptions or picking up refills were flagged for the participating pharmacies. Pharmacists then worked with these customers through one-on-one consultations to help address their individual barriers to medication adherence, such as cost of their medications, memory problems that cause patients to forget to take their medications, or confusion related to the complexity of their medication regimens.
