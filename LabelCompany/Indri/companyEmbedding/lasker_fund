American Cancer Society-Funded Researchers Win Lasker Award
Sep 8, 2014



An American Cancer Society Research Professor and a former Society grantee are among 5 scientists being honored for major advancements in the understanding, diagnosis, treatment, cure, and prevention of human disease. The winners were announced today by the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation.
American Cancer Society-Walt Disney Family Foundation Professor for Breast Cancer Research Mary-Claire King, PhD won the Lasker-Koshland Special Achievement Award in Medical Science for “bold, imaginative, and diverse contributions to medical science and human rights.” She discovered the genetic BRCA1 mutation in 1990. Women with this mutation are at a much higher risk of developing breast cancer in their lifetime.
King and her colleagues worked for 20 years to discover the gene mutation. In 1994, the American Cancer Society began supporting her continued work in genetics through an endowment by the Walt Disney family. Her ongoing work is focused on uncovering other mutations in known breast cancer genes.
Former Society grantee Peter Walter, PhD, was honored with the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award for his work in deciphering how proteins fold as part of the cell’s normal function. Misfolded proteins appear in some inherited diseases, and decoding this function could help better understand – and perhaps treat – these diseases in future. 
The Society supported Walter’s work in 1994.

Panel Backs CAR T-cell Therapy for Leukemia: What You Need to Know and What’s Next 
The US and Drug Administration (FDA) this week convened a panel of outside experts to weigh in on the readiness of a first-of-its-kind cancer treatment called CAR T-cell therapy. The panel unanimously recommended that the agency approve the treatment. What does this mean for patients? And is CAR T-cell therapy going to play an increasing role in cancer treatment in general? In this interview, Leonard Lichtenfeld, MD, MACP, American Cancer Society deputy chief medical officer, gives us his take.

The Mary Lasker Papers


Title:
[Albert D. Lasker]


 High resolution version (14,694,068 Bytes)

Description:
Albert Davis Lasker (1880-1952) has been called the father of modern advertising.  He had made a fortune after becoming, at
   age 32, sole owner of the Lord & Thomas advertising agency in Chicago and turning it into the world's largest by pioneering
   the use of logos, slogans, and endorsements by celebrities to turn consumer products into distinctive brands.  For his most
   profitable account, American Tobacco Company's Lucky Strike cigarettes, Lasker introduced the brand's iconic logo,
   and featured female opera singers and film stars who encouraged women to take up smoking in public by urging them to "reach
   for a Lucky instead of a sweet."
   Albert shared Mary's interest both in art and in improving public health.  He had set up a fund for medical research at
   the University of Chicago in the early 1930s in search of new treatments for his ailing first wife.

� The Lasker Story - As He Told It
(out-of-print)� Taken at the Flood: The Story of Albert D. Laskerby John Gunther
(out-of-print)




Albert Lasker (1880-1952), with the help of marketing legends
		John E. 
      Kennedy and Claude 
      Hopkins, established modern advertising as it�s known today. 
He started out as a newspaper reporter when still in his teens. But he 
      soon got interested in advertising. 
At age 18, Lasker began his job at Lord and Thomas as an office clerk.
		
After a year, Lasker asked for and was granted a chance to try his luck 
      as a salesman, soliciting accounts in Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan. He was 
      an immediate success. 
Before the next year was over, Lasker made another daring move. He 
      asked Mr. Thomas to put him in charge of a few accounts that were not 
      making any money so he could practice copy writing. Within a year, he 
      achieved a dramatic success with a hearing aid company. 
Both Mr. Lord and Mr. Thomas were impressed with Lasker's ingenuity, 
      which in turn caused a fond rapport to develop among the three men. In 
      1903, when Mr. Lord retired, Lasker purchased his share of the business, 
      thus becoming a partner in Lord and Thomas. 
Early on, Lasker became obsessed with one simple question: "What 
      exactly is advertising?" But he never could get a satisfactory answer.
		
One popular view of advertising at that time was "keeping you name 
      before the people. " Lasker�s response to that was, "Well, suppose I can�t 
      live that long. Suppose I go broke and I can�t keep my name before the 
      people.� 
But Lasker eventually found his answer in 1904 when
		John E. 
      Kennedy, a former member of the Canadian Mounted Police who was 
      working as a copywriter for Dr. Shoop's Restorative, offered this simple 
      explanation: "Advertising is Salesmanship in Print." 
Kennedy went on to explain that advertising should give prospects 
      reasons why they should buy the product being advertised. And why it was a 
      better buy than competing products or alternatives. 
Lasker hired Kennedy to work with him at Lord and Thomas. Kennedy also 
      stressed that the way the ad copy was written and tested was crucial to 
      advertising. 
Lasker began to perceive the need for a copywriting department. Kennedy 
      compiled all of his breakthrough lessons into a training book called "The 
      Book of Advertising Tests". And Lasker hired several young newspaper 
      writers and taught them according to these advertising methods. 
Thus Lasker created the first systematically trained copywriting staff 
      in America. And soon, Lord and Thomas became the training center of the 
      advertising world. Their copywriters were so good that other agencies 
      began luring them away with high salaries. 
Thus, the principles of Salesmanship-In-Print spread throughout the 
      advertising world. And many started their own agencies, like John Orr 
      Young who co-founded Young & Rubicam. 
Kennedy soon left Lord and Thomas in 1907 to establish his own 
      business. But with the new emphasis on copy writing, Lasker started Lord 
      and Thomas on the road to becoming the industry leader. 
In 1908, Lasker hired Claude 
      Hopkins, one of the most gifted copywriters of all time. Hopkins 
      shared the "Salesmanship-In-Print" philosophy. With Hopkins aboard, Lord 
      and Thomas soon became the largest advertising agency in the world. 
Some of the most memorable accounts of these early years included The 
      California Fruit Growers Exchange (which later became the Sunkist Growers 
      Inc.), and Van Camp's pork and beans. 
Leaving the active management of Lord and Thomas to Hopkins, Lasker 
      engaged in politics and briefly baseball between 1918 and 1923. 
In 1918 Lasker went to direct the publicity for the Republican National 
      Committee during the congressional campaigns. In 1920 he led the 
      unsuccessful drive to make Hiram Johnson the Republican presidential 
      candidate. He then took charge of the publicity for Harding's successful 
      1920 presidential race. In the process he introduced modern advertising 
      techniques to politics. Upon Harding's inauguration, Harding appointed 
      Lasker chairman of the U.S. Shipping Board, where he served for two years.
		
In 1916, Lasker purchased a large block of stock in the Chicago Cubs 
      baseball organization. He soon became the controlling stockholder. In 1919 
      amidst claims that gamblers had bribed ball players to throw the World 
      Series, Lasker took it upon himself to do something to restore the game to 
      it's former, honorable place. He fought long and hard for an outside, 
      unbiased authority to run the game. And so it was that Judge Kenesaw 
      Mountain Landis became the first baseball commissioner. 
During this time, William Wrigley, a Chicago chewing gum manufacturer, 
      became a stockholder of the Chicago Cubs organization. In 1925, Lasker 
      sold his interest in the Cubs to Wrigley. Lasker is largely responsible 
      for the decision to change the name of the playing field from Cubs Park to 
      Wrigley Field. 
While Lasker was away, Lord and Thomas slipped from its position as the 
      largest firm in the advertising business. Returning in September of 1923, 
      Lasker set out to regain the industry leadership position. Some of the 
      important accounts of this time were Kimberly Clark, Pepsodent toothpaste, 
      and American Tobacco Company's Lucky Strike Cigarettes. 
In 1926, Lasker entered a new advertising medium - radio. He introduced 
      his "Salesmanship in print" formula to radio and the radio commercial as 
      it is known today was born. 
Lasker had the ability to capitalize on emerging opportunities. The 
      Amos and Andy show was created by Lord and Thomas as a medium to advertise 
      Pepsodent. 
Later a struggling young comedian named Bob Hope was given a chance to 
      make a success of a radio show for Pepsodent. 
Lord and Thomas were the first to broadcast the Metropolitan Opera, 
      "authentic" police and FBI dramas and to chain sponsor Football games. For 
      a brief time in the 1930's, Lord and Thomas regained its position as the 
      biggest advertising agency in the world. 
In the mid 1930's, Lasker began to lose interest in business affairs. 
      One reason was undoubtedly the successful achievement of his goal of 
      industry leadership. More importantly was the death of his wife, Flora, in 
      December of 1936. After 33 years of marriage, her death left him 
      discontented and caused him to seek new friends, activities, and 
      distractions. 
Lasker became disenchanted with the advertising business stating the 
      pioneering had disappeared. As the use of advertising grew, major clients 
      began to question and evaluate the advertising campaigns developed by Lord 
      and Thomas. This angered Lasker, causing him to voluntarily give up major 
      accounts with Quaker Oats, RCA and General Electric. 
Lasker retired as president in 1938 from Lord and Thomas after his son, 
      Edward, failed to embark on an advertising career. He retained ownership, 
      but Don Francisco became the active manager of Lord and Thomas. 
In 1942, Albert Lasker decided to leave Lord and Thomas. He decided to 
      liquidate the firm so that the name Lord and Thomas would cease to be 
      used. 
At this same time he was instrumental in creating a new firm to carry 
      on the work of the existing clients. The new firm was named "Foote, Cone 
      and Belding" and its new owner-managers were Lasker's three senior 
      executives at the time: Emerson Foote in New York, Fairfax Cone in Chicago 
      and Don Belding in California. 
Lasker solicited all of his clients to continue with the new company. 
      All but one client stayed with Foote, Cone and Belding. 
Having retired from the business in 1938, Lasker entered into a new 
      life of public affairs and philanthropy. He met Mary Woodard Reinhardt, a 
      New York industrial designer in 1939. They were married in 1940 in New 
      York. 
His financial contributions and active promotional activities were 
      responsible for major expansions in the nation's medical research 
      activities. He and Mary established
      	The Albert and Mary Lasker 
      Foundation to support medical research. 
In 1944, he spearheaded a fund raising drive that nearly doubled the 
      amount of money spent on cancer research in the United States. He pursued 
      the idea of getting the federal government more involved in medical 
      research. Through Lasker's efforts the National Institutes of Health was 
      established over the period of 1946- 1950. During this period he became 
      ill and on May 30, 1952 he died at the age of 73. 
Lasker's ingenuity and unique ability to explain the product being 
      advertised using the philosophy of "Advertising is Salesmanship in Print" 
      have earned him the title of Founder of Modern Advertising by his peers.
		
His focus on the ad copy and establishment of the copy write department 
      were crucial to the advertising industry's evolution. Lasker's creative 
      use of coupons, radio, and potential to see alternative uses for products 
      were keys to his success and the success of Lord and Thomas. 


Since I study all the great marketing and advertising gurus 
      from the past for a 
    living, you can guess I know what works and what doesn't . But there is only 
      one that has made me serious money. Click here to who.

� The Lasker Story - As He Told It
(out-of-print)� Taken at the Flood: The Story of Albert D. Laskerby John Gunther
(out-of-print)




Albert Lasker (1880-1952), with the help of marketing legends
		John E. 
      Kennedy and Claude 
      Hopkins, established modern advertising as it�s known today. 
He started out as a newspaper reporter when still in his teens. But he 
      soon got interested in advertising. 
At age 18, Lasker began his job at Lord and Thomas as an office clerk.
		
After a year, Lasker asked for and was granted a chance to try his luck 
      as a salesman, soliciting accounts in Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan. He was 
      an immediate success. 
Before the next year was over, Lasker made another daring move. He 
      asked Mr. Thomas to put him in charge of a few accounts that were not 
      making any money so he could practice copy writing. Within a year, he 
      achieved a dramatic success with a hearing aid company. 
Both Mr. Lord and Mr. Thomas were impressed with Lasker's ingenuity, 
      which in turn caused a fond rapport to develop among the three men. In 
      1903, when Mr. Lord retired, Lasker purchased his share of the business, 
      thus becoming a partner in Lord and Thomas. 
Early on, Lasker became obsessed with one simple question: "What 
      exactly is advertising?" But he never could get a satisfactory answer.
		
One popular view of advertising at that time was "keeping you name 
      before the people. " Lasker�s response to that was, "Well, suppose I can�t 
      live that long. Suppose I go broke and I can�t keep my name before the 
      people.� 
But Lasker eventually found his answer in 1904 when
		John E. 
      Kennedy, a former member of the Canadian Mounted Police who was 
      working as a copywriter for Dr. Shoop's Restorative, offered this simple 
      explanation: "Advertising is Salesmanship in Print." 
Kennedy went on to explain that advertising should give prospects 
      reasons why they should buy the product being advertised. And why it was a 
      better buy than competing products or alternatives. 
Lasker hired Kennedy to work with him at Lord and Thomas. Kennedy also 
      stressed that the way the ad copy was written and tested was crucial to 
      advertising. 
Lasker began to perceive the need for a copywriting department. Kennedy 
      compiled all of his breakthrough lessons into a training book called "The 
      Book of Advertising Tests". And Lasker hired several young newspaper 
      writers and taught them according to these advertising methods. 
Thus Lasker created the first systematically trained copywriting staff 
      in America. And soon, Lord and Thomas became the training center of the 
      advertising world. Their copywriters were so good that other agencies 
      began luring them away with high salaries. 
Thus, the principles of Salesmanship-In-Print spread throughout the 
      advertising world. And many started their own agencies, like John Orr 
      Young who co-founded Young & Rubicam. 
Kennedy soon left Lord and Thomas in 1907 to establish his own 
      business. But with the new emphasis on copy writing, Lasker started Lord 
      and Thomas on the road to becoming the industry leader. 
In 1908, Lasker hired Claude 
      Hopkins, one of the most gifted copywriters of all time. Hopkins 
      shared the "Salesmanship-In-Print" philosophy. With Hopkins aboard, Lord 
      and Thomas soon became the largest advertising agency in the world. 
Some of the most memorable accounts of these early years included The 
      California Fruit Growers Exchange (which later became the Sunkist Growers 
      Inc.), and Van Camp's pork and beans. 
Leaving the active management of Lord and Thomas to Hopkins, Lasker 
      engaged in politics and briefly baseball between 1918 and 1923. 
In 1918 Lasker went to direct the publicity for the Republican National 
      Committee during the congressional campaigns. In 1920 he led the 
      unsuccessful drive to make Hiram Johnson the Republican presidential 
      candidate. He then took charge of the publicity for Harding's successful 
      1920 presidential race. In the process he introduced modern advertising 
      techniques to politics. Upon Harding's inauguration, Harding appointed 
      Lasker chairman of the U.S. Shipping Board, where he served for two years.
		
In 1916, Lasker purchased a large block of stock in the Chicago Cubs 
      baseball organization. He soon became the controlling stockholder. In 1919 
      amidst claims that gamblers had bribed ball players to throw the World 
      Series, Lasker took it upon himself to do something to restore the game to 
      it's former, honorable place. He fought long and hard for an outside, 
      unbiased authority to run the game. And so it was that Judge Kenesaw 
      Mountain Landis became the first baseball commissioner. 
During this time, William Wrigley, a Chicago chewing gum manufacturer, 
      became a stockholder of the Chicago Cubs organization. In 1925, Lasker 
      sold his interest in the Cubs to Wrigley. Lasker is largely responsible 
      for the decision to change the name of the playing field from Cubs Park to 
      Wrigley Field. 
While Lasker was away, Lord and Thomas slipped from its position as the 
      largest firm in the advertising business. Returning in September of 1923, 
      Lasker set out to regain the industry leadership position. Some of the 
      important accounts of this time were Kimberly Clark, Pepsodent toothpaste, 
      and American Tobacco Company's Lucky Strike Cigarettes. 
In 1926, Lasker entered a new advertising medium - radio. He introduced 
      his "Salesmanship in print" formula to radio and the radio commercial as 
      it is known today was born. 
Lasker had the ability to capitalize on emerging opportunities. The 
      Amos and Andy show was created by Lord and Thomas as a medium to advertise 
      Pepsodent. 
Later a struggling young comedian named Bob Hope was given a chance to 
      make a success of a radio show for Pepsodent. 
Lord and Thomas were the first to broadcast the Metropolitan Opera, 
      "authentic" police and FBI dramas and to chain sponsor Football games. For 
      a brief time in the 1930's, Lord and Thomas regained its position as the 
      biggest advertising agency in the world. 
In the mid 1930's, Lasker began to lose interest in business affairs. 
      One reason was undoubtedly the successful achievement of his goal of 
      industry leadership. More importantly was the death of his wife, Flora, in 
      December of 1936. After 33 years of marriage, her death left him 
      discontented and caused him to seek new friends, activities, and 
      distractions. 
Lasker became disenchanted with the advertising business stating the 
      pioneering had disappeared. As the use of advertising grew, major clients 
      began to question and evaluate the advertising campaigns developed by Lord 
      and Thomas. This angered Lasker, causing him to voluntarily give up major 
      accounts with Quaker Oats, RCA and General Electric. 
Lasker retired as president in 1938 from Lord and Thomas after his son, 
      Edward, failed to embark on an advertising career. He retained ownership, 
      but Don Francisco became the active manager of Lord and Thomas. 
In 1942, Albert Lasker decided to leave Lord and Thomas. He decided to 
      liquidate the firm so that the name Lord and Thomas would cease to be 
      used. 
At this same time he was instrumental in creating a new firm to carry 
      on the work of the existing clients. The new firm was named "Foote, Cone 
      and Belding" and its new owner-managers were Lasker's three senior 
      executives at the time: Emerson Foote in New York, Fairfax Cone in Chicago 
      and Don Belding in California. 
Lasker solicited all of his clients to continue with the new company. 
      All but one client stayed with Foote, Cone and Belding. 
Having retired from the business in 1938, Lasker entered into a new 
      life of public affairs and philanthropy. He met Mary Woodard Reinhardt, a 
      New York industrial designer in 1939. They were married in 1940 in New 
      York. 
His financial contributions and active promotional activities were 
      responsible for major expansions in the nation's medical research 
      activities. He and Mary established
      	The Albert and Mary Lasker 
      Foundation to support medical research. 
In 1944, he spearheaded a fund raising drive that nearly doubled the 
      amount of money spent on cancer research in the United States. He pursued 
      the idea of getting the federal government more involved in medical 
      research. Through Lasker's efforts the National Institutes of Health was 
      established over the period of 1946- 1950. During this period he became 
      ill and on May 30, 1952 he died at the age of 73.

Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation and The Eric and Wendy Schmidt Fund for Strategic Innovation Join Science Philanthropy Alliance as Associate Members
July 12, 2016, Palo Alto, CA – The Science Philanthropy Alliance announced that the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation and The Eric and Wendy Schmidt Fund for Strategic Innovation have joined the Alliance to support increased giving to basic science. With other new members joining, the Alliance has doubled its membership in the last year from six to 12.
Founded in 1942, the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation seeks to improve health by accelerating support for medical research through recognition of research excellence, education, and advocacy. Since 1945, the foundation has bestowed the Lasker Awards to recognize scientists, physicians, and public servants who have made major contributions to medical science.
The Schmidt Family Foundation advances the development of renewable energy and the wiser use of natural resources. Its grant-making operation, The 11th Hour Project, supports more than 150 non-profit organizations in program areas including climate and energy, ecological agriculture, human rights, and our maritime connection. In 2009, the Schmidts created the Schmidt Ocean Institute (SOI), and in 2012 launched the research vessel, Falkor, as a mobile platform to advance ocean exploration, discovery, and knowledge, and catalyze sharing of information about the oceans. In addition, through The Eric and Wendy Schmidt Fund for Strategic Innovation, the Schmidts support a variety of organizations addressing global issues in the fields of science and technology, education and the environment.
“We are excited to have such impressive leaders in science and discovery join the Alliance and lend their experiences to support philanthropists and institutions interested in giving to basic science,” said Marc Kastner, President of the Alliance. “Our growing membership roster is one indicator of the interest in supporting basic science research. Basic science asks the big questions about the fundamental workings of nature and the universe, and has resulted in game-changing discoveries, such as lasers, GPS, microprocessors, and gene editing.”
About Science Philanthropy Alliance
The Alliance’s mission is to increase private funding for basic science research. It does this by providing advice and learning opportunities for individual philanthropists and foundation staffs on how to support basic research most effectively. The Science Philanthropy Alliance was founded in 2012 by six organizations: the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Kavli Foundation, the Simons Foundation, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and Research Corporation for Science Advancement.
