The international backlog at June 30, 2017 was $76.2 million compared to $54.9 million at June 30, 2016, an increase of 39%. All prior year backlog amounts have been recast to include the backlog of Power Flame Incorporated which was acquired on August 1, 2016.
Excluding pellet plant backlogs of $65.1 million and $144.4 million at June 30, 2017 and 2016 respectively, the Company's June 30, 2017 backlog increased $60.4 million or 27% compared to June 30, 2016. 
Consolidated financial information for the second quarter and year to date ended June 30, 2017 and additional information related to segment revenues and profits are attached as addenda to this press release.
Commenting on the announcement, Benjamin G. Brock, Chief Executive Officer, stated, "Although we were not pleased with our net income for the quarter,  we were pleased that we were able to grow sales while also shipping several new products during the quarter. While the costs associated with building new products and getting them going in the field negatively affected our results as we expected, significantly lower than expected margins on pellet plant installation were our primary disappointment for the quarter."
Mr. Brock continued, "Excluding pellet plants, our backlog is up 27% versus last year. We are pleased that, excluding pellet plants, each of our financial reporting groups increased backlog versus last year. Non-pellet plant backlog increased both in domestic and international markets. Domestically, we continue to experience a good market for our products, mainly as a result of the federal highway bill and other state and local level funding mechanisms. Internationally, our strategy of keeping our sales and service structure in place despite the challenge of the strong U.S. Dollar, which increases our sales prices globally for export equipment, has allowed us to earn orders mainly as a result of pent up demand meeting improved global market conditions."
In closing, Mr. Brock commented, "Given our current backlog and quote activity, we are optimistic on our outlook for the balance of 2017."

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Forward-Looking Statements  These forward-looking statements are based largely on management's expectations, which are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors discussed in this Report and in other documents filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which may cause actual results, financial or otherwise, to be materially different from those anticipated, expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements included in this document are based on information available to the Company on the date hereof, and the Company assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances.  The risks and uncertainties identified herein under the caption "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in Part II of this Report, elsewhere herein and in other documents filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, should be carefully considered when evaluating the Company's business and future prospects.  Overview  � design, engineer, manufacture and market equipment used in each phase of road building, including mining, quarrying and crushing the aggregate, mobile bulk and material handling solutions, producing asphalt or concrete, recycling old asphalt or concrete and applying the asphalt;  � design, engineer, manufacture and market additional equipment and components, including equipment for geothermal drilling, oil and natural gas drilling, industrial heat transfer, wood chipping and grinding, wood pellet processing, commercial and industrial burners, combustion control systems; and  � manufacture and sell replacement parts for equipment in each of its product lines.  The Company, as we refer to it herein, consists of a total of 20 companies that are consolidated in our financial statements, which includes 16 manufacturing companies, 2 companies that operate as dealers for the manufacturing companies, a captive insurance company and the parent company. The companies fall within three reportable operating segments: the Infrastructure Group, the Aggregate and Mining Group and the Energy Group.  Infrastructure Group- This segment consists of five business units, three of which design, engineer, manufacture and market a complete line of asphalt plants, asphalt pavers, wood pellet plants and related components and ancillary equipment. The two remaining companies in the Infrastructure Group primarily sell, service and install equipment produced by the manufacturing subsidiaries of the Company with the majority of sales to the infrastructure industry.  Aggregate and Mining Group- This segment consists of eight business units that design, manufacture and market heavy equipment and parts in the aggregate, metallic mining, quarrying, recycling, ports and bulk handling industries.  Energy Group- This segment consists of five business units that design, manufacture and market heaters, gas, oil and combination gas/oil burners, combustion control systems, drilling rigs, concrete plants, wood chippers and grinders, pump trailers, commercial and industrial burners, combustion control systems, storage equipment and related parts to the oil and gas, construction, and water well industries.  Individual Company subsidiaries included in the composition of the Company's segments are as follows:  1. Infrastructure Group - Astec, Inc., Roadtec, Inc., Carlson Paving Products, Inc., Astec Australia, Pty Ltd and Astec Mobile Machinery GmbH.  2. Aggregate and Mining Group - Telsmith, Inc., Kolberg-Pioneer, Inc., Johnson Crushers International, Inc., Osborn Engineered Products SA (Pty) Ltd, Breaker Technology, Inc., Astec Mobile Screens, Inc., Astec do Brasil Fabricacao de Equipamentos LTDA and Telestack Limited.  3. Energy Group - Heatec, Inc., CEI, Inc., GEFCO, Inc., Peterson Pacific Corp.  The Company also has one other category, Corporate, that contains the business units that do not meet the requirements for separate disclosure as a separate operating segment or inclusion in one of the other reporting segments. The business units in the Corporate category are Astec Insurance Company ("Astec Insurance" or "the captive") and Astec Industries, Inc., the parent company. These two companies provide support and corporate oversight for all the companies that fall within the reportable operating segments.  The Company's financial performance is affected by a number of factors, including the cyclical nature and varying conditions of the markets it serves. Demand in these markets fluctuates in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to the amount of public sector spending on infrastructure development, privately funded infrastructure development, changes in the price of crude oil, which affects the cost of fuel and liquid asphalt, and changes in the price of steel.  The Company believes that federal highway funding influences the purchasing decisions of the Company's customers, who are typically more comfortable making capital equipment purchases with long-term federal legislation in place. Federal funding provides for approximately 25% of all highway, street, roadway and parking construction in the United States.  In July 2012, the "Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act" ("Map-21") was approved by the U.S. federal government, which authorized $105 billion of federal spending on highway and public transportation programs through fiscal year 2014. In August 2014, the U.S. government approved short-term funding of $10.8 billion through May 2015. Federal transportation funding operated on short-term appropriations until December 4, 2015 when the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act ("FAST Act") was signed into law. The $305 billion FAST Act approved funding for highways of approximately $205 billion and transit projects of approximately $48 billion for the five-year period ending September 30, 2020. The Company believes a multi-year highway program (such as the FAST Act) will have the greatest positive impact on the road construction industry and allow its customers to plan and execute longer-term projects, but given the inherent uncertainty in the political process, the level of governmental funding for federal highway projects will similarly continue to be uncertain. In late 2016, the newly-elected administration stated one of its priorities would be a new infrastructure bill including increased funding for roads, bridges, tunnels, airports, railroads, ports and waterways, pipelines, clean water infrastructure, energy infrastructure and telecommunication needs. The funding for the bill as proposed would rely in part on direct federal spending as well as increased private sector funding in exchange for federal tax credits. Governmental funding that is committed or earmarked for federal highway projects is always subject to repeal or reduction. Although continued funding under the FAST Act or funding of a bill passed by the new administration is expected, it may be at lower levels than originally approved or anticipated.  In addition, Congress could pass legislation in future sessions that would allow for the diversion of previously appropriated highway funds for other purposes, or it could restrict funding of infrastructure projects unless states comply with certain federal policies. The level of future federal highway construction is uncertain and any future funding may be at levels lower than those currently approved or that have been approved in the past.  The public sector spending described above is needed to fund road, bridge and mass transit improvements. The Company believes that increased funding is unquestionably needed to restore the nation's highways to a quality level required for safety, fuel efficiency and mitigation of congestion. In the Company's opinion, amounts needed for such improvements are significantly greater than amounts approved to date, and funding mechanisms such as the federal usage fee per gallon of gasoline, which is still at the 1993 level of 18.4 cents per gallon, would likely need to be increased along with other measures to generate the funds needed.  In addition to public sector funding, the economies in the markets the Company serves, the price of oil and its impact on customers' purchasing decisions and the price of steel may each affect the Company's financial performance. Economic downturns generally result in decreased purchasing by the Company's customers, which, in turn, causes reductions in sales and increased pricing pressure on the Company's products. Rising interest rates also typically negatively impact customers' attitudes toward purchasing equipment. The Federal Reserve has maintained historically low interest rates in response to the economic downturn which began in 2009; however, the Federal Reserve raised the Federal Funds Rate in 2016 and again in early 2017, and may implement additional increases in the future.  Significant portions of the Company's revenues from the Infrastructure Group relate to the sale of equipment involved in the production, handling, recycling or installation of asphalt mix. Liquid asphalt is a by-product of oil production. An increase or decrease in the price of oil impacts the cost of asphalt, which is likely to alter demand for asphalt and therefore affect demand for certain Company products. While increasing oil prices may have a negative financial impact on many of the Company's customers, the Company's equipment can use a significant amount of recycled asphalt pavement, thereby partially mitigating the effect of increased oil prices on the final cost of asphalt for the customer. The Company continues to develop products and initiatives to reduce the amount of oil and related products required to produce asphalt mix. Oil price volatility makes it difficult to predict the costs of oil-based products used in road construction such as liquid asphalt and gasoline. Oil prices rose during much of 2016 but have stabilized during the first quarter of 2017. Minor fluctuations in oil prices should not have a significant impact on customers' buying decisions. Other factors such as political uncertainty in oil producing countries, interruptions in oil production due to disasters, whether natural or man-made, or other economic factors could significantly impact oil prices, which could negatively impact demand for the Company's products. However, the Company believes the continued funding of the FAST Act federal highway bill passed in December 2015 has greater potential to impact the buying decisions of the Company's customers than does the fluctuation of oil prices in 2017.  Contrary to the impact of oil prices on many of the Company's Infrastructure Group products as discussed above, the products manufactured by the Energy Group, which are used in drilling for oil and natural gas, in heaters for refineries and oil sands, and in double fluid pump trailers for fracking and oil and gas extraction, would benefit from higher oil and natural gas prices, to the extent that such higher prices lead to increased development in the oil and natural gas production industries. The Company believes further development of domestic oil and natural gas production capabilities is needed and would positively impact the domestic economy and the Company's business.  Steel is a major component in the Company's equipment. Steel prices increased during the first quarter of 2017, and the Company expects this trend to continue through the second quarter of 2017. The Company continues to utilize forward-looking contracts (with no minimum or specified quantity guarantees) coupled with advanced steel purchases to minimize the impact of any price increases. The Company will review the trends in steel prices entering into the second half of 2017 and establish future contract pricing accordingly.  In addition to the factors stated above, many of the Company's markets are highly competitive, and its products compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and dealers that produce and sell similar products. From 2010 through mid-2012, a weak U.S. dollar, combined with improving economic conditions in certain foreign economies, had a positive impact on the Company's international sales. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar from mid-2012 through March 31, 2017 has negatively impacted pricing in certain foreign markets the Company serves. The Company expects the U.S. dollar to remain strong in the near term relative to most foreign currencies. Increasing domestic interest rates or weakening economic conditions abroad could cause the U.S. dollar to continue to strengthen, which could negatively impact the Company's international sales.  In the United States and internationally, the Company's equipment is marketed directly to customers as well as through dealers. During 2016, approximately 75% to 80% of equipment sold by the Company was sold directly to the end user. The Company expects this ratio to remain relatively consistent through the end of 2017.  The Company is operated on a decentralized basis with a complete management team for each operating subsidiary. Finance, insurance, legal, shareholder relations, corporate accounting and other corporate matters are primarily handled at the corporate level (i.e., Astec Industries, Inc., the parent company). The engineering, design, sales, manufacturing and basic accounting functions are handled at each individual subsidiary. Standard accounting procedures are prescribed and followed in all reporting.  During 2016, the Company implemented revised profit sharing plans whereby corporate officers, subsidiary presidents and other employees at each subsidiary have the opportunity to earn profit sharing incentives based upon the Company's and/or the individual groups or subsidiaries' return on capital employed, EBITDA margin and safety. Corporate officers' and subsidiary presidents' awards when calculated at targeted performance are between 35% and 100% of their base salary, depending upon their responsibilities, and the plans allow for awards of up to 200% of the target. Each subsidiary has the opportunity to earn up to 10% of its after-tax profit as a profit sharing incentive award to be paid to its employees.  The Company also implemented revised long-term incentive plans during 2016 whereby corporate officers, subsidiary presidents and other corporate or subsidiary management employees will be awarded Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") if certain goals are met based upon the Company's Total Shareholder's Return ("TSR") as compared to a peer group and the Company's pretax profit margin. The grant date value of corporate officers' and subsidiary presidents' awards when calculated at targeted performance are between 20% and 100% of their base salary, depending upon their responsibilities, and the plans allow for awards of up to 200% of the target. Additional RSUs may be granted to other key subsidiary management employees based upon individual subsidiary pretax profit margins and Company TSR as compared to a peer group.  Results of Operations  Net Sales  Domestic sales for the first quarter of 2017 were $253,497 or 79.6% of consolidated net sales compared to $234,247 or 84.0% of consolidated net sales for the first quarter of 2016, an increase of $19,250 or 8.2%. Domestic sales for the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the first quarter of 2016 increased $12,140 in the Energy Group (including $5,982 of Power Flame sales), $4,318 in the Aggregate and Mining Group and $2,792 in the Infrastructure Group.  International sales for the first quarter of 2017 were $64,904 or 20.4% of consolidated net sales compared to $44,474 or 16.0% of consolidated net sales for the first quarter of 2016, an increase of $20,430 or 45.9%. International sales for the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the first quarter of 2016 increased $9,337 in the Infrastructure Group, $7,286 in the Energy Group and $3,807 in the Aggregate and Mining Group. The increases in international sales occurred primarily in Canada, Russia, Australia, Mexico and Africa, offset by decreases in sales in South America and Japan/Korea. These increased sales were achieved in spite of the continuing strength of the U.S. dollar as compared to the currencies in many of the countries in which the Company operates, low oil and gas pricing, and the continuing sluggishness in the mining sector. The increased sales volumes may indicate a softening of the impact of these issues on the Company's sales; however, the issues continue to be a significant headwind to our regaining historical levels of international sales.  Parts sales for the first quarter of 2017 were $80,959 compared to $74,053 for the first quarter of 2016, an increase of $6,906 or 9.3%. Parts sales as a percentage of net sales decreased 120 basis points from 26.6% for the first quarter of 2016 to 25.4% for the first quarter of 2017. Parts sales increased in all of the Company's segments.  Gross Profit  Selling, General, Administrative and Engineering Expenses Selling, general, administrative and engineering expenses increased $9,315 to $53,121 or 16.7% of net sales for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $43,806 or 15.7% of net sales for the first quarter of 2016 due to increases in selling expenses of $4,298 (including increases in exhibit costs for ConExpo-2017 of $4,254 and commissions of $1,016), general and administrative expenses of $3,721 (including increases in wages of $629, annual incentive earnings of $1,015 and restricted stock unit expense of $403) and engineering expenses of $1,296 (including an increase of $592 in research and development costs).  Interest Expense  Other Income, Net of Expenses  Income Tax Expense  Net Income  Dividends  Backlog  Segment Net Sales: Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 $ Change % Change Infrastructure Group $ 165,243 $ 153,114 $ 12,129 7.9 % Aggregate and Mining Group 100,613 92,488 8,125 8.8 % Energy Group 52,545 33,119 19,426 58.7 %  Infrastructure Group: Sales in this group were $165,243 for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $153,114 for the same period in 2016, an increase of $12,129 or 7.9%. Domestic sales for the Infrastructure Group increased $2,792 or 2.0% for the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 due primarily to increases in mobile equipment related sales of $10,249 and asphalt plant related sales of $8,123, offset by a decline in pellet plant sales of $15,604. The increases in domestic sales are due primarily to increased road building activities impacted by the long-term highway bill approved in December 2015. International sales for the Infrastructure Group increased $9,337 or 56.2% for the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 due primarily to a $7,459 increase in mobile asphalt related sales resulting from improved highway building activities in certain foreign countries. The increase in international sales was also impacted by the Company's decision to market its mobile equipment products through equipment dealers in select territories in which historical direct sales efforts yielded less than desired volumes. Additionally, sales through the Company-owned distributor in Australia increased by 30.5% from the first quarter of 2016 to the first quarter of 2017. Sales increases in Canada, Russia, Mexico and Australia were partially offset by decreases in sales in Europe, South America and China. Parts sales for the Infrastructure Group increased 6.8% for the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 due primarily to improved sales of parts for mobile asphalt equipment.  Aggregate and Mining Group: Sales in this group were $100,613 for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $92,488 for the same period in 2016, an increase of $8,125 or 8.8%. Domestic sales for the Aggregate and Mining Group increased by $4,318 or 6.4% for the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 . . .

Voyager™ Asphalt Plants
The Voyager 120 offers a compact, highly portable design. Unique for a plant in this class with the ability to run up to 30% RAP. In addition, it is backed by the best service support in the industry.
The ASTEC Voyager 120 is built around a counter flow drum featuring ASTEC v-fights. The v-flights provide greater uniformity of the aggregate veil during the drying process, which results in better heat transfer, a reduction of fuel use and increased productivity.

Six Pack® Asphalt Plants
The latest standard Six Pack portable HMA plants come with a Double Barrel® drum mixer, cold feed, scalping screen with inclined conveyor, baghouse, surge bin, drag conveyor and control house. The baghouse load also holds the inertial dust collector. One load handles the SEB and drag conveyor. All ship complete with duct work, dust screws, electrical switch gear, cables, and plant controls. We also supply RAP bins, fuel tanks, lime mixers and AC tanks.

M-Pack® Asphalt Plants
Astec designed a facility for customers who don’t need to move often and still want to reap the benefits of faster and more economical setup. The M-Pack is engineered as a set of modules, which are transported by truck and bolted up at the site. Astec tests each component before shipping it to your site to ensure a hassle free setup. Plus, the M-Pack gives you full-size control rooms, large silos, high production capacity, and excellent maintenance access.

Additional Equipment



Stationary Drum Plants




































Astec stationary plants are suitable for permanent installations, especially when the highest production volumes are required. They allow flexibility for future add-ons as the needs of the contractor change. Stationary plants can accommodate unconventional plant layouts.
Components are supplied with steel legs to grade. Concrete foundations hold the legs and support the components.
Stationary plants are outfitted with Double Barrel® drum mixers and storage silos are used to hold the mix. Like Astec portable and relocatable plants, Astec stationary plants are equipped with many, innovative features not available anywhere else. Astec pollution and noise control equipment include load out tunnels, systems that capture hydrocarbon vapors, stack silencers, and burner blower silencers. This technology makes these permanent facilities good neighbors in their communities.
Astec leads the way with attractive, stationary asphalt plants that offer clean, trouble-free operation.




Stationary Batch Plants




































The batch plant is ideal for metropolitan areas requiring a large number of different mixes. Instead of a continuous mixer, these facilities use a batch tower. Bins in the top section of the tower hold dried aggregate in various sizes. Depending upon the mix needed, the bins automatically dispense the correct amount of the required aggregate. The dry material is routed to a pugmill mixer located at the bottom of the tower. Here the liquid asphalt is added. After thorough mixing, the bottom of the mixer opens and the batch is dispensed into a truck or conveyed to a storage silo.
Depending on the model Astec batch plants produce 45 to 500 tons of HMA per hour. Three model series are offered: TS, Super and BGA. Super towers and TS towers are similar in design. The larger Super tower includes extra-large aggregate bins. BGA towers are based on the proven Barber Greene design for which Astec retains all rights. BGA models are smaller in size.
Astec batch plants are the most modern, most rugged and most dependable in the world.




Recycle Batch Plants 




































A uniquely designed batch plant is offered in the full range of batch plant sizes with varying volumes of hot bin storage. With this design, recycled material is blended with the superheated, virgin aggregate in the bucket elevator and is conveyed to the top of the tower. This allows the operator the versatility to process recycle percentages from 0% to 40% and switch from recycle mixes to virgin mixes without emptying the hot bins.




Batch Drum Plants




































A Double Barrel® mixer can be set up in combination with a batch tower for maximum versatility. This enables the facility to produce a variety of batch mixes and high volumes of continuous mixes using RAP. The counterflow dryer section of the Double Barrel dries all the aggregate. A special diverter gate routes the aggregate leaving the dryer section. Astec storage technology added to the plant gives the producer the possibility to sell a wide range of HMA products.




Coater II Plants





A batch plant with an Astec Coater II can run two HMA production lines, one mixing in batches and the other in continuous runs. The dual-shaft Coater II comes in nine different sizes. Coaters can produce up to 725 tons per hour. These facilities are also outfitted with either a surge bin or a storage silo, a diverter chute for the dryer, weigh bridges for the cold feed bins, and related controls. Existing batch facilities can be retrofitted with the coater as a stand-alone unit.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
