Manufacturing Growth


      Large-scale development projects will play an increasingly important
      role in the Company’s capital program. The strategic shift to
      manufacturing growth is enabled by our large, contiguous acreage
      positions in the Midland Basin, Delaware Basin and New Mexico Shelf.
      Manufacturing mode includes targeting multiple intervals with long
      lateral wells and batch completions and will further power
      capital-efficient development of our high-quality resource.
    

      Concho is currently drilling the Mabee Ranch development project in
      Andrews County, Texas. The project includes 13 two-mile wells targeting
      five landings across the Spraberry and Wolfcamp zones. The development
      pattern implies 32 wells per section. Concho is utilizing leading edge
      technology, including fiber optic monitoring, to assess lateral
      placement, well spacing and completion design of the project.
    

      In the Northern Delaware Basin, the Company has eight development
      projects with at least four wells each, including the Windward project
      in Red Hills. This project targets the Avalon Shale with two-mile
      lateral wells. The Brass Monkey project in the Southern Delaware Basin
      is an eight-well project testing simultaneous development of the 3rd
      Bone Spring and Wolfcamp with long lateral wells.
    

Northern Delaware Basin


      Concho added 16 horizontal wells in the Northern Delaware Basin with at
      least 30 days of production as of the end of the first quarter of 2017
      and an average lateral length of 5,084 feet. The wells delivered record
      performance on both an absolute and lateral-length normalized basis with
      an average 30-day peak rate of 1,473 Boepd (75% oil), which equates to
      productivity of 290 Boepd per one-thousand feet of lateral. The average
      peak 24-hour rate for the wells was 1,825 Boepd. The Company currently
      has eight horizontal rigs in the Northern Delaware Basin.
    

      Extending Robust Oil Plays into the Company’s Deep Area
    

      Outstanding well results in the Company’s Deep area extend the robust
      oil plays further north from the Red Hills area in Lea County, New
      Mexico. In the Deep area, Concho is actively developing the Bone Spring
      and Wolfcamp formations with an emphasis on optimizing lateral placement
      and spacing between wells. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company
      added three wells in the Bone Spring with an average lateral length of
      4,274 feet and average peak 30-day rate of 2,112 Boepd (81% oil).
    

      In addition, Concho’s oil-rich Red Hills acreage continues to deliver
      excellent results. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company added
      five wells. The wells were drilled to an average lateral length of 5,745
      feet and produced at an average peak 30-day rate of 1,980 Boepd (78%
      oil). Here the Company is focused on delineating pay zones by refining
      lateral placement as well as spacing between wells.
    

Southern Delaware Basin


      Concho added nine horizontal wells in the Southern Delaware Basin with
      at least 30 days of production as of the end of the first quarter of
      2017. The average peak 30-day and 24-hour rates for these wells were
      1,632 Boepd (73% oil) and 2,156 Boepd, respectively. The average 30-day
      peak rate and the average lateral length for these wells of 8,184 feet
      both represent Company records for the Southern Delaware Basin. The
      Company currently has six horizontal rigs in the Southern Delaware Basin.
    

      Delivering Strong Results in the 3rd Bone Spring Formation
    

      The Company continues to demonstrate success in the 3rd Bone
      Spring formation in the Southern Delaware Basin. Concho added two 3rd
      Bone Spring horizontal wells during the first quarter of 2017 with an
      average peak 30-day and 24-hour rate of 2,412 Boepd (70% oil) and 2,985
      Boepd, respectively. The average lateral length for these wells was
      10,003 feet.
    

Midland Basin


      Concho added 21 horizontal wells in the Midland Basin with at least 30
      days of production as of the end of the first quarter of 2017. The
      average peak 30-day and 24-hour rates for these wells were 1,164 Boepd
      (88% oil) and 1,453 Boepd, respectively. The average lateral length for
      these wells was 9,910 feet. The Company currently has five horizontal
      rigs in the Midland Basin.
    

New Mexico Shelf


      In the New Mexico Shelf, Concho added seven horizontal wells with at
      least 30 days of production as of the end of the first quarter of 2017.
      The average peak 30-day and 24-hour rates for these wells were 546 Boepd
      (84% oil) and 701 Boepd, respectively. The average lateral length for
      these wells was 4,517 feet. The Company currently has two horizontal
      rigs in the New Mexico Shelf.
    

      Improving Recoveries in Legacy Oil Play
    

      Concho completed the Sneed 9 Federal Com #11H, a 5,490 foot horizontal
      well targeting the Paddock formation. The well achieved peak 30-day and
      24-hour rates of 1,039 Boepd (84% oil) and 1,227 Boepd, respectively.
      Overall, the Company’s program in the New Mexico Shelf is generating
      excellent rates of return due to lean capital costs and advancements in
      completion design.
    

First-Quarter 2017 Financial Summary


      Concho’s average realized price for crude oil and natural gas for the
      first quarter of 2017, excluding the effect of commodity derivatives,

      diluted share, compared to net loss of $1.0 billion, or $7.95 per
      diluted share, for the first quarter of 2016. During the first quarter
      of 2017, Concho completed the sale of its ownership interests in Alpha
      Holding Company, LLC, the owner of the Alpha Crude Connector system

      Adjusted net income (non-GAAP), which excludes non-cash and unusual
      items, for the first quarter of 2017 was $72 million, or $0.49 per
      diluted share, compared with adjusted net loss (non-GAAP) of $6 million,
      or $0.05 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2016.

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures




Unaudited




      The Company reports its financial results in accordance with the United
      States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, the
      Company believes certain non-GAAP performance measures may provide
      financial statement users with additional meaningful comparisons between
      current results, the results of its peers and of prior periods. In
      addition, the Company believes these measures are used by analysts and
      others in the valuation, rating and investment recommendations of
      companies within the oil and natural gas exploration and production
      industry. See the reconciliations throughout this release of GAAP
      financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures for the periods
      indicated.
    

Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and
      Adjusted Earnings per Share


      The Company’s presentation of adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted
      earnings per share that exclude the effect of certain items are non-GAAP
      financial measures. Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings per
      share represent earnings and diluted earnings per share determined under
      GAAP without regard to certain non-cash and unusual items. The Company
      believes these measures provide useful information to analysts and
      investors for analysis of its operating results on a recurring,
      comparable basis from period to period. Adjusted net income (loss) and
      adjusted earnings per share should not be considered in isolation or as
      a substitute for earnings or diluted earnings per share as determined in
      accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled
      measures of other companies.
    

      The following table provides a reconciliation from the GAAP measure of
      net income (loss) to adjusted net income (loss) (non-GAAP), both in
      total and on a per diluted share basis, for the periods indicated:

Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to EBITDAX


      EBITDAX (as defined below) is presented herein and reconciled from the
      GAAP measure of net income (loss) because of its wide acceptance by the
      investment community as a financial indicator of a company’s ability to
      internally fund exploration and development activities.
    

      The Company defines EBITDAX as net income (loss), plus (1) exploration
      and abandonments expense, (2) depreciation, depletion and amortization
      expense, (3) accretion expense, (4) impairments of long-lived assets,
      (5) non-cash stock-based compensation expense, (6) gain on derivatives,
      (7) net cash receipts from derivatives, (8) gain on disposition of
      assets, net, (9) interest expense and (10) federal and state income tax
      expense (benefit). EBITDAX is not a measure of net income (loss) or cash
      flows as determined by GAAP.
    

      The Company’s EBITDAX measure provides additional information which may
      be used to better understand the Company’s operations, and it is also a
      material component of one of the financial covenants under the Company’s
      credit facility. EBITDAX is one of several metrics that the Company uses
      as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of its
      business and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more
      meaningful than, net income (loss) as an indicator of operating
      performance. Certain items excluded from EBITDAX are significant
      components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial
      performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as
      well as the historic cost of depreciable and depletable assets. EBITDAX,
      as used by the Company, may not be comparable to similarly titled
      measures reported by other companies. The Company believes that EBITDAX
      is a widely followed measure of operating performance and is one of many
      metrics used by the Company’s management team and by other users of the
      Company’s consolidated financial statements, including by lenders
      pursuant to a covenant in the Company’s credit facility. For example,
      EBITDAX can be used to assess the Company’s operating performance and
      return on capital in comparison to other independent exploration and
      production companies without regard to financial or capital structure,
      and to assess the financial performance of the Company’s assets and the
      Company without regard to capital structure or historical cost basis.
      Further, under the Company’s credit facility, an event of default could
      arise if it were not able to satisfy and remain in compliance with its
      specified financial ratio, defined as the maintenance of a quarterly
      ratio of total debt to consolidated last twelve months EBITDAX of no
      greater than 4.25 to 1.0. Non-compliance with this ratio could trigger
      an event of default under the Company’s credit facility, which then
      could trigger an event of default under its indentures. At March 31,
      2017, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under all of its
      debt instruments.
    

      The following table provides a reconciliation of the GAAP measure of net
      income (loss) to EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for the periods indicated:

2015


    Despite a challenging commodity price environment, where oil prices declined 47% compared to 2014, Concho delivered excellent results while maintaining a strong financial position.  Daily production volumes for 2015 increased 28%, with crude oil growing by 31%, and exploration and development capital totaled $1.8 billion for the year, as compared to $2.6 billion in 2014.  In total, resource capture for the company increased by 35% to five billion barrels of oil equivalent, including proved reserves.



2014


    Operating one of the largest horizontal drilling programs in the Permian Basin, Concho grew production 22% to 112 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day and proved reserves by 27% to 637 million barrels of oil equivalent. Concho also achieved record EBITDAX of $2 billion, which supported a robust drilling and completion program, and approximately $400 million in acquisitions that expanded Concho’s acreage position in the Permian Basin by about 70,000 net acres.



2013


    Concho delivers year-over-year production growth from continuing operations of 20% and year-over-year crude oil growth of 25%. Concho nearly doubles its drilling locations, identifying approximately 22,000 locations at year-end. Concho produces 33.6 million barrels of oil equivalent with a capital budget of approximately $1.8 billion.



2012


    Concho acquires the assets of Three Rivers Operating Company for approximately $1 billion, significantly adding to the Company’s positions in the core northern Delaware Basin play, the Midland Basin Wolfberry play and the emerging southern Midland Basin horizontal Wolfcamp play. Concho partially funds the acquisition with a $520 million divestiture of non-core Permian Basin assets. Concho produces 29.8 million barrels of oil equivalent with a capital budget of approximately $1.5 billion.



2011


    Concho divests its North Dakota Bakken assets for approximately $200 million and redeploys this capital in the Permian Basin, making several acquisitions totaling over $500 million in the Midland and Delaware Basins. These acquisitions significantly add to the Company’s inventory in the Wolfberry play in the Midland Basin and the Avalon Shale, Bone Spring and Wolfcamp horizontal plays within the Delaware Basin. Concho produces 23.6 million barrels of oil equivalent with a capital budget of approximately $1.4 billion.



2010


    Concho acquires Marbob Energy Corporation, its affiliates and certain related assets for a total purchase price of $1.6 billion. As a result of these transactions, Concho increases its position in the Yeso play on the New Mexico Shelf and adds a new third core area in the Delaware Basin. In addition, Concho divests approximately $103 million in non-core Permian Basin assets. Concho produces 15.6 million barrels of oil equivalent with a capital budget of approximately $ 700 million.



2009


    Concho purchases interests in the Midland Basin Wolfberry trend for approximately $271 million, enhancing its Texas Permian asset base. Concho produces 10.9 million barrels of oil equivalent with a capital budget of approximately $400 million.



2008


    Concho acquires Henry Petroleum, LP and its affiliates for approximately $584 million, establishing a second core area for the Company in the Midland Basin Wolfberry play. Concho produces 7.1 million barrels of oil equivalent with a capital budget of approximately $390 million.



2007


    Concho prices its initial public offering of its common stock at $11.50 per share. The shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CXO. Concho produces 5.0 million barrels of oil equivalent with a capital budget of approximately $155 million.



2006


    Concho Resources Inc. is formed as result of the combination of Concho Equity Holdings Corp. and a portion of the oil and natural gas properties owned by Chase Oil Corporation and its affiliates, establishing Concho’s New Mexico Shelf core area within the Yeso play.



2004


    Concho Equity Holdings Corp. is formed, and represents the third of three Permian Basin-focused companies formed since 1997 by Tim Leach and certain members of the Company’s management. Concho acquires oil and natural gas properties from Lowe Partners, LP for approximately $117 million.

Midland Basin


 


Traditionally a vertical play, over the past three years, the Midland Basin is emerging as a horizontal play for Concho. Since 2008, Concho has drilled more than 1,400 vertical wells targeting the Wolfcamp and Spraberry zones. Today, Concho is primarily developing our Midland Basin position using horizontal drilling and advanced completion techniques. Since our transition to horizontal development, Concho has drilled more than 100 horizontal wells targeting four distinct zones.
During 2015, Concho made significant progress in its horizontal program in the Midland Basin by optimizing drilling and completion methods, including increasing lateral length. These changes allow us to maximize well recoveries and increase resource potential. Further our large, concentrated acreage position and infrastructure network complement the growth opportunities in this region.




Concho has approximately 260,000 gross acres in the Midland Basin.

Permian at our core.
The Permian Basin is one of the most prolific oil and gas regions in the United States, with its first commercial discovery in 1923. It stretches approximately 250 miles wide and 300 miles long, underlying much of southeast New Mexico and west Texas.
Concho's operations are centered on acquiring, developing and exploring for oil and natural gas in the Permian Basin. Our core operating areas include the New Mexico Shelf, the Delaware Basin and the Midland Basin. Concho’s acreage position in the Permian Basin spans approximately 1 million gross acres.
Our legacy in the Permian Basin provides us with a deep understanding of operating and geological trends, enabling us to achieve operational efficiencies. Concho is also at the forefront of applying new technologies to old reservoirs – such as horizontal drilling and enhanced completion techniques. In 2015, approximately 85% of our wells were drilled horizontally. In 2016, we plan to spend substantially all of our planned drilling and completion capital on our horizontal opportunities.




Concho's position in the Permian Basin spans approximately 1 million gross acres.

History[edit]
The company was founded as Concho Equity Holdings Corporation in 2004 by a group of businessmen headed by current CEO Timothy A. Leach. The new company bought oil and gas properties from Lowe Management for $117 million.[4] Concho Equity Holdings merged with some assets owned by Chase Oil Corporation to form Concho Resources Inc. in 2006.
The Corporation went public in 2007 in an initial public offering of $535 million in Concho shares. The corporation was listed on the New York Stock Exchange.[5]
Concho has expanded rapidly by buying out other independent oil and gas producers.
In 2008, Concho bought Henry Petroleum for $584 million, gaining a large acreage position in the Wolfberry play.[6]
In 2010, Concho bought the assets of Midland, Texas-based Marbob Energy for $1.65 billion cash and Concho stock.[7]
In 2012, Concho paid about one billion dollars for the assets of Three Rivers Operating Company.[8][9]
Operations[edit]
In 2014, Concho drilled 329 net wells, and had reserves of 508 million barrels of petroleum liquids. The Oil & Gas Journal listed Concho as one of the 20 fastest-growing US oil and gas companies of 2014.[10]

The new company bought oil and gas properties from Lowe Management for $117 million.[4] Concho Equity Holdings merged with some assets owned by Chase Oil Corporation to form Concho Resources Inc. in 2006.

In 2008, Concho bought Henry Petroleum for $584 million, gaining a large acreage position in the Wolfberry play.[6]
In 2010, Concho bought the assets of Midland, Texas-based Marbob Energy for $1.65 billion cash and Concho stock.[7]

2015


    Despite a challenging commodity price environment, where oil prices declined 47% compared to 2014, Concho delivered excellent results while maintaining a strong financial position.  Daily production volumes for 2015 increased 28%, with crude oil growing by 31%, and exploration and development capital totaled $1.8 billion for the year, as compared to $2.6 billion in 2014.  In total, resource capture for the company increased by 35% to five billion barrels of oil equivalent, including proved reserves.



2014


    Operating one of the largest horizontal drilling programs in the Permian Basin, Concho grew production 22% to 112 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day and proved reserves by 27% to 637 million barrels of oil equivalent. Concho also achieved record EBITDAX of $2 billion, which supported a robust drilling and completion program, and approximately $400 million in acquisitions that expanded Concho’s acreage position in the Permian Basin by about 70,000 net acres.



2013


    Concho delivers year-over-year production growth from continuing operations of 20% and year-over-year crude oil growth of 25%. Concho nearly doubles its drilling locations, identifying approximately 22,000 locations at year-end. Concho produces 33.6 million barrels of oil equivalent with a capital budget of approximately $1.8 billion.



2012


    Concho acquires the assets of Three Rivers Operating Company for approximately $1 billion, significantly adding to the Company’s positions in the core northern Delaware Basin play, the Midland Basin Wolfberry play and the emerging southern Midland Basin horizontal Wolfcamp play. Concho partially funds the acquisition with a $520 million divestiture of non-core Permian Basin assets. Concho produces 29.8 million barrels of oil equivalent with a capital budget of approximately $1.5 billion.



2011


    Concho divests its North Dakota Bakken assets for approximately $200 million and redeploys this capital in the Permian Basin, making several acquisitions totaling over $500 million in the Midland and Delaware Basins. These acquisitions significantly add to the Company’s inventory in the Wolfberry play in the Midland Basin and the Avalon Shale, Bone Spring and Wolfcamp horizontal plays within the Delaware Basin. Concho produces 23.6 million barrels of oil equivalent with a capital budget of approximately $1.4 billion.



2010


    Concho acquires Marbob Energy Corporation, its affiliates and certain related assets for a total purchase price of $1.6 billion. As a result of these transactions, Concho increases its position in the Yeso play on the New Mexico Shelf and adds a new third core area in the Delaware Basin. In addition, Concho divests approximately $103 million in non-core Permian Basin assets. Concho produces 15.6 million barrels of oil equivalent with a capital budget of approximately $ 700 million.



2009


    Concho purchases interests in the Midland Basin Wolfberry trend for approximately $271 million, enhancing its Texas Permian asset base. Concho produces 10.9 million barrels of oil equivalent with a capital budget of approximately $400 million.



2008


    Concho acquires Henry Petroleum, LP and its affiliates for approximately $584 million, establishing a second core area for the Company in the Midland Basin Wolfberry play. Concho produces 7.1 million barrels of oil equivalent with a capital budget of approximately $390 million.



2007


    Concho prices its initial public offering of its common stock at $11.50 per share. The shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CXO. Concho produces 5.0 million barrels of oil equivalent with a capital budget of approximately $155 million.



2006


    Concho Resources Inc. is formed as result of the combination of Concho Equity Holdings Corp. and a portion of the oil and natural gas properties owned by Chase Oil Corporation and its affiliates, establishing Concho’s New Mexico Shelf core area within the Yeso play.



2004


    Concho Equity Holdings Corp. is formed, and represents the third of three Permian Basin-focused companies formed since 1997 by Tim Leach and certain members of the Company’s management. Concho acquires oil and natural gas properties from Lowe Partners, LP for approximately $117 million.

Manufacturing Growth


      Large-scale development projects will play an increasingly important
      role in the Company’s capital program. The strategic shift to
      manufacturing growth is enabled by our large, contiguous acreage
      positions in the Midland Basin, Delaware Basin and New Mexico Shelf.
      Manufacturing mode includes targeting multiple intervals with long
      lateral wells and batch completions and will further power
      capital-efficient development of our high-quality resource.
    

      Concho is currently drilling the Mabee Ranch development project in
      Andrews County, Texas. The project includes 13 two-mile wells targeting
      five landings across the Spraberry and Wolfcamp zones. The development
      pattern implies 32 wells per section. Concho is utilizing leading edge
      technology, including fiber optic monitoring, to assess lateral
      placement, well spacing and completion design of the project.
    

      In the Northern Delaware Basin, the Company has eight development
      projects with at least four wells each, including the Windward project
      in Red Hills. This project targets the Avalon Shale with two-mile
      lateral wells. The Brass Monkey project in the Southern Delaware Basin
      is an eight-well project testing simultaneous development of the 3rd
      Bone Spring and Wolfcamp with long lateral wells.
    

Northern Delaware Basin


      Concho added 16 horizontal wells in the Northern Delaware Basin with at
      least 30 days of production as of the end of the first quarter of 2017
      and an average lateral length of 5,084 feet. The wells delivered record
      performance on both an absolute and lateral-length normalized basis with
      an average 30-day peak rate of 1,473 Boepd (75% oil), which equates to
      productivity of 290 Boepd per one-thousand feet of lateral. The average
      peak 24-hour rate for the wells was 1,825 Boepd. The Company currently
      has eight horizontal rigs in the Northern Delaware Basin.
    

      Extending Robust Oil Plays into the Company’s Deep Area
    

      Outstanding well results in the Company’s Deep area extend the robust
      oil plays further north from the Red Hills area in Lea County, New
      Mexico. In the Deep area, Concho is actively developing the Bone Spring
      and Wolfcamp formations with an emphasis on optimizing lateral placement
      and spacing between wells. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company
      added three wells in the Bone Spring with an average lateral length of
      4,274 feet and average peak 30-day rate of 2,112 Boepd (81% oil).
    

      In addition, Concho’s oil-rich Red Hills acreage continues to deliver
      excellent results. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company added
      five wells. The wells were drilled to an average lateral length of 5,745
      feet and produced at an average peak 30-day rate of 1,980 Boepd (78%
      oil). Here the Company is focused on delineating pay zones by refining
      lateral placement as well as spacing between wells.
    

Southern Delaware Basin


      Concho added nine horizontal wells in the Southern Delaware Basin with
      at least 30 days of production as of the end of the first quarter of
      2017. The average peak 30-day and 24-hour rates for these wells were
      1,632 Boepd (73% oil) and 2,156 Boepd, respectively. The average 30-day
      peak rate and the average lateral length for these wells of 8,184 feet
      both represent Company records for the Southern Delaware Basin. The
      Company currently has six horizontal rigs in the Southern Delaware Basin.
    

      Delivering Strong Results in the 3rd Bone Spring Formation
    

      The Company continues to demonstrate success in the 3rd Bone
      Spring formation in the Southern Delaware Basin. Concho added two 3rd
      Bone Spring horizontal wells during the first quarter of 2017 with an
      average peak 30-day and 24-hour rate of 2,412 Boepd (70% oil) and 2,985
      Boepd, respectively. The average lateral length for these wells was
      10,003 feet.
    

Midland Basin


      Concho added 21 horizontal wells in the Midland Basin with at least 30
      days of production as of the end of the first quarter of 2017. The
      average peak 30-day and 24-hour rates for these wells were 1,164 Boepd
      (88% oil) and 1,453 Boepd, respectively. The average lateral length for
      these wells was 9,910 feet. The Company currently has five horizontal
      rigs in the Midland Basin.
    

New Mexico Shelf


      In the New Mexico Shelf, Concho added seven horizontal wells with at
      least 30 days of production as of the end of the first quarter of 2017.
      The average peak 30-day and 24-hour rates for these wells were 546 Boepd
      (84% oil) and 701 Boepd, respectively. The average lateral length for
      these wells was 4,517 feet. The Company currently has two horizontal
      rigs in the New Mexico Shelf.
    

      Improving Recoveries in Legacy Oil Play
    

      Concho completed the Sneed 9 Federal Com #11H, a 5,490 foot horizontal
      well targeting the Paddock formation. The well achieved peak 30-day and
      24-hour rates of 1,039 Boepd (84% oil) and 1,227 Boepd, respectively.
      Overall, the Company’s program in the New Mexico Shelf is generating
      excellent rates of return due to lean capital costs and advancements in
      completion design.
    

First-Quarter 2017 Financial Summary


      Concho’s average realized price for crude oil and natural gas for the
      first quarter of 2017, excluding the effect of commodity derivatives,
      was $49.08 per Bbl and $3.00 per Mcf, respectively, compared with $29.90
      per Bbl and $1.50 per Mcf, respectively, for the first quarter of 2016.
    

      Net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $650 million, or $4.37 per
      diluted share, compared to net loss of $1.0 billion, or $7.95 per
      diluted share, for the first quarter of 2016. During the first quarter

Forward-Looking Statements and Cautionary Statements


The foregoing contains “forward-looking statements” within the
      meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of
      the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements, other than
      statements of historical fact, included in this press release that
      address activities, events or developments that the Company expects,
      believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are
      forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements contained in this
      press release specifically include statements, estimates and projections
      regarding the Company’s future financial position, operations,
      performance, business strategy, oil and natural gas reserves, drilling
      program, capital expenditure budget, liquidity and capital resources,
      the timing and success of specific projects, outcomes and effects of
      litigation, claims and disputes, derivative activities and potential
      financing. The words “estimate,” “project,” “predict,” “believe,”
      “expect,” “anticipate,” “potential,” “could,” “may,” “foresee,” “plan,”
      “goal” or other similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of
      future events or outcomes are intended to identify forward-looking
      statements, which generally are not historical in nature. However, the
      absence of these words does not mean that the statements are not
      forward-looking. These statements are based on certain
      assumptions and analyses made by the Company based on management’s
      experience, expectations and perception of historical trends, current
      conditions, anticipated future developments and other factors believed
      to be appropriate. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of
      performance. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in
      its forward-looking statements are reasonable and are based on
      reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these assumptions
      are accurate or that any of these expectations will be achieved (in full
      or at all) or will prove to have been correct. Moreover, such statements
      are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of
      which are beyond the control of the Company, which may cause actual
      results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the
      forward-looking statements. These include the risk factors discussed or
      referenced in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and
      in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended
      March 31, 2017; risks relating to declines in, or the sustained
      depression of, the prices the Company receives for its oil and natural
      gas; uncertainties about the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas
      reserves; drilling, completion and operating risks; the effects of
      government regulation, permitting and other legal requirements,
      including new legislation or regulation of hydraulic fracturing and the
      export of oil and natural gas; environmental hazards, such as
      uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas
      or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater
      contamination; difficult and adverse conditions in the domestic and
      global capital and credit markets; risks related to the concentration of
      the Company’s operations in the Permian Basin of Southeast New Mexico
      and West Texas; disruptions to, capacity constraints in or other
      limitations on the pipeline systems that deliver the Company’s oil,
      natural gas liquids and natural gas and other processing and
      transportation considerations; the costs and availability of equipment,
      resources, services and qualified personnel required to perform the
      Company’s drilling and operating activities; potential financial losses
      or earnings reductions from the Company’s commodity price
      risk-management program; risks and liabilities associated with acquired
      properties or businesses; uncertainties about the Company’s ability to
      successfully execute its business and financial plans and strategies;
      the adequacy of the Company’s capital resources and liquidity including,
      but not limited to, access to additional borrowing capacity under the
      Company’s credit facility; the impact of potential changes in the
      Company’s credit ratings; cybersecurity risks, such as those involving
      unauthorized access, malicious software, data privacy breaches by
      employees or others with authorized access, cyber or phishing-attacks,
      ransomware and other security issues; uncertainties about the Company’s
      ability to replace reserves and economically develop its current
      reserves; general economic and business conditions, either
      internationally or domestically; competition in the oil and natural gas
      industry; uncertainty concerning the Company’s assumed or possible
      future results of operations; and other important factors that could
      cause actual results to differ materially from those projected.


Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which
      such statement is made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to
      correct or update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of
      new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by
      applicable law.

Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Measures




Unaudited




      The Company reports its financial results in accordance with the United
      States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, the
      Company believes certain non-GAAP performance measures may provide
      financial statement users with additional meaningful comparisons between
      current results, the results of its peers and of prior periods. In
      addition, the Company believes these measures are used by analysts and
      others in the valuation, rating and investment recommendations of
      companies within the oil and natural gas exploration and production
      industry. See the reconciliations throughout this release of GAAP
      financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures for the periods
      indicated.
    

Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and
      Adjusted Earnings per Share


      The Company’s presentation of adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted
      earnings per share that exclude the effect of certain items are non-GAAP
      financial measures. Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings per
      share represent earnings and diluted earnings per share determined under
      GAAP without regard to certain non-cash and unusual items. The Company
      believes these measures provide useful information to analysts and
      investors for analysis of its operating results on a recurring,
      comparable basis from period to period. Adjusted net income (loss) and
      adjusted earnings per share should not be considered in isolation or as
      a substitute for earnings or diluted earnings per share as determined in
      accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled
      measures of other companies.
    

      The following table provides a reconciliation from the GAAP measure of
      net income (loss) to adjusted net income (loss) (non-GAAP), both in
      total and on a per diluted share basis, for the periods indicated:

Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to EBITDAX


      EBITDAX (as defined below) is presented herein and reconciled from the
      GAAP measure of net income (loss) because of its wide acceptance by the
      investment community as a financial indicator of a company’s ability to
      internally fund exploration and development activities.
    

      The Company defines EBITDAX as net income (loss), plus (1) exploration
      and abandonments expense, (2) depreciation, depletion and amortization
      expense, (3) accretion expense, (4) impairments of long-lived assets,
      (5) non-cash stock-based compensation expense, (6) gain on derivatives,
      (7) net cash receipts from derivatives, (8) gain on disposition of
      assets, net, (9) interest expense and (10) federal and state income tax
      expense (benefit). EBITDAX is not a measure of net income (loss) or cash
      flows as determined by GAAP.
    

      The Company’s EBITDAX measure provides additional information which may
      be used to better understand the Company’s operations, and it is also a
      material component of one of the financial covenants under the Company’s
      credit facility. EBITDAX is one of several metrics that the Company uses
      as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of its
      business and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more
      meaningful than, net income (loss) as an indicator of operating
      performance. Certain items excluded from EBITDAX are significant
      components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial
      performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as
      well as the historic cost of depreciable and depletable assets. EBITDAX,
      as used by the Company, may not be comparable to similarly titled
      measures reported by other companies. The Company believes that EBITDAX
      is a widely followed measure of operating performance and is one of many
      metrics used by the Company’s management team and by other users of the
      Company’s consolidated financial statements, including by lenders
      pursuant to a covenant in the Company’s credit facility. For example,
      EBITDAX can be used to assess the Company’s operating performance and
      return on capital in comparison to other independent exploration and
      production companies without regard to financial or capital structure,
      and to assess the financial performance of the Company’s assets and the
      Company without regard to capital structure or historical cost basis.
      Further, under the Company’s credit facility, an event of default could
      arise if it were not able to satisfy and remain in compliance with its
      specified financial ratio, defined as the maintenance of a quarterly
      ratio of total debt to consolidated last twelve months EBITDAX of no
      greater than 4.25 to 1.0. Non-compliance with this ratio could trigger
      an event of default under the Company’s credit facility, which then
      could trigger an event of default under its indentures. At March 31,
      2017, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under all of its
      debt instruments.
    

      The following table provides a reconciliation of the GAAP measure of net
      income (loss) to EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for the periods indicated:

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Introducing my new sales associate...Jake.Jake has no sales experience, but he does his best to please everyone that walks in. He's still learning all the product and apparently some taste better than others.  He's a great doorbell and tends to scare off solicitors.







 It is very good advice to believe only what one does, 
rather than what one says he does.
 





My name is Harold Arnett and I am proud to offer you the following assortment of products inspired from growing up in and living in Texas. I'm a former store manager, Director of Research and Development, Buyer, Marketing and Merchandise Manager for Tandy Leather Company. I have 36 years experience in the sourcing, manufacturing, wholesale and retail of Western craft related products and love to create new and innovative products. 
While traveling through TexHAs, I hope you find a few things that you just can't live without. Please check back occasionally to see what we have that's new.
Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express and PayPal are welcome inTexHAs.





As you travel across TexHAs, you'll notice some items that are"Temporarily Sold Out". Please keep in mind that if my products were all that common, I'd be able to just order them from another supplierand never be out of stock.But that's not the case.Quailty, competitive pricing, customer concern and uncommon products make TexHAs a great place to shop.
Some TexHAs pages may be slower to load than others and please be patient. I'm working to fix that. 
Thanks for visiting TexHAs,Harold

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
