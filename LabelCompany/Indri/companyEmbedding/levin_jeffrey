Copyright
The following elements of this website are protected by United States and international copyright laws and are the property of Jeffrey Levin:  - All text, graphics, logos, button icons, images, audio clips, digital downloads and data compilations, both individually and as they are compiled on the site;  - All software.

Accuracy
We aim to provide only accurate information on jeffreylevin.com. However, it is possible that errors can occur related to omissions, product information, pricing and availability. Jeffrey Levin cannot guarantee that the color of metals and stones or the handcrafted finish of an item will exactly match or reflect the colors shown on your screen. Jeffrey Levin reserves the right to make corrections to errors at any time, including after an order has been placed. We acknowledge that human and technological errors can be a hindrance and do sincerely apologize in advance for any inconvenience we could cause.
Handcrafted Jewelry
The majority of orders at Jeffrey Levin are custom made to our customers’ exact specifications and therefore can take two to four weeks delivery time. Handcrafted jewelry in comparison to computer-aided design and machine made design is very different. When a piece is handcrafted it is subject to unique perfection and therefore may have some variations in pieces. The finish is a worked method, will have its own uniqueness and may not match the product image on the website exactly.
Sizing for Wristwear
Wrist diameter varies with every body type, womenswear vs menswear. A simple way to determine sizing for wristwear (bracelets and bangles) is take a string and wrap it around your wrist, just above the wristbone. Mark or cut the string, measure on a ruler and round up to the nearest 1/2 inch. Traditionally, wristwear is recommended to be 1/2 to 1 inch larger than your wrist. Any deviation is a personal choice. Most women order 7.5 inch wristwear and most men 8.25 inch.
Retail Customer Return Policy
Jeffrey Levin will accept items for exchange or credit only within 21 days from the date order is delivered to the customer, accompanied by a sales receipt. Custom, Special Order and Sales items will not be returnable. Items received as gifts (except Custom, Special Order and Sales items) may be exchanged.
