INNOVATE.

A Technology Transformation
“As InvenTrust has transformed its portfolio, so too have our IT needs changed. Our baseline of technical tools was geared for a portfolio that supported multiple property types.  With the organizational evolution to pure retail, I am proud to say technology has also evolved. Financial accounting, document management, internal processing systems and Business Intelligence platforms have all been upgraded. We are truly adding value to the business through technology.”
– Dipesh Shah, SVP – Chief Information Officer
MORE ABOUT WHO WE ARE








COLLABORATE.

Moving Forward Together
“Prior to joining InvenTrust Properties Corp, I had met a couple of company employees at an industry meeting, and was struck by the company’s values. When I had the opportunity to join the team, I was intrigued by the potential for a leadership position that would add impact to the progressive culture, and by the company’s commitment to developing strong teams. In my first three months, I hired two managers and opened two new offices.  Everything that we are doing every day is moving the company forward, and this creates a lot of positive energy.” 
– Jennifer Roeser, CPM – Director, Property Management
MORE ABOUT CAREERS AT INVENTRUST








GROW.

Growing Asset Quality and Value
“We have been selectively selling non-strategic assets, focusing on building a retail platform for continued value growth. Two of our new acquisitions, The Shops at the Galleria in the Austin market, and Renaissance Place in Raleigh/Durham, exemplify our quest for quality. We believe that significant retail market assets such as these, along with our proficiency in leasing and redevelopment, can increase shareholder value in the long term.”
– Michael Podboy, EVP - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Investment Officer and Treasurer

InvenTrust Properties Corp. Extends Tender Offer | Business Wire


























































InvenTrust Properties Corp. Extends Tender Offer






November 28, 2016 02:04 PM Eastern Standard Time



OAK BROOK, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--InvenTrust Properties Corp. (“InvenTrust” or the “Company”) announced 
      today that in order to provide additional time to stockholders to submit 
      paperwork to validly tender their shares, and to allow them to correct 
      any paperwork submitted in error, the Company has decided to extend its 
      modified “Dutch Auction” tender offer (the “Offer”) to 5:00 p.m. New 
      York Time on Thursday, December 1, 2016. The Offer was previously 
      scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m. New York Time on Monday, November 28, 
      2016.
    

      In accordance with the terms of the Offer and subject to its conditions, 
      tendering stockholders will specify the price or prices at which they 
      are tendering their shares, which may not be greater than $2.94 nor less 
      than $2.45 per share. The purchase price will be the lowest price that 
      will enable the Company to buy up to $200 million in value of its shares 
      of common stock pursuant to the Offer. Upon expiration, payment for the 
      shares of common stock accepted for purchase under the Offer will occur 
      promptly in accordance with applicable law.
    

      None of the Company, its board of directors, or DST Systems, Inc. 
      (“DST”), in its capacity as depositary, paying agent or information 
      agent, makes any recommendation to stockholders as to whether to tender 
      or refrain from tendering their shares or as to the price or the prices 
      at which they may choose to tender their shares. Each stockholder must 
      make his, her or its own decision whether to tender shares, and if so, 
      how many shares to tender and the price or prices at which to tender.
    

      As of November 25, 2016, approximately 109.1 million shares have been 
      tendered. Please note that the number of shares tendered may change 
      significantly between such date and the new expiration date of December 
      1, 2016. In accordance with rules promulgated by the Securities and 
      Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the Company may increase the number of 
      shares accepted for payment in the Offer by up to 2% of the outstanding 
      shares without amending or extending the Offer. This could result in the 
      dollar value of the Offer increasing by up to approximately $42 million 
      assuming a purchase price at the low end of the range or $51 million 
      assuming a purchase price at the high end of the range. All shares 
      purchased by the Company pursuant to the Offer will be purchased at the 
      same price. InvenTrust expects to fund the tender offer with cash on 
      hand.
    

      Any questions or requests for assistance may be directed to DST by 
      telephone toll free at 855-377-0510. Requests for copies of the offer to 
      purchase, the letter of transmittal or other tender offer materials may 
      be directed to the information agent and such copies will be furnished 
      promptly at the Company’s expense. Stockholders may also want to 
      consider contacting their broker dealer, commercial bank, trust company, 
      custodian or other nominee for assistance concerning the Offer.
    

Important Notice


      This press release is a summary provided for informational purposes only 
      and is not an offer to buy or the solicitation of an offer to sell any 
      securities of the Company. The full details of the modified “Dutch 
      Auction” tender offer, including complete instructions on how to tender 
      shares, will be included in the offer to purchase, the letter of 
      transmittal and other related materials, which the Company will publish, 
      send or give to stockholders upon commencement of the tender offer, and 
      file with the SEC. Stockholders are urged to read carefully the offer to 
      purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related materials when 
      they become available because they contain important information, 
      including the terms and conditions of the Offer. Stockholders may obtain 
      free copies of the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and 
      other related materials after they are filed by the Company with the SEC 
      at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. 
      Each stockholder should consult with its tax advisor, broker, dealer, 
      commercial bank, trust company, custodian or other nominee to evaluate 
      the consequences of tendering or selling Shares in the Offer.

Forward-Looking Statements Disclaimer


      Forward-Looking Statements in this press release, which are not 
      historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of 
      the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking 
      statements are statements that are not historical, including statements 
      regarding management’s intentions, beliefs, expectations, plans or 
      predictions of the future and are typically identified by words such as 
      “may,” “could,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “seek,” “anticipate,” 
      “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,” “likely,” 
      “will,” “would” and variations of these terms and similar expressions, 
      or the negative of these terms or similar expressions. Such 
      forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and 
      assumptions that, while considered reasonable by us and our management, 
      are inherently uncertain and involve known and unknown risks that are 
      difficult to predict. Factors that may cause actual results to differ 
      materially from current expectations include, among others, the Risk 
      Factors included in InvenTrust’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, 
      as updated by any subsequent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in each case 
      as filed with the SEC. InvenTrust intends that such forward-looking 
      statements be subject to the safe harbors created by Section 27A of the 
      Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities 
      Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except as may be required by 
      applicable law. We caution you not to place undue reliance on any 
      forward-looking statements, which are made as of the date of this press 
      release. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any of these 
      forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, new information or 
      future events, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors 
      affecting forward-looking statements, except to the extent required by 
      applicable laws. If we update one or more forward-looking statements, no 
      inference should be drawn that we will make additional updates with 
      respect to those or other forward-looking statements.
