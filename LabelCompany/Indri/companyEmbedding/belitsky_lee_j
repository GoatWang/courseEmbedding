                            Dick's Sporting Goods Inc. (NYSE: DKS) has a new CFO.                        










 


Belitsky has been executive vice president, product development and merchandise planning, allocation and replenishment. He has also served in a number of senior vice president roles over the past 19 years since joining Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE: DKS) in 1997 as vice president, controller. He has also been CFO for Domain and was an executive with Morse Shoes Inc. and KPMG.




"Lee's strong financial acumen and extensive leadership experience across finance, strategy and operations will be instrumental to the continued growth and success of the company," said Chairman and CEO Edward W. Stack in a statement.
Joseph R. Oliver has been named senior vice president, merchandise planning, allocation and replenishment, to replace Belitsky. Oliver had been senior vice president, chief accounting officer.
List-Stoll departed Dick's in August, and Hawaux had been interim CFO since then.
