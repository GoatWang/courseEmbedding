BIOMASS AND BIOFUELS
More efficient and more cost effective process for producing biofuels, in particular bioalcohol, using hydrodynamic flow trough cavitation.

a process for the extraction of carbohydrates from biomass using hydrodynamic cavitation; and
a process for converting the carbohydrates into bioalcohol using hydrodynamic cavitation.

The present invention uses hydrodynamic cavitation for processing heterogeneous and homogeneous liquid systems. The cavitation facilitates synthesis of intermediate and final products in the overall production of biofuels.
Alcoholic biofuels (or bioalcohol), such as methanol, ethanol, butanol, propanol, etc., may be derived from biological materials, i.e., biomass. The biomass may include corn cob, corn stover, cotton stalk, wheat straw, rice straw, sugarcane bagasse, switchgrass, poplar wood, sorghum straw, and/or water hyacinth.CT's patented  Nano cavitation  reactor is highly versatile for the extraction of carbohydrates from ligno-cellulosic biomass (or the biomass pretreatment), which is an important and cost-intensive step in the synthesis of (alcoholic) biofuels, especially through the fermentation (or biochemical) route. Hydrodynamic cavitation is useful in the pretreatment of biomass prior to synthesis of biofuels – primarily through fermentation. Such processing enhances the release of carbohydrates or sugars from biomass prior to fermentation of hydrolyzate (comprising of hexose and pentose sugars).A large portion of the carbohydrates are extracted from the biomass by an acid or alkali hydrolysis process, which process is aided by the hydrodynamic cavitation. 
Strong microturbulence generated by hydrodynamic cavitation helps in the faster and more efficient transport of sugar moieties out of the biomass matrix into the solution.
The Nano cavitation device is particularly efficient at mixing the biomass with reagents and generating in this mixture the transient cavitation features followed by separation of the reaction mixture comprised of the extracted carbohydrates, residual initial reagents, remaining biomass, and other by-products.
Constant refreshing of the water in the biomass matrix enhances the rate of hydrolysis due to the fresh supply of hydrolyzing ions inside the biomass matrix and also dissolution of sugar and carbohydrate molecules leading to enhanced yield. The shock waves generated by microbubbles also help in expanding or swelling of biomass that increases the net voidage of the matrix allowing for, smoother flow of liquid medium or water through the matrix.
These pretreatments are applied prior to the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose in the biomass. The pretreatment has a two-fold purpose: (1) to break down the shield formed by lignin and emicellulose which results in better andhigher accessibility of enzymes to the cellulose during enzyme hydrolysis; and (2) to reduce the degree of polymerization of cellulose with disruption of crystalline structure, which enhances the yield of the enzymatic hydrolysis. The ligno-cellulosic biomass is typically in the form of agro- or forest residue.   Biomass pretreatment is perhaps the most cost intensive step in overall biofuels synthesis. Obviously, any advancement of the pretreatment technology would have a significant impact on the economics of biofuels.
Process
A process for extracting carbohydrates from biomass, comprising the steps of: preparing the biomass for extraction of carbohydrates; forming a first biomass solution comprising the prepared biomass, water, and acid or an alkali; subjecting the first biomass solution to a first Nano cavitation treatment, wherein acid or alkali hydrolysis of the biomass occurs; filtering the first biomass solution into a first filtrate and an intermediate biomass, wherein the first filtrate contains extracted carbohydrates; creating a second biomass solution comprising the intermediate biomass, water and an enzyme source; exposing the second biomass solution to a second hydrodynamic cavitation treatment, wherein enzymatic hydrolysis of the biomass occurs; filtering the second biomass solution into a second filtrate and a filtered biomass, wherein the second filtrate contains extracted carbohydrates. Fermenting the second filtrate to create a bioalcohol and separating the bioalcohol by distillation or similar process. The first and second filtrates may be combined and fermented in a single step. 

Nano cavitation treatment, wherein acid or alkali hydrolysis of the biomass occurs;
A second hydrodynamic cavitation treatment, wherein enzymatic hydrolysis of the biomass occurs;

Test
After cavitation of corn slurry, enzyme was added to the samples and a short  1 hour hydrolysis followed. The treated samples were found to yield  2-3 times more reducing sugar compared to the control (untreated) samples. The study suggests that Cti Nano cavitation systems enhances enzymatic hydrolysis yield, reduces particle size of corn slurry and could be a potential effective pretreatment for corn slurry.
We have done extensive study with cavitation in this particular field and seen substantial improvement up to 35% increase in yield.

Petroleum Upgrading
Based on the results of thorough testing, the Company’s proprietary technology of petroleum upgrading was proven to be capable of breaking down asphaltene agglomerates, improving both the viscosity and API gravity for a prolonged period of time, reducing pumping and atomization costs, facilitating hydrocarbon cracking and increasing the refining yields.
When petroleum is fed into a flow-through, multi-stage, specialized cavitation device with a pump at a proper velocity, advanced hydrodynamic cavitation generates numerous vapor-filled bubbles in the flow. The implosion of the bubbles results in vigorous mixing and creates local pressure and a temperature up to 1,000 atm and 5,000 K, correspondingly. The cavitation heats petroleum, disrupts its matrix and improves API gravity and viscosity by 10-15%. Asphaltene agglomerates and hydrocarbons are broken down, which facilitates their fragmentation into more valuable products. The treatment changes the Bromine number by 6-16% and may generate hydrogen from water, which results in the termination of radical reactions. The typical capacity of CTi’s state-of-the-art hydrodynamic devices and skids, which can be installed in line, is 3,500 barrels per day (bbl/day) and higher. Power consumption is about 650 W per barrel. All of the Company’s devices are compact, durable, turn-key, easy to install and maintain and feature superior performance in: mixing, de-agglomeration, dispersing, emulsification, atomization, desalting, crude oil dewatering, waste water de-oiling and phase-transfer reactions. The cavitation of oil and the FCC feed lowers the cost of pumping and atomization, reduces the amount of steam or low molecular weight atomizing agents and facilitates the cracking of hydrocarbons, which increases the gasoline yield. Refineries and plants dealing with processing petroleum-derived products may experience additional benefits through the implementation of CTi’s devices and technologies.

Cavitation Technologies, Inc., A Promising Green Technology Company at a Glance.  Tuesday 02/03/2009 9:00 AM ET - Pr Newswire   Related Companies  Symbol 	Last 	%Chg  CVAT 	1.11 	6.83%  As of 3:58 PM ET 2/5/09   Cavitation Technologies, Inc. (OTC Bulletin Board: CVAT) is an engineering and manufacturing company focused on becoming the worldwide leader in the sales of nano technology-based cavitation systems. Although CVAT's first product line is advanced modular, turn-key solutions for the biodiesel industry, the company recognizes potential commercial applications for nano-based cavitation technologies in markets such as crude oil enhancement, water sanitation, alcoholic beverage instant aging, milk pasteurization and homogenization, chemical processing, water-diesel emulsion, and pharmaceuticals. The company is led by seasoned business professionals with management, manufacturing, engineering and environmental experience, and is headquartered in Chatsworth, California. The company's web site is at http://www.CavitationTechnologies.com and its phone is (818) 718-0905.   Cavitation Technology   "Cavitation" is the formation, growth, and implosive collapse of gas or vapor-filled bubbles in liquids. The formation and collapse of these bubbles can have substantial chemical and physical effects on the liquids themselves. While the chemical effects of acoustic cavitation, i.e., sonochemistry and sonoluminescence have been extensively investigated in recent years, little information is available about the chemical consequences of hydrodynamic cavitation created during turbulent flow of liquids. CVAT has perfected its flow-through nano cavitator technology based on its proprietary research in the field of hydrodynamic cavitation. Essentially, the company's cavitation process in fluids provides superior mixing and significantly accelerates the rates of chemical reactions. This unique technology does not have an equivalent in the market.   Biodiesel   The first commercial application of the company's technology is the BioForce 9000 Nano Biodiesel Reactor, the most cutting-edge equipment available today for the production of biodiesel. The Bioforce 9000 offers substantial savings over existing technologies in both construction and production costs as well as its ability to process multiple feedstocks with FFA content as high as 6% using vegetable oil and 4.5% using animal fats.   Clayton Hawranik, President of SRS Engineering, one of CVAT's first clients commented after purchasing a BioForce 9000 reactor, "Working with Cavitation Technology has been a first class experience. They have a game changing technology which will revolutionize the biodiesel industry by allowing biodiesel producers to cut production costs as well as to have feedstock flexibility. We are looking forward to presenting the Bioforce 9000 to all existing and future clients and partners as we see tremendous added value." SRS Engineering is an industry leader in engineering and manufacturing process equipment and biodiesel plant equipment. The company is backed with over two decades of industry experience and over 150 years of combined engineering knowledge.   CVAT will pursue the biodiesel market through three strategies: (1) direct sales of its BioForce reactors for producing biodiesel, (2) the retrofitting of existing biodiesel plants with BioForce cavitation reactors to make them more efficient, and (3) the establishment of its own biodiesel production facilities using its own cavitation reactors.   While attending the National Biodiesel Conference & Expo in San Francisco from February 1-3, 2009 (http://www.biodieselconference.org/2009/default.asp) the company received more than 200 requests to demonstrate its technology. The company anticipates it will have biodiesel products sales of $50 million in the next 24 months with cumulative profits of $100 million over the next 5 years. The market continues to increase dramatically for biodiesel and the U.S. is positioned to become the largest biodiesel market with 19% world market share by 2012 and U.S. demand to grow to 3.4 billion gallons of biodiesel per year by 2015. The new U.S. administration's focus on green technology, energy independence and environmental concern along with multiple government incentive programs and mandates should only increase the current trend. CVAT views its technology as essential to achieving national biodiesel policy.   Modification of Crude Oil   CVAT filed a patent for the rapid modification and enhancement of crude oil at the end of 2008. By applying its cavitation technology to oil refining the company is able to increase the efficiency of refining crude petroleum to gasoline, kerosene, diesel, jet fuel and other valuable hydrocarbon-based products. The developed cavitation reactor generator can be used as a feed injector/mixer and can be easily coupled to a fluid catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) or any other refining facility to maximize the refinery's profitability.   With our system crude oil has been converted into many useful products. One barrel of crude oil gives the following percent yield: gasoline 46.7%, fuel oil 28.6%, jet fuel 9.1%, petrochemicals 3.8%, coke 3.5%, asphalt and road oil 3.1%, liquefied gases 2.9%, lubricants 1.3%, kerosene 0.9%, and waxes 0.1%. Cavitated oil increases the output of light fractions at lower temperatures. Cavitation heats crude oil, disrupts its matrix, and improves API gravity and viscosity. The process breaks down hydrocarbons and facilitates their fragmentation which results in creation of more valuable by-products. There are several potential benefits of using cavitation on crude oil such as, but not limited to: Reducing energy consumption by a minimum of 10%; facilitating cracking of hydrocarbons; increases gasoline/diesel yield by reducing sulfur content; raising the octane number in the straight run benzene and diesel fractions; and facilitating separation of water from the petroleum. For instance, in CVAT trials, oil cavitation in the absence of hydrogen gas has increased the Br-number (ASTM D1159-07) by 6-16%.   Roman Gordon, CEO of CVAT said in a recent press release, "We look forward to productive collaboration with a number of the oil mining and refining companies. Oil refining is a multi-billion dollar industry and we are very excited to become part of it. We are certain that our systems will increase profitability by cutting refining costs, saving energy, and increasing efficiencies. During our testing more diesel and gasoline was produced from the same barrel of crude oil using our technology."   The company is in discussion with several household-name oil companies on the possible use of CVAT technology for the modification of crude oil.   Other Applications   Many other applications of CVAT cavitator technology are being explored:   In the chemical industry CVAT cavitators can be used to process silicones, resins, waxes, textile fibers, lubricants, and much more. Multiple streams of raw materials can be fed into a CVAT cavitator reactor and create instant emulsions with small particle sizes and tight distributions. Many powders such as fumed silicas, zinc oxides and such can be dispersed with amazing results.   Likewise, in the personal care industry, CVAT cavitation systems can be used to process lotions, creams, shampoos, conditioners, body washes, deodorants, and much more. The CVAT cavitator can create instant emulsions with small particle sizes, improved shelf life and enhanced stability and appearance.   In the food and beverage industry, CVAT cavitation systems may be used to process sauces, purees, soup bases, beverage emulsions, dressings, and much more. Beyond mixing, the CVAT technology has also shown promise in the homogenization of milk, the purification of water and for improving the quality of wine. Reactors for the last three applications are being considered.   Summary   The company's unique cavitation technology has no equivalent in the world. And though CVAT is in the beginning of commercialization of its technology in the biodiesel field, in which it plans on making a significant impact on that market and reap tremendous profits, there are also a wide range of large-scale uses for its cavitation technology in which it eventually counts on reaping major rewards.
