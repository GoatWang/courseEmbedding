History - Washington State COGIC

The Church Of God In Christ was chartered May 5, 1926 for 50 years. The Church actually was born in 1924, following a revival at Madison Temple conducted by Elder Sylvester Howell. Brother L.E. Tolliver (later appointed Bishop) and Brother Sylvester Armstrong were saved during this revival. Bishop Van Goodlow was the first bishop assigned to the Washington State Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction in 1940. Following his demise, Bishop T.J. Kinlow was appointed in the Convocation of 1967. Under his leadership, five districts were set up with the fellowship meetings held in February and March. He appointed the following superintendents to oversee the districts: Supt. R.E. Altheimer, Supt. T.L. Westbrook, Supt. L.J. Green, Supt. J.M. Young and Supt. L. Nobles, who pastored in Selah and Pasco. Some of the other first pastors in the Washington State Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction during the 1940's were Supt. J.M. Young, Bishop L.E. Tolliver, Elder Martin, Elder V.F. Devers and Bishop R.E. Altheimer. Bishop Altheimer came to Tacoma in 1946 to fill the pastorate vacated by another pastor as a directive of the State Bishop. The first work in Moses Lake began by General Jackson in 1952. Some of the other pastors were Elder L.J. Green, who pastored in Bremerton before moving to Seattle; Elder W.B. Searcy pastored in Bremerton in the early months of 1950. He also served as State Secretary and State Finance Chairman, Dr. C.B. Smith, Elder J. W. Rabb, Elder Russell Byrd, Elder R.J. Causey, Elder Otis Byrd and Pastor Osborne. Elder John Bess pastored in Toppenish working with the young people and the Job Corps. This congregation was later pastored by Bishop T .L. Westbrook in the mid 1970's. Dr. Alfred C. Davis, Sr. began the mission work in Everett out of the home of Mother G. Brown's sister in 1961. Following his tenure, Elder Blackwell assumed the pastorate of this church. Elder Edgar Gray came to the Everett work in 1967, serving there until he moved to Madison Temple in Seattle. There has been three State Executive Secretaries for the Washington State Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction: Elder W.J. Jones, Dr. C.E. Smith and presently Elder Edgar Gray, Jr. who was appointed in 1973. At the time of Bishop Kinlow's home-going, there were approximately 21 churches. He was succeeded by Bishop R.E. Altheimer, under whose leadership the church continued to grow and be a strong witness for the Lord. The Church Of God In Christ was perpetually re-charted in 1976 by Bishop R.E. Altheimer, Elder T.L. Westbrook and State Secretary Elder Edgar Gray, along with the Board of Trustees. Thank God for the women, who served in our state to help bring historical as well as ecclesiastical progress to our great state. The first Supervisor of the Women's Department was Mother Rita Douglas, who served under Bishop Van Goodlow. Due to the untimely death of Mother Douglas in 1964, Bishop Goodlow appointed Mother Gertrude Young and Mother Lula Powell to serve in an interim capacity to co-coordinate the women's work in the state. Mother Gertrude Young was appointed in November of 1964 to the position as State Supervisor. In 1997, she had appointed Mother Bernice Altheimer as 1st Assistant Supervisor and Mother Willa Reese as 2nd Assistant Supervisor of the Women's Department. Under her leadership, the Women's Department has developed several auxiliaries and an annual convention that is second to none. Bishop R. E. Altheimer went home to be with the Lord in March of 1977. In the Annual Convocation that year, the pastors elected Bishop T. L. Westbrook as Prelate of Washington. Under his leadership, the state has grown to more than 70 churches and missions with 15 districts. He also organized Second Saturday Fellowships for Credential Holders' Workshops to train pastors and auxiliary workers. Bishop Westbrook came up through the ranks of the church and served in many capacities during the administration of all of his predecessors. Some of the positions were: State Y.P.W.W. President, Chairman of the State Program Committee, Chairman of the Finance Committee, Chairman of the Pastors' and Elders' Council and interim Pastor of several churches. After years of trying to find property to purchase and build a facility that could house our state functions, the superintendents, pastors, elders, missionaries and lay members, along with Bishop Westbrook, rallied and with the help of the Lord, purchased the North Lake School Campus, later named the Bishop T .L. Westbrook Educational Center and Chapel, from the Federal Way School District for $500,000.00. After almost 4 years, the property was valued at 1.5 million dollars. This beautiful, spacious complex that sat in a quiet wooded area was just a stepping stone. In December of 1998, yet under the dynamic leadership of Bishop Westbrook, the Board of Superintendents and Trustees began negotiating to purchase another facility after selling the Federal Way Property. In April of 1999, the Washington State Jurisdiction Church Of God In Christ became the owners of the Pacific Center Plaza at 9201 Pacific Avenue in Tacoma, Washington. At the beginning of this millennium, after much negotiation, our illustrious Bishop was able to present to the Assembly the land behind the Pacific Center Plaza. This procurement completed the land needed for the temple and other projects, and it represented the first phase of construction and remodeling for our State Temple. In November of 2014, the leadership of the Washington State Jurisdiction transferred to Bishop Leo Charles Brown, Jr., Prelate and Mother Curlie Davis, Supervisor of Women.

T.L. Webb Jr. 
FROM THE BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF PRIMITIVE OR OLD SCHOOL BAPTIST MINISTERS BY DAVID MONTGOMERY AND MARK GREEN: ELDER T. L. WEBB, JR.  Elder T. L. Webb, Jr. was born in Thornton, Arkansas November 30, 1930,the youngest child of Elder Thomas L. and Mattie Browning Webb. His father was associated with Elder C. H. Cayce in the publication of The Primitive Baptist at the time of his birth and they lived across the street from the Cayce Publishing Company.  In 1934 they moved to Eldorado Arkansas where he started to school and atthe age of 7 united with the Friendship Church there and was baptized togetherwith his sister Doris, age 10, by their father.  He first felt the burden to preach the gospel when about 14 years old. His father was preaching on this occasion and an impression came over him that he would have to do the same thing he was doing. He prayed for the burden to be removed and he did not make an effort until he was 18 years old. He was ordained to preach May 20, 1951 (age 20) at New Hope Church, Milan, TN where he has pastored for over 40 years. He has served several churches over his many years in the ministry, including Mud Creek and Pleasant Grove in Carroll Co. TN, Concord in Weakley County, TN, New Antioch in Henderson Co. TN, Old Gibson and Rutherford Churches in Gibson County, TN, and Hurricane Church inHardin County. At this writing he serves his home church in Milan fulltime.  For 8 years he was editor and publisher of The Christian Pathway and is presently trustee of the B. D. Bryant Memorial Library, a large collection of religious books. Besides his ministerial duties, he has been a bookkeeper for various firms and served as City Recorder of Milan for a few years, City Alderman and Vice Mayor of Milan.  He was married to Edith Chandler August 8, 1954, and they are blessed with 4 children and 7 grandchildren. He baptized his wife before their marriage and has baptized 3 of his children.   The ministry he considered a burden that could not be overcome without performing his duties. He is the 5th generation in his family who have preached for the Old Baptists. His father, T. L. Webb, Sr.; Grandfather, J. G. Webb; Great Grandfather, S. W. Webb; and great great grandfather, Daniel G. Webb. 

 












 
Elder James Compton (1905 - 2007)
            Elder James Compton was the original founder of the 'Gospel of Grace Tape Supply.' His collection of tapes began as he traveled to Church meetings and Associations recording sermons on Reel to Reel. He has maintained this library of sermons faithfully over the years and are now the foundation of PB Sermons. org. This web site is dedicated to Elder James Compton (1905 - 2007)
