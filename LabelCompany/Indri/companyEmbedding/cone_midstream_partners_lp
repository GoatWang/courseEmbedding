CONE Midstream: This Small-Cap MLP Has Great Growth Potential - CONE Midstream Partners LP (NYSE:CNNX) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»CONE Midstream: This Small-Cap MLP Has Great Growth PotentialMar.15.17 | About: CONE Midstream (CNNX) Breaking The Cycle Dividend investing, REITs, macro, oil & gasSummaryThe U.S. is in the middle of a shale revolution, and the Marcellus shale formation is at the heart of that revolution.Cheap natural gas is steadily replacing coal as our source of power generation.Drilling costs, operating costs, and lease operating expenses are some of the lowest in the nation at the Marcellus. As rigs return, this field will be a hot spot.CONE Midstream Partners is an MLP that has outstanding fundamentals and is located in the middle of the Marcellus.With safe and growing distribution coverage, low debt/EBITDA, future growth potential, and a healthy and growing dividend above 4.5%, this stock is worth consideration.The face of energy in the U.S. has transformed in the last two decades. Coal is losing its dominance as the primary power source across the nation. Three catalysts are responsible for this shift away from coal in favor of natural gas: Coal fired power plants are aging and wholly inefficient, there's increasing political pressure to reduce carbon emissions, and the emergence of abundant affordable natural gas. The shale revolution, made possible by advancements in hydraulic fracturing, is the main catalyst responsible for the rapid transition taking place. There are a variety of shale fields in play across the nation, but when it comes to natural gas the Marcellus shale is king. Over 18.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas is produced per day in this particular shale. This is more than double the gas production of the Permian Basin, which is the second-largest natural gas producing formation. In fact, the Marcellus outproduces the Bakken shale, Eagle Ford shale, Haynesville shale, and Utica shale combined. The Marcellus natural gas trend will be integral as the energy landscape of the U.S. -- and the world -- evolves over the coming decades. With ever increasing natural gas production comes demand for the infrastructure to transport the product and ultimately bring it to market. CONE Midstream Partners LP (NYSE:CNNX) is a master limited partnership that offers exposure precisely in this space. They have 254 miles of gathering pipeline in the heart of the Marcellus play. It appears that CNNX is poised for long term growth as the Marcellus continues to feed a natural gas hungry nation. The current administration is proving thus far to be supportive of future pipeline projects as well. This, along with healthy levels of capital investment, should be a boon to our natural gas pipeline network.
 Formed by sponsors CONSOL Energy (NYSE:CNX) and Noble Energy (NYSE:NBL), CNNX services their well head production, which has grown by 574% since 2012 (see Table 1 below). What makes this all the more impressive is the fact they managed to grow production despite a reduction in well completions in 2015 and 2016. Reduction in well completions was not limited to CONE's sponsors, but instead was a nationwide phenomenon due to the drop in oil and natural gas prices from November 2014 to February/March 2016. Natural gas prices are largely influenced by domestic supply and demand. If the U.S. experiences a warm winter, like the two warm winters in 2015 and 2016, then demand drops and prices are negatively effected. The culprit of these two warm winters was driven by an event called El Nino. Scientists have stated that El Nino has finally subsided and cooler winters should return. This should increase demand and drive the price back up to more sustainable levels for producers. Although prices have not yet fully recovered, they have shown considerable improvement in the last few quarters, and all indicators point toward further recovery. Another key driver to support future natural gas demand is the ever increasing exportation of Natural gas and gas feedstock abroad. The U.S. recently became a net exporter in natural gas. Companies like Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) and Cheniere Energy (NYSEMKT:LNG) are leading the way in natural gas exports. Demand for U.S. natural gas will continue to rise as both domestic demand begins to increase post El Nino, and exports to Mexico and overseas continues to rapidly increase. 

 Table 1: CNX and NBL well head production vs. completed wells by year. Source: Company 10-Q.
 As with all revolutions, the transformation that is taking place in the U.S. is not without setbacks. The last two years are proof of that, but the future of natural gas is a bright one. CNX and NBL already have 49% more wells drilled and ready to be completed in Q1 2017, than all of last year combined. Since 2011, CNX and NBL have drilled and completed a combined 537 wells and have a potential 3,700 drilling locations on their current acreage. The potential benefit to CNNX in production scale could be enormous. Although the sponsors have taken their lumps, the worst appears to be behind them. CNNX appears to be perfectly positioned to gain from their ever increasing production growth and improving well completion rate. According to a study in Q1 2016 by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, well completion costs and lease operating costs in the Marcellus Basin are some of the most favorable in America. Improving well head designs and cost rates will continually drive overall expenses downward and efficiency upward. This all bodes very well for CONE Midstream LP, which has already put up impressive numbers even in the face of the 2015/2016 commodity price drop. Their business model is less focused on commodity price and more to do with production volumes. The greater the volumes that pass through CNNX's pipelines, the better they do. Table 1 above plainly shows that production volume is on an upward trajectory, and Table 2 below shows that the stock was also on an equally impressive upward trajectory last year. 

 Table 2: CNNX vs. S&P 500 vs. Alerian MLP Index, one year. CNNX has been on quite the run in the previous year, rising over 93% vs. the S&P 500 and Alerian MLP Index at 19% and 22%, respectively. All the while, CNNX has been paying out a handsome dividend currently yielding above 4.5%. They have also increased their payout every year since going public in 2014. Last year's dividend increase was 14%.
 Distribution Coverage and Profit Margin CNNX has a very low current debt load. They reduced their current liabilities by 34% in 2015 and further reduced current liabilities in 2016 by another 45%. Their overall debt/equity is .27. CNNX has compounded its distributable cashflow annually by 46.6% and EBITDA by 47.6% since 2012. Their net income has grown at an even faster clip of 66.7%. This has given CNNX healthy distribution coverage of 1.6x, which is up from last year's solid 1.36x coverage. CNNX currently operates at over 40% profit margin and over 23% return on investment capital. Debt I just touched on the great debt/equity, but the debt/EBITDA is equally impressive at a low 1.75. Anything under 4.0 is preferable, and a debt/EBITDA under 2.0 makes CNNX the envy of most MLPs. P/DCF and Analysts' Estimates Instead of using the P/E ratio to determine if an MLP is under/overvalued, most analysts use the P/DCF ratio. It's difficult to nail down what the industry average is, but consensus points toward a 13-15x P/DCF ratio as being the industry average for an MLP. CNNX has a P/DCF ratio of 14.4x. It appears CNNX is within the realm of fair value. CNNX has an average rating as a buy. Eight analysts rated CNNX a strong buy, and four rated CNNX a hold. The average price target according to analysts is $24.90, with a high target of $27.00. According to analysts the stock has an average upside of 14%. It is worth noting that CNNX outperformed earnings estimates in three out of four quarters in 2016 and was on target in the remaining quarter. Insider Buying There has been a little insider buying going on, but nothing to really get too excited about. Just last month, an officer purchased more than 9,000 shares. This adds support to the overall idea that CNNX is heading in a good direction. Recommendation Although CNNX appears to be within the realm of fair value, it would be wise to err on the side of caution when initiating a position. The stock ran up considerably in the previous year, and with good reason. In order to have real investing success it's wise to give yourself a margin of safety. The stock enters the low end of fair value at $19.68 and enters undervalued territory at $18.24. Giving the current volatility with the Fed, we might see CNNX approach these levels soon. All MLPs and REITs have been fairly volatile in recent days due to looming interest rate hikes. Entering into a small position between $19.68 and $18.24 on further weakness should be considered.
 It should be emphasized that this stock does come with certain inherent risks. It is a small-cap stock, and with all small-cap positions volatility should be expected. Being so intimately linked to CNX and NBL is also a risk to consider. Additional warm winters could hamper future drilling and potential production levels. MLPs fuel growth with both debt and unit offerings, and this could potentially dilute shareholder value if the capital raised is not allocated efficiently. That said, the growth potential is incredibly compelling (see Table 3).   Next 5 Years (per annum) 12.80%         Past 5 Years (per annum) 146.51%     Table 3: Previous five years' growth and analysts' predictions. Source: Yahoo Finance. Conclusion CONE Midstream LP has a short but impressive track record of explosive growth, great margins, and low debt. The dividend is solid, growing nicely, and well covered. Sponsors CONSOL Energy and Noble Energy have rapidly increased well head production every year since 2012. Well completion is set to be on the rise once again, and they have over 3,700 potential drilling locations on their dedicated acreage. These three intimately interconnected companies lie in the heart of the largest natural gas play in the U.S., the Marcellus shale. Rigs are returning and capital investment is gaining momentum nationwide. The Marcellus is one of the most cost-effective places to drill for natural gas. Natural gas is fast replacing coal as our source of power generation. The U.S. is exporting natural gas at a pace never before imagined, and our current administration is bullish on energy and energy infrastructure. CNNX is in an important position in the most important natural gas field in the nation, and is poised for long-term growth. It should be on your watch list and is worthy of future consideration.

Real-time prices are provided by Bats Exchange on individual U.S. equities quote pages. During market hours, the real-time Bats price displays and new trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash"). Volume always reflects consolidated markets. If the symbol has pre-market or post-market trades, that information will also be reflected along with the last (closing) price from the symbol's exchange. Real-time prices are available during market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST).  Note: The Bats Exchange currently accounts for approximately 11-12% of all U.S. equity trading each day. As a result, the real-time prices displayed may have minor discrepancies when comparing the information with other sites offering real-time data, or with brokerage firms. If you require comprehensive real-time bids/asks/quotes, we offer a no-risk trial to one of our real-time products. Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information from the Bats exchange is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related Stocks For comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.Most Recent Stories View the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).
