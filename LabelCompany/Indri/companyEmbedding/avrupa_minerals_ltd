Avrupa Minerals is a growth-oriented junior exploration and development company focused on aggressive exploration, using a modified prospect generator model, for valuable mineral deposits in politically stable and prospective regions of Europe, including Portugal, Kosovo, and Germany.
The Company has an exciting portfolio of exploration projects consisting of:

Copper and Zinc in southern Portugal at Marateca, Mertola, and in the recently consolidated Alvalade project area located in the Iberian Pyrite Belt, where Europe's richest active copper mine operates;

Tungsten in northern Portugal at the Covas JV project area;

Iron oxide copper-gold (IOCG) targets in southern Portugal on the Alvito Option project area;

Gold, Silver, Lead, and Zinc in Kosovo on the Metovit property in the Trepça Mineral Belt of the Vardar Zone, historically, Europe's most productive district for lead and zinc;

The Peshter Gold-Silver deposit in the Slivovo JV, also located in the Trepça Mineral Belt, just 15 km southeast of Prishtine, the capital city of Kosovo.

Gold and Tin in eastern Germany in the 307 km2 Oelsnitz exploration license in the historic Erzgebirge Mining District, a 1000-year producer of tin, tungsten, silver, base metals, and uranium.

The projects are all in areas with existing mines and strong geological potential for discovery of further economic metal deposits.
Avrupa's aim is to create shareholder value through the development of a project portfolio to joint venture or sale to larger mining companies.  The Company has three active joint ventures and is currently marketing its base metal projects in south Portugal.
Avrupa Minerals has a strong and dedicated management team with extensive and broad experience from exploration to development. Management is supported by an active board with mining, exploration, and financial experience. In its present areas of exploration, Avrupa enjoys excellent relations with government mining agencies, local authorities, and the communities where it works.

The Company holds eight exploration licenses through its subsidiaries in Portugal, Kosovo, and partner in Germany.

In the Iberian Pyrite Belt of Portugal, the Company has just completed consolidation of the Alvalade license (see news release of June 19, 2017).  The license contains a massive sulfide discovery at the Sesmarias site, and a stockwork sulfide target zone at Monte da Bela Vista, in addition to numerous other drill targets.

The Alvito iron oxide copper-gold target area is optioned to OZ Minerals Limited.  First phase ground geophysics and property-wide exploration/prospecting have commenced (see news release of June 7, 2017).

A third license in Portugal is committed to the Covas Tungsten Joint Venture with Blackheath Resources.

Avrupa conducts self-funded generative exploration work in Portugal. Previously, the Company utilized funds provided by Callinan Royalties Corp. for prospect generation work. Additionally, Callinan funded more advanced early-stage exploration on the Alvito license in south Portugal, in return for a 1.5% NSR royalty covering the license. Callinan was acquired by Altius Minerals in early 2015, and Altius now holds the Alvito royalty.

Avrupa’s partner on the Slivovo JV, Byrnecut International Limited is presently drilling new targets at and around the Peshter Au-Ag deposit in Kosovo.

Avrupa continues to actively explore in all three countries, and may, at any time, make further applications to cover attractive possibilities in those countries or elsewhere in Europe. The map below shows the countries where Avrupa presently holds licenses and exploration permits.

Avrupa currently holds nine exploration licences in three European countries


 

Avrupa is a Europe-focused prospect generator resource firm








Avrupa Minerals Ltd (CVE:AVU) has closed its recently announced private placing and brought in $1.017mln at 10 cents a throw.

	Each unit consists of one share and one share warrant, with each warrant exercisable into a share at 15 cents for three years until July 12.

	Having recovered  a 100% ownership of the Alvalade copper/lead/zinc VMS (volcanic massive sulphide) project in southern Portugal, Avrupa is now assembling a data set for potential partners.

	Interest in the project has been strong, the group said.

	The exploration model it used is valid for Avrupa's other projects at Mertola and Marateca, and efforts to joint venture these projects are under way, Avrupa added.

	Avrupa currently holds nine exploration licences in three European countries, including six in Portugal covering 3,271 sq km - two in Kosovo covering 47 sq km and one in Germany covering 307 sq km.

	Avrupa now has three active option and joint venture agreements, two in Portugal and one in Kosovo.

Avrupa currently holds nine exploration licences in three European countries


 

Avrupa is a Europe-focused prospect generator resource firm








Avrupa Minerals Ltd (CVE:AVU) has closed its recently announced private placing and brought in $1.017mln at 10 cents a throw.

	Each unit consists of one share and one share warrant, with each warrant exercisable into a share at 15 cents for three years until July 12.

	Having recovered  a 100% ownership of the Alvalade copper/lead/zinc VMS (volcanic massive sulphide) project in southern Portugal, Avrupa is now assembling a data set for potential partners.

	Interest in the project has been strong, the group said.

	The exploration model it used is valid for Avrupa's other projects at Mertola and Marateca, and efforts to joint venture these projects are under way, Avrupa added.

	Avrupa currently holds nine exploration licences in three European countries, including six in Portugal covering 3,271 sq km - two in Kosovo covering 47 sq km and one in Germany covering 307 sq km.

	Avrupa now has three active option and joint venture agreements, two in Portugal and one in Kosovo.

Avrupa Minerals Closes Private Placement




















July 12, 2017 20:00 ET

 | Source: Avrupa Minerals Ltd.






VANCOUVER, British Columbia, July  12, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Avrupa Minerals Ltd. (TSXV:AVU) has closed the recently announced private placement to raise $1,017,000 and issue 10,170,000 units at a price of $0.10.  Each unit consists of one common share and one warrant.  Each warrant is exercisable into a common share at $0.15 for 3 years expiring on July 12, 2020. No finder’s fee was paid in this private placement.  All securities have a 4-month hold period expiring November 12, 2017. Having recovered 100% ownership of the Alvalade copper/lead/zinc VMS project in the Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB) of southern Portugal, Avrupa is assembling a data set for potential partners to review. Interest in the project has been strong. The geological team in Portugal has developed a geo-structural exploration model for the IPB that has lead to successful drilling on the Alvalade project. The exploration model is valid for Avrupa’s other projects at Mertola and Marateca, and efforts to joint venture these projects are underway. Avrupa now has a total of 86,918,797 common shares outstanding. Avrupa Minerals Ltd. is a growth-oriented exploration and development company focused on discovery, using a prospect generator model, of valuable mineral deposits in politically stable and prospective regions of Europe, including Portugal, Kosovo, and Germany. The Company currently holds nine exploration licenses in three European countries, including six in Portugal covering 3,271 km2, two in Kosovo covering 47 km2, and one in Germany covering 307 km2.  Avrupa now has three active option and joint venture agreements, two in Portugal and one in Kosovo, including: The Alvito Option Agreement with OZ Minerals Limited covering one license in the Ossa Morena Zone in southern Portugal, for IOCG deposits;The Covas JV, with Blackheath Resources, covering one license in northern Portugal, for intrusion-related W deposits; andAvrupa’s partner at the Slivovo Gold Project in Kosovo is fully funding the program, allowing Avrupa to dilute its ownership in the JV operating company Peshter Mining JSC.  If AVU ownership goes below 10%, the interest in the project converts to a 2% NSR.In addition, in the Iberian Pyrite Belt of south Portugal, the Company has 100% ownership of the Alvalade VMS Project where previous partners have spent over US$ 7.6 million on exploration for VMS copper, zinc, and lead, mineralization, resulting in discoveries at Sesmarias and Monte da Bela Vista. Avrupa is currently upgrading precious and base metal targets to JV-ready status in a variety of districts on their other licenses, with the idea of attracting potential partners to project-specific and/or regional exploration programs.  For additional information, contact Avrupa Minerals Ltd. at 1-604-687-3520 or visit our website at www.avrupaminerals.com.

Expert Comments:










Canadian Company Regains 100% Ownership of Portugal Project
				(6/27/17)

			    		A junior explorer has taken back the reins of a project in Portugal that is showing results.

      Jay Taylor, Gold, Energy & Tech Stocks
(6/16/17)

		
		"We are initiating coverage on Avrupa Minerals Ltd. . .the company is dirt cheap and valued at only a fraction of the intrinsic value of the projects it has optioned out. . .then there is the Alvalade project that appears to hold the potential to host a world-class volcanogenic massive sulphide deposit. . .my suggestion is that you buy this stock with the intention of considering a 50% exit on a double."
		
		












  
      Brien Lundin, Gold Newsletter (Jefferson Financial)
  

(6/1/17)

		
		"Avrupa Minerals Ltd. announced that it and 85% joint venture partner Byrnecut International have embarked on a 2017 drilling program on their Slivovo gold project in Kosovo; the 17-hole, 5,700m program will test at least six different targets on the project. The companies' stated goal is to increase the resource at Slivovo by another 250 Koz."
		
		









  
      Brien Lundin, Gold Newsletter (Jefferson Financial)
  

(5/1/17)

		
		"Avrupa Minerals Ltd. raised CA$225K in April by issuing 2.5M common shares at CA$0.09/common share. . .the company recently announced it has optioned its Alvito iron oxide-copper-gold project in Southern Portugal to OZ Minerals. . .the deal is a reminder that Avrupa executes the prospect generator model extremely well and is a diversified play on minerals exploration in Europe."

		
		
















Avrupa Closes Financing and Options Portuguese Property
				(4/27/17)

			    		Avrupa Minerals, a prospect generator active in Europe, has closed a financing and announced that it has optioned the Alvito project in southern Portugal.

      Brien Lundin, Gold Newsletter (Jefferson Financial)
  

(3/1/17)

		
		"Avrupa Minerals Ltd. has accepted the study on the Slivovo gold project in Kosovo generated by its partner Byrnecut International; with the acceptance, the company officially transferred 85% of its interest in the project to Byrnecut, retaining a 15% interest for itself. The next step on the project will be a three-phase, results-dependent drilling program on Slivovo in 2017."
		
		









  
      Brien Lundin, Gold Newsletter (Jefferson Financial)
  

(11/1/16)

		
		"Avrupa Minerals Ltd. filled up its coffers recently with C$661,500 from the exercise of warrants and finders warrants. While not a great deal of money for many juniors, the cash influx should hold this seasoned prospect generator in good stead. . .the company has three active joint ventures, two on its projects in Portugal and one on its Slivovo gold project in Kosovo. . .I have a feeling the upcoming prefeasibility study, along with the updated resource estimate, could surprise to the upside. . .given the company's current trading levels, the downside for Avrupa is fairly well protected. . . and is still a buy."
		
		









  
      Brien Lundin, Gold Newsletter (Jefferson Financial)
  

(10/1/16)

		
		"Avrupa Minerals Ltd. continues to have success drilling its Slivovo gold project in Kosovo. . .the company recently released assays for the final five drill holes from an 11-hole program conducted on the project. These last five holes targeted the Gossan Extension Zone, and they demonstrate the potential for this zone to grow at depth. . .I think Avrupa has a better-than-average shot to grow this deposit substantially, and remember, Slivovo is just the most advanced of the many projects in this prospect generator's portfolio; a great long-term play on metals discovery in Europe, Avrupa remains a buy at current levels."

      Brien Lundin, Gold Newsletter (Jefferson Financial)
  

(9/1/16)

		
		"Avrupa Minerals Ltd. recently released results from 10 of 15 holes recently drilled on its high-grade Slivovo gold project in Kosovo. The results were quite good, including 26.4m of 2.76 g/t gold in one hole and 45m of 2.47 g/t gold in another. . .Hole DHIP001 was a special hole designed to get beneath the fault. . .when they sampled the core from the hole, they realized they had made hit 15m of 5.98 g/t gold with 15.89 g/t silver. . .this high-grade deposit could extend significantly elsewhere on the expansive property."
