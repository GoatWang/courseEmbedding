Who We Are


High Value-Added Investment Firm

Active Strategies
Autonomous Franchises
Process-Driven Results



                                        We focus exclusively on active, high value-added investment strategies where experienced investment professionals pursue superior results through a combination of original thinking and a disciplined approach. We have a strong philosophical belief in the autonomy of each of our investment teams. We provide each investment team with ample resources and support, without imposing a centralized research function. Each investment strategy is focused on an area that we believe provides opportunities to generate returns in excess of the relevant benchmarks.
                                    




Talent-Driven Business

Designed for Investment Talent to Thrive
Managed by Business Professionals
Structured to Align Interests



                                        Our business model is designed to attract, develop and retain talented investment professionals by allowing them to focus on portfolio management in an environment conducive to producing their best work on a consistent, long-term basis. Our experienced business leadership team supports our investment management capabilities by managing a centralized infrastructure, which allows our investment professionals to focus primarily on making investment decisions and generating returns for our clients. We ensure that our interests are aligned with the long-term interests of our clients. Our investment professionals' incentives are directly tied to the growth in client capital generated by the strategies they manage; additionally, the leaders of our investment teams have meaningful capital invested alongside clients in those strategies and are equity partners in the firm.
                                    




Thoughtful Growth

Active Talent Identification
Entrepreneurial Commitment
Focus on Long-Term Global Demand



                                        Firm evolution requires thoughtful growth. A lack of growth or growth for growth's sake can make a business unattractive to investment talent. Our entrepreneurial mindset keeps us actively looking for ways to maximize long-term career opportunities for our existing investment professionals and make our business attractive to prospective investment talent. It also ensures we stay committed to providing investment solutions that are aligned with long-term global trends and that are relevant to our clients.

Overview
Artisan Partners is a global investment management firm that provides a broad range of high value-added investment strategies in growing asset classes to sophisticated clients around the world.
The foundation of Artisan Partners' story was set in 1994 by our founders Andy and Carlene Ziegler. At the time, the Zieglers identified two secular trends—talent acquisition and open architecture—that were taking hold in the market. Those two trends shaped the firm's growth strategy.
The talent acquisition movement within the industry created the opportunity for us to attract investment talent to our firm where high-quality investors are allowed to execute their own investment process without distractions. Open architecture provided the framework to distribute high-quality products more freely through consultants and mutual fund platforms if we had the right talent and results.
Our business model has always been structured around our investment talent. Our autonomous investment teams manage a range of active investment strategies that are diversified by market capitalization, region and investment style. Each team uses a clearly articulated, consistent and repeatable investment process.

Artisan Partners to Open Australian Office | Business Wire


























































Artisan Partners to Open Australian Office






December 22, 2014 04:10 PM Eastern Standard Time



MILWAUKEE & SYDNEY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Artisan Partners announced today that it will open an office in Sydney. 
      Artisan Partners will operate the office through its Australian 
      subsidiary Artisan Partners Australia Pty Ltd.
    

      Artisan Partners first entered the Australian market in late 2011 
      through a third-party distribution agreement with Grey Pine Advisory Pty 
      Ltd. Grey Pine Advisory is solely owned and operated by Whitney Drayton, 
      who will join Artisan Partners in January as a full-time employee and 
      Managing Director of Artisan Partners Australia.
    

      Prior to starting Grey Pine, Mr. Drayton was Director, Institutional 
      Business Development with Wellington Management. In his role with 
      Wellington, he managed business development for the company’s global 
      equity and global fixed income assets across Australia and New Zealand. 
      Mr. Drayton has worked in Sydney for over 30 years.
    

      Eric Colson, President and CEO said, “Australia and New Zealand are 
      markets with institutional clients and decision making processes that 
      align well with our business model and distribution goals. Over the last 
      several years we have worked with Whitney to introduce our firm to 
      investors in the region and have been fortunate to begin relationships 
      with multiple high quality clients. Having an office in Sydney will help 
      us better serve our growing client base and more effectively distribute 
      our investment offerings. We look forward to having Whitney on board to 
      continue building on the momentum we have seen in the market.”
