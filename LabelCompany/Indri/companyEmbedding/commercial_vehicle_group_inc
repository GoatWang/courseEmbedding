        'In Q2 2017, WABCO continued to demonstrate strong outperformance of the commercial vehicle industry relative to global truck and bus production,' said Jacques Esculier, WABCO Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. 'In addition, we delivered record quarterly earnings per share on a performance basis, up 18 percent year over year.'
      
      
Top Company Interviews


        'Indeed, Q2 2017 marked yet another quarter of further adoption of WABCO's industry-leading safety and efficiency technologies globally,' said Esculier. 'For example, in key markets like North America we augmented sales of automated manual transmission solutions and collision mitigation systems, while in China and India we increased penetration of anti-lock braking systems.'
      
      
        In Q2 2017, reported operating margin was negatively impacted by 0.6 percent due to extraordinary professional fees incurred in connection with an acquisition proposal received by the company. Both parties engaged in advanced discussions, with WABCO being advised by the potential buyer that due diligence had been satisfactorily concluded. However, these discussions were subsequently terminated when final approval was not granted by the buyer's board.
      
      
        In Q2 2017, WABCO's Operating System, the company's globally standardized management environment, delivered $20.4 million of materials and conversion productivity, another robust quarterly result.
      
      
        'In Q2 2017, we maintained momentum at driving cost efficiency across WABCO's global value chain, with superior conversion productivity of 8.0 percent in our factories and solid gross materials productivity of 5.2 percent,' said Esculier.
      
      
        WABCO continued in Q2 2017 to strongly convert income into cash, resulting in net cash from operating activities of $88.2 million.
      
      
        WABCO Share Buyback Program
      
      
        Since June 2011, WABCO has repurchased 19,328,912 shares for $1,591.0 million in open market transactions as of June 30, 2017, including 495,000 shares bought back for $60.2 million during Q2 2017. As previously disclosed, WABCO is further authorized to repurchase up to $480.0 million of additional shares through December 31, 2018.
      
      
        Recent WABCO Highlights
      
      
        In Q2 2017, WABCO announced that Daimler Trucks has extended its long-term supply agreement with WABCO for new heavy-duty automated manual transmission (AMT) control technology to support its series production in Europe, North America, Japan and South America. Headquartered in Germany, Daimler Trucks is the world's largest manufacturer of trucks over six tons. WABCO is supplying this original equipment manufacturer with its newest generation of tailored AMT solutions. WABCO's innovative AMT control technology transforms a manual transmission into an efficient, cost-effective solution that automatically shifts gears and controls clutch actuation for commercial vehicles. WABCO's newest AMT solution improves fuel economy through optimized gear shifting.
      
      
        WABCO continues to strengthen its fleet management systems (FMS) business in India as the company has recently signed an agreement to acquire AssetTrackr, a start-up FMS provider. Based in Bangalore, AssetTrackr is differentiated through advanced cloud-based FMS technologies, which superbly complement telematics products recently launched by WABCO INDIA. The combination of AssetTrackr and WABCO INDIA will accelerate the development of innovative solutions that improve the performance and safety of local commercial vehicle fleets. In addition, this acquisition will bring expertise and talent to further WABCO as a key innovator of FMS solutions globally.
      
      
        WABCO reported in Q2 2017 that it signed a strategic cooperation framework agreement with FAW Jiefang Automotive Company, a major manufacturer of light-, medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China. WABCO and FAW Jiefang will team up to enhance the safety and efficiency of commercial vehicles and fleet operators in China by advancing braking systems, chassis components and other technologies. Building on its more than 20-year supply relationship, WABCO will provide FAW Jiefang with industry-leading and cost-effective technologies as well as product development expertise.
      
      
        In Q2 2017, WABCO was distinguished by CLEPA (European Association of Automotive Suppliers) with two prestigious Innovation Awards 2017. One award honors WABCO and ZF for their joint development of Evasive Maneuver Assist (EMA), a breakthrough collision avoidance system for commercial vehicles. The EMA prototype combines WABCO's world-class braking, stability and vehicle dynamics control systems on trucks and trailers with ZF's top active steering technology. EMA engages to help the driver to safely steer around an obstructing vehicle and to bring truck and trailer to a complete and safe stop. WABCO was also recognized by CLEPA for its OptiFlow™ AutoTail, the latest addition to WABCO's industry-leading portfolio of aerodynamic solutions for trailers. This state-of-the-art device helps to reduce fuel consumption and emissions of commercial vehicles.
      
      
        Recently, WABCO was recognized by ReMaTec, known as the leading platform for remanufacturing, with the Remanufacturer of the Year 2017 award. This award is the most prestigious in the global remanufacturing industry. WABCO Reman Solutions, founded in 2010, advances operational efficiency and environmental sustainability in the automotive, commercial vehicle and related industries by restoring worn or non-functional components to 'like-new' or 'better-than-new' condition, offering solutions that are fully warranted in performance and quality. WABCO Reman Solutions features a broad portfolio of remanufactured parts - including mechanical, mechatronic, electronic and hydraulic products - through five production facilities in the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, Poland and China.
      
      
        WABCO INDIA has been recently honored with the 2016 Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) Excellence Award from the Japan Institute of Plant Maintenance. WABCO INDIA received this prestigious award for its Mahindra World City lean manufacturing facility in Chennai, India. This plant is a world-class export hub serving major commercial vehicle manufacturers and passenger car makers globally. The TPM Excellence Award rigorously evaluates a company-wide commitment to sustain superlative production capabilities and world-class quality standards. In India, where WABCO fully leverages its five world-class factories, the company produces frugally-engineered, high-quality and cost-effective technologies to meet local customers' requirements and to export to customers in the Americas, Europe and Asia.

        WABCO Forward-Looking Statements
      
      
        This document contains certain 'forward-looking statements' as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are based on management's good faith expectations and beliefs concerning future developments. Statements preceded by, followed by or that otherwise include the words 'believes,' 'expects,' 'anticipates,' 'strategies,' 'prospects,' 'intends,' 'projects,' 'estimates,' 'plans,' 'may increase,' 'may fluctuate,' and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as 'will,' 'should,' 'would,' 'may' and 'could' are generally forward looking in nature and not historical facts. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations as a result of many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the actual level of commercial vehicle production in our end markets, adverse developments in the business of our key customers, pricing changes to our supplies or products, our ability to successfully integrate any acquired businesses or our acquired businesses not performing as planned, our ability to mitigate any tax risks, including, but not limited to those risks associated with changes in legislation, tax audits and the loss of the benefits associated with our tax rulings and incentives in certain jurisdictions, and the other risks and uncertainties described in the 'Risk Factors' section and the 'Information Concerning Forward Looking Statements' section of WABCO's Form 10-K, as well as in the 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Information Concerning Forward Looking Statements' section of WABCO's Form 10-Q Quarterly Reports. WABCO does not undertake any obligation to update such forward-looking statements. All market and industry data are based on company estimates.
      
      
        Non-GAAP Financial Measures
      
      
        To facilitate the understanding of Q2 2017 results, several tables follow this news release.  Sales, gross profit, operating expenses, and operating income, which are adjusted to exclude the effects of foreign exchange, as well as EBIT, are non-GAAP financial measures and are denoted by the word 'adjusted' in the line item. Additionally, gross profit, operating expenses, operating income, operating margin, EBIT, tax rate, pre-tax income attributable to the company, net income attributable to the company, and net income attributable to the company per diluted share on a 'performance basis' are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude items for separation, streamlining and acquisition, discrete and one-time tax items, and other items that management believes may mask the underlying operating results of the company, as applicable.  These measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, GAAP measures. These measures may not be comparable to similar measures of other companies as not all companies calculate these measures in the same manner. Management believes that presenting these non-GAAP measures is useful to shareholders because it enhances their understanding of how management assesses the operating performance of the company's business. Certain non-GAAP measures may be used, in part, to determine incentive compensation for current employees.

Commercial Vehicle Insurance







Commercial Vehicle Insurance - Cover Drivers and Vehicles
The risks you face as a business owner vary widely from liability concerns to workers compensation issues to the possibility that one of your workers could be responsible for an accident. If you have staff members who get behind the wheel, your commercial vehicle insurance will protect your business financially in the event of incident on the road.
One of the best ways to identify the right commercial vehicle policy for your needs is to work with an independent agent in the Trusted Choice® network. These professionals have relationships with many different insurance companies, so they can help cover every aspect of your business insurance needs. Contact a local member agent in your area to get your questions answered and find the protection you need.

Who Needs Commercial Vehicle Insurance?

Freight companies and other businesses that use commercial trucks
Independent contractors who drive during the course of doing business
Any business that makes deliveries or transports goods
Limo services, taxi services, bus companies and other transportation services

If you or your staff members use a vehicle for commercial purposes, you need a commercial auto policy, as your standard personal auto policy will typically not cover you for business use of that vehicle.
The risks associated with commercial use of a vehicle, whether it is personally owned or company owned, often call for higher policy limits and different policy provisions.

Do You Need Commercial Vehicle Insurance?
In some cases, it is obvious that you need a commercial vehicle policy. For example, if you have a delivery service, limousine service, or a restaurant that delivers food, you know for certain that your business takes on risk each time you or a staff member drives one of your vehicles.
But there are many confusing scenarios where business car insurance is concerned. What if you use your personal vehicle to drive your kids around and to deliver cakes from your home bakery service? What if you attach a plow to the front of your truck each winter and offer snow plowing services?
It is typically a question of primary use, but you may have a unique situation to address. If you use any vehicle for business purposes, it definitely pays to talk with an agent who understands both personal and commercial vehicle insurance so you can make sure you have the right protection to meet your needs.

What Does Commercial Vehicle Insurance Cover?
Commercial vehicle policies, like personal auto policies, are primarily designed to cover your liability risks and provide compensation for damage to your vehicle. But instead of just covering your personal use of the vehicle, the policy covers you and any other person who drives the vehicle. If you have employees who use their own vehicles for work related to your business, you need to make sure your commercial auto policy covers those employees and their vehicles.
A typical policy will include:

Liability: Covers expenses resulting from an accident you or an employee causes, including:
Bodily injury to another person
Property damage to another person’s property
Legal fees


Medical payments: Covers hospitalization and other medical expenses for you or your employees, and any passengers in your vehicle
Uninsured/underinsured motorist: Covers bodily injury and property damage you or your employees and passengers incur if an uninsured or underinsured motorist caused the accident.
Collision coverage: Covers your vehicle when another object or vehicle causes damage.
Comprehensive coverage: Covers “other than collision” perils such as weather damage, theft and vandalism.


Get the Right Business Vehicle Insurance for Your Company
With commercial vehicle insurance, there is no “one size fits all.” The variables that affect the kind of coverage you need include the size of your company, whether you have one company car, a dump truck, a fleet of limousines or freight trucks, or a few delivery vans. You also may need special coverage for transporting hazardous or flammable materials.
In addition to these factors, your commercial vehicles may be subject to state and federal regulations that impact your insurance coverage. Every business is unique, and therefore each commercial vehicle policy must be tailored to the business.
To get the right policy and the right amount of coverage for your company, talk with an agent who will fully explore your commercial vehicle usage and risks. When you meet with your agent, be sure to provide all the important facts regarding your company vehicle use, such as:

How is the company organized (from a legal perspective)?
What types of vehicles does your company use?
Who owns them?
Who drives them? You will need to provide driver’s license information for each driver.
How often do you or your employees drive these vehicles?
Do you transport people? Transport or deliver goods? Use the vehicles to provide services? What kind?

The bottom line is that a business needs a flexible, tailored company car insurance policy, and it is important to make sure your policy adequately covers your real world use and risks.

Get a Commercial Vehicle Insurance Quote for Peace of Mind
If you are not sure whether you need commercial vehicle insurance, or what kind and how much you need, your best bet is to work with a knowledgeable agent. An independent agent who specializes in business auto insurance can advise you on the right coverage for your specific business needs.
Getting the right business vehicle insurance policy can be complicated, but an independent agent can find the right coverage for you from multiple insurance companies. Find a local Trusted Choice member agent today who can provide guidance and a commercial vehicle insurance quote tailored to your business.

        Sheriff’s Office to Focus on Commercial Vehicle Safety - Department Receives State Grant
    


By Monte Miller, Missourian Staff Writer

Jul 15, 2017
 (…)


































































































Franklin County has been ranked the 11th most dangerous county in the state when it comes to accidents involving commercial vehicles.Because of this distinction, the county has received a $288,835 grant, which Sheriff Steve Pelton hopes will make the roads safer for citizens and operators of commercial vehicles.The grant is part of the Missouri Department of Transportation’s (MoDOT) Commercial Motor Vehicle Enforcement Program and will be supplemented by $50,970 from the sheriff’s department.





With the local contribution, the new program will have an operating budget of $339,805.“Between 2011 and 2015 there were 187 accidents in Franklin County involving commercial vehicles,” Pelton said. “We want to do what we can to make the roads safer for the citizens.”The sheriff explained the grant money will be used to purchase two new trucks, emergency lighting and uniforms.The grant requires a three-pronged approach that will include commercial vehicle violation enforcement, education and outreach.Some of the first areas to be focused on with the most commercial vehicle hazards will be Interstate 44, Highways 50 and 185, and others through the county.According to MoDOT, in a period between 2011 and 2015 there were 16 traffic fatalities involving commercial vehicles in Franklin County and an additional 38 accidents resulting in serious injury.Pelton said of the fatalities, only two were the driver of the commercial vehicle.





Grant BreakdownMuch of the grant money will go toward new equipment to allow deputies to enforce and educate.About one-third of the money, $138,074, will go for two new vehicles, emergency equipment and computer hardware.Salary for two new deputies, their benefits and any overtime pay will total $164,249.An additional $29,908 will go toward operational expenses including uniforms, fuel, office supplies and communications.Finally, just over $7,500 will be spent on professional development and travel expenses.

NEW ALBANY, Ohio, July 21, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Commercial Vehicle Group, Inc. (the "Company") (Nasdaq:   CVGI), a leading supplier of fully integrated system solutions for the global commercial vehicle market, announced this week the closure of three North American facilities in connection with the cost reduction and restructuring plan previously announced on November 19, 2015.  At the time, the Company estimated pre-tax costs of $12 to $19 million, which is now lowered to $10 to $14 million. When fully implemented by the end 2017, the cost reduction and restructuring plan previously announced on November 19, 2015 is expected to lower annualized operating costs by $8 to $12 million.








The affected facilities include plants located in Monona, Iowa; and Shadyside, Ohio; along with administrative offices in Wixom, Michigan.
The Monona facility manufactures wire harnesses and has approximately 146 employees. The work performed at the Monona facility will be transferred to the Company's operations in Agua Prieta, Mexico.  A small group of administrative and sales professionals will remain in the Iowa market following the closure of the Monona facility which is expected to be substantially completed by March 31, 2017.
The Shadyside facility performs assembly and stamping activities and has approximately 172 employees. The activities performed at the Shadyside facility will be transferred to alternative facilities or sourced to local suppliers. The closure of the Shadyside facility is expected to be substantially completed by June 30, 2017.
The Company will also close its administrative office in Wixom, Michigan, when the lease expires in the third quarter of this year, as an outcome of its ongoing efforts to consolidate engineering services.    
The Company plans to petition for assistance for eligible employees under the Department of Labor Trade Adjustment Assistance Program (TAA).
"Decisions regarding facility closures are extremely difficult but ultimately this restructuring plan reflects our ongoing efforts to align our manufacturing footprint with our customers and supply base in response to changing global macroeconomic conditions and the state of our end markets," said Joseph Saoud, President of Global Construction, Agriculture, & Military Markets.  "Our employees are important to us and we will provide support for impacted personnel, however we must strategically manage our overhead and competitive cost position in response to market conditions and customer expectations." 
Dale McKillop, Senior Vice President and Managing Director of Trim & Structures said, "We understand the impact this decision will have on our employees and the communities of Monona and Shadyside where we have served as a long time employer.  Ultimately, we made the best decision we could to maximize our global capacity utilization in response to changing customer needs."
"We will provide assistance to our employees, including severance benefits, and hope that many of them will consider opportunities with CVG in other markets," added McKillop.

                        Who We Are and What We Do  Headquartered in New Albany, Ohio, Commercial Vehicle Group, Inc. (CVG) has a history that dates back to 2000 when the leadership team identified the need for a unified company that could more fully support the increasing demands and provide custom solutions to original equipment manufacturers. They envisioned an integrated company that could offer comprehensive product lines, reputable brand names and leading edge technology in diverse markets and locations. Due to the company’s success, a string of strategic acquisition and an increased global presence, CVG made the decision to go public on August 4, 2004 and are publicly traded on the NASDAQ with a stock symbol of CVGI.   Since that time, CVG has evolved into a recognized world leader in the development, manufacturing and fulfillment of fully integrated system solutions for the commercial vehicle market including the heavy truck, construction, military, agriculture and specialty industries. Our extensive product line is aimed at providing our customers solutions that help them succeed and includes suspension seat systems, interior trim systems such as instrument and door panels, headliners, cabinets, molded products and flooring, cab systems and components and electrical systems, including mirrors, wiper systems, electronic wiring harness assemblies and controls and switches. Our products are internationally recognized with product brands such as National Seating, KAB Seating, Sprague Devices, Moto Mirror, Prutsman, Roadwatch, Roadscan and Comfortek.   CVG is made up of hard-working, dedicated employees that are focused on delivering results for our customers as well as shareholders. We pride ourselves in being driven by our customer service, product innovation and a diverse culture focused on continuous improvement in all areas of our company using our Total Quality Production System (TQPS). We are well on our way to becoming a world class organization, and won’t stop even when we achieve that status.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

Download



The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
