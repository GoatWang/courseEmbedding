Our main service is providing  Illinois attorney referrals and legal guidance.  In addition to our personalized referrals, Illinoislawyers.com also provides a directory of almost all licensed attorneys in Illinois. The list, which we update daily, includes attorneys who are licensed in Illinois and who are physically in Illinois. The list does not include attorneys who have let their registration lapse or those who are out of state.
You can search by an attorney's first or last name, the name of a law firm, or their city. Each listing should include an attorney's name and the name of their firm, along with their address, phone number, fax number, e-mail address, website, and the year they were admitted to practice in Illinois. We also try to include, based on our research, the area of law in which the attorney practices.
The list is a good way to get the contact information for an Illinois attorney or law firm. We want to be clear that this list is completely different and separate from our attorney referral list. The network of attorneys we have created for referrals is a specific list of the Illinois attorneys we know and trust. Our network is made up of attorneys we would hire ourselves if we needed a lawyer. Basically, we have handpicked the attorneys we recommend to you.
If you have any questions related to this list, please do not hesitate to contact us.
Attorney Finder:
There are two ways to find contact information for Illinois lawyers:

Start typing the last name and click on the attorney when you find the one you are looking for.
Enter Attorneys Last Name





Suggestive Search:

Manual Rotary Draw Benders


A manual tube bender from Baleigh Industrial delivers precise results for a low cost—great for hobbyists and shops that make one-off parts. You’ll get the benefits of our industry-leading designs and quality materials without spending more for a production-oriented bender.
Why buy a manual tubing bender from Baileigh?

Efficient no-pin design – Bend tube to 180° without having to move the fixture pins. Your shop will save time, since you don’t have to stop and re-pin the die.
Steel or cast iron construction – We make our manual benders from durable materials, so they last long and stay accurate.
Lifetime technical support by phone – You can call up our team of trained and tested experts whenever you run into a problem or have a question.

We make 2 kinds of manual tube and pipe benders:

Simple hand benders, like the RBD-10 and the RDB-25 – These models let you bend small-capacity tubing and pipe. They come with multiple die sets.
Benders with ratchet wheels, like the RBD-50 and the RDB-100 – These models can bend larger capacities. A long handle gives you leverage to bend the material without straining.

Hydraulic Rotary Draw Benders


In 2002, Baileigh made the first hydraulic tube bender to bend 180° in one shot. Since then, we’ve continued to lead the industry. We build time-saving designs out of steel for long-lasting accuracy.
Why choose a tube and pipe bender from Baileigh?

Low-pressure hydraulics – We use only the safest industrial-grade hydraulics in our tubing benders.
Drop-on tooling – It’s fast and easy to change out dies for different projects.
Quick-release die – Loading and unloading is a cinch. No complicated screws to take up your valuable time.
Hands-free design – Stop and start the bender with the foot pedal. 
Durable materials – Steel frameworks add strength to our machines, so they’ll work hard for your shop over the years.
Made in the USA – We’re proud to say that each rotary draw bender in this line was manufactured right here in America.
Lifetime technical support by phone – Call us up whenever you need troubleshooting or have questions. Our customer reps all have hands-on machine experience.

With a hydraulic tube bender, you can:

Make handrails, racecar chassis, roll cages, and more.
Tackle production runs. Hydraulic benders are faster and more precise than manual models.
Save physical effort. A hydraulic tubing bender doesn’t require any human force.
Spend less than you would on a programmable tube bender.
