Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

734 Agriculture And Arlon Group Purchase Majority Interest In Alico, Inc.






GlobeNewswire



Oct 18, 2013 8:40 AM EDT













 




























































    FORT MYERS, Fla. and NEW YORK, Oct. 18, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 734 Agriculture, LLC and Alico, Inc. (Nasdaq:ALCO) announced today that 734 Agriculture, a private investment company owned and controlled by Remy W. Trafelet and George R. Brokaw, in partnership with Arlon Group, a global food and agriculture investment firm founded by Continental Grain Company, have entered into definitive agreements under which an affiliate of 734 Agriculture will acquire approximately 50.5 percent of Alico's outstanding voting stock from Atlantic Blue Group, a family owned holding company.  The all cash transaction values the majority stake in Alico at $37 per share, for a total purchase price of $137.8 million. The transaction is scheduled to close during the fourth calendar quarter of 2013, subject to limited customary closing conditions.  Based in Fort Myers, Florida, Alico is an agribusiness and land management company. Its principal lines of business are citrus groves, improved farmland including sugar cane, cattle ranching and resource conservation. The company is one of the largest private landowners in Florida, owning approximately 130,800 acres in five counties. It is a leading citrus grower in Florida with approximately 11,000 producing acres.  Upon close of the transaction, Clay G. Wilson, a third generation citrus grower associated with the citrus industry for more than 28 years, is expected to replace JD Alexander as Chief Executive Officer of Alico. Mr. Wilson currently serves as Chief Executive Officer of 734 Citrus Holdings, LLC and Silver Nip Citrus, companies also owned and controlled by 734 Agriculture.  The Alico board of directors is expected to comprise eight members after close of the transaction – including Mr. Wilson, Mr. Trafelet, Mr. Brokaw and Ben Fishman, Managing Principal of Arlon Group. In addition, Henry (Hank) Slack, former CEO of Minorco, former Executive Director of Anglo American PLC, and former Chairman of Terra Industries, is expected to assume the role of Chairman of the Board of Alico after closing. Ramon Rodriguez, current Chairman of the Board of Alico, is expected to remain a member of the board. 734 Agriculture and Arlon intend that at least a majority of the board of directors will continue to be independent based on NASDAQ listing criteria.
