Our Salmon 





AquaBounty—a small company with a bold vision—to raise the world’s finest, most sustainable Atlantic salmon. A fish that is nutritious, delicious, fresh and affordable.




Premium Quality, Superior Taste
“The flesh is exquisite. Buttery, light, juicy. Just as Atlantic salmon should be.”
– Michele Henry, Toronto Food Writer
AquAdvantage® Salmon – descended from wild salmon stocks that once inhabited the tributaries of Canada’s famed Bay of Fundy – has a mild delicate flavor, and the meat is moderately firm. Blind taste tests have consistently found that AquAdvantage® Salmon is delicious.




Healthy & Nutritious
Whether grilled, baked, sautéed, or smoked, Atlantic salmon is one of the world’s healthiest foods. It is low in calories, low in saturated and trans fats, and an excellent source of protein, essential vitamins, minerals, and heart-friendly omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. No wonder dietitians and physicians are recommending that consumers eat more fish. Atlantic salmon is a widely accepted center of the plate ingredient in recipes, menus and households around the world.











In the Kitchen with AquaBounty
From sesame crusted salmon with roasted pepper salsa to everything salmon burgers with scallion sour cream-cream cheese sauce, our staff of salmon lovers shares some of their favorite recipes.

Information Collection & Use; Privacy Policy
Scope
This Policy describes our practices with regard to information about you that is obtained, either directly or indirectly, through aquabounty.com. It does not apply to any other websites that we may operate, any websites of third parties to which we provide links, or information that we obtain outside of this website. We do not control and are not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties, or the data available on their websites, and you should evaluate those practices and data for yourself.
What Information Do We Collect?
We are very cognizant of the amount of private information that is collected these days, and we have no wish to add any more of your personal information to the Big Data warehouse. As such, we made the choice not to collect any information about the visitors to this website and to limit, as much as we can, the information our website vendors see in the course of providing their services. Rather than use “cookies” or other methods of collecting or storing your information, we elected to create this website using the open-source software WordPress and, using the JetPack plug-in, have WordPress.com provide us with de-identified usage metrics like the number of unique visitors we get, what countries those visitors are from, and how often individual website pages are visited.
When you visit a website, your browser sends that site the unique internet address (known as the Internet Protocol, or IP, address) of the device on which you are browsing and the unique identifier (the Uniform Resource Locator, or URL) of each page on the site you request during your visit. It may also send certain data about the equipment and software being used to browse, information about any search terms used to find the site, and where you were navigating from. While we do not collect any of this data, it is automatically passed to WordPress.com by the JetPack plug-in so that they can compile the information and provide us with the de-identified usage metrics.
How Do We Use That Information?
We don’t have any of your personal information to use, but we use the statistics provided to us by WordPress.com to improve the functionality of this website and determine what information to provide. For example, we use the number of visitors using certain portions or features of this website to guide what information to provide and how to post it.
How Do We Share That Information?
As described above, we do not collect any information about you and therefore have no private information to share with third parties. That said, as described above, WordPress.com collects the information passed to it by the JetPack plug-in in the course of providing its services. Please see the documentation and privacy policies of WordPress.com and GoDaddy.com, our web server host, for more information on how they handle personal information.
Of course, if required to do so by law or if we believed that it was necessary to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of AquaBounty or any of its affiliates, customers, or vendors (including their employees and consultants), we would request whatever personal information WordPress.com might have and disclose it to third parties as necessary to stay compliant and avoid harm.
Questions?
If you have any questions about this Policy, you may direct them to: AquaBounty Technologies, Inc., Attn: General Counsel, Two Clock Tower Plaza, Suite 395, Maynard, MA 01754.
Forward-Looking Statements
This website contains certain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, forecasts, and assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements are based on information available to us as of the date hereof, and our actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied, due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business, including any risks identified in any of our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, intentions, or strategies regarding the future and can be identified by forward-looking words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “should,” “will,” and “would” or similar words. We assume no obligation to update the information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

Products[edit]
The company has developed hybrid salmon, trout, and tilapia designed to grow faster than traditional fish.
Their hybrid Atlantic salmon incorporates a gene from a Chinook salmon, which bears a single copy of the stably integrated α-form of the opAFP-GHc2 gene construct at the α-locus in the EO-1α line (Ocean Pout AKA Eel).[4] AquaBounty has patented and trademarked this fish as the AquAdvantage salmon, a sterile Atlantic salmon female that can grow to market size in half the time of conventional salmon.[5]
The company also produces antifreeze proteins; and conducts research and development programs related to the commercialization of cryo preservatives and the antifreeze gene constructs.[3]
Finances[edit]
In 2012, a New York Times article reported the finances of AquaBounty were not in good shape and the company had to reduce staff from 27 to 12.[6] In March 2012, AquaBounty raised US$2 million in new capital, but this would only last until the end of the year.[6]
Georgian investor Kakha Bendukidze owned 47.6% of the company's stock before selling to American synthetic biology firm Intrexon in October 2012. Intrexon put up $500,000 in bridge financing and offered to buy the rest of the company.[5][7] Intrexon acquired majority ownership of Aquabounty in 2013.[8]

Products[edit]
The company has developed hybrid salmon, trout, and tilapia designed to grow faster than traditional fish.
Their hybrid Atlantic salmon incorporates a gene from a Chinook salmon, which bears a single copy of the stably integrated α-form of the opAFP-GHc2 gene construct at the α-locus in the EO-1α line (Ocean Pout AKA Eel).[4] AquaBounty has patented and trademarked this fish as the AquAdvantage salmon, a sterile Atlantic salmon female that can grow to market size in half the time of conventional salmon.[5]
The company also produces antifreeze proteins; and conducts research and development programs related to the commercialization of cryo preservatives and the antifreeze gene constructs.[3]
Finances[edit]
In 2012, a New York Times article reported the finances of AquaBounty were not in good shape and the company had to reduce staff from 27 to 12.[6] In March 2012, AquaBounty raised US$2 million in new capital, but this would only last until the end of the year.[6]
Georgian investor Kakha Bendukidze owned 47.6% of the company's stock before selling to American synthetic biology firm Intrexon in October 2012. Intrexon put up $500,000 in bridge financing and offered to buy the rest of the company.[5][7] Intrexon acquired majority ownership of Aquabounty in 2013.[8]

Vaccines and Other Medical Materials



    


AquAdvantage Salmon: Package Insert and Label InformationBy AquaBounty Technologies, Inc. | Last revised: 18 December 2015
 
AQUADVANTAGE SALMON — 
atlantic salmon transgenic whole (opafp-ghc2 rdna construct inserted into .alpha.-locus in the eo-1.alpha. lineage)
 not applicableAquaBounty Technologies, Inc.
 
 1.  Product Definition 
 1.1 Identity 
A single copy of the a-form of the opAFP-GHc2 recombinant DNA construct at the a-locus in the EO-1a lineage of triploid, hemizygous, all-female Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) known as AquAdvantage Salmon.
 1.2  Claim 
Significantly more AquAdvantage Salmon grow to at least 100 g within 2700°C-days than their comparators.




 1.3 Limitations 
AquAdvantage Salmon are produced as eyed-eggs and grown-out only in physically-contained, freshwater culture facilities specified in an FDA-approved application.
 2.  Product Use 
 2.1 Initial Receipt 
Remove the exterior cardboard packaging from the shipping container, then clean and disinfect the outside of the interior plastic crate before bringing it into the culture facility. Open the plastic crate in an area that is designated for egg receipt, and remove the eggs for disinfection as described in §2.2. Dispose of all packaging and the empty egg trays according to local regulations.
 2.2 Handling &  Disinfection 
 Important: This product was disinfected prior to packaging for shipment. If egg hatch has initiated during transit, do not subject to further disinfection as described below. 
Open the plastic crate and determine the temperature of the eggs in the top and bottom trays. If the egg temperature is greater than that of the receiving water by ³ 4°C, slowly equilbrate the eggs to the receiving temperature by pouring receiving water gently over the eggs until the difference is less than 4°C.
Disinfect the eggs in accordance with local regulations; following disinfection, rinse the eggs gently but thoroughly in running water at the receiving temperature before placing them in incubators.
 2.3 Incubation &  Hatch 
In a vertically-stacked Heath type incubator system, stock no more than 10,000 eggs in a single tray, preferably in a single layer. Adjust water flow to ~10 L/min and maintain egg-incubation temperature at ~6-8°C.* Clean the individual trays, removing dead eggs, a minimum of twice per week. Following hatch, use a substrate when alevin become more active, typically at ~20% yolk sac absorption. 
  
  * Eggs may be incubated at water temperatures lower than the range stated for the purpose of delaying hatch. 
 2.4 First-Feeding &  Initial Culture 
Before yolk sac absorption is complete, transfer the alevin to tanks appropriate for 1st-feeding and gradually increase water temperature to a maximum of ~15-16°C. When the yolk sac is fully absorbed, increase water flow rate to ~20 L/min. AquAdvantage Salmon grow very rapidly at this life stage. For maximum growth performance:  use freshwater flow-through, rather than recirculation, until they are feeding well; maintain a 24-hour light cycle; and, feed to satiety at least once per hour using automated feeders and appropriate pellet size, which will change several times during the first 2-3 months. If capabilities do not allow for optimum conditions , feed fry to satiety a minimum of six times, and preferably once per hour, during operational day-length. In either scenario, flush excess feed from tanks at least three times per day.
Observe fry carefully during this period for any change in behavior, which could indicate a deterioration of culture conditions that might lead to unnecessary mortality. Grade fry earlier and more often than would be typical for Atlantic salmon: at least three gradings during the first few months are highly recommended.
 
 2.5 Grow-Out &  Processing 
Transfer fry to larger tanks for grow-out at a body weight consistent with established practices. To optimize growth performance, maintain dissolved oxygen content at a minimum value of 7 mg/L and stocking density at a value less than the maximum sustainable under local culture conditions. Feed fish to satiety a minimum of twice per day according to manufacturer’s guidelines using a high-fat commercial diet of appropriate pellet-size; automatic feeders are recommended. Important: You must euthanize AquAdvantage Salmon before they leave the grow-out facility for processing.
 3.  Conditions of Use 
Rear only in contained, freshwater culture facilities specified in an FDA-approved application. Do not grow AquAdvantage Salmon in net pens or release them into the environment. Dispose of dead or morbid fish in a manner consistent with local regulations.
 4.  Growth Performance 
In a controlled study conducted for 2700°C-days after first-feeding, AquAdvantage Salmon and diploid comparators achieved average body weights of 261.0 g and 73.6 g, respectively; the proportion of individual AquAdvantage Salmon with a body weight greater than 100 g was 98.6% compared to 4.9% for the comparators. These differences in average body weight and proportion of fish weighing more than 100 g at 2700°C-days were significant (p < 0.0001).

    5.  Animal Safety 
In a controlled study, some juvenile AquAdvantage Salmon exhibited changes in gross morphology similar in number and severity to those observed in diploid comparator salmon; these changes most often affected the operculum and gill structure, jaw, or fins. The degree of change from a perfectly-formed fish was ranked as none, slight, moderate, or severe; the vast majority of these malformations were regarded as slight. No remarkable differences were observed in the morphology of internal body structures or relative organ weights.

 1.  Definición de Producto 
 1.1  Identidad 
Una sola copia de la forma-a de unidad compuesta de ADN recombinante opAFP-GHc2 en el locus-a de la línea EO-1a  del Salmón Atlántico (Salmo salar), triploide, hemicigoto y 100% hembra, conocido como Salmón AquAdvantage.
 1.2.  Aseveración 
La proporción de Salmones AquAdvantage que llega a alcanzar 100 gramos o más a los 2700°C-día, es significativamente mayor que los salmones Atlánticos comparables.
 1.3.  Restricciones 
El Salmón AquAdvantage es producido como ova con ojo y criado  únicamente en sistemas cerrados de agua dulce especificados en una solicitud aprobada por el U.S. FDA.
 2.  Uso del Producto 
 2.1.  Recepción Inicial 
Remueva el empaque exterior de cartón del contenedor de envío. Luego limpie y desinfecte el exterior del contenedor de plástico antes de ingresarlo a la instalación de cultivo. Abra el contenedor de plástico en un área designada para la recepción de ovas y remueva las ovas para realizar la desinfección descrita en el punto 2.2. Disponga todo el material de empaque y bandejas de ovas vacías acorde a las regulaciones locales. 
 2.2  Manejo y Desinfección 
Importante: Este producto fue desinfectado previo a su empaque para transporte. Si el proceso de eclosión se ha iniciado durante el tr ánsito, no proceda con la desinfección descrita más abajo. 
Abra la caja de plástico y mida la temperatura de las ovas tanto en la bandeja superior como inferior. Si la temperatura de las ovas es ≥ 4°C que la temperatura de recepción del agua, iguale lentamente las ovas a la temperatura de recepción, vertiendo suavemente el agua de recepción sobre las ovas hasta que esta diferencia sea menor a 4°C.
Desinfecte las ovas de acuerdo a las regulaciones locales. Después de la desinfección, proceda a lavar las ovas suave pero minuciosamente con agua corriendo a la temperatura de recepción antes de colocarlas en las incubadoras.
 2.3  Incubación y Eclosión 
Considerando un sistema de incubación vertical, coloque no más de 10.000 ovas por bandeja, preferentemente en una capa. Ajuste el flujo de agua a ~10 L/min y mantenga la temperatura de a ~6-8°C.* Limpie las bandejas individuales, removiendo las ovas muertas, al menos 2 veces por semana. A continuación de la eclosión, use sustratos cuando los alevines estén más activos, típicamente cuando hayan absorbido el ~20% del saco vitelino.
* Las ovas pueden ser incubadas a temperaturas menores a las indicadas con el propósito de retardar la eclosión.
 2.4. Primera Alimentación y Cultivo Inicial 
Antes de que el saco vitelino se haya absorbido completamente, transfiera los alevines a tanques apropiados para Primera Alimentación y gradualmente incremente la temperatura hasta un máximo de ~15-16°C. Cuando el saco vitelino este completamente absorbido, incremente el flujo de agua a ~20 L/min. El Salmon AquAdvantage crece en forma muy rápida en esta etapa de vida. Para un máximo crecimiento:  utilice agua dulce con flujo abierto, en vez de recirculación, hasta que estos estén alimentándose adecuadamente. Mantenga un ciclo de luz de 24 horas y aliméntelos a saciedad al menos una vez por hora utilizando alimentadores automáticos, adecuando el tamaño de pellet, el cual cambiará varias veces durante los 2-3 primeros meses. Si las capacidades no permiten óptimas condiciones , alimente los alevines a saciedad un mínimo de 6 veces por día, preferentemente cada hora, durante la jornada diaria de trabajo. Bajo cualquier escenario, descargue de los tanques el exceso de alimento al menos tres veces por día.
Durante este periodo, observe los alevines cuidadosamente de tal manera de detectar cambios de comportamiento que pudieran indicar deterioros en las condiciones de cultivo que pueden conllevar mortalidades innecesarias. 
 
Gradúe a los alevines más temprano y más seguido que en el caso de un salmón Atlántico convencional: al menos tres graduaciones durante el primer mes es altamente recomendado.
 2.5.  Engorda y Proceso 
Transfiera los alevines a tanques más grandes para su engorde, acorde a prácticas establecidas. Para optimizar el crecimiento mantenga el nivel de ox ígeno disuelto en un valor mínimo de 7 mg/L y densidades de cultivo menores a las condiciones máximas de cultivo local sustentable. Alimente a los peces a saciedad, mínimo dos veces al día acorde a las recomendaciones de los proveedores de alimento, usando dietas altas en lípidos, tamaños de pellets adecuados y sistemas de alimentación automáticos . Importante: Los Salmones AquAdvantage  deben ser sacrificados antes de salir de las instalaciones de cultivo para ser procesados.
 3.  Condiciones de Uso 
Sólo para ser cultivados en sistemas de agua dulce, especificados en una solicitud aprobada por el U.S. FDA. No cultive los Salmones AquAdvantage en redes — jaulas ni los libere al medio ambiente. Disponga los peces muertos o moribundos acorde a las regulaciones locales.
 4.  Crecimiento 
En un estudio bajo condiciones controladas desarrollado por 2700°C-día después de primera alimentación, los Salmones AquAdvantage  y los diploides comparables, obtuvieron un peso de 261.0 g. y 73.6 g. Respectivamente. Además, la proporción de individuos AquAdvantage  con un peso superior a 100 g fue de 98.6% en comparación con 4.9% de sus similares no transgénicos. Estas diferencias en promedio de peso y proporción de peces con pesos mayores a 100 g a los 2700°C-día son estadísticamente significativas (p < 0.0001).

FDA Approves AquAdvantage® Salmon

MAYNARD, Mass., Nov. 19, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- AquaBounty Technologies, Inc. (AIM: ABTU; OTC: AQBT), a biotechnology company focused on enhancing productivity in aquaculture, and a majority-owned subsidiary of Intrexon Corporation (NYSE:   XON), announces today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the Company's New Animal Drug Application for the production, sale, and consumption of its AquAdvantage® Salmon, an Atlantic salmon that has been genetically enhanced to reach market size in less time than conventional farmed Atlantic salmon.
Ronald L. Stotish, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of AquaBounty, commented, "AquAdvantage Salmon is a game-changer that brings healthy and nutritious food to consumers in an environmentally responsible manner without damaging the ocean and other marine habitats.  Using land-based aquaculture systems, this rich source of protein and other nutrients can be farmed close to major consumer markets in a more sustainable manner."
The U.S. currently imports over 90% of all the seafood, and more specifically over 95% of the Atlantic salmon, it consumes.  AquAdvantage Salmon will offer the opportunity for an economically viable domestic aquaculture industry while providing consumers a fresh and delicious product.
Through greater efficiency and localized production, AquaBounty's AquAdvantage Salmon increases productivity while reducing costs and the environmental impacts associated with current salmon farming operations.  Land-based aquaculture systems can provide a continuous supply of fresh, safe, traceable, and sustainable AquAdvantage Salmon to communities across the U.S. and do it with a reduced carbon footprint.  Importantly, it offers an alternative approach to fish farming that does not exploit the oceans.
Jack A. Bobo, Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer at Intrexon, stated, "The U.S. Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee encourages Americans to eat a wide variety of seafood—including wild caught and farmed—as part of a healthy diet rich in healthy fatty acids.  However, this must occur in an environmentally friendly and sustainable manner.  FDA's approval of the AquAdvantage Salmon is an important step in this direction."
About AquaBounty Technologies. Inc.
AquaBounty Technologies, Inc. is a publicly traded company whose largest shareholder is Intrexon Corporation (NYSE:   XON).  Intrexon is a synthetic biology company with diverse interests in medicine, food and agriculture, and fuels and the environment.  AquaBounty is an aquaculture company focused on improving productivity in commercial aquaculture, a $144 billion industry and the fastest-growing segment of the worldwide food industry.  The Company's objective is the application of biotechnology to ensure the availability of high quality seafood to meet global consumer demand. AquaBounty is developing products to address critical production constraints in the most popular farmed species, focusing initially on salmon, trout, and tilapia.  Its AquAdvantage® fish program is based upon a single, specific molecular modification in fish that results in more rapid growth in early development.

Products[edit]
The company has developed hybrid salmon, trout, and tilapia designed to grow faster than traditional fish.
Their hybrid Atlantic salmon incorporates a gene from a Chinook salmon, which bears a single copy of the stably integrated α-form of the opAFP-GHc2 gene construct at the α-locus in the EO-1α line (Ocean Pout AKA Eel).[4] AquaBounty has patented and trademarked this fish as the AquAdvantage salmon, a sterile Atlantic salmon female that can grow to market size in half the time of conventional salmon.[5]
The company also produces antifreeze proteins; and conducts research and development programs related to the commercialization of cryo preservatives and the antifreeze gene constructs.[3]
Finances[edit]
In 2012, a New York Times article reported the finances of AquaBounty were not in good shape and the company had to reduce staff from 27 to 12.[6] In March 2012, AquaBounty raised US$2 million in new capital, but this would only last until the end of the year.[6]
Georgian investor Kakha Bendukidze owned 47.6% of the company's stock before selling to American synthetic biology firm Intrexon in October 2012. Intrexon put up $500,000 in bridge financing and offered to buy the rest of the company.[5][7] Intrexon acquired majority ownership of Aquabounty in 2013.[8]

Products[edit]
The company has developed hybrid salmon, trout, and tilapia designed to grow faster than traditional fish.
Their hybrid Atlantic salmon incorporates a gene from a Chinook salmon, which bears a single copy of the stably integrated α-form of the opAFP-GHc2 gene construct at the α-locus in the EO-1α line (Ocean Pout AKA Eel).[4] AquaBounty has patented and trademarked this fish as the AquAdvantage salmon, a sterile Atlantic salmon female that can grow to market size in half the time of conventional salmon.[5]
The company also produces antifreeze proteins; and conducts research and development programs related to the commercialization of cryo preservatives and the antifreeze gene constructs.[3]
Finances[edit]
In 2012, a New York Times article reported the finances of AquaBounty were not in good shape and the company had to reduce staff from 27 to 12.[6] In March 2012, AquaBounty raised US$2 million in new capital, but this would only last until the end of the year.[6]
Georgian investor Kakha Bendukidze owned 47.6% of the company's stock before selling to American synthetic biology firm Intrexon in October 2012. Intrexon put up $500,000 in bridge financing and offered to buy the rest of the company.[5][7] Intrexon acquired majority ownership of Aquabounty in 2013.[8]
