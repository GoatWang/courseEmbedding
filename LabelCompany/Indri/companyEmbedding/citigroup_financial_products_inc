Institutional Business | Citi















Please be advised that this site is not optimized for use with Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.












Institutional Business

									We are a trusted partner, supporting innovation and growth globally for corporate clients through Citi's network in 98 countries.
								

















								Citi's Institutional Clients Group (ICG) enables progress by providing large multinational corporations, public sector entities, ultra-high-net-worth households and investment managers with wholesale banking products and services via an unmatched geographic breadth and product depth.
							
We are a trusted partner, supporting innovation and growth globally for corporate clients through Citi's network in 98 countries and providing lending, cash management and advisory services that help them to conduct daily operations, to hire, to grow and to succeed. In the public sector, we help build sustainable infrastructure, housing, transportation, schools and other vital public works for the future. With trading floors in more than 80 countries, clearing and custody networks in over 60 countries and connections with 400 clearing systems, we maintain one of the largest global financial infrastructures and facilitate approximately $4 trillion of flows daily. This is what enables us to serve our core clients with distinction.
							ICG's work represents all of Citi's core activities of safeguarding assets, lending money, making payments and accessing the capital markets on behalf of our clients.


Capital Markets Origination

								Citi's Capital Markets Origination business is focused on the capital-raising needs of institutional clients, from inaugural issuances and exchanges to cross-border transactions and landmark structures.
							


								Owing to an unmatched global footprint and diverse range of financial products, we aim to be the first choice among issuers for clients' underwriting needs. Our track record of successfully executing in both buoyant and challenging market conditions is a testament to our unwavering commitment to provide the highest quality service to clients. Our structuring and execution expertise has established us as a leader in the equity capital markets, whether measured by innovation or proceeds raised, and has distinguished Citi as the clear choice for debt underwriting, with excellence across a broad range of currencies and markets. In 2016, Citi served as joint global coordinator on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's multi-tranche $17.5 billion bond offering; as a bookrunner on Dell, Inc.'s $20 billion bond offering to finance its acquisition of EMC Corporation; as joint lead arranger and bookrunner for $12 billion of debt and equity financing for Molson Coors in relation to its acquisition of MillerCoors; as a joint global coordinator on Samsung BioLogics's $2 billion initial public offering; and as sole bookrunner on Ardagh Group's $4.5 billion bond offering in part to fund the acquisition of Ball/Rexam divestiture assets.

Corporate and Investment Banking

								Our Corporate and Investment Banking division provides comprehensive relationship coverage to ensure the best possible service and responsiveness to clients.
							

With our strong banker presence in many nations, we use sector and product expertise to deliver global capabilities to clients wherever they choose to compete. Our client teams are organized by industry and country, composed of two parts: Strategic Coverage Officers focus on mergers and acquisitions and equity and related financing solutions, while Corporate Bankers—in partnership with Citi's Capital Markets specialists and with support from the Global Subsidiaries Group—deliver corporate banking and finance services to global, regional and local clients. By serving these companies, we help them grow, creating jobs and economic value at home and in communities worldwide.
We played a key role in some of 2016's most significant transactions, including financial advisor to Time Warner Cable on its agreement to be acquired by Charter Communications, Inc. for $79 billion and financial advisor to Dell, Inc. and Silver Lake Partners on its acquisition of EMC Corporation for $67 billion. We served as a financial advisor to Baxalta Inc. on its agreement to be acquired by Shire plc for approximately $32 billion.

Markets and Securities Services

								Citi's Markets and Securities Services business provides financial products and services as diverse as the needs of the thousands of corporations, institutions, governments and investors that we serve.
							

We work to enrich the relationships, products and technology that define our market-making presence. The breadth, depth and strength of our sales and trading, distribution and research capabilities span a broad range of asset classes, currencies, sectors and products, including equities, commodities, credit, futures, foreign exchange, emerging markets, G10 rates, municipals, prime finance and securitized markets. And our Investor Services and Direct Custody and Clearing businesses provide customized solutions that support the diverse investment and transaction strategies of investors and intermediaries worldwide.
Our ability to secure our clients' trust has earned us some significant recognition. Once again, we topped Greenwich Associates' Annual Survey for Global Fixed Income Market Share in Quality and have gained more market share than any other large dealer since 2008. We ranked #1 in Sales Quality, Trading Quality and e-Trading according to the survey, as well as #1 market share in Global Credit, G10 Rates, Emerging Markets Rates and Municipal Bonds. Citi VelocitySM, which delivers electronic access to our global footprint, real-time information, and capital markets intelligence and services through web, mobile and trading applications, was used by 83,000 clients in 2016. In Equities, we rolled out OPTiMUS, Citi's algo selector that leverages pattern recognition and machine learning to identify the best strategy for clients per unique order, as well as adding new features such as Total Touch ADR block trading.

Private Banking

								Our 800 Private Bankers and product specialists, located in 48 offices in 16 countries, act as trusted advisors to many of the world's most successful and influential individuals and families.
							

From our comprehensive platform of products and services, the Private Bank creates customized wealth management strategies for clients such as entrepreneurs and business owners, single- and multi-family offices, senior corporate executives, next-generation inheritors, law firms and attorneys. To grow, manage and preserve wealth in a thoughtful and holistic way, the Private Bank is committed to objective advice underpinned by a truly open architecture platform, complemented with access for clients to global capital markets, cash management and lending solutions, wealth advisory and trust services, and a premier level of client services and experiences.
A key differentiator for Citi Private Bank is our Global Client Program, which facilitates clients' growing global appetite for financial assets by leveraging our offices and capabilities worldwide. The program ensures that the client is served by a Private Banker and specialists in each region in a coordinated manner. This translates into tailored advice, competitive pricing and timely execution for their capital markets needs, as well as financing and refinancing in both commercial and residential real estate globally. Another important benefit is access to our Corporate and Investment Bank locally for their business activities in the respective regions.

Treasury and Trade Solutions

								Our Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS) business provides integrated cash management and trade finance services to multinational corporations, financial institutions and public sector organizations across the globe.
							

With the industry's most comprehensive suite of digital-enabled platforms, tools and analytics, TTS leads the way in delivering innovative and tailored solutions to clients. Offerings include payments, receivables, liquidity management and investment services, working capital solutions, commercial card programs and trade finance. Based on the belief that client experience is the driver of sustainable differentiation, TTS has focused its efforts on transforming its business to deliver a seamless, end-to-end client experience through the development of its capabilities, client advocacy, network management and service delivery across the entire organization. 
In 2016, TTS processed more than $1.8 trillion globally in client transaction value on CitiDirect BE® Mobile and CitiDirect BE® Tablet. This institutional e-banking platform was ranked #1 in Greenwich Associates' Digital Banking Benchmarking study for the 11th consecutive year. 
TTS launched eSubmit, an electronic document submission digital service that allows clients to complete the account opening process by returning electronic versions of documentation in select Western European countries. TTS also launched new working capital capabilities for clients, including enhancing the Global Concentration Engine (GCE) and Online Investments Portal (OLI). The GCE has reached a significant milestone with more than 50 countries/territories now live on its global liquidity network, providing clients with automated cash concentration services. The OLI portal, which processes over $50 billion in client transactions each month, has been upgraded with new features that provide clients with more options in managing their liquidity. These enhancements support our strategy of continued investment to deliver a broad set of liquidity management services that meet clients' changing needs.

CITIGROUP FINANCIAL PRODUCTS INC. swift code / bic code     WHAT IS A SWIFT / BIC CODE?A Swift Code is the standard format for Business Identifier Codes (BIC) and it's a unique identificationcode for banks and financial institutions globally. These codes are used when transferring money between banks,in particular for international wire transfers or SEPA payments.SWIFT code, BIC code, SWIFT ID or SWIFT - BIC (ISO 9362) is a standard format of Business Identifier Codes approved by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It is a unique identification code for both financial and non-financial institutions. The acronym SWIFT stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. When assigned to a non-financial institution, the code may also be known as a Business Entity Identifier or BEI. These codes are used when transferring money between banks, particularly for international wire transfers, and also for the exchange of other messages between banks. The codes can sometimes be found on account statements. The overlapping issue between ISO 9362 and ISO 13616 is discussed in the article International Bank Account Number (also called IBAN). The SWIFT network does not require a specific format for the transaction so the identification of accounts and transaction types is left to agreements of the transaction partners. In the process of the Single Euro Payments Area the European central banks have agreed on a common format based on IBAN and BIC including an XML-based transmission format for standardized transactions; the TARGET2 is a joint gross clearing system in the European Union that does not require the SWIFT network for transmission (see EBICS). The TARGET-directory lists all the BICs of the banks that are attached to the TARGET2-network being a subset of the SWIFT-directory of BICs.SWIFTCODES BY COUNTRYABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWYZCITIGROUP FINANCIAL PRODUCTS INC. swift codesBrowse through all available bank swift codes used by CITIGROUP FINANCIAL PRODUCTS INC.The bic codes below belong to CITIGROUP FINANCIAL PRODUCTS INC. bank and/or any of its branches  across all countries and cities in the world.Swift codes also known as BIC Codes is a unique bank identifier used to verify financial transactions such as a Bank Wire Transfer.The bank swift code provides information about the bank and branch where the money should be transferred.

The customer service is right on point. They are always able to answer any questions that I may have unlike other companies out there. I have never had a problem with them. If I am late with a payment they work with me and give me a call to see what is going on and see if they can help. When I first applied for my card they walked me through all of the necessary steps to get it activated and told me about what the company could do for me. I even received a sign on bonus for opening a account with them. I was able to get 0% APR until the next year and they also had low transfer rates. Now that I have been with the company for a long time there is no way I would switch. I have also talked to some of my family and friends joining Citi and switching from the credit cards that they had. They are glad that they did and it is the only ones that they use now. They have also used Citi for loans and also personal banking.  Thank you, Citi!

Hi Marty,

It is a rule in the credit card industry that you cannot transfer balances between credit cards issued from the same bank. The reason you are not able to transfer your balance to the Citi Simplicity is because the AT&T Access More Credit Card is issued by Citibank as well. But 20% APR is very high, so I would certainly recommend transferring your balance to a low interest credit card to avoid paying a fortune in interest. Two cards to consider that aren't issued by Citibank would be the Chase Slate, which offers 15 months with 0% APR and no balance transfer fee, or the Discover It, which has 18 months with 0% APR.

The best card I have is Capital Visa, even though I had very  bad credit .First they gave me $300.00 limits so I build it up to $500.00. Then they sent me a Visa Credit application, I sent it for the heck of it I received the card from them I was shock.They gave me $10,000.00 limits on this visa card plus if I spent $2,000.00 in my first 2 month i will get 20,000 mile which i already got. I really feel that Capital One Is the best card. I use it for everything now just to get my mile to travel.

If you have less than perfect credit, but can pay your credit card bill on time every time, get yourself a credit card from Capital One. I have a friend with excellent credit and has been a Citi card holder since 1989. Never missed a payment. His Interest rate is 19.99%. Do yourself favor contact Capital One.

Your friend should ask to speak to an acct mgr; I've been with Citi for 22 years and have a very high credit score- my record with them is perfect and without pulling a report  they reduced my interest rate at the time to very low interest; the 19.99 makes no sense unless something negative has happened.

I have been with Citi '99 and have always had excellent customer service with them.  I have called them quite a few times with various requests and have always gotten quickly through to a person.  I have even received 2 calls over the years from them asking about questionable purchases.  Both were fraudulent purchases.  They denied the charges, I never saw a charge on my statement, and they issued new cards.  Awesome company to deal with.

	Citibank Credit Card Review

	Citibank credit cards are issued through Citi Bank, a subsidiary of CitiGroup, which is a multinational umbrella organization encompassing dozens of major corporations within the global financial services industry. Citi operates in more than 100 different countries and boasts approximately 200 million customers.

	Citi Bank was originally founded in 1812 as a New York banking company. In the late 1990s Citi merged with Travelers Group to form the current CitiGroup brand. In addition to its credit card business CitiGroup also operates stock brokerage firms, insurance companies, investment banking services, wealth management services, and other ventures that offer financial services and related products.

	Citibank credit cards include student credit cards, travel rewards cards, and Citi credit cards that have “thank you” points programs that earn valuable rewards as you shop and make purchases. The Citi Platinum Select lineup of credit cards, for example, provide zero introductory APR offers and the Citi PremierPass card is a generous rewards credit card offering bonus points for selected purchases.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
