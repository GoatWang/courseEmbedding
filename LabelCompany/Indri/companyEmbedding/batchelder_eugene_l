	Explanation of Responses:








	(


	1) 





	On March 24, 2016 (the "distribution date"), holders of Occidental Petroleum Corporation ("OPC") common stock as of February 29, 2016 (the "record date") received 0.093618 shares (the "distribution ratio") of California Resources Corporation ("CRC") common stock as a dividend on each outstanding share of OPC common stock they owned on the record date (the "distribution"). To account for the distribution, each of the reporting person's OPC common stock unit awards was proportionately adjusted on the distribution date to increase the common stock units subject to the award by an amount (rounded up to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i) the number of unpaid common stock units subject to the award as of the record date multiplied by (ii) the distribution ratio multiplied by (iii) the quotient obtained by dividing the closing price of a share of CRC common stock on the distribution date by the closing price of a share of OPC common stock on the distribution date.
