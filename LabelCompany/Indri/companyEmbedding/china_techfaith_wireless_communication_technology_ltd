This list compiles the top tech penny stocks to watch in June 2017, and includes the biggest gainers of the month so far. Plus, we'll give you one of our top tech stock picks this year after the chart…



Tech Penny Stock
Current Share Price
June 2017 Return


MoSys Inc. (Nasdaq: MOSY)
$2.07
+213.6%


Ability Inc. (Nasdaq: ABIL)
$1.20
+103.4%


China Techfaith Wireless Comm. Tech. Ltd. (Nasdaq: CNTF)
$3.33
+47.5%


The9 Limited (Nasdaq ADR: NCTY)
$1.28
+40.3%


ChinaCache International Holdings Ltd. (Nasdaq: CCIH)
$1.32
+38.4%


NII Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: NIHD)
$0.74
+30.3%


Technical Communications Corp. (Nasdaq: TCCO)
$3.65
+28.6%


ARI Network Services Inc. (Nasdaq: ARIS)
$6.73
+23.8%


Research Frontiers Inc. (Nasdaq: REFR)
$1.32
+23.6%


Wowo Ltd. (Nasdaq ADR: JMU)
$2.04
+20.7%



The tech sector is having one of its roughest months of 2017. On June 9, the bellwether Nasdaq index fell 1.8% thanks to its heaviest component, Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL), plunging 3.9%. That was the company's biggest one-day decline since January 2016. Although the Nasdaq is still up 0.3% month to date, it's on track for its worst monthly performance of the year. Out of the first five full months of the year, March saw the worst Nasdaq performance with a 1.5% gain.

Despite volatility in the broader tech sector, tech penny stocks have still managed to post market-smashing returns this month…
The top performer of June so far is MoSys Inc., a semiconductor company based in Santa Clara, Calif. Shares of MOSY stock are up this month 213.6% from $0.66 to $2.07 on the back of a Q1 earnings report that announced the firm has around $5.3 million in cash on hand. This indicates the company is inching toward profitability, which was a likely reason for the increase in buying.

But as attractive as those gains are, we don't recommend buying MOSY or any other tech penny stock listed above. Since they've already seen big double-digit and triple-digit returns, they might not offer a big profit to investors who buy in now at a high price.
Chasing after soaring penny stocks like these is also extremely dangerous for retail investors who haven't done the right research. When investing in penny stocks, digging through financial documents like annual 10-K filings and quarterly reports is paramount to finding safe companies that are profitably growing – and therefore are worth your money.
That's where Money Morning Small-Cap Specialist Sid Riggs comes in. He meticulously pours over this research for our readers. Today, he's currently recommending one of the best small-cap tech stocks to buy this year.
The company he's watching is a dominant force in the financial tech – or "fintech" – industry, which is growing at a rapid pace. Fintech companies are changing the banking landscape because they're letting people make financial transactions over their mobile devices instead of at the bank. Fintech is also projected to grow 716% through 2021, an even clearer indication of its disruption of the banking sector.
While the Nasdaq is only up 0.3% this month, shares of Sid's recommendation have climbed 10.3% and cost less than $9 a share. Analysts predict the stock could gain as much as 27.9% in the next year.
Here's one of the best small-cap stocks to invest in today…

These are the 10 best penny stock gainers of June 2017 so far, ranked in order of biggest to smallest return. Plus, we'll give you our top pick for 2017 after the chart…

BREAKING: New Legislation Could Turn Tiny Pot Stocks into Millions. Click Here…
The top penny stock in June 2017 is Delcath Systems Inc., which has soared a massive 206.1% over just eight trading sessions so far this month. The DCTH stock price popped 200% from $0.02 to $0.06 from June 8 to 9 after the liver cancer biotech announced it would release phase 2 trial data on its chemotherapy drug Melphalan sometime this month. The huge surge in share price last week indicates investors believe the recent announcement will be very positive for the company moving forward.
DCTH's stunning 206.1% return clearly demonstrates the explosive profits penny stocks can offer. Because they can cost literally just a few pennies, they can potentially hand you a triple-digit return in just a couple of days.
But we still don't recommend buying any of the stocks listed above. These companies have already handed investors a big profit, which means they might not give you the same profit if you buy in now at a high price.
Our Money Morning experts only recommend investing in firms that are financially healthy and have strong earnings potential. Both of these can be learned by digging into a company's SEC filings to see if its profits are increasing rather than decreasing.
Today, Money Morning Small-Cap Specialist Sid Riggs has done the research for you. Although many of his small-cap recommendations cost more than the $5 penny stock cutoff, these companies boast bigger market caps between $300 million and $2 billion. That means these businesses attract more investors than penny stocks because they're much more financially stable.
And Sid just found another one of the best small-cap stocks to invest in this year. It's a small biotech company that has consistently won FDA approval for its drugs, including a new product that will be available over the counter for the first time in its industry. We like that track record of innovation, and we think it's going to fuel this stock to reach new heights.
This company has also crushed earnings estimates over the last four quarters by an average of 57.6%. Sid says that's a sign Wall Street analysts are underestimating the company, which makes it a great buying opportunity right now.
Here's Sid's pick for the best small-cap company to invest in this year…

CenturyLink Inc (CTL): Today's Featured Telecommunications Winner






TheStreet Wire




Oct 24, 2012 5:00 PM EDT













 


























































  Editor's Note: TheStreet ratings do not represent the views of TheStreet's staff or its contributors. Ratings are established by computer based on metrics for performance (which includes growth, stock performance, efficiency and valuation) and risk (volatility and solvency). Companies with poor cash flow or high debt levels tend to earn lower ratings in our model.  CenturyLink ( CTL) pushed the Telecommunications industry higher today making it today's featured telecommunications winner. The industry as a whole was unchanged today. By the end of trading, CenturyLink rose 40 cents (1.1%) to $38.66 on average volume. Throughout the day, 5.4 million shares of CenturyLink exchanged hands as compared to its average daily volume of 5.5 million shares. The stock ranged in a price between $38.19-$38.95 after having opened the day at $38.25 as compared to the previous trading day's close of $38.26. Other companies within the Telecommunications industry that increased today were: Motricity ( MOTR), up 15.3%, Polycom ( PLCM), up 9.7%, China TechFaith Wireless Comm Tech ( CNTF), up 7.5%, and IDT Corporation Class B ( IDT), up 5.3%.  ACTIVE STOCK TRADERS: Get full access to Jim Cramer's thoughts for less than $3/week - sometimes before he says them on TV! Start with a 14-Day Free Trial.   CenturyLink, Inc. operates as an integrated telecommunications company in the United States. The company provides local and long-distance, network access, private line, public access, broadband, data, managed hosting, colocation, wireless, and video services to consumers and businesses. CenturyLink has a market cap of $24.01 billion and is part of the technology sector. The company has a P/E ratio of 48.8, above the average telecommunications industry P/E ratio of 47 and above the S&P 500 P/E ratio of 17.7. Shares are up 3.7% year to date as of the close of trading on Tuesday. Currently there are 14 analysts that rate CenturyLink a buy, no analysts rate it a sell, and five rate it a hold. TheStreet Ratings rates CenturyLink as a buy. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, expanding profit margins and increase in stock price during the past year. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had sub par growth in net income.  You can view the full CenturyLink Ratings Report.  On the negative front, Trunkbow International Holdings ( TBOW), down 10.9%, MER Telemanagement Solutions ( MTSL), down 7.8%, Nexxus Lighting ( NEXS), down 4.7%, and RRSat Global Communications Network ( RRST), down 4.5%, were all laggards within the telecommunications industry with Qualcomm ( QCOM) being today's telecommunications industry laggard.  Use our telecommunications section to find industry-relevant news.  Or find some new ideas from our top rated stocks lists.   For investors not wanting singular stock exposure, ETFs may be of interest. Investors who are bullish on the telecommunications industry could consider iShares Dow Jones US Telecom ( IYZ) while those bearish on the telecommunications industry could consider ProShares Ult Sht Telecommunication ( TLL).
