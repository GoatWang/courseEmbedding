About the Author


    St. John Bosco was born in 1815 at Becchi, Italy. Prompted by the dreams of his youth to bring others toward virtue and away from vice, John eventually became a priest and began taking in orphans at a rented shed in 1846. Famous for his dedication to the well-being of street children, juvenile delinquents, and youth at a disadvantage, he believed in teaching through love rather than by punishment. Before his death on the thirty-first of January, 1888, he founded the Salesian Order and also composed a life of St. Joseph Cafasso. John Bosco was canonized by Pope Pius XI in 1934, and his feast day is celebrated on January 31st.

Product DescriptionHere is the story of St. John Bosco's spiritual mentor in the priesthood and the man who influenced him to become a priest, told by St. John Bosco himself. St. Joseph Cafasso was called the "Priest of the Gallows" because he converted so many condemned criminals, often accompanying them all the way to their execution to keep alive in them the grace of final perseverance. Every minute of his life was consumed with the glory of God and the salvation of souls. St. John Bosco exclaims that he seemed to have been a full-time writer and a full-time pastor - judging by the fruit of his labor. In all, St. Joseph Cafasso is a striking example of how zealous are the saints in their work for Christ. Book Size: 7"x4" Softcover. 80 pp.

Product Description


    The life of St. John Bosco's spiritual mentor and model in the priesthood, told by St. John Bosco himself. Called the "Priest of the Gallows" because he converted so many criminals on "death row" (and promised them immediate entrance into Heaven). Great stories show how he did it. Also, stories of how he taught young St. John Bosco to put God first.     
About the Author


    St. John Bosco was born in 1815 at Becchi, Italy. Prompted by the dreams of his youth to bring others toward virtue and away from vice, John eventually became a priest and began taking in orphans at a rented shed in 1846. Famous for his dedication to the well-being of street children, juvenile delinquents, and youth at a disadvantage, he believed in teaching through love rather than by punishment. Before his death on the thirty-first of January, 1888, he founded the Salesian Order and also composed a life of St. Joseph Cafasso. John Bosco was canonized by Pope Pius XI in 1934, and his feast day is celebrated on January 31st.
