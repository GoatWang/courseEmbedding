Specialties & ExpertiseDr. Dennis Langer has the following 7 areas of expertise,  1 specialty and 1 board certification.                     Psychiatry
    A psychiatrist is a doctor with specific training in the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness.


    He or she can not only provide the counseling necessary to both diagnose and treat a patient, but can also prescribe medication when needed. In some cases, a psychiatrist will only provide the medication and the counseling will be provided by another healthcare specialist, like a certified counselor or psychologist.


    Like other doctors, psychiatrists employ diagnostic tools like CT scans and MRI in order to observe the structure and function of a patient's brain.


    Once a diagnosis is made, these specialists may use behavior or cognitive therapy in order to address the patient's condition, or a multitude of other types of therapy, in conjunction with or in place of medication.
