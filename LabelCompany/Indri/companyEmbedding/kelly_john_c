BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB:

Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Despite all the horrible reviews I read here on Yelp and other review sites, my experience with John C R Kelly has been great.

I rent an 2 br apt with a roommate from them in a very nice location in Shadyside, the rent of the apartment is so reasonable compared to other 5 places I looked at. The apartment and the carpet is stainless when we first moved in, we are so impressed. The building is pretty nicely maintained, and things got fixed usually within 48 hours everytime we report a problem. There were a few times we forgot and sent them rent money a few days to even two weeks late, and they are not picky about it at all. 

Overall my roommate and I really enjoyed the apartment and we really liked John C R Kelly, I don't understand why there are so many 1 star reviews, I guess people only write reviews to complain once they are really unsatisfied so you don't hear from the satisfied tenants often. Compared to my other friends' experience with other big agencies such as Meyers or Lobos, I definitely feeI lucky that I rent from John C R Kelly. 

The only complain I can think of is that the company is not up to the latest technology, their website looks 1990s-ish and you can't pay your rent online. You'll have to mail the check to them or drop off at the office, but that's not too much of a issue for us.







I love my apartment, I never want to leave! The rent is very reasonable. Not even $800 for a 2 bedroom! When I moved in there were brand new carpets and a nice new paint job. They are friendly when I call and if anything does not work(not even an emergency) there is someone who will come within hours!







Lived in an apt in Shadyside managed by John C R Kelly for 2 years. The staff is friendly and helpful. Had a great experience with them.







I would give kelly realty zero stars if i could.  

They are the worst people to deal with, I will edit this review with more details.  As the first reviewer pointed out, they are jerks.  They don't conduct business according to Pennsylvania law.  

There are tons of other properties in Pittsburgh to rent, this realty company is one to flee from.







After reading the previous reviews, I feel very fortunate because I rented a very nice apartment in Shadyside for one year and had no problems with the landlord.







i have to give them a star?  this place was terrible, and my roommate and i should have seen it from the start. 

1.  we were shown an apartment, which candace (don't know if she still works there or not....this was a few years ago) claimed was the apartment up for rent.  then, when we called back saying we'd take it, it turned out the actual apartment was the downstairs one.  we later found out the tenants in the other apartment had been living there a long time.  so, basically, she misled us by showing us a more-desirable apartment.

2.  before moving in, I requested permission to have one cat, and candace mailed me a letter of permission.  months later, i received a phone call threatening EVICTION because of the fact that we had a cat living in the apartment.  the "gentleman" who called also cursed at me.  i explained that i had a letter of permission, and tried to get him to reassure me that once i mailed in a copy of my letter, everything would be ok.  he (cursingly) refused to give me that permission, saying "...we'll see." (for what it's worth, once they received the letter, they did not harrass us about that anymore.)

3.  one time i had just gotten out of the shower, when i heard someone trying to get into the apartment.  i (completely scared) peeked my head around to see what was going on, and saw candace reaching her hand through the door trying to undo the chain lock.  i went to the door to undo the chain, and she acted really put-out because she had left a message on the machine saying that she planned to show the apartment that day.  well, she left the message the previous evening, and i hadn't gotten the message, nor had i given her permission.  furthermore, she did not even do us the courtesy of knocking.  rather, she tried to BREAK IN.

4.  they made it so that our lease was up on sept. 27.  yes, the 27th of the month. SO inconvenient!!

5.  their requirements for getting the security deposit back are CRAZY.  they made us wash the inside AND the outside of the windows!!!  (there is NO WAY the windows were washed on the outside when we moved in.  none.)  we were to move the stove and refrigerator away from the walls, to wash the floor and the walls, as well as the sides of the appliances.  etc.  

6.  If you do, for some crazy reason, decide to rent from these unpredictable maniacs, make sure before you move out that you take PICTURES of the move-out day.  getting our security deposit back was the easiest part of dealing with them, and i have to believe it is because we took pictures, and TOLD them that we had pictures, and that if they deducted any of our deposit that we would pursue court action.  

7.  someone, after we moved but before our lease was up, removed the note we had attached to our mailbox with our names (so that the postman knows which mail belongs in which mailbox).  we were still checking our mail there, and our "change of address" form had not yet been processed by the post office.  this had the result that the postman just didn't deliver our mail to that address anymore.  i asked our neighbors whether they had done it, and they said no.  my best guess is that someone working at this company removed it for us.  

they are such jerks.

Despite all the horrible reviews I read here on Yelp and other review sites, my experience with John C R Kelly has been great.I rent an 2 br apt with a roommate from them in a very nice location in Shadyside, the rent of the apartment is so reasonable compared to other 5 places I looked at. The apartment and the carpet is stainless when we first moved in, we are so impressed. The building is pretty nicely maintained, and things got fixed usually within 48 hours everytime we report a problem. There were a few times we forgot and sent them rent money a few days to even two weeks late, and they are not picky about it at all. Overall my roommate and I really enjoyed the apartment and we really liked John C R Kelly, I don't understand why there are so many 1 star reviews, I guess people only write reviews to complain once they are really unsatisfied so you don't hear from the satisfied tenants often. Compared to my other friends' experience with other big agencies such as Meyers or Lobos, I definitely feeI lucky that I rent from John C R Kelly. The only complain I can think of is that the company is not up to the latest technology, their website looks 1990s-ish and you can't pay your rent online. You'll have to mail the check to them or drop off at the office, but that's not too much of a issue for us.

I love my apartment, I never want to leave! The rent is very reasonable. Not even $800 for a 2 bedroom! When I moved in there were brand new carpets and a nice new paint job. They are friendly when I call and if anything does not work(not even an emergency) there is someone who will come within hours!

Lived in an apt in Shadyside managed by John C R Kelly for 2 years. The staff is friendly and helpful. Had a great experience with them.

I would give kelly realty zero stars if i could.  They are the worst people to deal with, I will edit this review with more details.  As the first reviewer pointed out, they are jerks.  They don't conduct business according to Pennsylvania law.  There are tons of other properties in Pittsburgh to rent, this realty company is one to flee from.

After reading the previous reviews, I feel very fortunate because I rented a very nice apartment in Shadyside for one year and had no problems with the landlord.

i have to give them a star?  this place was terrible, and my roommate and i should have seen it from the start. 1.  we were shown an apartment, which candace (don't know if she still works there or not....this was a few years ago) claimed was the apartment up for rent.  then, when we called back saying we'd take it, it turned out the actual apartment was the downstairs one.  we later found out the tenants in the other apartment had been living there a long time.  so, basically, she misled us by showing us a more-desirable apartment.2.  before moving in, I requested permission to have one cat, and candace mailed me a letter of permission.  months later, i received a phone call threatening EVICTION because of the fact that we had a cat living in the apartment.  the "gentleman" who called also cursed at me.  i explained that i had a letter of permission, and tried to get him to reassure me that once i mailed in a copy of my letter, everything would be ok.  he (cursingly) refused to give me that permission, saying "...we'll see." (for what it's worth, once they received the letter, they did not harrass us about that anymore.)3.  one time i had just gotten out of the shower, when i heard someone trying to get into the apartment.  i (completely scared) peeked my head around to see what was going on, and saw candace reaching her hand through the door trying to undo the chain lock.  i went to the door to undo the chain, and she acted really put-out because she had left a message on the machine saying that she planned to show the apartment that day.  well, she left the message the previous evening, and i hadn't gotten the message, nor had i given her permission.  furthermore, she did not even do us the courtesy of knocking.  rather, she tried to BREAK IN.4.  they made it so that our lease was up on sept. 27.  yes, the 27th of the month. SO inconvenient!!5.  their requirements for getting the security deposit back are CRAZY.  they made us wash the inside AND the outside of the windows!!!  (there is NO WAY the windows were washed on the outside when we moved in.  none.)  we were to move the stove and refrigerator away from the walls, to wash the floor and the walls, as well as the sides of the appliances.  etc.  6.  If you do, for some crazy reason, decide to rent from these unpredictable maniacs, make sure before you move out that you take PICTURES of the move-out day.  getting our security deposit back was the easiest part of dealing with them, and i have to believe it is because we took pictures, and TOLD them that we had pictures, and that if they deducted any of our deposit that we would pursue court action.  7.  someone, after we moved but before our lease was up, removed the note we had attached to our mailbox with our names (so that the postman knows which mail belongs in which mailbox).  we were still checking our mail there, and our "change of address" form had not yet been processed by the post office.  this had the result that the postman just didn't deliver our mail to that address anymore.  i asked our neighbors whether they had done it, and they said no.  my best guess is that someone working at this company removed it for us.  they are such jerks.

Despite all the horrible reviews I read here on Yelp and other review sites, my experience with John C R Kelly has been great.

I rent an 2 br apt with a roommate from them in a very nice location in Shadyside, the rent of the apartment is so reasonable compared to other 5 places I looked at. The apartment and the carpet is stainless when we first moved in, we are so impressed. The building is pretty nicely maintained, and things got fixed usually within 48 hours everytime we report a problem. There were a few times we forgot and sent them rent money a few days to even two weeks late, and they are not picky about it at all. 

Overall my roommate and I really enjoyed the apartment and we really liked John C R Kelly, I don't understand why there are so many 1 star reviews, I guess people only write reviews to complain once they are really unsatisfied so you don't hear from the satisfied tenants often. Compared to my other friends' experience with other big agencies such as Meyers or Lobos, I definitely feeI lucky that I rent from John C R Kelly. 

The only complain I can think of is that the company is not up to the latest technology, their website looks 1990s-ish and you can't pay your rent online. You'll have to mail the check to them or drop off at the office, but that's not too much of a issue for us.







I love my apartment, I never want to leave! The rent is very reasonable. Not even $800 for a 2 bedroom! When I moved in there were brand new carpets and a nice new paint job. They are friendly when I call and if anything does not work(not even an emergency) there is someone who will come within hours!







Lived in an apt in Shadyside managed by John C R Kelly for 2 years. The staff is friendly and helpful. Had a great experience with them.







I would give kelly realty zero stars if i could.  

They are the worst people to deal with, I will edit this review with more details.  As the first reviewer pointed out, they are jerks.  They don't conduct business according to Pennsylvania law.  

There are tons of other properties in Pittsburgh to rent, this realty company is one to flee from.







After reading the previous reviews, I feel very fortunate because I rented a very nice apartment in Shadyside for one year and had no problems with the landlord.







i have to give them a star?  this place was terrible, and my roommate and i should have seen it from the start. 

1.  we were shown an apartment, which candace (don't know if she still works there or not....this was a few years ago) claimed was the apartment up for rent.  then, when we called back saying we'd take it, it turned out the actual apartment was the downstairs one.  we later found out the tenants in the other apartment had been living there a long time.  so, basically, she misled us by showing us a more-desirable apartment.

2.  before moving in, I requested permission to have one cat, and candace mailed me a letter of permission.  months later, i received a phone call threatening EVICTION because of the fact that we had a cat living in the apartment.  the "gentleman" who called also cursed at me.  i explained that i had a letter of permission, and tried to get him to reassure me that once i mailed in a copy of my letter, everything would be ok.  he (cursingly) refused to give me that permission, saying "...we'll see." (for what it's worth, once they received the letter, they did not harrass us about that anymore.)

3.  one time i had just gotten out of the shower, when i heard someone trying to get into the apartment.  i (completely scared) peeked my head around to see what was going on, and saw candace reaching her hand through the door trying to undo the chain lock.  i went to the door to undo the chain, and she acted really put-out because she had left a message on the machine saying that she planned to show the apartment that day.  well, she left the message the previous evening, and i hadn't gotten the message, nor had i given her permission.  furthermore, she did not even do us the courtesy of knocking.  rather, she tried to BREAK IN.

4.  they made it so that our lease was up on sept. 27.  yes, the 27th of the month. SO inconvenient!!

5.  their requirements for getting the security deposit back are CRAZY.  they made us wash the inside AND the outside of the windows!!!  (there is NO WAY the windows were washed on the outside when we moved in.  none.)  we were to move the stove and refrigerator away from the walls, to wash the floor and the walls, as well as the sides of the appliances.  etc.  

6.  If you do, for some crazy reason, decide to rent from these unpredictable maniacs, make sure before you move out that you take PICTURES of the move-out day.  getting our security deposit back was the easiest part of dealing with them, and i have to believe it is because we took pictures, and TOLD them that we had pictures, and that if they deducted any of our deposit that we would pursue court action.  

7.  someone, after we moved but before our lease was up, removed the note we had attached to our mailbox with our names (so that the postman knows which mail belongs in which mailbox).  we were still checking our mail there, and our "change of address" form had not yet been processed by the post office.  this had the result that the postman just didn't deliver our mail to that address anymore.  i asked our neighbors whether they had done it, and they said no.  my best guess is that someone working at this company removed it for us.  

they are such jerks.

I would give kelly realty zero stars if i could.  They are the worst people to deal with, I will edit this review with more details.  As the first reviewer pointed out, they are jerks.  They don't conduct business according to Pennsylvania law.  There are tons of other properties in Pittsburgh to rent, this realty company is one to flee from.

After reading the previous reviews, I feel very fortunate because I rented a very nice apartment in Shadyside for one year and had no problems with the landlord.

i have to give them a star?  this place was terrible, and my roommate and i should have seen it from the start. 1.  we were shown an apartment, which candace (don't know if she still works there or not....this was a few years ago) claimed was the apartment up for rent.  then, when we called back saying we'd take it, it turned out the actual apartment was the downstairs one.  we later found out the tenants in the other apartment had been living there a long time.  so, basically, she misled us by showing us a more-desirable apartment.2.  before moving in, I requested permission to have one cat, and candace mailed me a letter of permission.  months later, i received a phone call threatening EVICTION because of the fact that we had a cat living in the apartment.  the "gentleman" who called also cursed at me.  i explained that i had a letter of permission, and tried to get him to reassure me that once i mailed in a copy of my letter, everything would be ok.  he (cursingly) refused to give me that permission, saying "...we'll see." (for what it's worth, once they received the letter, they did not harrass us about that anymore.)3.  one time i had just gotten out of the shower, when i heard someone trying to get into the apartment.  i (completely scared) peeked my head around to see what was going on, and saw candace reaching her hand through the door trying to undo the chain lock.  i went to the door to undo the chain, and she acted really put-out because she had left a message on the machine saying that she planned to show the apartment that day.  well, she left the message the previous evening, and i hadn't gotten the message, nor had i given her permission.  furthermore, she did not even do us the courtesy of knocking.  rather, she tried to BREAK IN.4.  they made it so that our lease was up on sept. 27.  yes, the 27th of the month. SO inconvenient!!5.  their requirements for getting the security deposit back are CRAZY.  they made us wash the inside AND the outside of the windows!!!  (there is NO WAY the windows were washed on the outside when we moved in.  none.)  we were to move the stove and refrigerator away from the walls, to wash the floor and the walls, as well as the sides of the appliances.  etc.  6.  If you do, for some crazy reason, decide to rent from these unpredictable maniacs, make sure before you move out that you take PICTURES of the move-out day.  getting our security deposit back was the easiest part of dealing with them, and i have to believe it is because we took pictures, and TOLD them that we had pictures, and that if they deducted any of our deposit that we would pursue court action.  7.  someone, after we moved but before our lease was up, removed the note we had attached to our mailbox with our names (so that the postman knows which mail belongs in which mailbox).  we were still checking our mail there, and our "change of address" form had not yet been processed by the post office.  this had the result that the postman just didn't deliver our mail to that address anymore.  i asked our neighbors whether they had done it, and they said no.  my best guess is that someone working at this company removed it for us.  they are such jerks.
