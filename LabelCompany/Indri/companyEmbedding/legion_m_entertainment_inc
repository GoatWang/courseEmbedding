Why I Like Legion M



Entertainment doesn't exist without fans, so whether you are an established Hollywood player or an up-and-coming creator, your fans are your most important asset. That's why a fan-owned company is such a revolutionary idea. By allowing people to be a part of the process, Legion M is building a community and fanbase that is invested in projects even before they are released. That has the potential to create huge value for everyone--from the biggest studios to the smallest independents.Also, Paul and Jeff are two of the nicest, smartest, and hardest working guys I've met in a long time. It's a bold plan, and I'm rooting for them to pull it off!



Scott Landsman

                Senior Vice President Comedy Development, Sony Pictures Television
                






THE BUZZ ABOUT LEGION M




Companies like Nerdist and Geek & Sundry have demonstrated that community is one of the most powerful forces in Entertainment. By tapping into the power of the community, Legion M has the opportunity to revolutionize the industry.

Adam Rymer
President at Legendary Digital Networks




My wife and I opened our first cinema nearly 20 years ago with dream of a movie house built by movie fans, for movie fans. Since then, we've witnessed the power and joy that comes from building a community around the films we love. We're thrilled to be part of Legion M and proud to be part of the fan-owned revolution!


Tim League

Founder and CEO, Alamo Drafthouse and Drafthouse Films




I invest in big ideas, and Legion M is as big as they come. Successful media companies are often measured in billions of dollars, and I believe this has potential to be one of the greats. I’ve invested in Paul and Jeff before and I’m betting on them again.


Terry Moore

Chairman and Founder, The VC Roundtable




Legion M’s new model presents an exciting new way to take fan engagement to the next level.


Matthew Senreich

Co-creator, Robot Chicken




It's a bold plan...It's like a Bernie Sanders movement in the Entertainment Industry!


Gregg Greenberg

The Street




Being immersed in pop-culture culture for over 25 years, the one constant is the unwavering passion of fans. They buy comics, collectibles, art, t-shirts and toys… for a fan to be able to own an actual piece of the underlying property itself — a true, long-term financial stake in its overall success — is an idea whose time has come. I am thrilled to be part of Legion M and feel confident that this team will marry rad content with financial reward for years to come.


Gaston Dominguez-Letelier

Owner & CEO, Meltdown Comics & Collectibles




Legion M represents a new future for content creators to develop and fund ideas outside of traditional industry models. We couldn’t be more excited about this new frontier of engagement.


Susan Bonds

CEO 42 Entertainment/Animal Repair Shop




Don't miss your opportunity to get involved with this fantastic idea from the very beginning!


Brittany Frederick

Examiner.com




When co-founders Paul & Jeff presented their idea for MobiTV, they were laughed out of meetings. Now, streaming content over a mobile device is as commonplace as carrying your driver's license. Being a part of and covering the entertainment/media world for all of my adult life, I can say that Legion M is another game-changer. A few years down the road, major film and television studios will be saying "Why didn't we get in on this?"


Henry San Miguel

The Geek Speak Show




[Legion M] is actively forming alliances with top Hollywood talents who have helped shape pop culture across multiple different platforms, including TV, comics, film, animation and immersive experiences.


Midori Yoshimura

Crowdfund Insider




[The Founders] are veterans of uncharted entertainment frontiers as their company MobiTV was an early innovator in bringing television to mobile platforms.


Erika Amaya

Bleeding Cool




This is an idea who's time has come. I've invested in Paul and Jeff before, and am thrilled to be an early investor in Legion M. Not only is fan-owned entertainment a revolutionary idea, I know that Paul, Jeff and the Legion M team are the ones to pull it off!

Michael Xenakis
Managing Director EMEA, OpenTable Inc.




Legion M is more than a fan-owned entertainment company.  It is a movement.  I've invested in Paul and Jeff before, and know they have the integrity and know-how to make this work. I am an early investor because I believe in the team and I believe in the idea.  Legion M and its fans will be a great addition to Hollywood, and I have full confidence that my investment will be both financially and emotionally rewarding.

How Legion M Plans to Take Down the Hollywood Studios 
April 19, 2016
Legion M intends to be the world's first fan-owned entertainment company. Jeff Annison, president and co-founder of Legion M, says Hollywood studios have been imposing their wills on the audience for too long. 'Our competitive advantage is that we already have fans attached to the project,' said Annison.

LAUNCH DAY: LEGION M ORIGIN STORY






WHAT IS LEGION M?






PLEASE WATCH BEFORE INVESTING








Read the entire LA Times article


"I invest in big ideas, and Legion M is as big as they come. Successful media companies are often measured in billions of dollars, and I believe this has potential to be one of the greats. I’ve invested in Paul and Jeff before and I’m betting on them again."


Terry Moore
Chairman VC RoundTable, Investor in Legion M








INVEST IN THE FUTURE OF ENTERTAINMENT
This isn't a Kickstarter project. When you invest in Legion M you aren't buying a DVD, you're buying stock in the company.





HOW DOES LEGION M MAKE MONEY?


Legion M partners with creators -- from independent filmmakers to big Hollywood studios -- to produce movies, TV shows, VR experiences and more.  We provide development support, financial backing, marketing muscle and, most importantly, fan engagement and monetization.

We're using proven business models for content production and adding a twist that gives us a competitive advantage. That's because getting fans involved in projects makes those projects more likely to succeed when they are released. 

Whether you're a producer pitching a show to a TV network, a studio trying to drive audience to the theater, or an up-and-coming Youtuber trying to break out of the basement, having a legion of fans behind you can mean the difference between success and failure. The power of Legion M is the Legion. The bigger the we get, the more valuable we become.
        


WHAT SORT OF RETURN CAN I EXPECT?
As with any investment, it's impossible to say what will happen in the future. But we can tell you what we hope to achieve. Entertainment is a massive $800 billion/year  (and growing) global industry. We believe Legion M is the sort of idea that can transform it. 

You are buying in at a $15.4MM pre-money valuation. The media companies we aspire to become (e.g. Legendary Entertainment, Vice Media, Maker Studios) are generally valued in billions. If we are successful, there is a LOT of upside.

The stock you are buying has the exact same financial terms as the founders. We're all in this together -- we only make money if you make money. We're swinging for the fences, and aiming for a return of 10x - 100x or higher for our investors. And while no one can guarantee success, we're doing everything in our power to make this the best investment you've ever made.





JOIN US


When you invest in a startup, you are investing in a vision. You are LITERALLY creating jobs, altering the course of the future, and making your mark on history. Every great company -- from Walt Disney to Facebook -- started with entrepreneurs and investors who were crazy enough to try something no one else had done before.

We believe fan-owned entertainment is an idea that's time has come. We're investing our time, money, blood, sweat, and tears to build something truly revolutionary. If you share our vision, please join the legion and help make it a reality!

Current Projects

      When you invest in Legion M you're not just backing a single project, you are investing in an entire slate. By diversifying across different genres, mediums (i.e. TV vs. Movies), and risk profiles (i.e. high risk early-stage vs. low risk late-stage), we're building a company designed to stand the test of time. Below are some of the projects we have in active development.








Colossal

                Legion M is teaming up with NEON's Tim League and Tom Quinn to help bring Nacho Vigalondo’s wildly imaginative film COLOSSAL to market. Starring Anne Hathaway and Jason Sudeikis, COLOSSAL invades theaters this spring. Read more about Colossal.



ICONS: Face-to-Face

                In January of 2017, Legion M filmed the pilot episode of the ICONS series featuring the legendary Stan Lee. ICONS is a first-of-its-kind virtual reality interview series that allows fans to stand face to face with the luminaries, titans and leaders of our time. Read more about ICONS.










The Field Guide to Evil

               Legion M joins Christos V. Konstantakopoulos (“Before Midnight,” “The Lobster”), and Keith and Jess Calder (“Anomalisa,” “Blair Witch,” “You’re Next”) as executive producers of "Field Guide to Evil", the highly anticipated follow-up from the creators of the cult classic ABCs of Death series. Read more about The Field Guide to Evil.






Legion M Pitch Elevator

               Last fall, Legion M built a full-size elevator set on the floor of Stan Lee's Los Angeles Comic Con. Guests were invited to step inside and give a 2 minute pitch for a film, TV, or VR experience, competing for a chance to win a development deal. Today, Legion M is using this concept as the basis for an unscripted TV or Web Series. Read more about Pitch Elevator.





Fans of the World Unite!

        For most companies, investors are simply a source of funding. For Legion M, they are the source of our power. The bigger we get, the more powerful we become.

Our long term goal is one million investors. In fact our logo is built around the Roman numeral for one million. If we meet that goal, our company will have hundreds of millions of dollars to invest in projects and, more importantly, one million people invested in their success. That could make us one of the most influential companies in Hollywood.

A LETTER FROM THE FOUNDERS TO PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS


-- This letter was filed with the SEC on Tuesday March 14th, 2017 as part of our offering statement. The statement, which has been qualified by the SEC, includes detailed information about the company, the founders, the business plan, as well as financial statements through December 31, 2016. If you'd like to review the circular, please click here and you will be redirected to the appropriate section of the SEC's website. --

Thank you for considering an investment in Legion M! We couldn’t be more excited about the opportunity in front of us, and are thrilled that you are considering joining us. Before you get into the offering circular, there are a couple things we want to mention. 
Legion M is not a conventional company. We don’t intend to become one. 

Most of this offering circular describes Legion M in conventional business terms. In fact, the whole purpose of this document is to provide a convention for you to evaluate our company and make an informed investment decision. But there are elements of Legion M that defy convention, and we want to take a moment to explain them in our own words.
Risk vs. Reward
Before you invest, it’s important to understand that Legion M is a very early stage company. In fact, thanks to the JOBS Act you now have the opportunity to invest earlier than has ever been possible, at a stage traditionally reserved for angel investors and venture capitalists.

If you want to get in early, you need to understand the risks. As an early stage company, we don’t yet have established customers or revenue streams, and we have very little operating history for you to review. Startups are an inherently risky investment--statistically speaking, most of them fail. 

But those that succeed often go on to change the world. Every great company — from Walt Disney Pictures to Apple Computer — started with entrepreneurs and investors who had the courage to defy the odds and try something no one else had done before.

We believe Legion M is one of those companies. We’ve beaten the odds before (1), and believe we can do it again. As a rule, you should never invest more than you can bear to lose in a startup company. But if you’ve got a little extra and want to swing for the fences, we’d love for you to join us. We’re betting our money, reputations, and careers that we can make this company a success. 
One Million Fans
Legion M is, to our knowledge, the first company built from the ground up to be owned by fans. We’re building it that way because we believe a media company owned by fans has a fundamental competitive advantage over those owned by Wall Street or corporate conglomerates. In fact, our logo (the M with a bar over it, which is the Roman numeral for one million) represents our long-term goal of having one million shareholders join our company. We believe that by uniting one million fans, we can change the world for good.

That’s because fans hold all the power in the entertainment industry. After all, we’re the ones that buy the tickets, pay the monthly subscriptions, and decide what to watch. As individuals, we are simply consumers. But when we stand together, we have the power to revolutionize the way content is made. 
Redefining ROI
Most companies view investors simply as a source of capital. For Legion M, our investors are the foundation of our business. We are a community as much as we are a corporation. 

As a management team, our job is to create value for this community. While conventional companies define shareholder value solely by dollars and cents, our definition goes one step farther:

Financial ROI
Legion M’s primary goal is to run a responsible business that earns money and increases our share price. People are investing hard-earned dollars, and our job is to give them a return. Financial success is the key to the long-term viability of our company--the more successful we are, the more great things we can do.
Emotional ROI
While financial success is the primary goal for Legion M, we believe there is more to life than money. In addition to financial return, we strive to give our investors an EMOTIONAL return for owning a piece of our company. We work hard to cultivate a vibrant community for our shareholders, look for interesting ways to take them behind the scenes with our projects, and strive to create new and exciting opportunities to be a part of the entertainment industry.
Putting an M-shaped Dent in the Universe
We are shooting for the stars with Legion M. What we’re doing has never been done before. We know it won’t be easy, but things worth doing rarely are. While we can’t guarantee the company will be successful (nobody can promise that), we can guarantee that we’ll do everything in our power to make this the best investment you’ve ever made.

So THANK YOU again for considering our company. Please review the information in this circular. If you like what you see, we’d be honored for you to join our cause. If you don’t, that’s fine too. And If you’re not sure, please join the Legion as a free member (2), so you can see for yourself what we’re all about. 
Onward and Upward,
Paul Scanlan and Jeff Annison

Details

 Expand all



                  Can I make money from this?
                  



That’s the whole point! This is completely different than Kickstarter or Indiegogo, where you donate in exchange for a reward, perk or pre-sale of the product. When you invest in Legion M, you are buying stock in the company. Our job is to make the value of that stock go up!




                  How does Legion M make money?
                  



We’re taking a proven business model (content production) and adding a twist that gives us a competitive advantage: fan ownership! Hollywood is fiercely competitive, but there is money to be made if you are successful… especially if you are working with people that have a track record of success.




                  Will Legion M pay dividends?
                  



Not in the foreseeable future. As an early stage company, all revenue from projects will go back into the business, allowing us to invest in more projects and to continue growing the value of the company overall.




                  Do you offer perks?
                  



Your investment level doesn’t “buy” you perks.  After all, people who invest in Apple don’t get free iPhones!  Giving away perks like that dilutes our ability to make our projects successful.  Instead, we offer something much better… a chance to peek behind the curtain, become part of a community, participate in fun events and help steer a media company to success!




                  Are there other benefits to investing?
                  



Absolutely! As a Legion M shareholder, you get to come along for the ride as we work with top Hollywood creators to release exciting new projects. You’ll get invites to shareholder-only online hangouts with the cast and crew, live-streamed tours of the set, invites to exclusive shareholder meetings, and all sorts of stuff like that.




                  Aren’t you afraid of having too many cooks in the kitchen?
                  



Just because we bring you behind the scenes doesn’t mean you get to call the shots. Great art isn’t made by committee--it’s made by empowering great artists (and then getting out of their way!). A lot of creators gets excited about working with us to find fun ways to engage with fans, but ultimately, we leave all the creative decisions to the creators.




                  Why hasn't anyone done this before?
                  



Recent changes to securities law (the JOBS Act) have opened the door for the public to invest in early stage ventures like Legion M. Before then, only “accredited investors” (i.e. the wealthiest 3% of the population) were legally allowed to invest in companies like Legion M. Now, we’reopening the gates of Hollywood for the rest of us!




                  Do I get to pick the projects my investment goes toward?
                  



No, and there is good reason for that. Hollywood is a hit-driven business, which means that it’s very risky to back any single project. Legion M is working with our creative allies to build a diversified slate of projects. Some may fail, but others will likely succeed, and the money we make from the hits will allow us to fund a new batch. In that way, we're really no different from how Hollywood studios operate because we'll spread the risk around to ensure Legion M can keep doing this for a long time.




                  What is Legion M’s competitive advantage?
                  



Our competitive advantage is our community. As of this writing, we have over 3100 investors and 8500 members!  By allowing people to own equity and come along for the ride, we’re building a legion of fans that are financially and emotionally invested in our projects' success. That’s a huge advantage when it comes to things like marketing, monetization, distribution, etc.

If you think about it, fans hold all the power in the entertainment industry. We buy the tickets, pay the subscriptions, and decide what to watch. Individually we’re just consumers, but when we band together we have the power to change Hollywood for good!




                  I want to invest, is next month going to be too late?
                  



All we can guarantee is that the Reg. A+ round will be open until it sells out, or for 12 months, whichever comes first.  Keep in mind that the valuation for the company will be changing periodically throughout this round, so the earlier you invest, the lower the valuation and the lower the per share price!




                  Why are you doing a Regulation A+ fundraise?
                  



It’s the next logical step in our company’s evolution.  We believe equity crowfunding is a terrific way to finance a media company because the more investors we have, the more fans we have --- a built-in fan base for all of our projects!

When we launched in March of 2016, we had no idea if fans would want to co-own an entertainment company like this.  Our Title III round was record-setting and massively oversubscribed with demand from our fans for more. Our fans are our secret superpower, and this is the first entertainment company to allow fans in on the very GROUND FLOOR. Regulation A+ of the “Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act” or JOBS Act allows us to raise up to $50MM per calendar year.




                  The minimum investment is $100, but shares are $7.47 each. Will I own a fraction of a share if I invest the minimum?
                  



We don't sell fractional shares, so if you invested $100 you would get 13 shares ($97.11) and a $2.89 refund. It's a little screwy, but at the moment it's just the way the platform is set up. I'm sure Wefunder will change that at some point.




                  As an investor, will I get a credit in our projects?
                  



As you probably know, movie and TV credits can be quite tricky--especially when you are working with lots of other partners.  We love the idea of investor credits! To that end, we created the Legion M photo mosaic which has pictures of our awesome investors and is part of our production company card… if you submit your photos to our mosaic project, you will be in pictures! Legion members who work or volunteer on our projects get credits for doing the actual work, and when we produce our own projects, we’ll work hard to find a way to include Legion investors as part of the credits – we just can’t guarantee it!




                  What do I do if I want to increase the amount of my initial investment?
                  



It’s easy peasy lemon squeezy!  If you invested in this Reg. A round, you can change your investment anytime as long as this Reg. A round is open. To do so, log in to Wefunder with your account details and go back to our page at www.wefunder.com/legionm, on that page, the invest button should now be replaced with an "Edit Investment" button near the top of the page over the photo. From there, I think you can just follow the steps.




                  What is a "subscription agreement?”  Will the same amount invested be withdrawn from my bank account every month or something like that?
                  



A subscription agreement is the legal contract between you and Legion M to buy the shares.  We don’t know why it’s called that, but this is the legal term for it -- rest assured, this is a one-time purchase, and no recurring payments will be withdrawn from your account.



                  What's the Exit Plan?
                  



Legion M is focused on creating shareholder value, and because we raised funds through a previous Title III and this Reg A+ round, we have, in a sense, already had a mini-IPO because the stock will be tradable once Reg A+ closes and secondary markets come online. As we create value in the company, share price should increase, and shareholders will be able to sell their stock and exit as they please. Our goal is to keep growing Legion M long into the future.



                  How are you able to offer liquidity without being publicly listed on a stock exchange?
                  



Since the JOBS Act is so new, some of this is still being worked out, but there are exchanges being set up as we speak to enable the buying and selling of JOBS Act securities. Once our first round of Reg. A+ stock closes, it becomes liquid so it can legally be sold, traded and transferred. So, while the shares won't be on the NASDAQ or NYSE, they will be tradable and there will be trading platforms supporting it soon!



                  Are we subject to insider trading rules?
                  



You betcha! That’s why we can’t have any private “shareholder only” groups.  We have to include investors who have bought stock in the company and members who have joined for free in all of our communications and activities.



                  What does the "M" stand for in Legion M?
                  



We like Legion because it represents a broad and strong community with a call to action. We are a Legion of fans reshaping the entertainment industry. The M in our logo has a bar over it which is the Roman numeral for 1 million and represents our long-term goal to have 1 million fans as our shareholders. With a Legion of 1 million fans, we can be one of the most influential companies in Hollywood!



                  How do I connect with the Legion M community?
                  



Lots of ways… We have an amazing, private, member-only Facebook group and robust, active forums!  You can connect with us on social media at Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/groups/iamlegionm/, on Twitter @LegionMOfficial or via our forums (sign up at http://legionm.us/forum/).

                  Who else is doing this in Hollywood?
                  



As far as we know, no one… yet!  There are other entertainment companies out there doing Reg. CF raises under Title III of the JOBS Act, but none have the same business model as Legion M and none have initiated a Reg. A+ raise.  We’re totally unique and the first to market with the idea that fans have the power!



                  Wow, Hollywood must really dislike Legion M because it’s such a disruptor!
                  



Hardly!  To our delight, this couldn’t be further from the truth.  Hollywood NEEDS Legion M, and we’ve had a fantastic response from every meeting and introduction, starting with the creative allies that we have in place and evidenced by the fact that we have four high-profile projects officially on our slate, with more to come!  Hollywood studios and creatives see Legion M as a valuable partner, and we believe the best is yet to come with future partnerships and opportunities!



                  How do you select projects?
                  



The criteria we use to select projects boils down to three questions:

(1) Can we make money from it? This isn't kickstarter - we are only interested in projects we feel can provide a financial return for our shareholders.

(2) Is it fun? In addition to financial return, we aim to provide is an emotional return--we want projects where we can engage our shareholders and bring the power of the legion to bear.

(3) Are we making the world a better place? We believe in using the power of the Legion to do good in the world.




                  How can fans help make projects successful?
                  



There is an old saying that "content is king." That saying is true, but before it can become king, it needs to rise above the noise. There is an amazing amount content out there and a lot of it is really good. The difference between financial success and failure often comes down to one simple element: marketing.

That's where the legion comes in. When you have a group of fans that are invested in content--especially emotionally and financially invested like we are at Legion M-- they are willing to get behind it, tell their friends about it, talk about it online, see it on opening day, etc. This is exactly the sort of "word of mouth" advertising that brands are looking for.  If our fans show up when we have a new release, we’ll be unstoppable.




                  Film, TV and VR are very different areas. Does being so diverse harm your ability to focus?
                  



The buzz word is “transmedia.”  That means projects can be developed across formats. Legion M plans to develop, partner and produce strong stories with great characters no matter the format, and we’ll partner with experts in their respective fields to help us produce it. Because we’re building a slate of projects, diversification across mediums allows us to stay nimble and chase after the very best projects.  Our ultimate task is to find ways to monetize our content no matter the format – whether film, TV, VR, merch, games or otherwise. By partnering with experts in all these respective fields, we are in a great position to build trans-media properties that span multiple categories.



                  How can a legion of fans help you find new projects?
                  



Everyone in Hollywood is always looking for the next great property--whether it’s a book, comic book or a creator on YouTube. Having a legion of fans who can help scout and identify up-and-coming voices and storytellers is a huge asset. Most production companies pay staffers to stay on top of all the current trends, but in our case, we have a legion of people excited and incented to tell us about a terrific new book or a funny video we need to watch!



                  How can a legion of fans help in the creative process?
                  



The creators we work with LOVE the idea of fan engagement as long as it's done in the right way. A lot of people think that engaging fans is about democratizing the creative process, but that is completely wrong. You don't make great art by committee, and no creator wants to review arbitrary notes from tens of thousands of people.

That said, there are plenty of ways for fans to get involved and for creators to use the legion as a resource. We have seen several amazing examples of this over the past year.  The first was our initial company trailer. We had two different cuts from two different voice-over artists. Internally, we were split: half of us preferred one, half preferred the other. The solution? We put it out to the Legion. Within 12 hours we had a clear winner, and a huge amount of insight into which version resonated best with different demographics. Ultimately, we ended up ordering both versions of the trailer and now use targeting to get each version in front of the demographics that liked it best!  Other examples include using legion volunteers to staff our booth at Stan Lee’s Los Angeles Comic Con, help shoot and produce our Pitch Elevator TV pilot, and photograph and video the on-set background during our ICONS shoot with Stan Lee and Kevin Smith.  All of these were 100% brought to you by Legion M volunteers and staffers!

We've had discussions with our creative allies about how to involve the Legion, and before we take on any project, that has to be a consideration. Luckily, our allies have dozens of concepts,and the opportunity to get in front of a friendly audience for feedback is hugely powerful. The ability to have fans play a role in what projects we greenlight is also powerful. And the best part is that by making it fun, it becomes a real benefit for all our shareholders!




                  What are some examples of Legion M community initiatives?
                  



Our forums were 100% built by volunteer Legion members.  We put the word out and said, "Hey, does anybody know anything about setting up forums, or is anybody interested in volunteering?" We had 150 volunteers, and we picked a team leader, and she picked the team, so now we have a robust and healthy forum solution that was completely built by volunteers. With months of effort and now they manage it and maintain it!  They are amazing!

We have another initiative with a guy who is creating a collection of short stories called "Tales from the Legion,” which will be written exclusively by members of Legion M. He said, "Hey, there are so many creative people in the Legion. Let's create a book filled with stories from Legion members and investors that we can sell as an e-book or as a hardcover print on-demand book." He's off and running, and it's being sourced 100% from the community.

Also, Legion M had a HUGE presence at the 2016 Stan Lee Los Angeles Comic Con where we staffed an awesome booth, shot a digital TV series and premiered our Pitch Elevator competition – all of which was staffed and run by Legion M member volunteers!  We had a blast meeting our members, working with them and hearing their ideas.  We were the most successful vendor at the Con due to the dedication and enthusiasm of our volunteers and we loved working with all of them!!!




                  How can I let my Legion M flag shine for the world to see?
                  



Lots of ways!  About 12 members across the country have received personalized Legion M license plates and one even got a tattoo!  At your request, we will mail you a welcome packet with some Legion M Swag like stickers and marketing cards, and of course you can buy Legion M t-shirts, hockey jerseys, name badges and pins in our online store:  https://thelegionm.com/store/.  We encourage creativity and are always open to hearing from merchandising partners.  Let us know if you have any ideas!



                  Will Legion M produce my script or hire me as an actor or director?
                  



Whenever possible, we'll give priority to the legion community when it comes to sourcing and staffing projects. We have a submission page on our website at (www.thelegionm.com/submissions) if you want to be added to the list when we open our doors for script submissions. There are thousands of people on thatlist already, so there is a LOT of competition! We also have a job board in our forums for members to post staffing/casting needs as our projects (or even other people’s projects) ramp up.  We obviously can't promise every investor a job or that we will back their projects, but when we can, our ideal will be to work within our community.

We also periodically have events and contests which give you the opportunity to submit your ideas!  Pitch Elevator was one opportunity we launched Fall of 2016, where the winner's idea will get a development deal with Legion M, and we’ll have an open call for narrative prose stories for the short story collection book "Tales From the Legion" spring 2017.




                  How much do we need to raise in the Reg. A to be successful?
                  



It’s really less about the money we raise and more about the number of people and shareholders we can get onboard. Our first goal will be to raise $1-2MM which will ensure that we'll be in business for the next couple of years and really be able to make a run at this. Once we raise that, we’ll try to raise a couple million more, taking one step at a time as we march toward the ultimate long-term goal of having a million shareholders.



                  What was MobiTV?
                  



We (co-founders Paul Scanlan and Jeff Annison) along with another friend of ours(Phillip Alvelda), cofounded MobiTV. In 2003 we were the first company in the US (and pretty much the entire world) to launch live television on your cellphone.

At the time, we were almost laughed out of Hollywood. People told us--and we are not exaggerating here--that it was the dumbest idea they had ever heard… "Nobody is ever going to watch television on their cell phone."

Now in fairness to them, this was 2003. The screens were really small, and the video quality was very poor by today's standards. It was years before the iPhone--even before the Razr. We were working on some of the very first phones with colorscreens.

Also, at the time, the ONLY place people watched TV was in the living room. It seems crazy to think about it now, but most people thought there wasn't any demand for television outside the living room.

Yet when we launched, it took off like wildfire. Over the last 13 years, it has been the fastest-growing part of the entertainment industry. In fact, we had such an impact, we were awarded a Primetime Emmy Award for our contributions to the television industry. We grew those services to over 20 million paying subscribers around the world, and the company is still going strong today.  Chances are, if you have watched TV on your AT&T, Sprint or T-Mobile device, it was powered by MobiTV. We pioneered that whole space. We were even the first to do live TV on the iPhone, not to mention the first to do March Madness, World Cup, NFL, NBA, Olympics and more.




                  What is pre-money valuation, and how does Legion M calculate it?
                  



The pre-money valuation is effectively the price at which you are buying into the company. Over time, if we're successful, this value will grow.

If you take the company's valuation and divide it by the number of outstanding shares, it gives you the value of each share. Conversely, if you take the number of outstanding shares and multiply it by the share price, you end up with valuation--the same way you'd calculate market cap for a public company.

Legion M is different then most early stage companies in that we don't have any financial preferences amongst our shareholders. Our two classes of stock have different voting rights, but financially they are equivalent. That means all of us -- the founders, insiders, and every single one of our investors -- have the EXACT SAME TERMS. We're all in the same boat; none of us wins unless all of us win.

When we calculate our pre-money valuation, we include all issued shares, options and warrants - even those that have not yet vested or been exercised. However, unlike most VC deals, we do NOT include stock options that have not yet been issued (i.e. the option pool). That's because when we issue stock options, the strike price is the current market price. This is very different than VC deals, where options are typically issued for pennies on the dollar due to the price difference between common and preferred. In a VC deal the option pool represents pure dilution for investors. In our case, it simply represents a potential future sale at the current market price.

Legion M works with top Hollywood creators to bring boldly original movies, TV and VR to market. We're also the first media company in history built from the ground up to be owned by...YOU! 

















































 















Why?
 







Why?
 



We believe the next great media company should be owned by FANS. Not because it's a fun idea (well, that's not the ONLY reason), but because it's an extremely powerful business model. After all, FANS buy the tickets, pay the subscription fees, and decide what to watch. As individuals, we're just consumers... But when we band together, we can change the world.













ONE MILLION FANS
 







ONE MILLION FANS
 



Legion M's long-term goal is to unite 1 million fans as shareholders of the company. If we achieve that, we'll have hundreds of millions of dollars to develop projects, with a million people standing behind them when they release.That could make us one of the most influential companies in Hollywood.










HISTORY IN THE MAKING
 







HISTORY IN THE MAKING
 



Legion M launched in 2016 with an oversubscribed investment round that made JOBS Act history. Today, we have an amazing community of over 12,000 people, a proven team, and a kick-ass first slate of projects!And we're just getting started...
