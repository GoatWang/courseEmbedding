J. Michael Hannon founded HANNON LAW GROUP in May of 2006 to expand the range of legal resources available to his clients. He is an experienced trial and appellate attorney, litigating cases in the areas of professional liability, criminal conduct, serious personal injury, business disputes, estate disputes, and employment.Michael began his legal career as an Assistant United States Attorney for the District of Columbia from 1981 to 1988, investigating and prosecuting violent and white collar offenders. He was promoted to the Special Prosecutions Section where he was responsible for the investigation and prosecution of racketeering, international fraud, and terrorism. From 1972 to 1980, he was a high school English teacher and swimming coach in Montgomery County, Maryland.Before founding HANNON LAW GROUP, Michael was a Partner with Thompson O'Donnell, LLP, for 18 years. During that time, he argued the first appeal before the United States Supreme Court from the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims in October of 1994. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in favor of his veteran client, overturning a 70-year practice by the Department of Veterans Affairs denying compensation to medically injured veterans.In 2005, Michael was selected to the Panel of Counsel for the Fraternal Order of Police Legal Plan. Through that plan and otherwise, Michael represents local and federal law enforcement officers in defense of employment actions, civil lawsuits, and criminal investigations. Michael is a member of the American Foreign Service Officers Association select Panel of Counsel. He represents Foreign Service Officers in a host of matters both domestic and international in scope, and occasionally contributes to the Foreign Service Journal.EducationGonzaga High School - 1968Princeton University - B.A., 1972University of Michigan - M.A. American Studies, 1976Catholic University of America, Columbus School of Law - J.D., 1980Bar MembershipsDistrict of ColumbiaMarylandUnited States Supreme CourtUnited States District Court for the District of ColumbiaUnited States District Court for MarylandUnited States Courts of Appeals for the District of Columbia CircuitUnited States Courts of Appeals for the Fourth CircuitUnited States Courts of Appeals for the Ninth CircuitUnited States Courts of Appeals for the Federal CircuitUnited States Courts of Appeals for Veterans ClaimsProfessional AffiliationsDistrict of Columbia Bar, MemberBar Association of the District of Columbia, MemberMaryland State Bar Association, MemberAmerican Bar Association, Member of the White Collar Crime and Grand Jury subcommitteesNational Association of Assistant United States Attorneys, MemberNational Employment Lawyers Association, MemberMetropolitan Washington Employment Lawyers Association, MemberThe Barristers, MemberThe Lawyers Club, MemberThe Counselors, former PresidentThurgood Marshall Inn of Court, Catholic University, Columbus School of Law, Counselor and MasterFormer state representative for the District of Columbia, Steering Committee for the October 2003 Annual Convention for Defense Research Institute

Michael J. Hannon










Hello! I am a Bader Postdoctoral Fellow at Queen's University. This August I'll start my new role as Deputy Director of the Institute of Philosophy at the University of London. Previously, I was a postdoc on the Varieties of Understanding project (2013-16) at Fordham University in New York City. I received my MPhil and PhD at the University of Cambridge (King's College). Epistemology (esp. social epistemology) is the main area of my research, but I also work in ethics, cognitive science, and the philosophy of language. I am especially interested in the value of knowledge and how epistemic language (e.g., 'knows', 'understands', 'rational') contributes to human cooperation, survival, and flourishing. Currently, I am writing a book on this topic titled What's the Point of Knowledge?

Beyond research, I am also passionate about teaching. You can find past students’ evaluations here.In 2015, I was also one of four Young Philosophers selected to give talks at De Pauw University.UPCOMING TALKS- Canadian Philosophical Association, May 28-31, 2017.- Bled Philosophical Conference on Epistemic Virtues and Epistemic Skills, June 5-9, 2017. - European Congress for Analytic Philosophy, Munich, Aug 21-26, 2017. - New Trends in Epistemology, Hamburg, Oct 5-7, 2017. - American Philosophical Association, Eastern Division, Jan 2018.
