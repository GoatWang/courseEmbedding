 Your Mid-Year Commodities Update 
 



 


Tuesday, July 18, 2017 - 12:00am
by Nathan Slaughter








 
 Well, we're just past the midway point of the year. And if nothing changes over the next six months, 2017 will go down as a pretty good year for U.S. stocks. Through June 30, the benchmark S&P 500 had already delivered a return of 10.5%. 
If it holds, that would be the strongest performance since 2013. 
Unfortunately, if you don't hold a handful of large-cap tech stocks, then you probably aren't doing quite as well. You know the ones I'm referring to: Facebook (NYSE: FB), Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN), Netflix (Nasdaq: NFLX) and Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOG), previously known as Google.
---Recommended Link---
The U.S. Government Gave You A Gift
			I know it sounds incredible, but the IRS offers a retirement program that lets you opt-out of the tax system completely. Apply it in a specific way and it can triple your cash flow in retirement. Roger N. made the move and now collects $10,000 a month. He says "It doesn't get any better..." As long as you are a U.S. citizen with a retirement account, you can make the same move. Here is what you need to do right now. 
At the time of this writing, these four giants have posted year-to-date gains of 38.1%, 34.1%, 28.1%, and 22.2%, respectively. And they have a combined market capitalization of $1.6 trillion -- more than the entire value of some foreign markets. That heft exaggerates their influence on cap-weighted indexes. 

Take them out, and the market isn't looking so hot. In fact, 819 of the 2,115 stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange have actually lost money so far this year. Another 207 are sitting on tepid gains between 0% and 5%. That means about half the market has done little to nothing this year, or worse. 






Most of the winners have been grouped in the technology, healthcare and consumer cyclical sectors. Unfortunately, commodities haven't been pulling their weight. In fact, energy has been the market's worst performing group this year. 
We see that reflected in the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE). The fund, which holds a mix of oil & gas producers such as Chevron and Exxon Mobil, has declined 13.6% since the start of the year. And it hasn't been much better for the S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE: XME), which tracks a basket of coal, aluminum, copper and precious metals stocks. 
As of today, 17 of the fund's top 25 holdings are underwater. One of the exceptions, however, is one of our own holding in Scarcity & Real Wealth: Allegheny Technologies (NYSE: ATI). The company has just made a bold leap into an exciting new field, and I expect more good things to come down the road (more on that in my newsletter). 
Despite these headwinds, I'm proud to see our model portfolio value outperform our closest benchmark, the VanEck Natural Resources ETF (NYSE: HAP). And we've achieved this despite the fact that half of the portfolio is in cash.
I've been cautiously slow in putting this cash to work, in part because the macro outlook hasn't exactly painted a bullish picture for most resource groups. But the cheaper these stocks get, the more I can buy with my model portfolio's $87,000 cash position.
I want to continue to add high-quality "Picks and Shovels" stocks to my portfolio. These stocks aren't as sensitive to commodity prices and can produce gains in any environment. It's been a productive first half, and I'm excited about the opportunities for even bigger gains between now and December.
Editor's Note: Nathan's point about "picks and shovels" here is key. By focusing on companies that provide the equipment (and other expertise) necessary for producers to get resources out of the ground, Nathan and his readers end up owning companies that hold up better during the lean times for commodities, partly because they are diversified into other businesses. And when things pick up, well, even better.
In Scarcity & Real Wealth, Nathan brings you his best picks across the entire natural resources spectrum, regardless of market cap or geography. One month, the biggest investment potential may lie in a mega-cap miner in Australia that's about to benefit from a surge in metal demand from China. 
All of Nathan's picks are traded in the United States, making these explosive opportunities readily accessible to investors in North America and elsewhere.
To learn more about the "picks and shovels" companies Nathan is focusing on right now, go here.

Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (ATI  -  Free Report)	 is scheduled to release second-quarter 2017 results before the market opens on Jul 25.The company reported net earnings of 16 cents per share in the previous quarter, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 11 cents. Revenues for the quarter rose 14.3% year over year to $865.9 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $850.5 million.Alleghany beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, while missing in one, with an average positive surprise of 16.08%.Let’s see how things have shaped up for the forthcoming announcement.Allegheny Technologies Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Allegheny Technologies Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Allegheny Technologies Incorporated QuoteFactors at PlayLast month, Alleghany provided its guidance for second-quarter 2017. The diversified specialty materials producer expects earnings in the band of 4–9 cents per share and revenues in the range of $865–$890 million for the quarter. The company also expects corporate and closed operations expenses to increase roughly $10 million on a sequential comparison basis in the second quarter.  Alleghany has made tremendous progress in restructuring and repositioning its Flat Rolled Products (FRP) business but remains cautious in the short term due to falling raw material costs, primarily nickel and ferrochrome.The company said that considerable decline in the prices of raw materials unfavorably impacted transaction prices and surcharges, resulting in the FRP unit being at or near breakeven in the second quarter. Furthermore, it expects the performance of the High Performance Materials and Components segment to improve in the quarter with sequentially higher operating margin.The company also said that cash generation from operations remains a key focus as it continues to manage working capital requirements carefully. Alleghany remains exposed to certain challenges in its core FRP segment. Challenging conditions across certain key end-use markets including oil & gas are weighing on the prospects of the FRP unit. Demand for the company’s products in the oil and gas market is expected to remain under pressure given the low oil price environment.Allegheny’s shares dipped 0.9% over the past three months, compared with the industry’s 0.8% decline.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Allegheny is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below:Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Allegheny is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 7 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Allegheny currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies in the basic materials space that you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (AEM  -  Free Report)	 has an Earnings ESP of +13.33% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK  -  Free Report)	 has an Earnings ESP of +5.04% and a Zacks Rank #1.The Chemours Company (CC  -  Free Report)	 has an Earnings ESP of +4.44% and a Zacks Rank #2.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

Current operations[edit]
ATI produces titanium and titanium alloys, nickel-based alloys and superalloys, grain-oriented electrical steel, stainless and specialty steels, zirconium, hafnium, and niobium, tungsten materials, forgings and castings.[1]
ATI's key markets are aerospace and defense particularly commercial jet engines (over 50% of sales), oil & gas, chemical process industry, electrical energy, and medical.[1]
The company organizes its products into 2 segments:[1]

High Performance Materials & Components, which includes titanium-based alloys, nickel-based alloys and superalloys, zirconium and hafnium.
Flat Rolled Products, which includes titanium and titanium alloys, nickel-based alloys, specialty alloys, duplex alloys in sheet, strip, and plate form, grain-oriented electrical steel.

Facilities[edit]




Midland Works


Allegheny Technologies is headquartered in Downtown Pittsburgh at Six PPG Place. Steel mill plants throughout Western Pennsylvania include facilities in Harrison Township (Allegheny Ludlum's Brackenridge Works), Vandergrift, and Washington. The company also has plants in: Illinois; Indiana; Ohio; Kentucky; California; South Carolina; Oregon; Alabama; Texas; Connecticut; Massachusetts; North Carolina; Wisconsin; Shanghai, China; and several facilities in Europe.[2]
History[edit]
In 1939, the merger of Allegheny Steel of Pittsburgh and Ludlum Steel of Watervliet, New York created Allegheny Ludlum Corporation; the merged company represented the manufacturers of steel for New York's Chrysler Building and Empire State Building and for the Model A Ford.
Through the 1970s, Allegheny Ludlum periodically cooperated with Ford to build several one-off promotional cars with stainless steel bodies. Three such cars are on display in the Crawford Auto-Aviation Museum.[3]
In 1987, Allegheny Ludlum became a public company via an initial public offering.[4]
In 1994, the company acquired Jessop Steel.
In 1996, it merged with Teledyne to form Allegheny Technologies.[4] The company then spun off several subsidiaries as independent public companies such as Teledyne Technologies and WaterPik Technologies in 1999, to concentrate on its core business of metal and alloy production.[4]
In 1998, the company acquired the assets of Lukens Washington Steel[5]
In 2004, the company acquired J&L Specialty Steel[6]
In 2005, the company sold its World Minerals subsidiary to French company Imerys.[7]
In 2010, the company acquired Ladish Co.[8]
Allegheny Technologies debuted its ATI 425 Titanium Alloy on June 14, 2010, at the land and air-land defense and security exhibition Eurosatory in Paris, France.[9] The ATI 425 Titanium Alloy is developed and provided by ATI for markets that include aerospace, defense, industrial, medical and recreation.
Controversies[edit]
Environmental record[edit]
Allegheny Ludlum's Natrona, Pennsylvania and Brackenridge, Pennsylvania plants contributed to the waste at the ALSCO Park Lindane Dump—an EPA Superfund site. These plants also released chromium into the air, which adversely affected air quality at schools in the Highlands School District.[10]
In 2005, Allegheny Ludlum agreed to pay a $2,375,000 penalty to settle a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 1995, which alleged that the company had unlawfully discharged oil and other pollutants, such as chromium, zinc, copper, and nickel, into the Allegheny River and Kiskiminetas River in the suburbs of Pittsburgh.[11]

Facilities[edit]




Midland Works


Allegheny Technologies is headquartered in Downtown Pittsburgh at Six PPG Place. Steel mill plants throughout Western Pennsylvania include facilities in Harrison Township (Allegheny Ludlum's Brackenridge Works), Vandergrift, and Washington. The company also has plants in: Illinois; Indiana; Ohio; Kentucky; California; South Carolina; Oregon; Alabama; Texas; Connecticut; Massachusetts; North Carolina; Wisconsin; Shanghai, China; and several facilities in Europe.[2]
History[edit]
In 1939, the merger of Allegheny Steel of Pittsburgh and Ludlum Steel of Watervliet, New York created Allegheny Ludlum Corporation; the merged company represented the manufacturers of steel for New York's Chrysler Building and Empire State Building and for the Model A Ford.
Through the 1970s, Allegheny Ludlum periodically cooperated with Ford to build several one-off promotional cars with stainless steel bodies. Three such cars are on display in the Crawford Auto-Aviation Museum.[3]
In 1987, Allegheny Ludlum became a public company via an initial public offering.[4]
In 1994, the company acquired Jessop Steel.
In 1996, it merged with Teledyne to form Allegheny Technologies.[4] The company then spun off several subsidiaries as independent public companies such as Teledyne Technologies and WaterPik Technologies in 1999, to concentrate on its core business of metal and alloy production.[4]
In 1998, the company acquired the assets of Lukens Washington Steel[5]
In 2004, the company acquired J&L Specialty Steel[6]
In 2005, the company sold its World Minerals subsidiary to French company Imerys.[7]
In 2010, the company acquired Ladish Co.[8]
Allegheny Technologies debuted its ATI 425 Titanium Alloy on June 14, 2010, at the land and air-land defense and security exhibition Eurosatory in Paris, France.[9] The ATI 425 Titanium Alloy is developed and provided by ATI for markets that include aerospace, defense, industrial, medical and recreation.
Controversies[edit]
Environmental record[edit]
Allegheny Ludlum's Natrona, Pennsylvania and Brackenridge, Pennsylvania plants contributed to the waste at the ALSCO Park Lindane Dump—an EPA Superfund site. These plants also released chromium into the air, which adversely affected air quality at schools in the Highlands School District.[10]
In 2005, Allegheny Ludlum agreed to pay a $2,375,000 penalty to settle a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 1995, which alleged that the company had unlawfully discharged oil and other pollutants, such as chromium, zinc, copper, and nickel, into the Allegheny River and Kiskiminetas River in the suburbs of Pittsburgh.[11]

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

Facilities[edit]




Midland Works


Allegheny Technologies is headquartered in Downtown Pittsburgh at Six PPG Place. Steel mill plants throughout Western Pennsylvania include facilities in Harrison Township (Allegheny Ludlum's Brackenridge Works), Vandergrift, and Washington. The company also has plants in: Illinois; Indiana; Ohio; Kentucky; California; South Carolina; Oregon; Alabama; Texas; Connecticut; Massachusetts; North Carolina; Wisconsin; Shanghai, China; and several facilities in Europe.[2]
History[edit]
In 1939, the merger of Allegheny Steel of Pittsburgh and Ludlum Steel of Watervliet, New York created Allegheny Ludlum Corporation; the merged company represented the manufacturers of steel for New York's Chrysler Building and Empire State Building and for the Model A Ford.
Through the 1970s, Allegheny Ludlum periodically cooperated with Ford to build several one-off promotional cars with stainless steel bodies. Three such cars are on display in the Crawford Auto-Aviation Museum.[3]
In 1987, Allegheny Ludlum became a public company via an initial public offering.[4]
In 1994, the company acquired Jessop Steel.
In 1996, it merged with Teledyne to form Allegheny Technologies.[4] The company then spun off several subsidiaries as independent public companies such as Teledyne Technologies and WaterPik Technologies in 1999, to concentrate on its core business of metal and alloy production.[4]
In 1998, the company acquired the assets of Lukens Washington Steel[5]
In 2004, the company acquired J&L Specialty Steel[6]
In 2005, the company sold its World Minerals subsidiary to French company Imerys.[7]
In 2010, the company acquired Ladish Co.[8]
Allegheny Technologies debuted its ATI 425 Titanium Alloy on June 14, 2010, at the land and air-land defense and security exhibition Eurosatory in Paris, France.[9] The ATI 425 Titanium Alloy is developed and provided by ATI for markets that include aerospace, defense, industrial, medical and recreation.
Controversies[edit]
Environmental record[edit]
Allegheny Ludlum's Natrona, Pennsylvania and Brackenridge, Pennsylvania plants contributed to the waste at the ALSCO Park Lindane Dump—an EPA Superfund site. These plants also released chromium into the air, which adversely affected air quality at schools in the Highlands School District.[10]
In 2005, Allegheny Ludlum agreed to pay a $2,375,000 penalty to settle a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 1995, which alleged that the company had unlawfully discharged oil and other pollutants, such as chromium, zinc, copper, and nickel, into the Allegheny River and Kiskiminetas River in the suburbs of Pittsburgh.[11]

Facilities[edit]




Midland Works


Allegheny Technologies is headquartered in Downtown Pittsburgh at Six PPG Place. Steel mill plants throughout Western Pennsylvania include facilities in Harrison Township (Allegheny Ludlum's Brackenridge Works), Vandergrift, and Washington. The company also has plants in: Illinois; Indiana; Ohio; Kentucky; California; South Carolina; Oregon; Alabama; Texas; Connecticut; Massachusetts; North Carolina; Wisconsin; Shanghai, China; and several facilities in Europe.[2]
History[edit]
In 1939, the merger of Allegheny Steel of Pittsburgh and Ludlum Steel of Watervliet, New York created Allegheny Ludlum Corporation; the merged company represented the manufacturers of steel for New York's Chrysler Building and Empire State Building and for the Model A Ford.
Through the 1970s, Allegheny Ludlum periodically cooperated with Ford to build several one-off promotional cars with stainless steel bodies. Three such cars are on display in the Crawford Auto-Aviation Museum.[3]
In 1987, Allegheny Ludlum became a public company via an initial public offering.[4]
In 1994, the company acquired Jessop Steel.
In 1996, it merged with Teledyne to form Allegheny Technologies.[4] The company then spun off several subsidiaries as independent public companies such as Teledyne Technologies and WaterPik Technologies in 1999, to concentrate on its core business of metal and alloy production.[4]
In 1998, the company acquired the assets of Lukens Washington Steel[5]
In 2004, the company acquired J&L Specialty Steel[6]
In 2005, the company sold its World Minerals subsidiary to French company Imerys.[7]
In 2010, the company acquired Ladish Co.[8]
Allegheny Technologies debuted its ATI 425 Titanium Alloy on June 14, 2010, at the land and air-land defense and security exhibition Eurosatory in Paris, France.[9] The ATI 425 Titanium Alloy is developed and provided by ATI for markets that include aerospace, defense, industrial, medical and recreation.
Controversies[edit]
Environmental record[edit]
Allegheny Ludlum's Natrona, Pennsylvania and Brackenridge, Pennsylvania plants contributed to the waste at the ALSCO Park Lindane Dump—an EPA Superfund site. These plants also released chromium into the air, which adversely affected air quality at schools in the Highlands School District.[10]
In 2005, Allegheny Ludlum agreed to pay a $2,375,000 penalty to settle a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 1995, which alleged that the company had unlawfully discharged oil and other pollutants, such as chromium, zinc, copper, and nickel, into the Allegheny River and Kiskiminetas River in the suburbs of Pittsburgh.[11]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
