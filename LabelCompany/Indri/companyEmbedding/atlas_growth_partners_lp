 Atlas Growth Partners, L.P.’s Form S-1 For Its Continuous $1 Billion Public Offering Declared 
         










    










 













 











 



















Atlas Growth Partners, L.P.'s Form S-1 For Its Continuous $1 Billion Public Offering Declared Effective
        																																						
              











 News provided by
Atlas Energy Group, LLC

 Share this article




























































PHILADELPHIA, April 5, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Atlas Energy Group, LLC (OTCQX: ATLS) announced today that the registration statement on Form S-1 (Registration Number: 333-207537) filed by its subsidiary, Atlas Growth Partners, L.P. ("AGP" or the "Partnership"), was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on April 5, 2016. ATLS controls the general partner of AGP by indirectly owning 80.01% of the interests in the general partner. 








AGP is offering in the aggregate up to 100,000,000 Class A common units and Class T common units, each representing limited partner interests in AGP, pursuant to a primary offering on a "best efforts" basis. The Partnership must receive minimum offering proceeds of $1.0 million to break escrow, and the maximum offering proceeds of the primary offering may not exceed $1.0 billion. The Class A common units will be sold for a cash purchase price of $10.00 and the Class T common units will be sold for a cash purchase price of $9.60, with the remaining $0.40 constituting the Class T common unitholders' deferred payment obligation to AGP. The Partnership is also offering up to 21,505,376 Class A common units at $9.30 per unit pursuant to a distribution reinvestment plan.
Investors in the primary offering will also receive warrants to purchase a number of additional common units equal to 10.00% of such investor's aggregate purchase of common units at an exercise price equal to the offering price at the time of purchase. 
The offering is subject to market and other conditions, and there can be no assurance as to whether or when the offering may be completed, or as to the ultimate size of the offering. The Partnership intends to use the proceeds from the offering to pay: (i) the costs to acquire oil and gas properties; (ii) the costs to develop, operate and manage its oil and gas properties, including drilling additional oil and gas wells on the properties; (iii) the offering expenses, which include sales commissions, the dealer manager fee, the marketing fee and all other expenses such as legal, accounting, printing, travel and similar amounts related to the offering of the common units; and (iv) potentially to fund a portion of the quarterly distribution to the Partnership's unitholders.
This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.  The offering will be made only by means of a prospectus and any prospectus supplement, if applicable, each of which is part of the effective registration statement filed by the Partnership with the SEC.
Anthem Securities, Inc. (member of FINRA/SIPC), an affiliate of Atlas Energy Group, LLC and AGP, is acting as the dealer manager for the offering. Copies of the prospectus and any prospectus supplement may be obtained from: Anthem Securities, Inc., Park Place Corporate Center One, 1000 Commerce Drive, Suite 410, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15275, or by telephone (412) 262-7430. Electronic copies may also be obtained at no charge at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.
Atlas Growth Partners, L.P. is an energy partnership formed to acquire energy assets in North America, which currently operates in the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas.
Atlas Energy Group, LLC (OTCQX: ATLS) is a limited liability company which owns the following interests: all of the general partner interest, incentive distribution rights and an approximate 23% limited partner interest in its upstream oil & gas subsidiary, Atlas Resource Partners, L.P.; the general partner interests, incentive distribution rights and limited partner interests in Atlas Growth Partners, L.P.; and a general partner interest in Lightfoot Capital Partners, an entity that invests directly in energy-related businesses and assets. For more information, please visit our website at www.atlasenergy.com, or contact Investor Relations at InvestorRelations@atlasenergy.com.
Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained herein.  Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the fact that AGP may not reach the minimum offering amount. The primary risks that could affect actual results include that: AGP may not have sufficient available cash to pay the full target distribution, or any distribution at all, on its common units and there is no guaranty that AGP will pay distributions to its unitholders in any quarter; any distributions from AGP may be a return of capital rather than a return on unitholders' investment; there is no guarantee of return of investment or rate of return of investment because of the speculative nature of drilling of oil and gas wells; holders of AGP's common units have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect its general partner or its board of directors; the common units are not liquid and unitholders' ability to resell AGP's common units will be limited by the absence of a public trading market and substantial transfer restrictions; the fiduciary duties of AGP's general partner's officers and directors may conflict with those they may have to affiliates of its general partner; AGP's tax treatment depends on its status as a partnership for federal and state income tax purposes and if it were to become subject to entity-level taxation for federal or state income tax purposes, taxes paid would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution; and unitholders may owe taxes in excess of the cash distributions from AGP.
All statements, other than historical facts included in this release, that address activities, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future, including such things as AGP's future capital expenditures (including the amount and nature thereof), business strategy and measures to implement strategy, competitive strengths, goals, expansion and growth of AGP's business and operations, plans, market conditions, references to future success, references to intentions as to future matters and other such matters are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof, and ATLS and AGP assume no obligation to update such statements, except as may be required by applicable law.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  BUSINESS OVERVIEW  We are a Delaware limited partnership and an independent developer and producer of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids ("NGL") with operations primarily focused in the Eagle Ford Shale in south Texas. Our general partner, Atlas Growth Partners GP, LLC ("AGP GP") owns 100% of our general partner units (which are entitled to receive 2% of the cash distributed by us without any obligation to make further capital contributions) and all of the incentive distribution rights through which it manages and effectively controls us.  Atlas Energy Group, LLC ("ATLS" or "Atlas Energy"), a publicly traded Delaware limited liability company 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    ATLS, +17.19%

                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                         manages and controls us through its 2.1% limited partner interest in us and 80% member interest in AGP GP. Current and former members of ATLS management own the remaining 20% member interest in AGP GP.  In addition to its general and limited partner interest in us, ATLS also holds a Series A Preferred Share (which entitles it to receive 2% of distributions, subject to potential dilution in the event of future equity interests and to appoint four of seven directors) in Titan Energy, LLC ("Titan"), an independent developer and producer of natural gas, crude oil and NGLs, with operations in basins across the United States, and a general and limited partner interest in Lightfoot Capital Partners, L.P. and Lightfoot Capital Partners GP, LLC, which incubate new MLPs and invest in existing MLPs.  FINANCIAL PRESENTATION  Our consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and the consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 include our accounts and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets and related consolidated statements of operations. Actual balances and results could be different from those estimates. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the consolidation of the financial statements.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  ARP Restructuring and Emergence from Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Proceedings. Atlas Resource Partners, L.P. ("ARP"), was a publicly traded Delaware master-limited partnership in which ATLS held general and limited partner interests. On July 25, 2016, ARP and certain of its subsidiaries and ATLS, solely with respect to certain sections thereof, entered into a restructuring support agreement with ARP's lenders (the "Restructuring Support Agreement") for a prepackaged restructuring that reduced debt on its balance sheet (the "ARP Restructuring"). On July 27, 2016, ARP and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code ("Chapter 11") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. The cases commenced thereby were jointly administered under the caption "In re:  We were not a party to the Restructuring Support Agreement, and the ARP Restructuring did not materially impact us.  The ARP Restructuring did not materially impact ATLS or its ownership interest in us, including ATLS' control of our general partner, AGP GP. The debt structure of ATLS was recently modified, and ATLS was not a party to the ARP Restructuring. ATLS remains controlled by the same ownership group and management team and thus, the ARP Restructuring did not have a material impact on the ability of management to operate us or the other ATLS managed businesses.  Effective Registration Statement. Our Registration Statement on Form S-1 (registration number:333-207537) (our "Form S-1") was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on April 5, 2016. We are offering in the aggregate up to 100,000,000 Class A common units and Class T common units, each representing limited partner interests in us, pursuant to a primary offering on a "best efforts" basis. We must receive minimum offering proceeds of $1.0 million to break escrow, and the maximum offering proceeds of the primary offering may not exceed $1.0 billion. The Class A common units will be sold for a cash purchase price of $10.00 and the Class T common units will be sold for a cash purchase price of $9.60, with the remaining $0.40 constituting the Class T common unitholders' deferred payment obligation to us. We are also offering up to 21,505,376 Class A common units at $9.30 per unit pursuant to a distribution reinvestment plan. Our management recently decided to temporarily suspend our primary offering efforts.  Primary Offering Suspension. On November 2, 2016, management decided to temporarily suspend our current primary offering efforts in light of new regulations and the challenging fund raising environment until such time as market participants have had an opportunity to ascertain the impact of such issues.  Cash Distributions Suspension. On November 2, 2016, our Board of Directors determined to suspend our quarterly common unit distributions, beginning with the three months ended September 30, 2016, in order retain our cash flow and reinvest in our business and assets due to the suspension of our current primary offering.  GENERAL TRENDS AND OUTLOOK  We expect our business to be affected by key trends in natural gas and oil production markets. Our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results.  The natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids commodity price markets have suffered significant declines since the fourth quarter of 2014 through the third quarter of 2016. The causes of these declines are based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, a significant increase in natural gas, oil and NGL production. While we anticipate continued high levels of exploration and production activities over the long-term in the areas in which we operate, fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments in the development of new natural gas, oil and NGL reserves.  Our future gas and oil reserves, production, cash flow, our ability to make payments on our obligations and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders, including ATLS, depend on our success in producing our current reserves efficiently, developing our existing acreage and acquiring additional proved reserves economically. We face the challenge of natural production declines and volatile natural gas, oil and NGL prices. As initial reservoir pressures are depleted, natural gas and oil production from particular wells decrease. We attempt to overcome this natural decline by drilling to find additional reserves and acquiring more reserves than we produce. To the extent we would not have access to sufficient capital, our ability to drill and acquire more reserves would be negatively impacted.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Gas and Oil Production  Production Profile. Currently, our gas and oil production revenues and expenses consist of our gas and oil production activities derived from our wells drilled in the Eagle Ford, Marble Falls and Mississippi Lime plays. We have established production positions in the following operating areas:   the Eagle Ford Shale in southern Texas, an oil-rich area, in which we acquired acreage in November 2014;   the Marble Falls play in the Fort Worth Basin in northern Texas, in which we own acreage and producing wells, contains liquids rich natural gas and oil, and;   the Mississippi Lime play in northwestern Oklahoma, an oil and NGL-rich area.  There were no gross or net dry wells drilled during the periods presented below. The following table presents the number of wells we drilled and the number of wells we turned in line, both gross and net during the periods indicated:   Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2016 2015 2016 2015 Gross wells drilled(1): Eagle Ford - - - - Marble Falls - - - - Mississippi Lime - - - - Total - - - - Net wells drilled(1): Eagle Ford - - - - Marble Falls - - - - Mississippi Lime - - - - Total - - - - Gross wells turned in line(2): Eagle Ford - 2 2 4 Marble Falls - - - - Mississippi Lime - - - - Total - 2 2 4 Net wells turned in line(2): Eagle Ford - 2 2 4 Marble Falls - - - - Mississippi Lime - - - - Total - 2 2 4  (1) There were no exploratory wells drilled during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  (2) Wells turned in line refers to wells that have been drilled, completed and connected to a gathering system.  Production Volumes. The following table presents total net natural gas, crude oil and NGL production volumes and production volumes per day for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:   Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2016 2015 2016 2015 Production volumes per day:(1) Eagle Ford: Natural gas (Mcfd) 268 236 275 118 Oil (Bpd) 651 854 871 521 NGLs (Bpd) 56 49 57 25 Total (Mcfed) 4,506 5,655 5,845 3,397 Marble Falls: Natural gas (Mcfd) 133 300 149 425 Oil (Bpd) 8 26 10 40 NGLs (Bpd) 17 38 19 55 Total (Mcfed) 283 689 321 992 Mississippi Lime: Natural gas (Mcfd) 21 39 22 50 Oil (Bpd) 2 4 2 6 NGLs (Bpd) 2 3 2 4 Total (Mcfed) 44 82 46 107 Total production volumes per day:(1) Natural gas (Mcfd) 422 574 445 594 Oil (Bpd) 661 885 883 566 NGLs (Bpd) 75 91 78 84 Total (Mcfed) 4,833 6,426 6,213 4,497 Total production volumes:(1) Natural gas (MMcf) 39 53 122 162 Oil (000's Bbls) 61 81 242 155 NGLs (000's Bbls) 7 8 21 23 Total (MMcfe) 445 591 1,702 1,228  (1) Oil and NGLs are converted to gas equivalent basis at the rate of one barrel of oil or NGLs to six Mcf of natural gas. This ratio is an estimate of the equivalent energy content of the products and does not necessarily reflect their relative economic value.  Production Revenues, Prices and Costs. Production revenues and estimated gas and oil reserves are substantially dependent on prevailing market prices for oil. The following table presents our production revenues and average sales prices for our natural gas, oil, and natural gas liquids production for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 along with our average production costs, which include lease operating expenses, taxes, and transportation and compression costs, in each of the reported periods:   Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2016 2015 2016 2015 Production revenues (in thousands):(1) Natural gas revenue $ 108 $ 139 $ 269 $ 430 Oil revenue 2,586 3,640 8,740 7,287 NGLs revenue 98 99 269 290 Total revenues $ 2,792 $ 3,878 $ 9,278 $ 8,007 Average sales price: Natural gas (per Mcf):(2) Total realized price, after hedge $ 2.78 $ 2.63 $ 2.20 $ 2.65 Total realized price, before hedge $ 2.78 $ 2.63 $ 2.20 $ 2.65 Oil (per Bbl):(2) Total realized price, after hedge(3) $ 42.80 $ 47.14 $ 37.09 $ 48.39 Total realized price, before hedge $ 42.56 $ 44.72 $ 36.12 $ 47.09 NGLs (per Bbl):(2) Total realized price, after hedge $ 14.28 $ 11.88 $ 12.58 $ 12.63 Total realized price, before hedge $ 14.28 $ 11.88 $ 12.58 $ 12.63 Production costs (per Mcfe):(2) Eagle Ford: Lease operating expenses $ 0.75 $ 0.55 $ 0.77 $ 0.54 Production taxes 0.29 0.32 0.26 0.34 Transportation and compression 0.14 0.08 0.11 0.07 $ 1.18 $ 0.94 $ 1.14 $ 0.95 Marble Falls: Lease operating expenses $ 1.54 $ 2.78 $ 1.95 $ 2.42 Production taxes 0.42 0.30 0.39 0.29 Transportation and compression - - - - $ 1.96 $ 3.08 $ 2.33 $ 2.71 Mississippi Lime: Lease operating expenses $ 0.75 $ 2.80 $ 3.78 $ 1.91 Production taxes 0.25 - 0.08 0.07 Transportation and compression 0.50 0.40 0.39 0.44 $ 1.50 $ 3.20 $ 4.25 $ 2.42 Total production costs: Lease operating expenses $ 0.79 $ 0.81 $ 0.85 $ 0.99 Production taxes 0.30 0.31 0.26 0.32 Transportation and compression 0.14 0.07 0.11 0.06 $ 1.23 $ 1.20 $ 1.22 $ 1.37  (1) Production revenues exclude the impact of our commodity derivative cash settlements because we do not apply hedge accounting (see "Item 1. Financial Statements - Note 4").  (2) "Mcf" represents thousand cubic feet; "Mcfe" represents thousand cubic feet equivalents; and "Bbl" represents barrels.  (3) Includes the impact of $16,000 and $0.2 million of cash settlements for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 on our oil derivative contracts, respectively. Includes the impact of $0.2 million of cash settlements for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 on our oil derivative contracts.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2016 2015 2016 2015 (in thousands) (in thousands) Gas and oil production revenues $ 2,792 $ 3,878 $ 9,278 $ 8,007 Gas and oil production costs $ 548 $ 709 $ 2,080 $ 1,684  The decrease in gas and oil production revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year period consisted of a $1.1 million decrease attributable to production from our Eagle Ford operations and a $0.1 million decrease attributable to our Marble Falls operations.  The increase in gas and oil production revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year period consisted of a $2.2 million increase attributable to production from our Eagle Ford operations, partially offset by a $0.8 million decrease attributable to our Marble Falls operations and a $0.1 million decrease attributable to our Mississippi Lime operations.  The decrease in gas and oil production expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year period primarily consisted of a decrease of $0.2 million attributable to our Marble Falls operations.  The increase in gas and oil production expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year period primarily consisted of a $0.9 million increase attributable to our Eagle Ford operations, partially offset by a decrease of $0.5 million attributable to our Marble Falls operations.  OTHER REVENUES AND EXPENSES Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2016 2015 2016 2015 (in thousands) (in thousands) Other Revenues Gain (loss) on mark-to-market derivatives $ 126 $ 713 $ (367 ) $ 760 Other Expenses General and administrative $ 2,726 $ 2,690 $ 8,118 $ 10,027 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 3,898 2,848 11,424 5,095 Asset impairment - 7,291 - 7,291 Other loss $ 5,297 $ - $ 5,297 $ -  Gain (Loss) on Mark-to-Market Derivatives. We recognize changes in fair value of derivatives immediately within gain (loss) on mark-to-market derivatives on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. The recognized losses and gains during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, are related to the changes in oil prices during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year periods.  Other loss. The increases in other loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year periods were due to a $5.3 million write-off of issuer costs in light of new regulations and the challenging fund raising environment until such time as market participants have had an opportunity to ascertain the impact of such issues.  General and Administrative Expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year period was due to a $2.0 million decrease in salaries, wages and other corporate activity costs allocated to us by ATLS and ARP in connection with the completion of our private placement offering in June 2015.  Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. The increases in depreciation, depletion and amortization for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, were primarily due to a $1.1 million increase and a $6.3 million increase in our depletion expense as compared to the prior year periods, respectively. The following table presents our depletion expense per Mcfe for our operations for the respective periods (in thousands, except per Mcfe data):   Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2016 2015 2016 2015 Depletion expense: Total $ 3,857 $ 2,713 $ 11,306 $ 4,958 Depletion expense as a percentage of gas and oil production revenue 138 % 67 % 122 % 60 % Depletion per Mcfe $ 8.68 $ 4.59 $ 6.64 $ 4.04  The increases in depletion expense, depletion expenses as a percentage of gas and oil revenues and depletion expenses per Mcfe, were primarily due to an increase in our depletion expense associated with the expansion of our Eagle Ford operations, partially offset by a decrease in oil volumes from our Marble Falls operations.  Asset Impairment. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized $7.3 million of asset impairment related to our proved oil and gas properties in the Marble Falls and Mississippi Lime operating areas, which were impaired due to lower forecasted commodity prices. There were no impairments of proved gas and oil properties recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  General  We have historically funded our operations, acquisitions and cash distributions primarily through cash generated from operations and financing activities, including our private placement offering completed in June 2015. Our future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including oil and natural gas prices. Prices for oil and natural gas began to decline significantly during the fourth quarter of 2014. Although oil and natural gas prices increased slowly over the three months ended September 30, 2016, these lower commodity prices have negatively impacted our revenues, earnings and cash flows. Sustained low commodity prices will have a material and adverse effect on our liquidity position.  On November 2, 2016, management decided to temporarily suspend our current primary offering efforts in light of new regulations and the challenging fund raising environment until such time as market participants have had an opportunity to ascertain the impact of such issues. In addition, our Board of Directors determined to suspend our quarterly common unit distributions, beginning with the three months ended September 30, 2016, in order retain our cash flow and reinvest in our business and assets due to the suspension of our current primary offering. Accordingly, these decisions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Management determined that substantial doubt is alleviated through management's plans to reduce general and administrative expenses, the majority of which represent allocations from ATLS.  Cash Flows- Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared with the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 2015 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 7,463 $ (23,880 ) Net cash used in investing activities (6,575 ) (65,643 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (16,238 ) 94,343  The change in cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities when compared with the comparable prior year period was primarily due to:   an increase in our advances from affiliates of $29.3 million related to the direct costs, indirect cost allocation, dealer manager costs for operating activities and timing of funding of cash accounts; and   an increase in our gas and oil production revenues of $1.3 million primarily related to the expansion of our Eagle Ford operations.
