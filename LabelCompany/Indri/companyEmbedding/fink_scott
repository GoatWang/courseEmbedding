Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.

Lainey Fink Scott Shapes Passion for Pottery Into Side Career

Lainey Fink Scott grew up in a family where food was a big deal and the dish that held it was sacred. Most of her childhood meals were served on handmade ceramic dishes.
For her, food is bolstered by the plate on which it is served.
“It enhances the dish,” she said.
Mrs. Scott, 32, is a graphic designer, partnering with her husband Ben Scott to form Bluerock Design. She spends her days working on a computer. But after the work day is over and the computers are powered down, she disappears into her basement workshop, where drying bowls sit upside down on a table near her throwing wheel, and blocks of clay are stacked on a shelving unit. Her squat kiln sits off to the side.
Upstairs, her kitchen shelves are filled with plates, bowls and mugs that she’s made herself. Restaurants in Boston, New York and on the Vineyard also serve meals on plates and bowls she’s thrown.
Mrs. Scott’s side career in ceramics began in college at the Rhode Island School of Design when she took an introductory pottery class on a whim. It was a tactile antidote to all of her computer focused graphic design classes.

 
        Schooled at the Rhode Island School of Design, Lainey Fink rekindled her passion for pottery when she moved to the Vineyard three years ago.. 
        
                  
        — Tova Katzman


“Just being in the studio and feeling clay and mud and being dirty and not staring at a computer screen,” she remembered fondly.
After graduation, while living in Boston, she had no access to a studio or equipment. But when the couple moved to the Vineyard in 2014, her husband pointed out that Featherstone Center for the Arts was just a short drive from their new house.
Mrs. Scott began visiting Featherstone’s open pottery hours. Eventually, she purchased her own wheel and set it up in her basement. But she still had to travel back and forth to Featherstone to use the kiln.
“I definitely had some breakage,” she said, referring to traveling with fragile pottery. There was also the separation anxiety of leaving pieces in a building she didn’t always have access to.
“The thing with pottery is you have to monitor pieces,” she said. “They are kind of like these little babies that you have to foster each one’s life.”
She purchased a kiln and stocked the basement with blocks of clay and drying tables. In just a few months time, Island chef Nathan Gould asked her to make some pieces for the Beach Plum Inn.
“I started thinking really seriously about when you plate food how it looks compared to the glaze or the shape of the bowl or plate,” Mrs. Scott said.
She developed a style of simple, functional dishes including flat-bottomed plates with a small lip, sturdy beer steins and sloping vases. Soon, with the help of Instagram, she was inundated with orders. Companies that Bluerock Design works for began asking for ceramics as well as high end restaurants like O Ya in Boston and New York, and Lamplighter Brewing Co. in Cambridge.
Though she has quickly made her way into the world of professional ceramics, Mrs. Scott said she spent hundreds and hundreds of hours figuring out what styles she liked and how to turn out a consistent product.
“There’s a lot of loss with pottery, you kind of have to play around a ton to get what you like,” she said.
Many pieces end up in a box that she offers to friends and family who visit her house.
“Whenever [my dad] comes and visits he’s like, ‘so can I check out the box? Let’s go and look.’ He usually ends up taking everything.”
Her parents have pottery of hers dating back to her time at RISD. Other pieces not ready for sale end up on her own kitchen shelves.
“I keep all the stuff that I can’t sell because of imperfections, or they are prototypes or they’re a little too funky. So we have all the funky stuff.”
Her cups have been also sold at Behind the Bookstore, and Vineyard Decorators will soon have a selection of her work for sale as well. In rediscovering pottery, Mrs. Scott developed a second career. “I would be doing it anyway, even if I wasn’t making money off it,” she said. “I don’t know, I just have to.”
