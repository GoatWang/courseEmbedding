Before initially retaining an attorney I spoke with many highly recommend lawyers, and after my first phone conversation with Mr.Joslyn, I knew I wanted no one else handling my case but him. Brian spent over 45 minutes speaking with me and for the first time in all of my calls with other attorneys, asked questions to get to know me, not only as a client, but as person. Because of that, Brian was able to have my case sentenced to treatment in lieu of a conviction so that my mistake would not cost me my future and all my hard work and education would not be gone with a felony conviction. His office staff was amazing to me, respectful, helpful, and accommodating as I was traveling from out of state for my court case. On top of everything else, Brian and his staff made financial arrangements with myself and my family that are unheard of! I can tell you that no other attorney would do such.  I was arrested for a probation violation in my case, and was worried Brian and his firm would not accept me again as a client as I still owe on my past balance, so I did not contact him. Brian saw my name on the docket when I was in jail for arrangement, came and found me, handled my case so I could post a bond. Not only did he do that without mention of money, a past balance, and most importantly without judgment, he went and spoke with my family in detail for over 30 minutes in the courthouse. As I am sure I am not alone in this, but my family has suffered as much as I have if not more through this ordeal. Knowing that Brian and his firm were there for them, to answer any and all questions, and re assure them that he would do any and everything to make sure I was ok and safe throughout the process, is purely priceless.  I would recommend Mr.Joslyn and his firm to anyone dealing with a criminal case. You will not find another lawyer that is so non-judgmental, hardworking, compassionate, and is truly working for your best interest at all costs. I thank Mr.Joslyn and his firm for everything that they have done for me and continue to do.Cecil & Geiser LLPkvanmarm ratedI was involved as a pedestrian...I was involved as a pedestrian in an auto accident back  in Ohio, but subsequently  moved to another state. When the driver's insurance company kept stalling me claiming they wanted to personally settle with me but drug out my claim for too long a time, I decided to take stronger action. I retained a small firm to handle my case.  After six months of what I thought was time being spent negotiating a settlement for me (so I could pay off my medical bills for one thing), I found that the attorney had sat on my information while I believed she was being an advocate for me. She did absolutely nothing but waste my time! I had  documented injuries (the other insurance company never denied liability), outstanding unpaid medical bills, ongoing pain and need for physical therapy, a lose of income, a loss of a career and a business I had built up 10 years, all due to the injury. The lawyer handling my case totally ignored medical diagnoses from outstanding orthopedic surgeons and other medical professionals, totally ignored all medical evidence and prognoses and dropped my case! I was in shock and insulted.I researched  for a more competent law firm. After a recommendation from a friend I had known for thirty years (and had been involved in a personal injury case with C & G representing her))  I picked Cecil & Geiser who are known for excellent service to their clients . The attorneys from Cecil & Geiser have had the difficult task of handling my case from a distance since I now live in a different state. They have handled each step of the process with patience, compassion, courtesy and professionalism.Cecil & Geiser LLPbike2010 ratedIn May of 2010 I was in an acc...In May of 2010 I was in an accident, while riding my bike a dog ran out into the road and caused me to have a serious fall. I have no memory of the accident. Luckily I was with friends that took care of me while I was unconscious and waiting for the ambulance. Subsequently, I made several unsuccessful attempts to communicate with the owner of the dog. I took my case to an attorney in an attempt to communicate once again with the owner of the dog but the attorney refused my case.  I then talked to Mike Geiser, of Cecil & Geiser.Mike Geiser accepted my case.  Shortly thereafter he did some investigating and was able to contact the appropriate party that insured the dog.  It took several years for me to recover but through the entire process I felt I was working with the best possible attorney for my personal injury.  He was very thorough; he understood all aspects of the law concerning my case, even when the opposing insurance representatives did not. He spent time with me explaining the pros and cons on my situation. His paralegal did an excellent job of organizing my medical files, which were quite extensive.  She promptly responded to emails and stayed on top of my deadlines.  Recently my case was successfully resolved. Until you work with someone you really do not know what kind of service you will receive and I can tell you that I received excellent legal service with Mike Geiser.  Michael R. Szolosi Sr. Columbus Ohio LawyerKati N. ratedI was given Attorney Siewert's name by a very good friend of mine.  I had never been in any kind of trouble and was scared to death to even discuss what may happen to me if found guilty (because I am innocent of course!!) I didn't take the referral right away, in fact I called several different law firms and discussed my situation with them and they all sounded like robots! All they wanted was my money!  Every one of them wanted a huge retainer fee as well as making it very clear that during the process of a trial the fees were sure to add on.  Not only did they assure me I'd be paying tons of money...they ALL advised me they would take the best deal the judge gave on the first try and warned me I'd be on probation or definitely do community service!!!  Finally I called Attorney Mike Siewert and he immediately gave me peace of mind!  Not only did he allow me to retain him for what I had available...he offered a payment agreement according to what I could afford!!  On top of the very personable conversation and the flexibile rates, Attorney Siewert has taken the time to fight my case! He did WHATEVER it took to get the results we were looking for and he wasn't going to stop until he did!  I will ALWAYS recommend Mike Siewert for an attorney to ANYONE in need!Cecil & Geiser LLPJennifer R. ratedIn July of 2013 I was in a serious pedestrian accident while walking on the sidewalk.  A motorcyclist was hit by a car and came up on the sidewalk and drove right into me.  For several weeks I was hospitalized & in a rehab center and unable to care for my daughter.  As a single parent, it was my worst nightmare.  I was hurt, stressed, worried and all I wanted to do was focus on getting better and getting home to my daughter.  Mike Geiser allowed me to do just that.  I let the experts do their job, so I did not have to worry about how the medical bills were going to get paid or what I needed to do, they took care of everything.  I don’t wish that situation on anyone, but if you find yourself in a similar situation, Cecil & Geiser are the ones that will step in and hold your hand through the process with care.  I am very happy with my settlement and will be forever grateful for all that they have done for me.  I don’t know how I would have gotten through all of this without their support.Dodgion Jeremyjohn.scior rated     I must admit that Mr Dodg...     I must admit that Mr Dodgion seemed a bit less concerned about my case in the beginning than I did, however later I realized this was simply because I had never faced the allegations I had been facing. He seemed quite strict in the thouroughness of his staff however his results were just as I asked. I in fact had been writing childrens stories at the time and had devoted one called the tyronnasaurus and the bunny rabbit and devoted it to his daughters who he had introduced me to in his initial consultation.  He had in fact been highly recommended from amongst a prosecuter I know of and also another defense attorney.  Amidst a sea of trouble he seemed a solid rock if not a beacon during a time of troubles and stormy weather in my life. If you are a Christian or whatever your belief might be. As your faith shall guide ye, Mr Jeremy Dodgion Esq. shall see ye through the storm of your life. Bless him.  Cecil & Geiser LLPRonald B. ratedI highly recommend Michael Geiser. Mr Geiser represented me in an auto accident that happened in December, 2012. The other driver was at fault and did not have insurance. My auto insurance tried to rip me off, first by not giving me a fair compensation for my car that was totaled. Then they stated that they did not pay medical bills. It was at that point that I retained Mr Geiser. Mr Geiser came to our house to explain everything. He was extremely prompt in answering any questions or concerns. He also encountered many difficulities with the insurance company, but his patience and persistance paid off. My case has been settled, and I am extremely happy with the results. My wife is still under medical treatment, so her case is still pending; but  Mr Geiser has been able to get the insurance company to re-imburse me for the medical bills. Again, I would strongly recommend Cecil & Geiser.Greco Anthony AttorneyJennifer H. ratedMy husband and I decided after his divorce that we needed to hire a different attorney to represent us for termination of spousal support due to cohabitation. We first met with a private investigator who referred us to Tony after hearing our case. After a short time in our meeting with Tony we knew he was the right attorney for us. He is very knowledgeable, has a great team of attorneys & staff, and will go the extra mile to get the job done. Cohabitation is one of the hardest things to prove but with our private investigator & Tony's expertise I am happy to say we won. We are currently back in court due to his ex-wife appealing the decision but with Tony and his team I know we will be just fine. If you need an attorney to handle your case look no further he is your guy!Cecil & Geiser LLPamdisabato ratedI like to call Mike Geiser my guardian angel. I have been in two car accidents and he has represented me both times.I was in a serious car accident a couple years ago with my 5 month old baby. From day one mike came to my house to help. I had no idea what what my future would hold not being able to walk and having to take care of my new baby. Through the entire time mike was by my side. He never let me down. I knew he was always a phone call away and he would be there for me everytime. In the end all my medical bills were paid for and a settlement that changed my life. If I never met mike I'm not sure what would have happened. I would highly recommend Mike Geiser!!! Someone I call my guardian angel, a friend , and someone who changed my life.Thanks Mike!!!Waters Law, LLCEric B. ratedI don't usually leave reviews,...I don't usually leave reviews, especially for something so personal, but I think this can help other people so here I am. Mr. Waters helped me tremendously with a frustrating tax problem that had been plaguing me for years. Within days of our initial conversation, he had things moving along with the IRS to get the issue resolved. I wish I could explain how much stress was relieved when he took over my tax case. He straightened out tax issues for my business and for me personally, and now I can move on with my life and put this behind me. If you have a tax problem, I recommend Waters Law - very professional and I liked his realistic approach to handling my problem.Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.

Mr. Mineff is a very professional attorney as well as an understanding attorney.  Mr. Mineff represented my daughter with relation to an OVI and let her know right from the beginning what to expect and guided her through the whole process in a very professional manner.  I felt what he charged was very very reasonable. Mr. Mineff is very well respected by his fellow colleagues and by his clients as well.  He has never never overcharged or racked up additional charges the entire time he represented my daughter.  I would highly recommend Mr. Mineff for any legal representation or advise.  Sliwinski Teddybernicecortes ratedI thank God for Mr. Sliwinski.  When I was in my twenties I made a mistake that got me in trouble.  He listened to me and did all that was in his power to get me out of.  He  made sure that even though at the time I was not thinking right,  I would  have a chance to a brighter future.  Since then and because of what he has done, I've been able to work in the banking industry without that hanging over my head.  Thank you so much Teddy for all you have done for me and my family!  For going above and beyond the call of duty.  And for still looking out for me after over 20 years.  You're the best!Luftman, Heck & AssociatesAndrew J. ratedAfter deciding that filing for bankruptcy would be my best option, Matt and the entire team have been nothing short of amazing. From the first meeting and thru the entire process and beyond all my questions or concerns were taken care of. I was never left to wonder what would happen next and they were always proactive in their approach while handling my case. I can not say enough about how professional they are and the peace of mind I had after that first meeting with them that everything will be taken care of which it was! They are the best. Mineff, George, JrEmily K. ratedA+; a real attorney who knows what he is doingI am franchise business owner who was referred from a friend 6 years ago to use George for a speeding violation. George is a phenomenal attorney; calls back right away with any questions, will spend as long as you need on the phone to make sure you understand everything, has a great staff that is very nice and actually have personalities. In life it's not always what you know, it's who you know...and you should know an attorney like George because he is a true professional and go-getter.Margolius Margolius & Associates LPAMark G. ratedI file disability May 3rd 2006 I got my paper the next day saying that I was denied I went straight to margolius sign a bunch of papers they took my case immediately it did take three years and eight months before I got my money but it was well worth the wait because I had crucial medical evidence to prove to the judge and to the court that I was disabled I got 3.8 years of back pay thanks for your help thanks for winning my case I highly recommend themW Scott Ramsey Law OfficeN B. ratedIf your not being represented by this attorney than your opinion is irrelevant. You fail to know all the details  about the case in question of "your friend".  Tell the entire story not your emotional self righteous judgment. Mostly you are bias. This attorney has not been in practice for 10 plus years because of something wrong. So, the suggestion to you, stop with the blame game. Your friend may have more issues than you know or spoken about in court.Mark R. Gusley & Associates LPAacidentertainment ratedFor a few years I was going through some terribly stressful litigation. Mark R Gusley was not only a great attorney, but a very approachable person who helped guide me both legally and personally. During an emotional time it was difficult o think about legal intricacies, but Mark R Gusley and Associates helped me get through successfully. Highly recommended.

Warren and Shaun and Ariel were the best. I recommend them for anyone looking for a lawyer that helps you after an injury or accident or you get hurt.Shaleika Vargas Attorney at LawLisa O. ratedAttorney Vargas represented me in a civil matter. I couldn't be happier with the outcome of my case. This lawyer is honest, hardworking and down to earth. Not to mention the price was very very affordable. I highly recommend this lawyer! Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.
