Early life[edit]
Burnett was born on 17 July 1960 in London, the only child of Archie and Jean Burnett, both Ford Motors factory workers,[3] and was raised in Dagenham, Essex. His father was a Roman Catholic and his mother was a Presbyterian, although it is not known in which denomination he was raised.[4][5] Aged 17, he enlisted in the British Army, and became a Section Commander in the Parachute Regiment. From 1978–82 he served with the 3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment in C Company and saw action during the Falklands War.[3]
Early career[edit]
In October 1982, Burnett emigrated to the United States, where his friend Nick Hill, who had emigrated from the UK several years earlier, was working as a nanny and chauffeur. Hill knew of an open position for a live-in nanny with the Jaeger family in affluent Beverly Hills. Despite having no experience as a nanny, Burnett went on the interview. The Jaegers, realizing the advantage of having a nanny and security at the same time, hired him. After a year of working for the Jaegers, he moved on to another family in the beach city of Malibu, California, taking care of two boys for $250 a week. He was eventually given a position in the insurance office owned by Burt, the father of the two boys. Two years later, Burnett rented a portion of a fence at Venice Beach in Los Angeles, and sold T-shirts for $18 each during weekends. Realizing he made more money selling T-shirts, he left his insurance job.[6] In 1991, Burnett, and four others joined a French adventure competition, the Raid Gauloises. Afterward, Burnett saw a business opportunity in holding similar competitions. He purchased the format rights and brought a similar competition, Eco-Challenge, to America. Eco-Challenge launched Burnett's career as a television producer.[3]
Productions[edit]
Burnett is best known for producing the hit reality show Survivor, which premiered in the summer of 2000 and was the most watched summer series since Sonny and Cher.[7] Survivor was named the Number 1 reality series of all time by Entertainment Weekly in 2009.[8]
In 2004, NBC premiered The Apprentice, a reality television series in which contestants competed for a job under real estate magnate and future President Donald Trump.[9] The Apprentice spawned numerous licensed international versions of the show.
Burnett has produced several other television franchises including: Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?, Shark Tank, and The Voice.[10] He has maintained a strong presence in award show franchises, having produced the MTV Movie Awards (2007–2011), the annual People's Choice Awards (2010–2017), the Spike Video Game Awards (2011 & 2012) and the 2011 Primetime Emmy Awards.[citation needed]
Burnett has produced more than 3,200 hours of television programming which regularly airs in more than 70 countries.[11] Past shows include "Celebrity Apprentice (NBC), Bully Beatdown, Combat Missions, The Contender, The Contender Asia, Expedition Africa, Expedition Impossible, How'd You Get So Rich?, Martha Stewart, My Dad Is Better Than Your Dad, On the Lot (a collaboration with Steven Spielberg), The Restaurant, Rock Star, Sarah Palin's Alaska, Stars Earn Stripes, Starmaker, Toughest Cowboy, and Wedding Day.
As well as his ongoing productions, Burnett and his wife, actress Roma Downey, produced The Bible, a 10-hour History Channel drama based upon stories of the Bible.[12] The Bible became the No. 1 new series on cable TV in 2013[13] and was the No. 1 series in Canada, Spain, and Portugal.[14] In total, with subsequent airings, The Bible was seen by more than 100 million viewers.[15]
After the success of The Bible, Burnett and Downey started developing more faith-based scripted series. A.D. The Bible Continues premiered on NBC on Easter Sunday 2015, and The Dovekeepers miniseries aired on CBS in Spring 2015.
In October 2013, NBC announced that it has reached a deal with Burnett and Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic to produce a television series on which contestants will compete to win a spaceflight aboard SpaceShipTwo. The series will be titled Space Race, although it is currently undeterminable when the show will begin airing.[16]
In September 2014, MGM acquired a 55 percent interest in One Three Media and LightWorkers Media, both operated by Burnett and his wife. The two companies will be consolidated into a new film and television company, United Artists Media Group. Burnett is UAMG's CEO and Downey is president of LightWorkers Media.[17]
In December 2015, Burnett was named president of MGM Television and Digital Group, signing a five-year deal. Burnett's appointment was set up to occur simultaneously with the closing of MGM's acquisition of the remaining 45 percent of Hearst's, Burnett's and Roma Downey‘s interests in United Artists Media Group (UAMG), which will be absorbed under the MGM Television Group umbrella. MGM Television will now have numerous unscripted and scripted television shows airing on network and cable or in production including: The Voice (NBC); Survivor (CBS); Shark Tank (ABC); Beyond the Tank (ABC); Celebrity Apprentice (NBC); Fargo (FX);Vikings (HISTORY); Teen Wolf (MTV); 500 Questions (ABC); The People's Choice Awards (CBS); Lucha Underground (El Rey Network) and America's Greatest Makers (INTEL/Turner).[18]
In 2016, Burnett produced the film Ben-Hur, a film adaptation of the novel Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ.[9] The film was a box office flop.[9]
Personal life[edit]
In January 2004, Burnett began dating Downey. In November 2006, while the two were vacationing with their children in Zihuatanejo, Mexico, he proposed to her.[19] They wed on 28 April 2007 in their Malibu home. The ceremony was officiated by Downey's former co star, Della Reese.[20]
Burnett is an Evangelical christian.[21][22] Downey and him produced The Bible (miniseries) and are now co-owners of United Artists Media Group together with MGM and Hearst. In addition to their producing projects, the couple is heavily involved with philanthropic organizations Operation Smile and Compassion International.[23] In 2014, they announced a fundraising plan called Cradle of Christianity that aims to raise $25 million to help Iraqi and Syrian Christians and other minorities displaced by ISIL survive that upcoming winter.[24]
Burnett was previously married to Dianne J. Burnett (née Valentine); they have two sons, James and Cameron.[25] The couple filed for legal separation in September 2002 and a judgment for legal separation was granted in December 2003.[25][26] They later divorced in 2006.[when?]

Early life[edit]
Burnett was born on 17 July 1960 in London, the only child of Archie and Jean Burnett, both Ford Motors factory workers,[3] and was raised in Dagenham, Essex. His father was a Roman Catholic and his mother was a Presbyterian, although it is not known in which denomination he was raised.[4][5] Aged 17, he enlisted in the British Army, and became a Section Commander in the Parachute Regiment. From 1978–82 he served with the 3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment in C Company and saw action during the Falklands War.[3]
Early career[edit]
In October 1982, Burnett emigrated to the United States, where his friend Nick Hill, who had emigrated from the UK several years earlier, was working as a nanny and chauffeur. Hill knew of an open position for a live-in nanny with the Jaeger family in affluent Beverly Hills. Despite having no experience as a nanny, Burnett went on the interview. The Jaegers, realizing the advantage of having a nanny and security at the same time, hired him. After a year of working for the Jaegers, he moved on to another family in the beach city of Malibu, California, taking care of two boys for $250 a week. He was eventually given a position in the insurance office owned by Burt, the father of the two boys. Two years later, Burnett rented a portion of a fence at Venice Beach in Los Angeles, and sold T-shirts for $18 each during weekends. Realizing he made more money selling T-shirts, he left his insurance job.[6] In 1991, Burnett, and four others joined a French adventure competition, the Raid Gauloises. Afterward, Burnett saw a business opportunity in holding similar competitions. He purchased the format rights and brought a similar competition, Eco-Challenge, to America. Eco-Challenge launched Burnett's career as a television producer.[3]
Productions[edit]
Burnett is best known for producing the hit reality show Survivor, which premiered in the summer of 2000 and was the most watched summer series since Sonny and Cher.[7] Survivor was named the Number 1 reality series of all time by Entertainment Weekly in 2009.[8]
In 2004, NBC premiered The Apprentice, a reality television series in which contestants competed for a job under real estate magnate and future President Donald Trump.[9] The Apprentice spawned numerous licensed international versions of the show.
Burnett has produced several other television franchises including: Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?, Shark Tank, and The Voice.[10] He has maintained a strong presence in award show franchises, having produced the MTV Movie Awards (2007–2011), the annual People's Choice Awards (2010–2017), the Spike Video Game Awards (2011 & 2012) and the 2011 Primetime Emmy Awards.[citation needed]
Burnett has produced more than 3,200 hours of television programming which regularly airs in more than 70 countries.[11] Past shows include "Celebrity Apprentice (NBC), Bully Beatdown, Combat Missions, The Contender, The Contender Asia, Expedition Africa, Expedition Impossible, How'd You Get So Rich?, Martha Stewart, My Dad Is Better Than Your Dad, On the Lot (a collaboration with Steven Spielberg), The Restaurant, Rock Star, Sarah Palin's Alaska, Stars Earn Stripes, Starmaker, Toughest Cowboy, and Wedding Day.
As well as his ongoing productions, Burnett and his wife, actress Roma Downey, produced The Bible, a 10-hour History Channel drama based upon stories of the Bible.[12] The Bible became the No. 1 new series on cable TV in 2013[13] and was the No. 1 series in Canada, Spain, and Portugal.[14] In total, with subsequent airings, The Bible was seen by more than 100 million viewers.[15]
After the success of The Bible, Burnett and Downey started developing more faith-based scripted series. A.D. The Bible Continues premiered on NBC on Easter Sunday 2015, and The Dovekeepers miniseries aired on CBS in Spring 2015.
In October 2013, NBC announced that it has reached a deal with Burnett and Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic to produce a television series on which contestants will compete to win a spaceflight aboard SpaceShipTwo. The series will be titled Space Race, although it is currently undeterminable when the show will begin airing.[16]
In September 2014, MGM acquired a 55 percent interest in One Three Media and LightWorkers Media, both operated by Burnett and his wife. The two companies will be consolidated into a new film and television company, United Artists Media Group. Burnett is UAMG's CEO and Downey is president of LightWorkers Media.[17]
In December 2015, Burnett was named president of MGM Television and Digital Group, signing a five-year deal. Burnett's appointment was set up to occur simultaneously with the closing of MGM's acquisition of the remaining 45 percent of Hearst's, Burnett's and Roma Downey‘s interests in United Artists Media Group (UAMG), which will be absorbed under the MGM Television Group umbrella. MGM Television will now have numerous unscripted and scripted television shows airing on network and cable or in production including: The Voice (NBC); Survivor (CBS); Shark Tank (ABC); Beyond the Tank (ABC); Celebrity Apprentice (NBC); Fargo (FX);Vikings (HISTORY); Teen Wolf (MTV); 500 Questions (ABC); The People's Choice Awards (CBS); Lucha Underground (El Rey Network) and America's Greatest Makers (INTEL/Turner).[18]
In 2016, Burnett produced the film Ben-Hur, a film adaptation of the novel Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ.[9] The film was a box office flop.[9]
Personal life[edit]
In January 2004, Burnett began dating Downey. In November 2006, while the two were vacationing with their children in Zihuatanejo, Mexico, he proposed to her.[19] They wed on 28 April 2007 in their Malibu home. The ceremony was officiated by Downey's former co star, Della Reese.[20]
Burnett is an Evangelical christian.[21][22] Downey and him produced The Bible (miniseries) and are now co-owners of United Artists Media Group together with MGM and Hearst. In addition to their producing projects, the couple is heavily involved with philanthropic organizations Operation Smile and Compassion International.[23] In 2014, they announced a fundraising plan called Cradle of Christianity that aims to raise $25 million to help Iraqi and Syrian Christians and other minorities displaced by ISIL survive that upcoming winter.[24]
Burnett was previously married to Dianne J. Burnett (née Valentine); they have two sons, James and Cameron.[25] The couple filed for legal separation in September 2002 and a judgment for legal separation was granted in December 2003.[25][26] They later divorced in 2006.[when?]
Awards, honors and affiliations[edit]
In 2004, Time called Burnett one of the Most Influential People in the World Today.[27] Burnett was also named "Philanthropist of the Year" by the Reality Cares Foundation. He has won both Brandweek's "Marketer of the Year Award", the prestigious Rose d’Or Frapa Format Award, the Brandon Tartikoff Legacy Award and the Norman Lear Award from the Producers Guild of America.
Burnett served for two years on the Board of Directors for the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.[28] In November 2007, Burnett was elected into the Broadcast & Cable Hall of Fame and in 2008, it was announced that he would be honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. On 8 July 2009, Burnett received a star at 6664 Hollywood Blvd.[29] In June 2011, Burnett was elected into the Producers Guild of America Council Board of Delegates and currently serves on the Producers Council. He is an ambassador for Operation Smile.

Early life[edit]
Burnett was born on 17 July 1960 in London, the only child of Archie and Jean Burnett, both Ford Motors factory workers,[3] and was raised in Dagenham, Essex. His father was a Roman Catholic and his mother was a Presbyterian, although it is not known in which denomination he was raised.[4][5] Aged 17, he enlisted in the British Army, and became a Section Commander in the Parachute Regiment. From 1978–82 he served with the 3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment in C Company and saw action during the Falklands War.[3]
Early career[edit]
In October 1982, Burnett emigrated to the United States, where his friend Nick Hill, who had emigrated from the UK several years earlier, was working as a nanny and chauffeur. Hill knew of an open position for a live-in nanny with the Jaeger family in affluent Beverly Hills. Despite having no experience as a nanny, Burnett went on the interview. The Jaegers, realizing the advantage of having a nanny and security at the same time, hired him. After a year of working for the Jaegers, he moved on to another family in the beach city of Malibu, California, taking care of two boys for $250 a week. He was eventually given a position in the insurance office owned by Burt, the father of the two boys. Two years later, Burnett rented a portion of a fence at Venice Beach in Los Angeles, and sold T-shirts for $18 each during weekends. Realizing he made more money selling T-shirts, he left his insurance job.[6] In 1991, Burnett, and four others joined a French adventure competition, the Raid Gauloises. Afterward, Burnett saw a business opportunity in holding similar competitions. He purchased the format rights and brought a similar competition, Eco-Challenge, to America. Eco-Challenge launched Burnett's career as a television producer.[3]
Productions[edit]
Burnett is best known for producing the hit reality show Survivor, which premiered in the summer of 2000 and was the most watched summer series since Sonny and Cher.[7] Survivor was named the Number 1 reality series of all time by Entertainment Weekly in 2009.[8]
In 2004, NBC premiered The Apprentice, a reality television series in which contestants competed for a job under real estate magnate and future President Donald Trump.[9] The Apprentice spawned numerous licensed international versions of the show.
Burnett has produced several other television franchises including: Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?, Shark Tank, and The Voice.[10] He has maintained a strong presence in award show franchises, having produced the MTV Movie Awards (2007–2011), the annual People's Choice Awards (2010–2017), the Spike Video Game Awards (2011 & 2012) and the 2011 Primetime Emmy Awards.[citation needed]
Burnett has produced more than 3,200 hours of television programming which regularly airs in more than 70 countries.[11] Past shows include "Celebrity Apprentice (NBC), Bully Beatdown, Combat Missions, The Contender, The Contender Asia, Expedition Africa, Expedition Impossible, How'd You Get So Rich?, Martha Stewart, My Dad Is Better Than Your Dad, On the Lot (a collaboration with Steven Spielberg), The Restaurant, Rock Star, Sarah Palin's Alaska, Stars Earn Stripes, Starmaker, Toughest Cowboy, and Wedding Day.
As well as his ongoing productions, Burnett and his wife, actress Roma Downey, produced The Bible, a 10-hour History Channel drama based upon stories of the Bible.[12] The Bible became the No. 1 new series on cable TV in 2013[13] and was the No. 1 series in Canada, Spain, and Portugal.[14] In total, with subsequent airings, The Bible was seen by more than 100 million viewers.[15]
After the success of The Bible, Burnett and Downey started developing more faith-based scripted series. A.D. The Bible Continues premiered on NBC on Easter Sunday 2015, and The Dovekeepers miniseries aired on CBS in Spring 2015.
In October 2013, NBC announced that it has reached a deal with Burnett and Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic to produce a television series on which contestants will compete to win a spaceflight aboard SpaceShipTwo. The series will be titled Space Race, although it is currently undeterminable when the show will begin airing.[16]
In September 2014, MGM acquired a 55 percent interest in One Three Media and LightWorkers Media, both operated by Burnett and his wife. The two companies will be consolidated into a new film and television company, United Artists Media Group. Burnett is UAMG's CEO and Downey is president of LightWorkers Media.[17]
In December 2015, Burnett was named president of MGM Television and Digital Group, signing a five-year deal. Burnett's appointment was set up to occur simultaneously with the closing of MGM's acquisition of the remaining 45 percent of Hearst's, Burnett's and Roma Downey‘s interests in United Artists Media Group (UAMG), which will be absorbed under the MGM Television Group umbrella. MGM Television will now have numerous unscripted and scripted television shows airing on network and cable or in production including: The Voice (NBC); Survivor (CBS); Shark Tank (ABC); Beyond the Tank (ABC); Celebrity Apprentice (NBC); Fargo (FX);Vikings (HISTORY); Teen Wolf (MTV); 500 Questions (ABC); The People's Choice Awards (CBS); Lucha Underground (El Rey Network) and America's Greatest Makers (INTEL/Turner).[18]
In 2016, Burnett produced the film Ben-Hur, a film adaptation of the novel Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ.[9] The film was a box office flop.[9]
Personal life[edit]
In January 2004, Burnett began dating Downey. In November 2006, while the two were vacationing with their children in Zihuatanejo, Mexico, he proposed to her.[19] They wed on 28 April 2007 in their Malibu home. The ceremony was officiated by Downey's former co star, Della Reese.[20]
Burnett is an Evangelical christian.[21][22] Downey and him produced The Bible (miniseries) and are now co-owners of United Artists Media Group together with MGM and Hearst. In addition to their producing projects, the couple is heavily involved with philanthropic organizations Operation Smile and Compassion International.[23] In 2014, they announced a fundraising plan called Cradle of Christianity that aims to raise $25 million to help Iraqi and Syrian Christians and other minorities displaced by ISIL survive that upcoming winter.[24]
Burnett was previously married to Dianne J. Burnett (née Valentine); they have two sons, James and Cameron.[25] The couple filed for legal separation in September 2002 and a judgment for legal separation was granted in December 2003.[25][26] They later divorced in 2006.[when?]
Awards, honors and affiliations[edit]
In 2004, Time called Burnett one of the Most Influential People in the World Today.[27] Burnett was also named "Philanthropist of the Year" by the Reality Cares Foundation. He has won both Brandweek's "Marketer of the Year Award", the prestigious Rose d’Or Frapa Format Award, the Brandon Tartikoff Legacy Award and the Norman Lear Award from the Producers Guild of America.
Burnett served for two years on the Board of Directors for the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.[28] In November 2007, Burnett was elected into the Broadcast & Cable Hall of Fame and in 2008, it was announced that he would be honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. On 8 July 2009, Burnett received a star at 6664 Hollywood Blvd.[29] In June 2011, Burnett was elected into the Producers Guild of America Council Board of Delegates and currently serves on the Producers Council. He is an ambassador for Operation Smile.
In 2013, the ten-hour mini-series The Bible received the Parents Television Council 2013 Seal of Approval.

Early life[edit]
Burnett was born on 17 July 1960 in London, the only child of Archie and Jean Burnett, both Ford Motors factory workers,[3] and was raised in Dagenham, Essex. His father was a Roman Catholic and his mother was a Presbyterian, although it is not known in which denomination he was raised.[4][5] Aged 17, he enlisted in the British Army, and became a Section Commander in the Parachute Regiment. From 1978–82 he served with the 3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment in C Company and saw action during the Falklands War.[3]
Early career[edit]
In October 1982, Burnett emigrated to the United States, where his friend Nick Hill, who had emigrated from the UK several years earlier, was working as a nanny and chauffeur. Hill knew of an open position for a live-in nanny with the Jaeger family in affluent Beverly Hills. Despite having no experience as a nanny, Burnett went on the interview. The Jaegers, realizing the advantage of having a nanny and security at the same time, hired him. After a year of working for the Jaegers, he moved on to another family in the beach city of Malibu, California, taking care of two boys for $250 a week. He was eventually given a position in the insurance office owned by Burt, the father of the two boys. Two years later, Burnett rented a portion of a fence at Venice Beach in Los Angeles, and sold T-shirts for $18 each during weekends. Realizing he made more money selling T-shirts, he left his insurance job.[6] In 1991, Burnett, and four others joined a French adventure competition, the Raid Gauloises. Afterward, Burnett saw a business opportunity in holding similar competitions. He purchased the format rights and brought a similar competition, Eco-Challenge, to America. Eco-Challenge launched Burnett's career as a television producer.[3]
Productions[edit]
Burnett is best known for producing the hit reality show Survivor, which premiered in the summer of 2000 and was the most watched summer series since Sonny and Cher.[7] Survivor was named the Number 1 reality series of all time by Entertainment Weekly in 2009.[8]
In 2004, NBC premiered The Apprentice, a reality television series in which contestants competed for a job under real estate magnate and future President Donald Trump.[9] The Apprentice spawned numerous licensed international versions of the show.
Burnett has produced several other television franchises including: Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?, Shark Tank, and The Voice.[10] He has maintained a strong presence in award show franchises, having produced the MTV Movie Awards (2007–2011), the annual People's Choice Awards (2010–2017), the Spike Video Game Awards (2011 & 2012) and the 2011 Primetime Emmy Awards.[citation needed]
Burnett has produced more than 3,200 hours of television programming which regularly airs in more than 70 countries.[11] Past shows include "Celebrity Apprentice (NBC), Bully Beatdown, Combat Missions, The Contender, The Contender Asia, Expedition Africa, Expedition Impossible, How'd You Get So Rich?, Martha Stewart, My Dad Is Better Than Your Dad, On the Lot (a collaboration with Steven Spielberg), The Restaurant, Rock Star, Sarah Palin's Alaska, Stars Earn Stripes, Starmaker, Toughest Cowboy, and Wedding Day.
As well as his ongoing productions, Burnett and his wife, actress Roma Downey, produced The Bible, a 10-hour History Channel drama based upon stories of the Bible.[12] The Bible became the No. 1 new series on cable TV in 2013[13] and was the No. 1 series in Canada, Spain, and Portugal.[14] In total, with subsequent airings, The Bible was seen by more than 100 million viewers.[15]
After the success of The Bible, Burnett and Downey started developing more faith-based scripted series. A.D. The Bible Continues premiered on NBC on Easter Sunday 2015, and The Dovekeepers miniseries aired on CBS in Spring 2015.
In October 2013, NBC announced that it has reached a deal with Burnett and Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic to produce a television series on which contestants will compete to win a spaceflight aboard SpaceShipTwo. The series will be titled Space Race, although it is currently undeterminable when the show will begin airing.[16]
In September 2014, MGM acquired a 55 percent interest in One Three Media and LightWorkers Media, both operated by Burnett and his wife. The two companies will be consolidated into a new film and television company, United Artists Media Group. Burnett is UAMG's CEO and Downey is president of LightWorkers Media.[17]
In December 2015, Burnett was named president of MGM Television and Digital Group, signing a five-year deal. Burnett's appointment was set up to occur simultaneously with the closing of MGM's acquisition of the remaining 45 percent of Hearst's, Burnett's and Roma Downey‘s interests in United Artists Media Group (UAMG), which will be absorbed under the MGM Television Group umbrella. MGM Television will now have numerous unscripted and scripted television shows airing on network and cable or in production including: The Voice (NBC); Survivor (CBS); Shark Tank (ABC); Beyond the Tank (ABC); Celebrity Apprentice (NBC); Fargo (FX);Vikings (HISTORY); Teen Wolf (MTV); 500 Questions (ABC); The People's Choice Awards (CBS); Lucha Underground (El Rey Network) and America's Greatest Makers (INTEL/Turner).[18]
In 2016, Burnett produced the film Ben-Hur, a film adaptation of the novel Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ.[9] The film was a box office flop.[9]
Personal life[edit]
In January 2004, Burnett began dating Downey. In November 2006, while the two were vacationing with their children in Zihuatanejo, Mexico, he proposed to her.[19] They wed on 28 April 2007 in their Malibu home. The ceremony was officiated by Downey's former co star, Della Reese.[20]
Burnett is an Evangelical christian.[21][22] Downey and him produced The Bible (miniseries) and are now co-owners of United Artists Media Group together with MGM and Hearst. In addition to their producing projects, the couple is heavily involved with philanthropic organizations Operation Smile and Compassion International.[23] In 2014, they announced a fundraising plan called Cradle of Christianity that aims to raise $25 million to help Iraqi and Syrian Christians and other minorities displaced by ISIL survive that upcoming winter.[24]
Burnett was previously married to Dianne J. Burnett (née Valentine); they have two sons, James and Cameron.[25] The couple filed for legal separation in September 2002 and a judgment for legal separation was granted in December 2003.[25][26] They later divorced in 2006.[when?]
Awards, honors and affiliations[edit]
In 2004, Time called Burnett one of the Most Influential People in the World Today.[27] Burnett was also named "Philanthropist of the Year" by the Reality Cares Foundation. He has won both Brandweek's "Marketer of the Year Award", the prestigious Rose d’Or Frapa Format Award, the Brandon Tartikoff Legacy Award and the Norman Lear Award from the Producers Guild of America.
Burnett served for two years on the Board of Directors for the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.[28] In November 2007, Burnett was elected into the Broadcast & Cable Hall of Fame and in 2008, it was announced that he would be honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. On 8 July 2009, Burnett received a star at 6664 Hollywood Blvd.[29] In June 2011, Burnett was elected into the Producers Guild of America Council Board of Delegates and currently serves on the Producers Council. He is an ambassador for Operation Smile.

Early life[edit]
Burnett was born on 17 July 1960 in London, the only child of Archie and Jean Burnett, both Ford Motors factory workers,[3] and was raised in Dagenham, Essex. His father was a Roman Catholic and his mother was a Presbyterian, although it is not known in which denomination he was raised.[4][5] Aged 17, he enlisted in the British Army, and became a Section Commander in the Parachute Regiment. From 1978–82 he served with the 3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment in C Company and saw action during the Falklands War.[3]
Early career[edit]
In October 1982, Burnett emigrated to the United States, where his friend Nick Hill, who had emigrated from the UK several years earlier, was working as a nanny and chauffeur. Hill knew of an open position for a live-in nanny with the Jaeger family in affluent Beverly Hills. Despite having no experience as a nanny, Burnett went on the interview. The Jaegers, realizing the advantage of having a nanny and security at the same time, hired him. After a year of working for the Jaegers, he moved on to another family in the beach city of Malibu, California, taking care of two boys for $250 a week. He was eventually given a position in the insurance office owned by Burt, the father of the two boys. Two years later, Burnett rented a portion of a fence at Venice Beach in Los Angeles, and sold T-shirts for $18 each during weekends. Realizing he made more money selling T-shirts, he left his insurance job.[6] In 1991, Burnett, and four others joined a French adventure competition, the Raid Gauloises. Afterward, Burnett saw a business opportunity in holding similar competitions. He purchased the format rights and brought a similar competition, Eco-Challenge, to America. Eco-Challenge launched Burnett's career as a television producer.[3]
Productions[edit]
Burnett is best known for producing the hit reality show Survivor, which premiered in the summer of 2000 and was the most watched summer series since Sonny and Cher.[7] Survivor was named the Number 1 reality series of all time by Entertainment Weekly in 2009.[8]
In 2004, NBC premiered The Apprentice, a reality television series in which contestants competed for a job under real estate magnate and future President Donald Trump.[9] The Apprentice spawned numerous licensed international versions of the show.
Burnett has produced several other television franchises including: Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?, Shark Tank, and The Voice.[10] He has maintained a strong presence in award show franchises, having produced the MTV Movie Awards (2007–2011), the annual People's Choice Awards (2010–2017), the Spike Video Game Awards (2011 & 2012) and the 2011 Primetime Emmy Awards.[citation needed]
Burnett has produced more than 3,200 hours of television programming which regularly airs in more than 70 countries.[11] Past shows include "Celebrity Apprentice (NBC), Bully Beatdown, Combat Missions, The Contender, The Contender Asia, Expedition Africa, Expedition Impossible, How'd You Get So Rich?, Martha Stewart, My Dad Is Better Than Your Dad, On the Lot (a collaboration with Steven Spielberg), The Restaurant, Rock Star, Sarah Palin's Alaska, Stars Earn Stripes, Starmaker, Toughest Cowboy, and Wedding Day.
As well as his ongoing productions, Burnett and his wife, actress Roma Downey, produced The Bible, a 10-hour History Channel drama based upon stories of the Bible.[12] The Bible became the No. 1 new series on cable TV in 2013[13] and was the No. 1 series in Canada, Spain, and Portugal.[14] In total, with subsequent airings, The Bible was seen by more than 100 million viewers.[15]
After the success of The Bible, Burnett and Downey started developing more faith-based scripted series. A.D. The Bible Continues premiered on NBC on Easter Sunday 2015, and The Dovekeepers miniseries aired on CBS in Spring 2015.
In October 2013, NBC announced that it has reached a deal with Burnett and Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic to produce a television series on which contestants will compete to win a spaceflight aboard SpaceShipTwo. The series will be titled Space Race, although it is currently undeterminable when the show will begin airing.[16]
In September 2014, MGM acquired a 55 percent interest in One Three Media and LightWorkers Media, both operated by Burnett and his wife. The two companies will be consolidated into a new film and television company, United Artists Media Group. Burnett is UAMG's CEO and Downey is president of LightWorkers Media.[17]
In December 2015, Burnett was named president of MGM Television and Digital Group, signing a five-year deal. Burnett's appointment was set up to occur simultaneously with the closing of MGM's acquisition of the remaining 45 percent of Hearst's, Burnett's and Roma Downey‘s interests in United Artists Media Group (UAMG), which will be absorbed under the MGM Television Group umbrella. MGM Television will now have numerous unscripted and scripted television shows airing on network and cable or in production including: The Voice (NBC); Survivor (CBS); Shark Tank (ABC); Beyond the Tank (ABC); Celebrity Apprentice (NBC); Fargo (FX);Vikings (HISTORY); Teen Wolf (MTV); 500 Questions (ABC); The People's Choice Awards (CBS); Lucha Underground (El Rey Network) and America's Greatest Makers (INTEL/Turner).[18]
In 2016, Burnett produced the film Ben-Hur, a film adaptation of the novel Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ.[9] The film was a box office flop.[9]
Personal life[edit]
In January 2004, Burnett began dating Downey. In November 2006, while the two were vacationing with their children in Zihuatanejo, Mexico, he proposed to her.[19] They wed on 28 April 2007 in their Malibu home. The ceremony was officiated by Downey's former co star, Della Reese.[20]
Burnett is an Evangelical christian.[21][22] Downey and him produced The Bible (miniseries) and are now co-owners of United Artists Media Group together with MGM and Hearst. In addition to their producing projects, the couple is heavily involved with philanthropic organizations Operation Smile and Compassion International.[23] In 2014, they announced a fundraising plan called Cradle of Christianity that aims to raise $25 million to help Iraqi and Syrian Christians and other minorities displaced by ISIL survive that upcoming winter.[24]
Burnett was previously married to Dianne J. Burnett (née Valentine); they have two sons, James and Cameron.[25] The couple filed for legal separation in September 2002 and a judgment for legal separation was granted in December 2003.[25][26] They later divorced in 2006.[when?]
Awards, honors and affiliations[edit]
In 2004, Time called Burnett one of the Most Influential People in the World Today.[27] Burnett was also named "Philanthropist of the Year" by the Reality Cares Foundation. He has won both Brandweek's "Marketer of the Year Award", the prestigious Rose d’Or Frapa Format Award, the Brandon Tartikoff Legacy Award and the Norman Lear Award from the Producers Guild of America.
Burnett served for two years on the Board of Directors for the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.[28] In November 2007, Burnett was elected into the Broadcast & Cable Hall of Fame and in 2008, it was announced that he would be honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. On 8 July 2009, Burnett received a star at 6664 Hollywood Blvd.[29] In June 2011, Burnett was elected into the Producers Guild of America Council Board of Delegates and currently serves on the Producers Council. He is an ambassador for Operation Smile.

Early life[edit]
Burnett was born on 17 July 1960 in London, the only child of Archie and Jean Burnett, both Ford Motors factory workers,[3] and was raised in Dagenham, Essex. His father was a Roman Catholic and his mother was a Presbyterian, although it is not known in which denomination he was raised.[4][5] Aged 17, he enlisted in the British Army, and became a Section Commander in the Parachute Regiment. From 1978–82 he served with the 3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment in C Company and saw action during the Falklands War.[3]
Early career[edit]
In October 1982, Burnett emigrated to the United States, where his friend Nick Hill, who had emigrated from the UK several years earlier, was working as a nanny and chauffeur. Hill knew of an open position for a live-in nanny with the Jaeger family in affluent Beverly Hills. Despite having no experience as a nanny, Burnett went on the interview. The Jaegers, realizing the advantage of having a nanny and security at the same time, hired him. After a year of working for the Jaegers, he moved on to another family in the beach city of Malibu, California, taking care of two boys for $250 a week. He was eventually given a position in the insurance office owned by Burt, the father of the two boys. Two years later, Burnett rented a portion of a fence at Venice Beach in Los Angeles, and sold T-shirts for $18 each during weekends. Realizing he made more money selling T-shirts, he left his insurance job.[6] In 1991, Burnett, and four others joined a French adventure competition, the Raid Gauloises. Afterward, Burnett saw a business opportunity in holding similar competitions. He purchased the format rights and brought a similar competition, Eco-Challenge, to America. Eco-Challenge launched Burnett's career as a television producer.[3]
Productions[edit]
Burnett is best known for producing the hit reality show Survivor, which premiered in the summer of 2000 and was the most watched summer series since Sonny and Cher.[7] Survivor was named the Number 1 reality series of all time by Entertainment Weekly in 2009.[8]
In 2004, NBC premiered The Apprentice, a reality television series in which contestants competed for a job under real estate magnate and future President Donald Trump.[9] The Apprentice spawned numerous licensed international versions of the show.
Burnett has produced several other television franchises including: Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?, Shark Tank, and The Voice.[10] He has maintained a strong presence in award show franchises, having produced the MTV Movie Awards (2007–2011), the annual People's Choice Awards (2010–2017), the Spike Video Game Awards (2011 & 2012) and the 2011 Primetime Emmy Awards.[citation needed]
Burnett has produced more than 3,200 hours of television programming which regularly airs in more than 70 countries.[11] Past shows include "Celebrity Apprentice (NBC), Bully Beatdown, Combat Missions, The Contender, The Contender Asia, Expedition Africa, Expedition Impossible, How'd You Get So Rich?, Martha Stewart, My Dad Is Better Than Your Dad, On the Lot (a collaboration with Steven Spielberg), The Restaurant, Rock Star, Sarah Palin's Alaska, Stars Earn Stripes, Starmaker, Toughest Cowboy, and Wedding Day.
As well as his ongoing productions, Burnett and his wife, actress Roma Downey, produced The Bible, a 10-hour History Channel drama based upon stories of the Bible.[12] The Bible became the No. 1 new series on cable TV in 2013[13] and was the No. 1 series in Canada, Spain, and Portugal.[14] In total, with subsequent airings, The Bible was seen by more than 100 million viewers.[15]
After the success of The Bible, Burnett and Downey started developing more faith-based scripted series. A.D. The Bible Continues premiered on NBC on Easter Sunday 2015, and The Dovekeepers miniseries aired on CBS in Spring 2015.
In October 2013, NBC announced that it has reached a deal with Burnett and Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic to produce a television series on which contestants will compete to win a spaceflight aboard SpaceShipTwo. The series will be titled Space Race, although it is currently undeterminable when the show will begin airing.[16]
In September 2014, MGM acquired a 55 percent interest in One Three Media and LightWorkers Media, both operated by Burnett and his wife. The two companies will be consolidated into a new film and television company, United Artists Media Group. Burnett is UAMG's CEO and Downey is president of LightWorkers Media.[17]
In December 2015, Burnett was named president of MGM Television and Digital Group, signing a five-year deal. Burnett's appointment was set up to occur simultaneously with the closing of MGM's acquisition of the remaining 45 percent of Hearst's, Burnett's and Roma Downey‘s interests in United Artists Media Group (UAMG), which will be absorbed under the MGM Television Group umbrella. MGM Television will now have numerous unscripted and scripted television shows airing on network and cable or in production including: The Voice (NBC); Survivor (CBS); Shark Tank (ABC); Beyond the Tank (ABC); Celebrity Apprentice (NBC); Fargo (FX);Vikings (HISTORY); Teen Wolf (MTV); 500 Questions (ABC); The People's Choice Awards (CBS); Lucha Underground (El Rey Network) and America's Greatest Makers (INTEL/Turner).[18]
In 2016, Burnett produced the film Ben-Hur, a film adaptation of the novel Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ.[9] The film was a box office flop.[9]
Personal life[edit]
In January 2004, Burnett began dating Downey. In November 2006, while the two were vacationing with their children in Zihuatanejo, Mexico, he proposed to her.[19] They wed on 28 April 2007 in their Malibu home. The ceremony was officiated by Downey's former co star, Della Reese.[20]
Burnett is an Evangelical christian.[21][22] Downey and him produced The Bible (miniseries) and are now co-owners of United Artists Media Group together with MGM and Hearst. In addition to their producing projects, the couple is heavily involved with philanthropic organizations Operation Smile and Compassion International.[23] In 2014, they announced a fundraising plan called Cradle of Christianity that aims to raise $25 million to help Iraqi and Syrian Christians and other minorities displaced by ISIL survive that upcoming winter.[24]
Burnett was previously married to Dianne J. Burnett (née Valentine); they have two sons, James and Cameron.[25] The couple filed for legal separation in September 2002 and a judgment for legal separation was granted in December 2003.[25][26] They later divorced in 2006.[when?]
Awards, honors and affiliations[edit]

He has won both Brandweek's "Marketer of the Year Award", the prestigious Rose d’Or Frapa Format Award, the Brandon Tartikoff Legacy Award and the Norman Lear Award from the Producers Guild of America.
Burnett served for two years on the Board of Directors for the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.[28] In November 2007, Burnett was elected into the Broadcast & Cable Hall of Fame and in 2008, it was announced that he would be honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. On 8 July 2009, Burnett received a star at 6664 Hollywood Blvd.[29] In June 2011, Burnett was elected into the Producers Guild of America Council Board of Delegates and currently serves on the Producers Council. He is an ambassador for Operation Smile.

GLAAD Media Award


 28th GLAAD Media Awards



GLAAD Media Award statuette



Awarded for
Outstanding representations of the LGBT community in media


Country
United States


Presented by
Gay & Lesbian Alliance
Against Defamation


First awarded
1990


Website
www.glaad.org/mediaawards


The GLAAD Media Award is an accolade bestowed by the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) to recognize and honor various branches of the media for their outstanding representations of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community and the issues that affect their lives.[1] In addition to film and television, the Awards also recognize achievements in other branches of the media and arts, including theatre, music, journalism and advertising.[2]
Honorees are selected by a process involving over 700 GLAAD Media Award voters and volunteers and are evaluated using four criteria: "Fair, Accurate and Inclusive Representations" of the LGBT community, "Boldness and Originality" of the project, significant "Cultural Impact" on mainstream culture, and "Overall Quality" of the project. Results are then certified by a "Review Panel" who determine the final list of recipients based on voting results and their own "expert opinions".[3][4]
The 1st GLAAD Media Awards ceremony honoring the 1989 season was held in 1990, and recognized 34 nominees in 7 competitive categories.[5]

History[edit]
The first GLAAD Media Awards were presented by the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation in 1990 to honor the 1989 season, and were envisioned as a way to recognize various branches of the media for their fair, accurate and inclusive representations of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community and the issues that affect their lives.[6]
The 1st Annual Awards ceremony recognized 34 nominees in 7 competitive categories and was a relatively "small" affair.[6] At the 20th Annual Awards ceremony presented in 2009, GLAAD Award Honoree, Phil Donahue said of the first Annual ceremony – “It’s unbelievable to think about the power and the warp speed of this revolution. Twenty years ago when I proudly accepted the first GLAAD Media Award…it was a very small crowd. There are more photographers here tonight than there were people then".[7][8]
For the first six years, winners were announced prior to the ceremony. Beginning with the 7th Annual Awards held in 1996, the change was made to its current format, announcing the winners in competitive categories at the ceremony. The 15th Annual Awards held in 2004 marked the first year nominations were expanded to recognize media in Spanish-language categories.[6] The 16th Annual Awards held in 2005 marked the first year that the ceremonies were televised, first airing on the LGBT-themed Logo channel on July 24, 2005.[9]
Statuette[edit]
The original GLAAD Media Award stood approximately 6-inches (15 cm) tall, consisting of a flat, 5-inch (13 cm) square shaped crystal sculpture with a design of five concentric circles on a "newsprint" background. The sculpture was traditionally etched with the year it was presented followed by the words "GLAAD Media Award" and was mounted perpendicular to its flat, quadrant shaped base.[7][10][11]
The award remained unchanged until 2009, when an all new statuette designed by David Moritz of Society Awards was unveiled for the 20th annual GLAAD Media Awards ceremonies. The current statuette stands 12-inches (30.5 cm) tall, consisting of a 9-inch (23 cm) die-cast zinc sculpture, hand finished with a satin texture, plated with a nickel and rhodium finish, and mounted on a 3-inch (7.6 cm) tall, black-stained ash, trapezoidal shaped base.[7][12]
Nomination[edit]
Nominees are selected by GLAAD "Nominating Juries" consisting of over 90 volunteers with interest and expertise in the particular category they are judging. Nominating Juries may select up to five nominees in each category. If no projects are deemed worthy of nomination in a particular category, the jury may choose to not award that category. At the end of the year, the Nominating Juries submit their list of recommended nominees to GLAAD's staff and Board of Directors for approval.[3][4]
In addition to media monitoring by the juries, GLAAD issues a "Call for Entries", inviting media outlets to submit their work for consideration, however, GLAAD may nominate a mainstream media project even if it is not submitted as part of the call for entries. GLAAD does not monitor media created by and for the LGBT community for defamation, therefore media outlets created by and for an LGBT audience must submit in order to be considered for nomination.[3][4]
Candidates considered for nomination are evaluated using four criteria: "Fair, Accurate and Inclusive Representations" – meaning that the diversity of the LGBT community is represented, "Boldness and Originality" – meaning the project breaks new ground by exploring LGBT subject matter in non-traditional ways, "Cultural Impact" – meaning the project impacts an audience that may not regularly be exposed to LGBT issues, and "Overall Quality" – A project of extremely high quality which adds impact and significance to the images and issues portrayed.[3][4]
Selection[edit]
Over 600 GLAAD Media Award voters participate in the selection of Honorees from the pool of Nominees in each category via online balloting. Voters are made up of three groups: GLAAD staff and board, GLAAD Alliance and Media Circle members, and GLAAD volunteers & allies (which include former Honorees, media industry allies, volunteers from the "Nominating Juries" and "Event Production Teams").[3][4]
These results are then reviewed for certification by a "Review Panel" which consists of the GLAAD Board co-chairs, senior GLAAD program and communications staff, and media industry experts. Members of the Review Panel are expected to view all of the nominees in each category, and the final list of award recipients is determined by the Review Panel based on the results of the online balloting and their own "expert opinions".[3][4]
Categories[edit]
The first Annual Awards recognized Honorees in just 7 competitive categories, all for television.[6] Over the years, the competitive categories have been expanded to recognize various other branches of the media including, film, theatre, music, print media, digital media, and advertising, as well as establishing additional categories recognizing Spanish-language media and a "Special Recognition" category for media representations that may not meet the criteria of pre-existing categories.[2]
While many of the categories have been expanded over time, several early categories have been "merged" or phased out altogether. One notable example being the omission of the "Outstanding Daytime Drama" category in 2011, reflecting the steady decline in popularity of English-language daytime soaps. As of 2011, GLAAD considers nominations in a total of 26 English-language categories and 12 Spanish-language categories, however, If no projects within a category are deemed worthy of recognition, GLAAD may choose to not award the category that year.[2][3] As of 2011, these 38 competitive categories are:

Special awards[edit]
In addition to the GLAAD Media Awards' competitive categories, special non-competitive "Honorary Awards" have also been presented since the first Awards ceremony. Beginning with just one Honorary Award, then known as the "Special Honoree Award" presented at the first annual GLAAD Media Awards, the Honorary Awards have also been expanded to recognize the diversity of contributions of respective Honorees. The most notable of these Special Honorary Awards are:

Advocate for Change Award – Presented at the Los Angeles GLAAD Media Awards in 2013. Its inaugural recipient was former U.S. President Bill Clinton for his record of promoting tolerance, including advocating for marriage equality and calling for the Supreme Court of the United States to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act.[13]
Davidson/Valentini Award – Presented annually at the San Francisco GLAAD Media Awards. It is named in memory of Craig Davidson, GLAAD's first executive director, and his partner Michael Valentini, a GLAAD supporter.

The award is given to an openly LGBT member of the entertainment or media community for his or her work toward eliminating homophobia.
Vanguard Award – Presented annually at the Los Angeles GLAAD Media Awards. It is presented to a member of the entertainment community who has made a significant difference in promoting equal rights for LGBT people.

Ceremony[edit]




GLAAD Media Award Honoree Laverne Cox at the 25th GLAAD Media Awards, Los Angeles, April 12, 2014.


Award recipients are announced at the annual GLAAD Media Awards banquet ceremonies usually held in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco to honor achievements from January 1 to December 31 of the previous calendar year.[3][4] Over the years, ceremonies have also been held in Washington, D.C. and Miami. Each year's hosts and presenters are usually selected from former Honorees, celebrities and/or prominent public figures known for their contributions to the LGBT community.
The announcement of award recipients in all competitive categories is withheld until the ceremonies. Although presented annually in three cities, time constraints dictate that not all of the awards are presented onstage. Categories presented onstage in their respective cities are chosen to reflect the range of GLAAD's work with the media, representing a mix of entertainment, news, and Spanish-language awards. Recipients who are not announced onstage are instead announced by a listing in the ceremony's program book.[4]
The 16th Annual Awards held in 2005 were the first year that the ceremonies were televised, first airing on the Logo channel on July 24, 2005.[9] Logo continued to air the telecast annually, editing together each city's respective ceremonies for each year into one annual show, as well as airing a retrospective special in 2005 titled "The Best of the GLAAD Media Awards" which documented the history of the first 15 years of the Awards. Logo ceased to televise the ceremony in 2008 when the Bravo network acquired exclusive broadcast rights to air the 19th Annual Awards telecast.[14]

Early life[edit]
Burnett was born on 17 July 1960 in London, the only child of Archie and Jean Burnett, both Ford Motors factory workers,[3] and was raised in Dagenham, Essex. His father was a Roman Catholic and his mother was a Presbyterian, although it is not known in which denomination he was raised.[4][5] Aged 17, he enlisted in the British Army, and became a Section Commander in the Parachute Regiment. From 1978–82 he served with the 3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment in C Company and saw action during the Falklands War.[3]
Early career[edit]
In October 1982, Burnett emigrated to the United States, where his friend Nick Hill, who had emigrated from the UK several years earlier, was working as a nanny and chauffeur. Hill knew of an open position for a live-in nanny with the Jaeger family in affluent Beverly Hills. Despite having no experience as a nanny, Burnett went on the interview. The Jaegers, realizing the advantage of having a nanny and security at the same time, hired him. After a year of working for the Jaegers, he moved on to another family in the beach city of Malibu, California, taking care of two boys for $250 a week. He was eventually given a position in the insurance office owned by Burt, the father of the two boys. Two years later, Burnett rented a portion of a fence at Venice Beach in Los Angeles, and sold T-shirts for $18 each during weekends. Realizing he made more money selling T-shirts, he left his insurance job.[6] In 1991, Burnett, and four others joined a French adventure competition, the Raid Gauloises. Afterward, Burnett saw a business opportunity in holding similar competitions. He purchased the format rights and brought a similar competition, Eco-Challenge, to America. Eco-Challenge launched Burnett's career as a television producer.[3]
Productions[edit]
Burnett is best known for producing the hit reality show Survivor, which premiered in the summer of 2000 and was the most watched summer series since Sonny and Cher.[7] Survivor was named the Number 1 reality series of all time by Entertainment Weekly in 2009.[8]
In 2004, NBC premiered The Apprentice, a reality television series in which contestants competed for a job under real estate magnate and future President Donald Trump.[9] The Apprentice spawned numerous licensed international versions of the show.
Burnett has produced several other television franchises including: Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?, Shark Tank, and The Voice.[10] He has maintained a strong presence in award show franchises, having produced the MTV Movie Awards (2007–2011), the annual People's Choice Awards (2010–2017), the Spike Video Game Awards (2011 & 2012) and the 2011 Primetime Emmy Awards.[citation needed]
Burnett has produced more than 3,200 hours of television programming which regularly airs in more than 70 countries.[11] Past shows include "Celebrity Apprentice (NBC), Bully Beatdown, Combat Missions, The Contender, The Contender Asia, Expedition Africa, Expedition Impossible, How'd You Get So Rich?, Martha Stewart, My Dad Is Better Than Your Dad, On the Lot (a collaboration with Steven Spielberg), The Restaurant, Rock Star, Sarah Palin's Alaska, Stars Earn Stripes, Starmaker, Toughest Cowboy, and Wedding Day.
As well as his ongoing productions, Burnett and his wife, actress Roma Downey, produced The Bible, a 10-hour History Channel drama based upon stories of the Bible.[12] The Bible became the No. 1 new series on cable TV in 2013[13] and was the No. 1 series in Canada, Spain, and Portugal.[14] In total, with subsequent airings, The Bible was seen by more than 100 million viewers.[15]
After the success of The Bible, Burnett and Downey started developing more faith-based scripted series. A.D. The Bible Continues premiered on NBC on Easter Sunday 2015, and The Dovekeepers miniseries aired on CBS in Spring 2015.
In October 2013, NBC announced that it has reached a deal with Burnett and Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic to produce a television series on which contestants will compete to win a spaceflight aboard SpaceShipTwo. The series will be titled Space Race, although it is currently undeterminable when the show will begin airing.[16]
In September 2014, MGM acquired a 55 percent interest in One Three Media and LightWorkers Media, both operated by Burnett and his wife. The two companies will be consolidated into a new film and television company, United Artists Media Group. Burnett is UAMG's CEO and Downey is president of LightWorkers Media.[17]
In December 2015, Burnett was named president of MGM Television and Digital Group, signing a five-year deal. Burnett's appointment was set up to occur simultaneously with the closing of MGM's acquisition of the remaining 45 percent of Hearst's, Burnett's and Roma Downey‘s interests in United Artists Media Group (UAMG), which will be absorbed under the MGM Television Group umbrella. MGM Television will now have numerous unscripted and scripted television shows airing on network and cable or in production including: The Voice (NBC); Survivor (CBS); Shark Tank (ABC); Beyond the Tank (ABC); Celebrity Apprentice (NBC); Fargo (FX);Vikings (HISTORY); Teen Wolf (MTV); 500 Questions (ABC); The People's Choice Awards (CBS); Lucha Underground (El Rey Network) and America's Greatest Makers (INTEL/Turner).[18]
In 2016, Burnett produced the film Ben-Hur, a film adaptation of the novel Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ.[9] The film was a box office flop.[9]
Personal life[edit]
In January 2004, Burnett began dating Downey. In November 2006, while the two were vacationing with their children in Zihuatanejo, Mexico, he proposed to her.[19] They wed on 28 April 2007 in their Malibu home. The ceremony was officiated by Downey's former co star, Della Reese.[20]
Burnett is an Evangelical christian.[21][22] Downey and him produced The Bible (miniseries) and are now co-owners of United Artists Media Group together with MGM and Hearst. In addition to their producing projects, the couple is heavily involved with philanthropic organizations Operation Smile and Compassion International.[23] In 2014, they announced a fundraising plan called Cradle of Christianity that aims to raise $25 million to help Iraqi and Syrian Christians and other minorities displaced by ISIL survive that upcoming winter.[24]
Burnett was previously married to Dianne J. Burnett (née Valentine); they have two sons, James and Cameron.[25] The couple filed for legal separation in September 2002 and a judgment for legal separation was granted in December 2003.[25][26] They later divorced in 2006.[when?]
Awards, honors and affiliations[edit]
In 2004, Time called Burnett one of the Most Influential People in the World Today.[27] Burnett was also named "Philanthropist of the Year" by the Reality Cares Foundation. He has won both Brandweek's "Marketer of the Year Award", the prestigious Rose d’Or Frapa Format Award, the Brandon Tartikoff Legacy Award and the Norman Lear Award from the Producers Guild of America.
Burnett served for two years on the Board of Directors for the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.[28] In November 2007, Burnett was elected into the Broadcast & Cable Hall of Fame and in 2008, it was announced that he would be honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. On 8 July 2009, Burnett received a star at 6664 Hollywood Blvd.[29] In June 2011, Burnett was elected into the Producers Guild of America Council Board of Delegates and currently serves on the Producers Council. He is an ambassador for Operation Smile.

Personal Quotes (3)

      When I arrived [in America] a friend of mine had a chauffeur job in Beverly Hills and it seemed like an easy thing, except for there were no jobs. The only position I could get was childcare. I thought I'd do it for two weeks. It was two years later before I moved on from nanny.


      What I always thought growing up, which I think a lot of people feel, was that the Bible was like a rule book and - if I stepped left or right - a lightning bolt might hit me. But actually it's a love story. I'm hoping that, while 'Son of God' is an epic movie and a political thriller, it's still got this intimate, personal love story.


      I don't know what 'reality TV' means, but unscripted dramas are made on a pretty large scale, with multiple helicopters and a crew of about 400.

After immigrating to the United States in his early 20s, Burnett worked as a nanny and in sales before creating and producing the adventure competition television series Eco Challenge. He has gone on to produce a variety of hit TV series, including Survivor, The Apprentice, The Voice, Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?, Shark Tank, Sarah Palin's Alaska and The Bible.Early Life and CareerJames Mark Burnett was born on July 17, 1960, in London, England. His father, Archie Burnett, is a former member of the Scottish Navy and worked at the Ford Motor Company. His mother, Jean Burnett, worked at a battery compound. Growing up, Mark Burnett was a big fan of American television series, including Starsky and Hutch and Bonanza. At the age of 17, he joined the British Army and became a section commander in the Parachute Regiment. After several years of service, in 1982, Burnett gave up his military career and moved to California, where he would take on a number of odd jobs, including as a nanny for wealthy families and selling T-shirts on Venice Beach, before finding success in TV. Eco-ChallengeBurnett experienced his first successful career venture in the early  1990s, when he created Eco-Challenge, a multi-day team competition  including racing, trekking, diving and horseback riding, and taking  place in Utah. According to Burnett, the event was inspired by the  French expedition race Raid Gauloises (in which he later competed—in the 1992 Oman Raid,  the 1993 Madagascar Raid and the 1994 Borneo Raid—as a member of Team American Pride).  The first Eco-Challenge event was held in 1995. That same year, Burnett  created and began producing a show documenting the event for USA  Network, Eco-Challenge (1995-2002). In 1999, Burnett received a Sports Emmy Award for best program achievement for his work on Eco-Challenge. Reality Television SuccessIn 2000, Mark Burnett acted as executive producer for Survivor, a reality TV show airing on CBS and loosely based on The Lord of the Flies,  the award-winning novel by William Golding. On the series, individuals compete for food and survival on an island for  a $1 million cash prize. The show became an immediate success, reaching  50 million viewers for the final episode of Season 1. Survivor has maintained a strong audience ever since, with its 28th season premiering in early 2014. Burnett went on to find more success with the hit show The Apprentice, starring Donald Trump. On the series, which began airing in 2004 on NBC, contestants compete for a one-year contract to run one of Trump's companies. A new Burnett creation, The Voice, a singing-competition show similar to American Idol, began airing on NBC in 2011. With stars like Adam Levine, Cee Lo Green and Christina Aguilera, the series immediately gained wide acclaim, entering its fourth season in 2013. 'The Bible' and 'Son of God'Also in 2013, Burnett created and served as executive producer of the popular History Channel miniseries . According to Burnett, he and wife Roma Downey, a Bible co-producer, feel that they were spiritually "called" to create the miniseries. "There were many people in Hollywood who said, 'You have several hit television shows. Why take on the Bible?' They failed to realize that it's not a business for us. This is a calling for us," he said, adding some words of advice: "Keep checking in. Ask yourself, 'Am I on the right path? Is this what I was called to do?' Most people who hear a call fail to take action or fail to keep checking their map. They get further and further away from their goal, their destination, and soon they are off course. Always check in." Burnett shared similar sentiments about Son of God, his 2014 film adaptation of The Bible, stating that the movie—for which he also shared production duties with Downey—represented a personal calling. "We feel pretty sure, over the next 30 or 40 years, not only will this movie be a regular, annual TV event, we expect this to be in 100 countries in 100 languages, and we're already discussing with people how to do that," Burnett said in a 2014 interview published by TheBlaze.com.Fact CheckWe strive for accuracy and fairness.

James Mabry Burnett






Submitted by bulletin1 on Wed, 06/07/2017 - 10:34am 

James Mabry Burnett
September 14, 1932 ~ May 11, 2017
James Mabry Burnett, born September 14, 1932, passed away peacefully Thursday, May 11,  surrounded by family.
James (Jim) was born and raised in Beaumont, one of three children born to the late Sam and Eunice Burnett. James graduated from French High School in 1950. He served in the U. S. Coast Guard for three years before meeting, Marie, his wife of 58 years.
In 1972 he settled in Liberty Hill with his family and became a small business owner. He purchased the local laundromat and opened a convenience store. The Corner Washateria and Corner Carry Out became a well known landmark and gathering spot in downtown Liberty Hill.
Always concerned about the youth in town, he added an arcade and pool tables at the back of the store so they had a place to go. He loved and encouraged not only his children, but all of them.
James was involved in the community. He volunteered for the fire departments in Liberty Hill and Bertram.  He was the first to attend and complete fire training school. He encouraged others to do the same. He gave blood regularly, earning recognition for giving more than 12 gallons through the years.
He volunteered his time recording books on tape at the library and served as a leader for scouting in Round Rock and Liberty Hill. He loved to read, loved old county music, and dancing.
The most important thing to him was family. James was a loving husband, father, uncle, grandfather, and friend. He was fiercely loyal and protective of those he loved. He touched many lives and will be remembered for his quick wit, sense of humor, love for words, and infectious smile.
He was preceded in death by his parents, his brother; Donathon Burnett; and sister, Wilma Patrick.
He is survived by his wife, Marie Burnett; children; LaRue Williams and husband Tommy; Rex Burnett and wife, Carol; Phyllis Burnett; Mark Burnett and wife, BJo; and Connie Burnett; sister-in-law, Patricia Burnett and brother-in-law, William Patrick, 11 grandchildren, 11 great grandchildren, two great-great grandchildren and many nieces and nephews.
A Celebration of Life was held Saturday, June 3, at Cross Tracks Church, a Methodist Community. The family requests donations in lieu of flowers made to Cross Tracks Church Youth Ministries.
Arrangements under the care of Edgar & Jenkins Family Funeral Home, Burnet.

The son of TV mogul Mark Burnett is recovering after being treated for a brain tumor.Cameron Burnett, 16, underwent surgery for the tumor last month, with his family and friends calling for prayers online.Mark, 54 - dubbed the father of reality TV - has made a reported $86 million fortune after bringing hits including The Apprentice, Survivor, The Voice and miniseries The Bible to our screens.Cameron's older brother James and his mother Dianne detailed the crisis they were swept into, as James wrote: 'We need all the love and prayers we can...as my brother  recovers from surgery.  





 Close: Mark Burnett stands between his sons, Cameron (left) and James (right) on a climbing expedition. After Cameron was diagnosed with a brain tumor, his brother posted the picture with the message: 'Top of the mountain, you can climb this one too'  





 Birthday boy: Cameron Burnett celebrates his 16th birthday in October with his mom Dianne 'They had to remove a growth in his pituitary gland which is located right under the brain, and has apparently been growing for the past ten years.'James said Cameron had gone through a nine-hour surgery, but still 'managed to crack a laugh', calling him: 'A strong man', and telling him: 'Cam, I love you.'Dianne, Mark's first wife, wrote on Facebook late last month:  'A new day. What we take for granted saying the simple words I love you came from Cameron's lips today. I am feeling so blessed. My heart filled with love and joy. Thank you God.'

Cameron was welcomed home earlier this month and today, Dianne told MailOnline: 'Cameron's doing much better, he's going to be absolutely perfect.'He is going to have some recovery time, but it won't be very long.'Multi-millionaire Mark, 54, is a Brit who found fame and fortune after moving to the States in 1982. He had his two sons James and Cameron with his second wife Dianne. And he married actress and producer Roma Downey, a fellow Brit, in 2007. Roma has a daughter called Reilly from her first marriage.

 Family man: Mark Burnett and wife Roma Downey and their children James, Reilly, and Cameron at the Operation Smile Gala at the Beverly Hilton on September 18, 2008 in Beverly Hills, CaliforniaHe was named one of Time's most influential people in the world today and has turned his major talents to the world of Christian entertainment.His History Channel miniseries, The Bible, won 13 million viewers when it debuted last year. So far it has been seen by more than 100 million viewers globally.Mark and his wife, Roma Downey, then released the movie Son of God, which grossed $68 million at the global box office. The couple is now helping Paramount and MGM make a big-budget remake of Ben-Hur and working on a sequel to The Bible, titled A.D.The couple have frequently  talked about their faith and both want the bible to be taught in public school in the US.Mark said: 'I grew up with a Presbyterian mom and a Catholic dad. And never a bad word between them. Especially on the subject of the Bible. I don’t remember ever as a kid not having bibles in our house.'Roma added: 'Faith is deeply important to me, has been since I was a child. I was raised in a family of faith. I’ve always found deep comfort in it, was particularly thrilled in the early ‘90’s to be cast to play an angel on “Touched by an Angel,” which as you know ran for almost 10 years and delivered a central message of God’s love. It was such a privilege to be the messenger on that and my old Irish father used to say 'the family that prays together stays together'.'

 British boys: James and Cameron Burnett in LondonSpeaking about The Bible, Mark said: 'We’ve approached this as God’s love story, God’s love of all of us. There’s only one perfect character in the entire 66 books. That’s Jesus Christ. Everybody else, to lesser or greater degrees, are flawed, like all of us.'And people have huge problems, I mean, in kings, but still God didn’t give up. And that’s the message. It’s like an unconditional love story.'In September 2014, movie studio MGM acquired a 55 per cent interest in One Three Media and Lightworkers Media, both run by Mark and Roma.The two companies have been consolidated into a new film and television company, United Artists Media Group. Burnett is UA's CEO and Roma is president of Lightworkers Media.
