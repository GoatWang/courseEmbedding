                Closed-end funds carry a certain level of risk for investors.
		 		
				Closed-end funds are traded on the secondary market through a stock exchange. The Closed-end fund's investment
                return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares may be worth more or less than the
                original cost. Shares of closed-end funds may trade above (a premium) or below (a discount) the net asset value
                (NAV) of the fund's portfolio.  The market price for a closed-end fund is based on supply and demand which
                fluctuates daily based on many factors, such as economic conditions and global events, investor sentiment, and
                security-specific factors. The possibility of a market decline should be considered market risk.
 				
				There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective and you can lose money by investing in a
                closed-end fund. Past performance does not guarantee future results.

    Returns represent past performance and do not guarantee future results. Current performance may be lower
    or higher than the performance data quoted. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so, upon
    redemption, shares may be worth more or less than their original cost. To obtain the most recent month end
    performance information and a prospectus, please call 800-GABELLI or visit www.gabelli.com 

	The performance does not reflect the full effect of the front-end or back-end sales charges.
	Quarterly (Standardized)
    performance reflects the full effect of the front-end sales charge. Other Period Performance does not
    reflect the full effect of the front-end or back-end sales charges. Please consult your financial advisor
    for prospectus and for more information on mutual fund sales charges.
	
	(a) Total returns and average annual returns reflect changes in share price, reinvestment of distributions,
	and are net of expenses. The net asset value of a Fund is
	reduced on the ex-dividend (payment) date by the amount if the dividend paid. Of course, returns represent
	past performance and do not guarantee future results. Investment returns and the principal value of an
	investment will fluctuate. When shares are redeemed they may be worth more or less than their original cost.
	Investing in small capitalization securities involves special challenges because these securities may trade
	less frequently and experience more abrupt price movements than large capitalization securities. Investing
	in micro capitalization securities may involve greater risks than investments in small, medium and large
	capitalization securities because the securities are subject to more abrupt or erratic movements in price.
	Investments in foreign securities involves risks not ordinarily associated with investments in domestic
	issues, including currency fluctuation, economic and political risks. Investing in gold is considered
	speculative and is affected by a variety of worldwide economic, financial and political factors. Funds
	concentrating in specific sectors may experience greater fluctuations in value than funds that are more
	diversified.
	

	(1) Maximum Sales Charge for Class A shares is a percentage of the initial investment and may be
	reduced based on the size of your investment. Class B and C shares have a contingent deferred sales charge
	when you redeem your shares depending on your holding period. Please see the Fund's Prospectus or contact
	your Adviser for a complete description of the applicable sales charge.
	

	(2) Gross Expense Ratio is the expenses of the Fund reflected as a percentage of the Fund's average
	daily net assets and do not include any voluntary or contractual fee waivers or expense limitations as
	described in the Fund Prospectus.
	

	(3) Net Expense Ratio is the expenses of the Fund including any voluntary or contractual fee waivers
	or expense limitations as a percentage of the Fund's average daily net assets. Where applicable, please see
	the Fund's Prospectus or contact your Adviser for a complete description of the fee waiver or expense
	limitation, the effective date and the expiration date.
	
	The Fund's share price will fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Fund's portfolio securities.
	Stocks are subject to market, economic and business risks that cause their prices to fluctuate. Investment
	returns and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate.  When you sell Fund shares, they may be worth
	less than what you paid for them. Consequently, you can lose money by investing in the Fund.
	

    Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund before
    investing. The prospectus, which contains more complete information about this and other matters, should be read
    carefully before investing. To obtain a prospectus, please call 800 GABELLI or visit www.gabelli.com .

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Multi Packaging Solutions Intrntnl Ltd (NYSE:MPSX) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?)

MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.20)Consensus Price Target: $17.00 (5.56% downside)

What are analysts saying about Energy Recovery stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Energy Recovery stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Based in San Leandro, California, ENERGY RECOVERY, INC. is a leading global developer and manufacturer of highly efficient energy recovery devices utilized in the water desalination industry. Energy Recovery, Inc. operates primarily in the sea water reverse osmosis segment of the desalination industry.ERI manufactures ultra-high efficiency recovery products and technology, specifically the ERI PX Pressure Exchanger, that are among the enabling technologies driving the rapid growth in seawater reverse osmosis desalination, and are helping to make desalination affordable worldwide.   " (7/10/2017)
2. FBR & Co analysts commented, "Last week, we hosted President and CEO Joel Gay, CFO Chris Gannon, and Managing Director, IR and Corporate Development Brian Uhlmer in meetings with clients. We heard encouraging updates across all three of the oil & gas division's current initiatives: design finalization and construction of the Gen-II missile in time for the VorTeq system to attempt its delayed first milestone (M1) in 3Q17; introduction this year of the second PX-derivative product for the oil & gas sector; and monetization traction in the GCC Middle East for the IsoBoost/IsoGen lines. At its present level, the stock is valuing these oil & gas opportunities, in aggregate, at ~$1/share and thus proffering a very attractive risk/reward entry point, in our view. ERII's water division and net cash position are worth $4.50 and $1.83, by our estimates." (3/28/2017)
3. Evercore ISI analysts commented, " A relatively new entrant to the OFS space, Energy Recovery is an energy solutions provider who leverages its expertise in fluid dynamics and advanced material sciences to arbitrage pressure energy. Through its IP-protected Pressure Exchanger (PX) technology, along with its various derivatives, Energy Recovery aims to create markets to preserve or eliminate pumps that are subject to, and destroyed by, hostile process fluids, and to convert wasted pressure energy into a reusable asset. In doing so, ERII seeks to reduce customer opex, capex, and downtime, allowing for quicker customer payback periods and significant margins and returns for ERII. While the company looks to diversify its story and investment case, investors will likely continue to focus on the VorTeq's path to commercialization, given the large potential NPV impact. According to our math, the current share price appraises a minimal likelihood of success, which we deem overly pessimistic, while acknowledging that many investors are likely willing to sacrifice initial upside and wait until M1 is achieved in 2H17 and more clarity is provided as to M2 and the commercialization timeline. We remain confident in commercialization and rate the shares Outperform with a $20 PT." (3/15/2017)
