Gary J. Grieco













                    
                    Gary J. Grieco is a professional engineer and a self-described Civil War history buff.  While he finds the war's military history interesting, it is the personalities of the participants and the startling quirks and coincidences that satisfy his appetite.  Sherman's Angels is Gary's first attempt at sharing his passion.http://www.northjersey.com/arts-and-entertainment/books/sherman-s-angels-blends-christmas-with-civil-war-author-1.1145023Merry Christmas to All!
