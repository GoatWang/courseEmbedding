Business model[edit]
As noted in the opening, Cedar has set itself up as a REIT which is an IRS-recognized taxable structure under which most of its assets must be in and revenue from real estate or related sources.[2] Essentially all of Cedar's revenue comes from rents and payments on long-term leases from tenants of their various properties.[2] As of December 2013[update], >90% of Cedar's gross leasable area was occupied.[2] Cedar's focus on "grocery-anchored community shopping centers" is predicated on the notion that people need to eat and purchase staples and will continue to need to do so into the future, thus providing a long term stable base for revenues.[2]
Cedar operates under a structure where substantially all of its assets have been contributed to a limited partnership, Cedar Realty Trust Partnership, L.P., which itself is a Delaware corporation.[2] As of December 2013[update], Cedar was the only partner in the Partnership and owned >99% of the contributed assets.[2]
As of December 2013[update], the top two tenants in terms of number of occupied locations were Dollar Tree and Giant Foods, with 22 and 13 locations, respectively.[5] Giant Foods also occupied the largest sq. footage overall and generated the most revenue for Cedar, accounting for ~12% of 2013 revenue.[5]
Acquisitions[edit]
Among the properties acquired by the company are:

In 2014


Quartermaster Plaza, 456,000 sq. ft. on 46 acres located in South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for US$92,300,000, purchased from Forest City Ratnor Companies of Cleveland, Ohio[4]


Before 2014


South Philadelphia Shopping Center, 283,000 sq. ft. located in South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, adjacent to Quartermaster Plaza acquired in 2014.[4]


In 2006


Harbor Square (known as "Shore Mall" at the time of purchase), ~344,800 sq. ft. on 124.6 acres located in Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey for US$36,500,000.[8] The property was originally constructed in 1968.[8]

Divestments[edit]
Among the properties sold by the company are:

In 2014


Harbor Square, to Aetna Realty of New York, for US$25,000,000; the property was originally acquired for $36 million.[8]

Business model[edit]
As noted in the opening, Cedar has set itself up as a REIT which is an IRS-recognized taxable structure under which most of its assets must be in and revenue from real estate or related sources.[2] Essentially all of Cedar's revenue comes from rents and payments on long-term leases from tenants of their various properties.[2] As of December 2013[update], >90% of Cedar's gross leasable area was occupied.[2] Cedar's focus on "grocery-anchored community shopping centers" is predicated on the notion that people need to eat and purchase staples and will continue to need to do so into the future, thus providing a long term stable base for revenues.[2]
Cedar operates under a structure where substantially all of its assets have been contributed to a limited partnership, Cedar Realty Trust Partnership, L.P., which itself is a Delaware corporation.[2] As of December 2013[update], Cedar was the only partner in the Partnership and owned >99% of the contributed assets.[2]
As of December 2013[update], the top two tenants in terms of number of occupied locations were Dollar Tree and Giant Foods, with 22 and 13 locations, respectively.[5] Giant Foods also occupied the largest sq. footage overall and generated the most revenue for Cedar, accounting for ~12% of 2013 revenue.[5]
Acquisitions[edit]
Among the properties acquired by the company are:

In 2014


Quartermaster Plaza, 456,000 sq. ft. on 46 acres located in South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for US$92,300,000, purchased from Forest City Ratnor Companies of Cleveland, Ohio[4]


Before 2014


South Philadelphia Shopping Center, 283,000 sq. ft. located in South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, adjacent to Quartermaster Plaza acquired in 2014.[4]


In 2006


Harbor Square (known as "Shore Mall" at the time of purchase), ~344,800 sq. ft. on 124.6 acres located in Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey for US$36,500,000.[8] The property was originally constructed in 1968.[8]

Divestments[edit]
Among the properties sold by the company are:

In 2014


Harbor Square, to Aetna Realty of New York, for US$25,000,000; the property was originally acquired for $36 million.[8]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Business model[edit]
As noted in the opening, Cedar has set itself up as a REIT which is an IRS-recognized taxable structure under which most of its assets must be in and revenue from real estate or related sources.[2] Essentially all of Cedar's revenue comes from rents and payments on long-term leases from tenants of their various properties.[2] As of December 2013[update], >90% of Cedar's gross leasable area was occupied.[2] Cedar's focus on "grocery-anchored community shopping centers" is predicated on the notion that people need to eat and purchase staples and will continue to need to do so into the future, thus providing a long term stable base for revenues.[2]
Cedar operates under a structure where substantially all of its assets have been contributed to a limited partnership, Cedar Realty Trust Partnership, L.P., which itself is a Delaware corporation.[2] As of December 2013[update], Cedar was the only partner in the Partnership and owned >99% of the contributed assets.[2]
As of December 2013[update], the top two tenants in terms of number of occupied locations were Dollar Tree and Giant Foods, with 22 and 13 locations, respectively.[5] Giant Foods also occupied the largest sq. footage overall and generated the most revenue for Cedar, accounting for ~12% of 2013 revenue.[5]
Acquisitions[edit]
Among the properties acquired by the company are:

In 2014


Quartermaster Plaza, 456,000 sq. ft. on 46 acres located in South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for US$92,300,000, purchased from Forest City Ratnor Companies of Cleveland, Ohio[4]


Before 2014


South Philadelphia Shopping Center, 283,000 sq. ft. located in South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, adjacent to Quartermaster Plaza acquired in 2014.[4]


In 2006


Harbor Square (known as "Shore Mall" at the time of purchase), ~344,800 sq. ft. on 124.6 acres located in Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey for US$36,500,000.[8] The property was originally constructed in 1968.[8]

Divestments[edit]
Among the properties sold by the company are:

In 2014


Harbor Square, to Aetna Realty of New York, for US$25,000,000; the property was originally acquired for $36 million.[8]

As noted in the opening, Cedar has set itself up as a REIT which is an IRS-recognized taxable structure under which most of its assets must be in and revenue from real estate or related sources.[2] Essentially all of Cedar's revenue comes from rents and payments on long-term leases from tenants of their various properties.[2] As of December 2013[update], >90% of Cedar's gross leasable area was occupied.[2] Cedar's focus on "grocery-anchored community shopping centers" is predicated on the notion that people need to eat and purchase staples and will continue to need to do so into the future, thus providing a long term stable base for revenues.[2]
Cedar operates under a structure where substantially all of its assets have been contributed to a limited partnership, Cedar Realty Trust Partnership, L.P., which itself is a Delaware corporation.[2] As of December 2013[update], Cedar was the only partner in the Partnership and owned >99% of the contributed assets.[2]
As of December 2013[update], the top two tenants in terms of number of occupied locations were Dollar Tree and Giant Foods, with 22 and 13 locations, respectively.[5] Giant Foods also occupied the largest sq. footage overall and generated the most revenue for Cedar, accounting for ~12% of 2013 revenue.[5]
Acquisitions[edit]
Among the properties acquired by the company are:

In 2014


Quartermaster Plaza, 456,000 sq. ft. on 46 acres located in South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for US$92,300,000, purchased from Forest City Ratnor Companies of Cleveland, Ohio[4]


Before 2014


South Philadelphia Shopping Center, 283,000 sq. ft. located in South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, adjacent to Quartermaster Plaza acquired in 2014.[4]


In 2006


Harbor Square (known as "Shore Mall" at the time of purchase), ~344,800 sq. ft. on 124.6 acres located in Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey for US$36,500,000.[8] The property was originally constructed in 1968.[8]

Divestments[edit]
Among the properties sold by the company are:

In 2014


Harbor Square, to Aetna Realty of New York, for US$25,000,000; the property was originally acquired for $36 million.[8]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
