SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the Commission's Public Reference Desk, 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549-0102 (telephone (202) 551-5850). 
Applicants' Representations 
1. The Trust is a statutory trust organized under the laws of the state of Delaware and is registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company. The Trust currently offers three series that intend to rely on the relief requested by the application: PAS Small Cap Fund of Funds, PAS International Fund of Funds, and PAS U.S. Opportunity Fund of Funds (“PAS Funds,” and each a “Fund of Funds”).[1] 
           Each PAS Fund operates as a fund of funds and has its own distinct investment objectives, policies and restrictions. 
2. SAI currently serves as the investment adviser to each PAS Fund. FMR and SAI are investment advisers registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”). FMTC is a “bank” within the meaning of section 202(a)(2) of the Advisers Act and, accordingly, is exempt from registration under the Advisers Act. Any future Adviser will be registered under the Advisers Act or exempt from registration. Each of FMR, FMTC, and SAI is a direct or indirect subsidiary of FMR Corp., a Massachusetts corporation. FDC and NFS are broker-dealers registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”). Each of FDC and NFS is a direct or indirect subsidiary of FMR Corp. FDC is currently the distributor of the PAS Funds. 
3. Applicants request relief to permit: (a) A Fund of Funds to acquire shares of registered open-end management investment companies that are not part of the same “group of investment companies” (as defined in section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the Act) as the Fund of Funds (the “Non-Affiliated Investment Companies”) and unit investment trusts (“UITs”) that are not part of the same group of investment companies as the Fund of Funds (“Non-Affiliated Trusts,” and together with the Non-Affiliated Investment Companies, the “Non-Affiliated Underlying Funds”); (b) the Non-Affiliated Underlying Funds, their principal underwriter and brokers and dealers registered under the Exchange Act (“Brokers”) to sell such shares to the Fund of Funds; (c) a Fund of Funds to acquire shares of certain other registered open-end management investment companies advised by the Adviser or series thereof and that are part of the same “group of investment companies” (as defined in section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the Act) as the Fund of Funds (“Affiliated Underlying Funds,” and together with the Non-Affiliated Underlying Funds, the “Underlying Funds”); and (d) the Affiliated Underlying Funds, their principal underwriter and Brokers to sell such shares to the Fund of Funds.[2] 

           Certain of the Non-Affiliated Underlying Funds Start Printed Page 56809may be registered under the Act as either UITs or open-end management investment companies and have received exemptive relief to permit their shares to be listed and traded on a national securities exchange at negotiated prices (“ETFs”). Each Fund of Funds also may invest in stocks, bonds, money market instruments and other securities and financial instruments that are consistent with its investment objective. 
Applicants' Legal Analysis 
A. Section 12(d)(1) 
1. Section 12(d)(1)(A) of the Act prohibits a registered investment company from acquiring shares of an investment company if the securities represent more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of the acquired company, more than 5% of the total assets of the acquiring company, or, together with the securities of any other investment companies, more than 10% of the total assets of the acquiring company. Section 12(d)(1)(B) of the Act prohibits a registered open-end investment company, its principal underwriter and any broker or dealer from selling the shares of the investment company to another investment company if the sale will cause the acquiring company to own more than 3% of the acquired company's voting stock, or if the sale will cause more than 10% of the acquired company's voting stock to be owned by investment companies generally. 
2. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions, from any provision of section 12(d)(1) if the exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors. Applicants seek an exemption under section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act to permit the Funds of Funds to acquire shares of the Underlying Funds and to permit the Underlying Funds, their principal underwriter and Brokers to sell shares to the Funds of Funds beyond the limits set forth in sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (B) of the Act. 
3. Applicants state that the proposed arrangement will not give rise to the policy concerns underlying sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (B), which include concerns about undue influence by a fund of funds over underlying funds, excessive layering of fees, and overly complex fund structures. Accordingly, applicants believe that the requested exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors. 
4. Applicants state that the proposed arrangement will not result in undue influence by a Fund of Funds or its affiliated persons over the Non-Affiliated Underlying Funds. The concern about undue influence does not arise in connection with a Fund of Funds' investment in the Affiliated Underlying Funds, since they are part of the same group of investment companies. To limit the control that a Fund of Funds may have over a Non-Affiliated Underlying Fund, applicants propose a condition prohibiting: (a) The Adviser and any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Adviser, any investment company or issuer that would be an investment company but for section 3(c)(1) or section 3(c)(7) of the Act, advised or sponsored by the Adviser or any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Adviser (collectively, the “Group”), and (b) any investment adviser to a Fund of Funds within the meaning of section 2(a)(20)(B) of the Act (“Subadviser”), any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Subadviser, and any investment company or issuer that would be an investment company but for section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Act (or portion of such investment company or issuer) advised or sponsored by the Subadviser or any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Subadviser (collectively, the “Subadviser Group”) from controlling (individually or in the aggregate) a Non-Affiliated Underlying Fund within the meaning of section 2(a)(9) of the Act. 
5. Applicants further state that condition 2 below precludes a Fund of Funds and its Adviser, Subadviser, promoter, principal underwriter and any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with any of these entities (each, a “Fund Affiliate”) from causing any existing or potential investment by the Fund of Funds in a Non-Affiliated Underlying Fund to influence the terms of any services or transactions between the Fund of Funds or a Fund Affiliate and the Non-Affiliated Underlying Fund or its investment adviser(s), sponsor, promoter, principal underwriter and any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with any of these entities (each, a “Non-Affiliated Fund Affiliate”). Non-Affiliated Underlying Funds will be prohibited from purchasing a security in an offering of securities during the existence of any underwriting or selling syndicate of which a principal underwriter is an officer, director, member of an advisory board, Adviser, Subadviser, or employee of the Fund of Funds, or a person of which any such officer, director, member of an advisory board, Adviser, Subadviser, or employee is an affiliated person (each, an “Underwriting Affiliate,” except any person whose relationship to the Non-Affiliated Underlying Fund is covered by section 10(f) of the Act is not an Underwriting Affiliate). An offering of securities during the existence of an underwriting or selling syndicate of which a principal underwriter is an Underwriting Affiliate is an “Affiliated Underwriting.” 
6. Applicants also propose a condition that once an investment by a Fund of Funds in the securities of a Non-Affiliated Investment Company exceeds the limit in section 12(d)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, the board of directors or trustees of the Non-Affiliated Investment Company, including a majority of the independent directors or trustees, will determine that any consideration paid by the Non-Affiliated Investment Company to the Fund of Funds or a Fund Affiliate Service Provider [3] 
           in connection with any services or transactions: (a) Is fair and reasonable in relation to the nature and quality of the services and benefits received by the Non-Affiliated Investment Company; (b) is within the range of consideration that the Non-Affiliated Investment Company would be required to pay to another unaffiliated entity in connection with the same services or transactions; and (c) does not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned. 
7. To further assure that a Non-Affiliated Investment Company understands the implications of an investment by a Fund of Funds under the requested order, prior to a Fund of Funds' investment in a Non-Affiliated Investment Company in excess of the limit in section 12(d)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, the Fund of Funds and Non-Affiliated Investment Company will execute an agreement stating, without limitation, Start Printed Page 56810that their boards of directors or trustees and their investment advisers understand the terms and conditions of the order and agree to fulfill their responsibilities under the order (“Participation Agreement”). Applicants note that a Non-Affiliated Underlying Fund (other than an ETF whose shares are purchased by a Fund of Funds in the secondary market) will retain the right to reject an investment from a Fund of Funds.[4] 

8. Applicants do not believe that the proposed arrangement will involve excessive layering of fees. With respect to investment advisory fees, applicants state that, prior to approving any investment advisory contract under section 15 of the Act, the board of trustees of the Fund of Funds (the “Board”), including a majority of the trustees who are not “interested persons,” as defined in section 2(a)(19) of the Act (the “Independent Trustees”), will find that the investment advisory fees charged under the Fund of Fund's investment advisory contract are based on services provided that are in addition to, rather than duplicative of, services provided pursuant to any Underlying Fund's advisory contract(s). Applicants further state that the Adviser or Distributor will waive fees otherwise payable to it by a Fund of Funds in an amount at least equal to any compensation (including fees received pursuant to any plan adopted by a Non-Affiliated Investment Company under rule 12b-1 under the Act) received from a Non-Affiliated Underlying Fund by the Adviser, or an affiliated person of the Adviser, other than any advisory fees paid to the Adviser or its affiliated person by the Non-Affiliated Investment Company, in connection with the investment by the Fund of Funds in the Non-Affiliated Underlying Fund. Applicants also state that any sales charges and/or service fees, as defined in Rule 2830 of the Conduct Rules of the NASD (“NASD Conduct Rule 2830”), charged with respect to shares of a Fund of Funds will not exceed the limits applicable to a funds of funds set forth in NASD Conduct Rule 2830. 
9. Applicants state that the proposed arrangement will not create an overly complex fund structure. Applicants note that an Underlying Fund will be prohibited from acquiring securities of any investment company or company relying on section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Act in excess of the limits contained in section 12(d)(1)(A), except in certain circumstances identified in condition 10 below. Applicants also represent that a Fund of Funds' prospectus and sales literature will contain concise, “plain English” disclosure designed to inform investors about the unique characteristics of the proposed arrangement, including its expense structure and the additional expenses of investing in Underlying Funds.[5] 

B. Section 17(a) 
10. Section 17(a) of the Act generally prohibits sales or purchases of securities between a registered investment company and any affiliated person of the company. Section 2(a)(3) of the Act defines an “affiliated person” of another person to include: (a) Any person directly or indirectly owning, controlling, or holding with power to vote, 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the other person; (b) any person 5% or more of whose outstanding voting securities are directly or indirectly owned, controlled, or held with power to vote by the other person; and (c) any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the other person. 
11. Applicants state that if a Funds of Funds and an Affiliated Underlying Fund were deemed to be under common control, they would be affiliated persons of each another. Applicants also state that a Funds of Funds and an Underlying Fund might be deemed to be affiliated persons of one another if a Fund of Funds acquires 5% or more of an Underlying Fund's outstanding voting securities. In light of these possible affiliations, section 17(a) could prevent an Underlying Fund from selling shares to and redeeming shares from a Fund of Funds.[6] 

12. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to grant an order permitting a transaction otherwise prohibited by section 17(a) if it finds that (a) The terms of the proposed transaction are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (b) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of each registered investment company involved; and (c) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act. Section 6(c) of the Act permits the Commission to exempt any person or transactions from any provision of the Act if such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. 
13. Applicants submit that the proposed transactions satisfy the standards for relief under sections 17(b) and 6(c) of the Act as the terms are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching.[7] 
           Applicants note that the terms upon which an Underlying Fund will sell its shares to or purchase its shares from a Fund of Funds will be based on the net asset value of each Underlying Fund. Applicants state that the proposed arrangement will be consistent with the policies of each Fund of Funds and Underlying Fund, and with the general purposes of the Act. 
Applicants' Conditions 
Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions: 
1. The members of the Group will not control (individually or in the aggregate) a Non-Affiliated Underlying Fund within the meaning of section 2(a)(9) of the Act. The members of the Subadviser Group will not control (individually or in the aggregate) a Non-Affiliated Underlying Fund within the meaning of section 2(a)(9) of the Act. If, as a result of a decrease in the outstanding voting securities of a Non-Affiliated Underlying Fund, the Group or the Subadviser Group, each in the aggregate, becomes a holder of more than 25% of the outstanding voting securities of a Non-Affiliated Underlying Fund, it will vote its shares of the Non-Affiliated Underlying Fund in the same proportion as the vote of all other holders of the Non-Affiliated Underlying Fund's shares. This condition will not apply to the Start Printed Page 56811Subadviser Group with respect to a Non-Affiliated Underlying Fund for which the Subadviser or a person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Subadviser, acts as the investment adviser within the meaning section 2(a)(20)(A) of the Act (in the case of a Non-Affiliated Investment Company) or as the sponsor (in the case of a Non-Affiliated Trust). 
2. No Fund of Funds or Fund Affiliate will cause any existing or potential investment by the Fund of Funds in a Non-Affiliated Underlying Fund to influence the terms of any services or transactions between the Fund of Funds or a Fund Affiliate and the Non-Affiliated Underlying Fund or a Non-Affiliated Fund Affiliate. 
3. The Board of the Fund of Funds, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, will adopt procedures reasonably designed to assure that the Adviser and any Subadviser are conducting the investment program of the Fund of Funds without taking into account any consideration received by the Fund of Funds or a Fund Affiliate from a Non-Affiliated Underlying Fund or a Non-Affiliated Fund Affiliate in connection with any services or transactions. 
4. Once an investment by a Fund of Funds in the securities of a Non-Affiliated Investment Company exceeds the limit in section 12(d)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, the board of directors or trustees of the Non-Affiliated Investment Company, including a majority of the independent directors or trustees, will determine that any consideration paid by the Non-Affiliated Investment Company to the Fund of Funds or a Fund Affiliate Service Provider in connection with any services or transactions: (a) Is fair and reasonable in relation to the nature and quality of the services and benefits received by the Non-Affiliated Investment Company; (b) is within the range of consideration that the Non-Affiliated Investment Company would be required to pay to another unaffiliated entity in connection with the same services or transactions; and (c) does not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned. This condition does not apply with respect to any services or transactions between a Non-Affiliated Investment Company and its investment adviser(s), or any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such investment adviser(s). 
5. No Non-Affiliated Underlying Fund will purchase a security in any Affiliated Underwriting. 
6. Before investing in a Non-Affiliated Investment Company in excess of the limit in section 12(d)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, the Fund of Funds and the Non-Affiliated Investment Company will execute a Participation Agreement stating, without limitation, that their boards of directors or trustees and their investment advisers understand the terms and conditions of the order and agree to fulfill their responsibilities under the order. At the time of its investment in shares of a Non-Affiliated Investment Company in excess of the limit in section 12(d)(1)(A)(i), the Fund of Funds will notify the Non-Affiliated Investment Company of the investment. At such time, the Fund of Funds will also transmit to the Non-Affiliated Investment Company a list of the names of each Fund Affiliate Service Provider. The Fund of Funds will notify the Non-Affiliated Investment Company of any changes to the list of names as soon as reasonably practicable after a change occurs. The Non-Affiliated Investment Company and the Fund of Funds will maintain and preserve a copy of the order, the Participation Agreement, and the list with any updated information for the duration of the investment and for a period of not less than six years thereafter, the first two years in an easily accessible place. 
7. Before approving any advisory contract under section 15 of the Act, the Board of the Fund of Funds, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, will find that the advisory fees charged under the advisory contract will be based on services provided that will be in addition to, rather than duplicative of, services provided under the advisory contract(s) of any Underlying Fund in which the Fund of Funds may invest. These findings and the basis upon which they are made will be recorded fully in the minute books of the appropriate Fund of Funds. 
8. The Adviser or Distributor will waive fees otherwise payable to it by a Fund of Funds in an amount at least equal to any compensation (including fees received pursuant to any plan adopted by a Non-Affiliated Investment Company under rule 12b-1 under the Act) received from a Non-Affiliated Underlying Fund by the Adviser, or an affiliated person of the Adviser, other than any advisory fees paid to the Adviser or its affiliated person by the Non-Affiliated Investment Company, in connection with the investment by the Fund of Funds in the Non-Affiliated Underlying Fund. Any Subadviser will waive fees otherwise payable to the Subadviser, directly or indirectly, by the Fund of Funds in an amount at least equal to any compensation received from a Non-Affiliated Underlying Fund by the Subadviser, or an affiliated person of the Subadviser, other than any advisory fees paid to the Subadviser or its affiliated person by the Non-Affiliated Investment Company, in connection with the investment by the Fund of Funds in the Non-Affiliated Underlying Fund made at the direction of the Subadviser. In the event that the Subadviser waives fees, the benefit of the waiver will be passed through to the Fund of Funds. 
9. Any sales charges and/or service fees (as defined in NASD Conduct Rule 2830) charged with respect to shares of a Fund of Funds will not exceed the limits applicable to a fund of funds set forth in NASD Conduct Rule 2830. 
10. No Underlying Fund will acquire securities of any investment company or company relying on section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Act in excess of the limits contained in section 12(d)(1)(A) of the Act, except to the extent that such Underlying Fund: (a) Receives securities of another investment company as a dividend or as a result of a plan of reorganization of a company (other than a plan devised for the purpose of evading section 12(d)(1) of the Act); or (b) acquires (or is deemed to have acquired) securities of another investment company pursuant to exemptive relief from the Commission permitting such Underlying Fund to (i) Acquire securities of one or more affiliated investment companies for short-term cash management purposes, or (ii) engage in interfund borrowing and lending transactions.

1.
     Applicants request that the order extend to each registered open-end management investment company or series thereof that is part of the same group of investment companies, as defined in section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the Act as the Trust (each included in the term “Fund of Funds”) and advised by the Adviser or any investment adviser controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser (each included in the term “Adviser”). Each existing registered open-end management investment company that currently intends to rely on the order is named as an applicant. Any other existing or future registered open-end management investment company that subsequently relies on the order will do so only in accordance with the terms and conditions of the application. 

        Back to Citation
      


2.
     With regard to purchases of shares of Non-Affiliated Underlying Funds, the requested order would apply to purchases made by a Fund of Funds only to the extent that the Fund of Funds could not rely on the provisions of section 12(d)(1)(F) of the Act. 

        Back to Citation
      


3.
     A “Fund Affiliate Service Provider” is the Adviser, any Subadviser, promoter or principal underwriter of the Fund of Funds, and any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with any of these entities, provided that (i) such person would reasonably be expected to be in a position to provide services of a securities-related nature (that is, investment advisory, brokerage, distribution, transfer agency, administration, participant recordkeeping or shareholder services) to a Non-Affiliated Underlying Fund, or (ii) if such person is not described by clause (i), to the actual knowledge of the Adviser, any Subadviser, promoter or principal underwriter of the Fund of Funds, such person currently has or is reasonably expected to begin having a material business relationship with a Non-Affiliated Underlying Fund. 

        Back to Citation
      


4.
     A Non-Affiliated Investment Company (including an ETF) would retain its right to reject any initial investment by a Fund of Funds in excess of the limits in section 12(d)(1)(A)(i) of the Act by declining to execute the Participation Agreement with the Fund of Funds. 

        Back to Citation
      


5.
     Each Fund of Funds also will comply with the disclosure requirements concerning the aggregate expenses of investing in Underlying Funds set forth in Investment Company Act Release No. 27399 (June 20, 2006). 

        Back to Citation
      


6.
     Applicants note that a Fund of Funds investing in ETFs generally would purchase and sell shares of an ETF through secondary market transactions at market prices rather than through principal transactions with the Underlying Fund. Applicants would not rely on the requested relief from section 17(a) for such secondary market transactions. To the extent that a Fund of Funds purchases or redeems shares from an ETF that is an affiliated person of the Fund of Funds in exchange for a basket of specified securities as described in the application for the exemptive order upon which the ETF relies, applicants also request relief from section 17(a) for those transactions. 

        Back to Citation
      


7.
     Applicants acknowledge that receipt of any compensation by (a) An affiliated person of a Fund of Funds, or an affiliated person of such person, for the purchase by the Fund of Funds of shares of an Underlying Fund or (b) an affiliated person of an Underlying Fund, or an affiliated person of such person, for the sale by the Underlying Fund of its shares to a Fund of Funds is subject to section 17(e) of the Act. The Participation Agreement also will include this acknowledgement.

To join the conversation, click on the link: https://forms.thomsonreuters.com/communities/ INDIA TOP NEWS  India plans expansive budget despite growth, revenue worries India's finance minister is likely to borrow more than originally planned when he presents the budget on Feb. 1, senior aides and officials said, despite counting on revenues from a national sales tax whose launch date is still unknown.  India mulls reviving colonial-era gold mines with $2 bln reserves India is planning to revive a cluster of colonial-era gold mines - shut for 15 years but with an estimated $2.1 billion worth of deposits left - as the world's second-largest importer of the metal looks for ways to cut its trade deficit, officials said.  US-based Fidelity marks down value of India's e-commerce giant Flipkart U.S.-based mutual fund Fidelity Rutland Square Trust II has marked down the value of its holding in Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart Online Services by around 36 percent.  Tata Steel's UK pensions trustee warns deficit to surge Tata Steel UK's pension scheme deficit is set to balloon to $1.25-$2.5 billion and Britain's largest steelmaker believes it could face insolvency unless a way can be found to tackle it, the scheme's trustee has told members.  India to fill Mangalore strategic reserve with UAE oil India signed a deal with the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday that allows the Gulf OPEC country to fill half of an underground crude oil storage facility at Mangalore that is part of New Delhi's strategic reserve system.  India's Wipro expects muted growth amid growing protectionism Wipro, India's third-largest software services exporter, forecast muted revenue growth for its third quarter as clients in its biggest market, the United States, await clarity on business policies under the Donald Trump administration.  Maruti Suzuki Q3 profit soars 48 pct on sales of pricier cars Maruti Suzuki India, the country's top-selling car maker, posted a 48 percent rise in quarterly profit as demand for its pricier vehicles such as the Brezza crossover offset a cooling of overall sales growth caused by India's demonetisation move.  Indian regulator bars liquor tycoon Mallya from capital markets India's capital markets regulator on Wednesday barred liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya and six others from participating in the country's securities market for allegedly diverting funds from whiskey maker United Spirits.  Peugeot plans cautious return to manufacturing in India PSA Group will return to the fast-growing Indian market by 2020, the French carmaker said on Wednesday, unveiling a modest production deal with New Delhi-based CK Birla Group. GLOBAL TOP NEWS  Trump to seek quick progress with Japan's Abe on replacement trade deal President Donald Trump will seek quick progress toward a bilateral trade agreement with Japan in place of a broader Asia-Pacific deal he abandoned this week, when Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visits the White House next month, an official in the Trump administration said on Thursday.  U.S.-Mexico crisis deepens as Trump aide floats border tax idea The White House on Thursday floated the idea of imposing a 20 percent tax on goods from Mexico to pay for a wall at the southern U.S. border, sending the peso plummeting and deepening a crisis between the two neighbors.  Toshiba reckoning looms with chip decision, nuclear hole unresolved Toshiba Corp faces a day of reckoning, when it is expected to offer an initial estimate of the multibillion-dollar charge it must take on its U.S. nuclear business, but this will be only a step in a series of tough choices on the Japanese conglomerate's survival. LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise)  The SGX Nifty Futures was at 8,660.50, down 0.4 pct from its previous close.  The Indian rupee will likely open lower against the dollar, as renewed optimism about U.S. economic outlook ahead of quarterly growth numbers and upbeat corporate earnings boosted demand for the greenback.  Indian government bonds will likely open lower, as investors may defer purchases ahead of a fresh debt sale later today.The yield on the benchmark 6.97 pct bond maturing in 2026 is likely to trade in a 6.41 pct-6.47 pct  band today. The bond had closed at 103.87 rupees, yielding 6.42 pct on Jan. 25. GLOBAL MARKETS  U.S. stocks were little changed on Thursday as investors paused following a two-day rally that pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average above the 20,000 mark, while the latest wave of earnings rolled in.  Asian shares were steady on Friday and were on track for a solid advance this week, while oil and the dollar held onto gains in the wake of strong U.S. corporate earnings.  The dollar edged up, rebounding from a seven-week low on optimism over the U.S. economic outlook and corporate earnings, although U.S. President Donald Trump's protectionist policies raised uncertainties for global trade.  U.S. Treasury yields fell on Thursday with benchmark yields retreating from a four-week high, after strong investor demand at a $28 billion auction of seven-year notes, part of this week's $88 billion coupon-bearing government debt supply.  Oil prices were stable, with rising crude output from the United States offsetting efforts by OPEC and other producers to prop up the market by cutting supplies.  Gold held near two-week lows as the dollar strengthened on the new U.S. administration's plans to spur growth, leaving the metal on track to end the week lower for the first time since late December.

All Fixed Income News












In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible.
Lower-quality debt securities generally offer higher yields, but also involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.
Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Minimum concessions of $19.95 if traded with a Fidelity representative. For U.S Treasury purchases traded with a Fidelity representative, a flat charge of $19.95 per trade applies. A $250 maximum applies to all trades and is reduced to a $50 maximum for bonds maturing in one year or less. Fixed income trading requires a Fidelity brokerage account with a minimum opening balance of $2,500. Rates are for U.S. Dollar denominated bonds, additional fees and minimums apply for non-Dollar bond trades. Other conditions may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details.. Please note that concessions may impact the total cost of the transaction and the total, or "effective," yield of your investment. The offering broker, which may be our affiliate National Financial Services LLC, may separately mark up on mark down the price of the security and may realize a trading profit or loss on the transaction.

         In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible.
	
      



         Lower-quality debt securities generally offer higher yields, but also involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.

         A CD ladder, depending on the types and amount of securities within it, may not ensure adequate diversification of your investment portfolio. While diversification does not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss, a lack of diversification may result in heightened volatility of your portfolio value. You must perform your own evaluation as to whether a CD ladder and the securities held within it are consistent with your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial circumstances. To learn more about diversification and its effects on your portfolio, contact a representative.
	
      



         The CD ladder strategies displayed are provided for educational purposes and are not intended to serve as the primary basis for your investment, financial or tax planning decisions.
	
      



         Displayed rates of return, including Annual Percentage Yield (APY), represent stated APY for either individual Certificates of Deposit (CDs), or multiple CDs within model CD ladders, were identified from Fidelity inventory as of the time stated. For current inventory, including available CDs, please view the CDs & Ladders tab.
	
      



         The CDs in the CD Search Results screen are displayed on the basis of them offering the highest yields available given certain selected criteria. The criteria entered are at the sole discretion of the user, including the maturities of the strategy selected and yield-based inventory filtering, and any information obtained should not be considered an offer to buy or sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a recommendation for any securities.
	
      



         You acknowledge that your requests for information are unsolicited and shall neither constitute, nor be considered as investment advice by Fidelity Brokerage Services, LLC, Fidelity Distributors Corporation, or their affiliates (collectively, "Fidelity").
	
      



         Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are debt instruments offered by commercial banks, thrifts and brokerages to raise funds for their business activities. Minimum investment amount is typically one CD or multiple CDs for a ladder strategy. All brokered CDs displayed are FDIC-insured as indicated by the Attribute: FDIC. The FDIC insurance covers up to $250,000 per institution per category of account, or up to $250,000 in qualifying retirement accounts. Note that FDIC insurance only covers the principal amount of the CD and any accrued interest. In some instances, CD's may be purchased on the secondary market at a price which reflects a premium to their principal value. This premium is ineligible for FDIC insurance.

         Outside normal market hours our complete inventory is not reflected and trade requests may not be fulfilled.
	
      



         1. The secondary market may be limited. The pre-maturity sale price of CDs may be less than its original purchase price, particularly if interest rates are higher at the time of sale. There may be certain features or provisions of the CD that may also influence its market price. If you want to buy or sell a CD, Fidelity Brokered Services LLC ("FBS") may charge you a fee. This concession will be applied to your order, and you will be provided the opportunity to review it prior to submission for execution. CDs are made available through our affiliate National Financial Services LLC ("NFS") and from various third-party providers, including participants on the BondDesk platform, with FBS normally acting as riskless principal or agent. These offering brokers, including NFS, may separately mark up or mark down the price of the security and may realize a trading profit or loss on the transaction.
	
      



         2. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to a substantial gain or loss. Your ability to sell a CD on the secondary market is subject to market conditions. If your CD has a step rate, the interest rate of your CD may be higher or lower than prevailing market rates. The initial rate on a step rate CD is not the yield to maturity. If your CD has a call provision, which many step rate CDs do, please be aware the decision to call the CD is at the issuer’s sole discretion. Also, if the issuer calls the CD, you may be confronted with a less favorable interest rate at which to reinvest your funds. Fidelity makes no judgment as to the creditworthiness of the issuing institution.
	
      



         3. For the purposes of FDIC insurance coverage limits, all depository assets of the account holder at the institution that issued the CD will generally be counted toward the aggregate limit (usually $250,000) for each applicable category of account. FDIC insurance does not cover market losses. All of the new issue brokered CDs Fidelity offers are FDIC insured. In some cases, CDs may be purchased on the secondary market at a price that reflects a premium to their principal value. This premium is ineligible for FDIC insurance. For details on FDIC insurance limits, see www.fdic.gov.
	
      



         4. Fidelity makes new issue CDs available without a separate transaction fee. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC and National Financial Services LLC receive compensation for participating in the offering as a selling group member or underwriter.
	
      



         5. Other concessions apply if traded with a Fidelity representative. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details.

         The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Please see the ratings tab for more information about methodology. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar RatingTM based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of the funds in an investment category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)

Supplement to thePAS 
InternationalFidelity Fund of Funds®and PAS 
U.S.Opportunity FidelityFund of Funds®April 29, 
2009Prospectus
Proposed Reorganizations. The Boards of Trustees of 
Fidelity Rutland Square Trust and Fidelity Rutland Square Trust II have 
unanimously approved Agreements and Plans of Reorganization ("Agreements") 
between PAS International Fidelity Fund of Funds and PAS U.S. Opportunity 
Fidelity Fund of Funds (the Merging Funds), funds of Fidelity Rutland Square 
Trust, and Strategic Advisers International II Fund and Strategic Advisers U.S. 
Opportunity II Fund (the Surviving Funds), funds of Fidelity Rutland Square 
Trust II. 
The Agreements provide for the transfer of all of the assets and 
the assumption of all of the liabilities of each of the Merging Funds in 
exchange for shares of the Surviving Funds equal in value to the relative net 
asset value of the outstanding shares of each of the Merging Funds. After the 
exchange, the Merging Funds will distribute the Surviving Funds' shares to its 
shareholders pro rata, in liquidation of the Merging Funds (these transactions 
are each referred to as a "Reorganization"). 
Each Reorganization can be consummated only if, among other 
things, it is approved by a "majority of the outstanding voting securities" of 
the respective Merging Fund, as that term is defined under the Investment 
Company Act of 1940. Special Meetings (the "Meetings") of the Shareholders of 
each Merging Fund are expected to be held and approval of the Agreements will be 
voted on at that time. Shareholders of record will be entitled to vote. In 
connection with the Meetings, the Merging Funds will be filing with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission and delivering to its shareholders of record 
a Proxy Statement describing their respective Reorganizations and a Prospectus 
for each Surviving Fund. 
If the Reorganizations and Agreements are approved at the Meetings 
and certain conditions required by the Agreements are satisfied, the 
Reorganizations are expected to take place as soon as practicable after 
shareholder approval. If shareholder approval of any Agreement is delayed due to 
failure to meet a quorum or otherwise, that Reorganization will become 
effective, if approved, as soon as practicable thereafter. 
In the event a Merging Fund's shareholders fail to approve that 
fund's Agreement, that fund will continue to engage in business as a registered 
investment company and Strategic Advisers will consider other options for that 
fund. 
The foregoing is not a solicitation of any proxy. For a free 
copy of the Proxy Statement describing the Reorganizations (and containing 
important information about fees, expenses and risk considerations) and a 
Prospectus for the Surviving Funds, please call 1-800-544-3455 after 
June 21, 2010. Each prospectus and the proxy statement will also be 
available for free on the Securities and Exchange Commission's web site 
(www.sec.gov). 
The following information replaces the similar information found 
in the "Fee Table" section beginning on page 7. 
The following table describes the fees and expenses charged 
by PAS International Fidelity and PAS U.S. Opportunity Fidelity, but does not 
include other fees charged by Strategic Advisers. The acquired funds' fees and 
expenses are based on the average net assets during each acquired fund's most 
recent fiscal year. To the extent that current net assets of the acquired funds 
are less than the average during the most recent fiscal year, the acquired

A Differs from the ratios of expenses 
to average net assets in the Financial Highlights section because the total 
annual operating expenses shown above include acquired fund fees and 
expenses. 
B Strategic Advisers has contractually 
agreed to waive its management fee until March 31, 2012. In addition, Strategic 
Advisers has contractually agreed to reimburse the fund to the extent that total 
operating expenses (excluding interest, taxes, brokerage commissions, 
extraordinary expenses, and acquired fund fees and expenses, if any) exceed 
0.00% of its average daily net assets until March 31, 2012. 
C Strategic Advisers has contractually 
agreed to waive its management fee until September 30, 2011. In addition, 
Strategic Advisers has contractually agreed to reimburse the fund to the extent 
that total operating expenses (excluding interest, taxes, brokerage commissions, 
extraordinary expenses, and acquired fund fees and expenses, if any) exceed 
0.00% of its average daily net assets until September 30, 2011. 
As is reflected in the table above, the funds, as shareholders in 
underlying Fidelity funds, will indirectly bear a pro rata share of the fees and 
expenses incurred by the underlying Fidelity funds, and the funds' investment 
returns will be net of underlying Fidelity fund expenses. 
This example helps you compare the cost of investing in the 
funds with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. 
Let's say, hypothetically, that each fund's annual return is 5%, 
and that your shareholder fees and each fund's annual operating expenses are 
exactly as described in the fee table. This example illustrates the effect of 
fees and expenses and includes Strategic Advisers' fee waiver and expense 
reimbursement for each period shown, but is not meant to suggest actual or 
expected fees and expenses or returns, all of which may vary. For every $10,000 
you invested, here's how much you would pay in total expenses if you sell all of 
your shares at the end of each time period indicated:
