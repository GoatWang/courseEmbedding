About This Meeting
Stephanie Bergeron, President & CEO of Walsh College; Dr. Virinder Moudgil, President & CEO of Lawrence Technological University; and Dr. Keith Pretty, President & CEO of Northwood University addressed the Detroit Economic Club on Wednesday November 30, 2016, and talked about how business and employers are the real consumers of higher education.
“We have to understand what the employer needs or wants today or tomorrow to make sure that we are delivering that product to them efficiently,” said Bergeron.
Pretty added that shifting demographics in the workforce are a chance for colleges and universities to make a change in order to meet employer’s needs. “We really have a lot of opportunity to make change today that will make their education relevant and their opportunities extraordinary going forward, but we have to do it efficiently,” said Pretty.
Moudgil completed the thread by commenting that private institutions have the power themselves to move forward in implementing key academic programming. “In order to do so, you have to meet the needs of the community, businesses and the industry,” said Moudgil.
