            Brooks J.     

            Klimley    

            Adjunct Professor of International and Public Affairs     



bjk19@columbia.edu 
Biography


Brooks J. Klimley currently acts as President of Brooks J. Klimley & Associates, an energy advisory services firm focused on mergers & acquisitions strategy and execution, financial restructurings and capital raising for energy and power companies. In addition, he is an Adjunct Professor at both the Columbia Business School and the Columbia School of International and Public Affairs, where he teaches graduate level courses focused on the terms and applications of various financing structures developed in response to evolving industry, regulatory and market conditions. Mr. Klimley is well versed in virtually all facets of conventional, alternative and renewable energy and power businesses, and he has significant transactional experience within and across all public and private debt, quasi-equity and equity markets. In both his professional and academic work, Mr. Klimley is assisted greatly by his broad range of industry relationships throughout public and private sectors.
Mr. Klimley spent the first 25 years of his career leading investment banking practices focused principally on the energy and natural resources sectors. Most recently, he acted as the President of CIT Energy, where he designed and implemented the transformation of the legacy asset based lending business into a fee based energy merchant banking platform focused on the major conventional and clean energy sectors and the related private equity sponsors. Previously, he held senior leadership positions at a number of Wall Street firms, including Citicorp, Bear Stearns, UBS and Kidder, Peabody.
The cornerstone of Mr. Klimley’s career has been his ability to engage in CEO-level strategic dialogue. He possesses both the industry knowledge and the analytical orientation to effectively unearth, present and pursue value added ideas. In addition, he has an uncharacteristically well developed knowledge of the range of capital markets products, both debt and equity, which allows for additional franchise enhancing dialogue throughout client organizations. He is a tactical thinker and skillful negotiator capable of dealing directly with the most challenging issues presented by the largest and most complex companies in the world.
 
Throughout his career, Mr. Klimley has been singled out for his collaborative nature and his unparalleled commitment to developing junior professionals. He is a tireless recruiter, an innovative trainer and a creative manager. He retains a keen sense for how best to address the various organizational and personnel issues which are critical to the effective operation and expansion of business enterprises. He is a natural leader who maintains a long term perspective and has been successful in leaving his mark on organizations and individuals, in particular.    
 
Mr. Klimley holds a dual BA/MA in Jurisprudence (Law) from Oxford University where he was also active in a number of athletic and social activities. Mr. Klimley attended Oxford under the auspices of the Euretta J. Kellet Research Fellowship, which he received from Columbia University, where he graduated magna cum laude and received Phi Beta Kappa recognition in his joint Economics and History major. While at Columbia, Mr. Klimley was a very active presence on campus running a fraternity, captaining the squash team, and participating in a variety of other activities. Prior to Columbia, Mr. Klimley attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts.
Outside of his professional activities, Mr. Klimley remains very active at Columbia University. He is a member of the Varsity C Advisory Board where he oversees Columbia’s men’s and women’s varsity squash programs. Previously, he has served on the College’s Board of Visitors and was Chairman of his 25th Reunion Committee, which set records for attendance and contributions.  Mr. Klimley also served on the Board of Directors of Giant Industries (NYSE: GI), where he served on the Audit and Compensation and Corporate Governance Committees. His other philanthropic endeavors include his support for the Institute for the Recruitment of Teachers at Phillips Academy and various local organizations in Bronxville, New York where he resides with his wife and fifteen year-old triplets.

Throughout his career, Mr. Klimley has been singled out for his collaborative nature and his unparalleled commitment to developing junior professionals. He is a tireless recruiter, an innovative trainer and a creative manager. He retains a keen sense for how best to address the various organizational and personnel issues which are critical to the effective operation and expansion of business enterprises. He is a natural leader who maintains a long term perspective and has been successful in leaving his mark on organizations and individuals, in particular.    
 
Mr. Klimley holds a dual BA/MA in Jurisprudence (Law) from Oxford University where he was also active in a number of athletic and social activities. Mr. Klimley attended Oxford under the auspices of the Euretta J. Kellet Research Fellowship, which he received from Columbia University, where he graduated magna cum laude and received Phi Beta Kappa recognition in his joint Economics and History major. While at Columbia, Mr. Klimley was a very active presence on campus running a fraternity, captaining the squash team, and participating in a variety of other activities. Prior to Columbia, Mr. Klimley attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts.
Outside of his professional activities, Mr. Klimley remains very active at Columbia University. He is a member of the Varsity C Advisory Board where he oversees Columbia’s men’s and women’s varsity squash programs. Previously, he has served on the College’s Board of Visitors and was Chairman of his 25th Reunion Committee, which set records for attendance and contributions.  Mr. Klimley also served on the Board of Directors of Giant Industries (NYSE: GI), where he served on the Audit and Compensation and Corporate Governance Committees. His other philanthropic endeavors include his support for the Institute for the Recruitment of Teachers at Phillips Academy and various local organizations in Bronxville, New York where he resides with his wife and fifteen year-old triplets.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
