History — Accelera Innovations
























































History























Our Corporate HistoryWe were incorporated on April 29, 2008 in Delaware under the name Accelerated Acquisitions IV, Inc. and engaged in the investigation and acquisition of a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. We changed our name to Accelera Innovations, Inc. on October 18, 2011 when we identified healthcare technology, obtained exclusive rights and became a healthcare technology service provider.On June 13, 2011, Synergistic Holdings, LLC, a company owned or controlled by Geoff Thompson, Chairman of our Board of Directors and his wife Nancy Thompson acquired 17,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock for a price of $0.0001 per share. At the same time, Accelerated Venture Partners, LLC cancelled 3,750,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. Following these transactions, Synergistic Holdings, LLC owned approximately 93.15% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Simultaneously with the share purchase, Timothy Neher resigned from the Company’s Board of Directors and John Wallin was simultaneously appointed to the Company’s Board of Directors. Such transaction represented a change of control of the Company.On August 22, 2011, the Company entered into a Licensing Agreement (“Licensing Agreement”) with our majority shareholder Synergistic Holdings, LLC (“Licensor”) pursuant to which the Company was granted an exclusive, non-transferrable worldwide license for proprietary Internet-based, software that is designed to improve the functionality and performance of healthcare services by making clinical healthcare data available to healthcare consumers.On April 13, 2012, the Company entered into an amended Licensing Agreement (“Agreement”) with Synergistic Holdings LLC, (Licensor) whereas the Company and Licensor agreed to amend the August 22, 2011 Licensing Agreement. The Company licensed additional technology from Licensor and the parties agreed to modify the terms, conditions, representations and warranties regarding the technology and to clarify any obligations the Licensor may have with third parties.Pursuant to the Agreement the Company was granted an exclusive, non-transferrable worldwide license for proprietary Internet-based, software “Accelera Technology” that is intended to improve the functionality and performance of healthcare services by making clinical healthcare data available to healthcare consumers. This relevant data is intended to serve as the backbone for self-management tools that are designed to allow these same healthcare consumers to facilitate the self-management portion of their doctor-prescribed care plan and focus on the most costly disease states. This is intended to be accomplished through the proprietary technology, which is designed to identify and measure the severity of the sickness level based upon evidence-based clinical and medical rules and is designed to delivers the results to insurance companies, doctors, hospitals, and employers.In November of 2012, Accelera was granted “Effective Status” by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In January 2015, the Company moved to trading on the OTCQB under the ticker ACNV. Acquisition of with SCI Home Health, Inc. (d/b/a Advance Lifecare Home Health)On August 25, 2014, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with SCI Home Health, Inc. (d/b/a Advance Lifecare Home Health) (“SCI”), Ethel dela Cruz, Virgilia Avila, Ma Lourdes Reyes Celicious, Cristina Soriano, Michelle Cartas and Jimmy Lacaba (collectively, the “Sellers”), pursuant to which we agreed to purchase, and the Sellers agreed to sell, all their SCI shares, collectively representing all of the outstanding shares of common stock of SCI.KEYS TO SUCCESS: Acquiring health care Providers or groups with strong revenue and positive EBITDA of 10% to 20% of annual revenue.Decreasing the expenses and increasing revenue within our acquisitions by utilizing our technology applications and platforms.Becoming more involved in Telemedicine including acquisitions and using our cloud-based Health Information Exchange.Influence the delivery of health care globally

Accelera Innovations Inc. Secures $200 Million USD Equity Investment Agreement

Oct 23, 2013, 13:14 ET

CHICAGO, Oct. 23, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Accelera Innovations, Inc. a Chicago-based healthcare software-as-a-service provider (the "Company") today announced it has entered into a Standby Equity Purchase Agreement ("Investment Agreement") with Lambert Private Equity, LLC, (the "Investor").  Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, the Investor committed to purchase, subject to certain restrictions and conditions, up to $200,000,000 of the Company's common stock, over a period of 36 months from the first trading day following the effectiveness of the registration statement registering the resale of shares purchased by the Investor pursuant to the Investment Agreement (Equity Line). 
"This new equity line facility gives us a flexible and inexpensive access to capital to support our growth initiatives," said John Wallin, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. "By demonstrating access to capital it allows us to be opportunistic in accessing additional capital to continue to focus on the execution of our business plan sending a clear and positive message to our potential clients and financial stakeholders."
The Company may draw on the facility from time to time, as and when it determines appropriate in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Investment Agreement.  The maximum amount that the Company is entitled to put to the Investor in any one draw down notice is no more than $2,000,000 and not exceeding 285,710 shares.  In addition, the Investor will not be obligated to purchase shares if the Investor's total number of shares beneficially held at that time would exceed 4.99% of the number of shares of the Company's common stock.
As an inducement to Investor to enter in to the Investment Agreement and as consideration for the Investor making the investment the Investor received 285,710 shares of common stock and a warrant/option to purchase from the Company up to a total of 14,287,710 shares of the Company's common shares at the price of the lesser of (a) $7.00 or (b) 110% of the lowest daily VWAP for the common stock as reported by Bloomberg during the thirty (30) trading days prior to the date the Investor exercised the Warrant prior to 5:00pm New York time on September 3, 2018 the expiration date. Additional details are available in the Company's SEC filing on Form 8-K filed October 10, 2013.
The Company currently has an effective registration statement excluding the equity line shares to sell 5,000,000 registered shares of the Company's common stock at $7.00 per share and has filed a formal application with the NASDAQ Capital Market to have its shares listed. Additionally, the Company has reserved the NASDAQ ticker symbol "ACCI" in anticipation of meeting the NASDAQ Capital Market listing requirement.
