	Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Financial Results and Provides Update



	MENLO PARK, CA, March 6, 2017  Adverum Biotechnologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: ADVM), a gene therapy company committed to discovering and developing novel
	medicines for patients suffering from diseases with few or burdensome treatment options, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2016 and provided a corporate update.


	We are laser-focused on advancing our three lead gene therapy programs, with a goal of becoming a clinical-stage company by the end of this year,
	said Amber Salzman, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of Adverum Biotechnologies. Adverum has a robust pipeline of gene therapies, a platform of industry-leading technology and capabilities, and an experienced leadership team with
	expertise in developing gene therapies. We are excited to be doing this important work to develop potential new therapies for patients living with wet AMD and rare diseases

	alpha-1

	antitrypsin (A1AT)
	deficiency and hereditary angioedema. Looking ahead this year, we are executing our plans to initiate patient enrollment during the fourth quarter in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for

	ADVM-043

	in patients with
	A1AT deficiency. Importantly, we believe our cash is sufficient to fund the development of our three lead programs through the end of 2019.



	Recent Highlights



	 




	 


	


	 


	In February 2017, Adverum was notified by Regeneron that it is extending the term of the companies research collaboration by an additional three years, to May 1, 2020. The companies research
	collaboration and license agreement, entered into in May 2014 for an initial period of three years, was created to discover, develop and commercialize novel gene therapy products for the treatment of ophthalmologic diseases. The collaboration covers
	up to eight distinct ocular therapeutic targets.




	 




	 


	


	 


	At the European Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ESGCT) meeting in October 2016, Adverum presented new preclinical data from its gene therapy candidates

	ADVM-022


	(AAV.7m8-aflibercept)

	and

	ADVM-032


	(AAV.7m8-ranibizumab)

	for the treatment of wet

	age-related

	macular degeneration (wAMD). Administered through a single, intravitreal injection,

	ADVM-022

	and

	ADVM-032

	demonstrated compelling


	proof-of-concept


	of these vectors anti-angiogenic effect which was comparable to the


	standard-of-care


	anti-VEGF therapies
	in a laser-induced choroidal neovascularization model of wAMD in

	non-human

	primates.




	 




	 


	


	 


	In August 2016, Adverum and Editas Medicine, Inc. announced a collaboration to explore the delivery of genome editing medicines to treat up to five inherited retinal diseases. This collaboration leverages Adverums
	AAV vector platform technology and expertise to deliver Editas leading CRISPR-based genome editing technologies to create a series of novel therapies for the treatment of inherited retinal diseases.









	2017 Outlook



	 




	 


	


	 


	Adverum has selected

	ADVM-022

	to advance as an intravitreal injection gene therapy product candidate for wAMD. The Company met with the FDA in February 2017 and plans to initiate
	investigational new drug (IND)-enabling toxicology and biodistribution studies in the first half of 2017 to support a planned IND filing. The Company continues to review data for

	ADVM-032,

	its backup gene
	therapy product candidate for wAMD.




	 




	 


	


	 


	For

	ADVM-043,

	Adverums gene therapy product candidate for treating

	alpha-1

	antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency, the Company is upgrading

	ADVM-043s

	manufacturing to a commercial-grade baculovirus-based process and plans to transfer this process to a contract manufacturing organization for the production of clinical materials. The Company is
	planning to engage with the FDA to review development plans under an open IND in the first half of 2017. Adverum plans to initiate a toxicology study using

	ADVM-043

	made in the baculovirus system in the first
	half of 2017 and to start enrolling patients for a Phase 1/2 trial in the fourth quarter of 2017.




	 




	 


	


	 


	For

	ADVM-053,

	Adverums gene therapy product candidate for treating hereditary angioedema (HAE), the Company plans to initiate

	IND-enabling

	toxicology studies and engage with the FDA in the first half of 2017. In addition, the Company plans to transfer its manufacturing process to a contract manufacturing organization and prepare to
	file an IND in order to move forward with a planned Phase 1/2 trial.




	 




	 


	


	 


	Adverums cash and cash equivalents of $222.2 million as of December 31, 2016 are expected to fund the three lead gene therapy programs through the end of 2019 and through the achievement of
	meaningful clinical data in patients for at least one of the Companys lead programs.

	Cash,


	cash


	equivalents


	and


	marketable


	securities

	were $222.2 million as of December 31, 2016, compared to $231.3 million as of September 30, 2016 and
	$259.1 million as of


	 December 31, 2015.




	 




	 


	


	 



	Revenues

	, consisting of revenue from collaborative research, were $0.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to $1.0 million for the same period in 2015. This
	decrease was primarily due to the recognition of an event under a collaboration agreement for the three months ended December 31, 2015.










	 


	

	expenses

	were $4.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to $5.4 million for the same period in 2015. This
	reduction was primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.




	 




	 


	


	 



	Impairment


	of


	goodwill


	and


	intangible


	assets

	was $11.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and related to an impairment of intangible assets recorded

	non-cash

	charge was the result of the Companys

	in-process

	research and development
	(IPR&D) asset assessment that was based on the Companys analysis of the fair value of intangible assets at December 31, 2016.




	 




	 


	


	 



	Income


	tax


	benefit

	was $0.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and related to the change in the deferred tax liabilities balance due to the intangible assets impairment
	recognized in the same quarter.




	 




	 


	


	 



	Net


	loss


	attributable


	to


	common


	stockholders

	was $22.4 million or $0.54 per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared
	to $14.1 million, or $0.55 per basic and diluted share, for the same period in 2015.





	Financial Results for the Twelve Months
	Ended December 31, 2016



	 




	 


	


	 



	Revenues

	, consisting of revenue from collaborative research, were $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $2.3 million for 2015. This decrease was primarily due to
	the recognition of an event in 2015 under a collaboration agreement.




	 




	 


	


	 



	Research


	and


	development


	expenses

	were $31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $25.5 million for 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to
	increases in stock-based compensation expense and in clinical material production, license fees and laboratory expenses for the Companys three lead programs.




	 




	 


	


	 



	General


	and


	administrative


	expenses

	were $24.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $22.1 million for 2015. This increase was primarily due to
	Annapurna acquisition-related expenses, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.




	 




	 


	


	 



	Impairment


	of


	goodwill


	and


	intangible


	assets

	was $60.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and related to a non-cash goodwill and intangible assets impairment
	charges recorded in connection with the Annapurna transaction that closed in May 2016.










	 


	


	 



	Income


	tax


	benefit

	was $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and related to the change in the deferred tax liabilities balance due to intangible assets impairment recognized in the
	fourth quarter of 2016.




	 




	 


	


	 



	Net


	loss


	attributable


	to


	common


	stockholders

	was $113.7 million or $3.14 per basic and diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to
	$47.5 million, or $1.86 per basic and diluted share, for 2015. The increase in net loss was primarily due to the

	non-cash

	impairment charges of $60.7 million. The

	non-cash

	charges have no effect on the Companys current cash balance or operating cash flows.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.
