Linkable Networks Launches Shopper Attribution Platform
Linkable Networks has launched the Linkable Shopper Attribution Platform, enabling retailers to directly measure the impact of their digital media on in-store sales based on actual consumer transactions.
The Linkable Shopper Attribution Platform is able to measure the purchase behavior of 180 million credit cardholders in the United States and gives brands and retailers a way to incentivize and reward consumers for purchasing specific products in store, where 93 percent of all retail sales still occur.
“Physical retail is never going away,” says John Caron, chief marketing officer at Linkable Networks, “but retailers are struggling to get people into their stores” amid increased competition from Amazon and direct-fulfillment by manufacturers.

Digital Coupons At Retail
Digital isn’t just a millennial thing. Millennials want things to be easier, smarter, faster and better. And, that usually means digital. But, dumb and digital is still a fail which is why so many of the mobile coupon apps have failed. Digital is about making the experience better for the consumer, more efficient for the retailer and more measureable for the brand. Aligning with those goals is what will drive the transition from print to digital.

August 25, 2015 | Shopper Marketing Magazine (Link requires subscription)








The Paperless Chase

Digital coupons are currently a footnote in overall coupon distribution and redemption. Traditional free-standing inserts (FSIs) that shoppers receive in newspapers are overwhelmingly dominant.


But if newspaper readership is declining and so-called “Mobile Millennials” will be the key grocery shopper of the future, it’s clear that digital offers will grow.
L2C digital coupons aren’t confined to a grocer’s loyalty card. Kroger links digital coupons to its Kroger Plus credit card. While such applications are rare, that may change soon: Boston-based Linkable Networks has launched a program for retailers that enables shoppers to link digital coupons to a credit or debit card.
August 14, 2015 | Progressive Grocer









Digital Coupons Speak To Millennials
According to a recent study conducted by Forrester Consulting on behalf of Linkable Networks, when it comes to reaching out to the millennial demographic, digital coupons could be the answer.  Attracting this group is a major goal for most supermarkets and marketers alike, and according to the study, retailers and brands must adopt digital coupon redemption experiences that are automatic to millennials, in other words, digital.
“Convenience is key in CPG. For today’s influential millennial population, CPG marketers who consider Invisible Redemption, where through card-linked offers coupons are connected to a shopper’s credit or debit cards and savings are seamlessly redeemed at the time of purchase, will win the race to scale digital couponing.” In addition the study found that shoppers say retailers and brands that offer simplicity will find millennials more inclined to try new retailers or products, driving customer acquisition and use coupons, along with driving loyalty.
June 29, 2015 | Supermarket Guru








Trading Partners Must Make Digital Offers Seamless For Millennials
CPG brands and retailers must adopt automatic digital coupon redemption to appeal to Millennial shoppers, especially those with children. The reason: Millennials find most digital offers to be harder to use than traditional paper coupons.
That’s the key finding of a new study conducted by Forrester Consulting on behalf of Linkable Networks, developer of a scalable platform that enables trading partners to engage, reward and incent consumers directly and across any channel – online, mobile and in-store.
The study, “Creating Loyalty with Millennials and Young Parents: How Automated Redemption and Card-Linked Offers Will Solve the Adoption Dilemma for Digital Coupons,” is based on a March 2015 survey of 516 U.S. shoppers. It concluded that brands and retailers that offer simplicity will find Millennials more inclined to try new products and retailers, thus driving coupon use, customer acquisition, and loyalty. Digital coupons should be linked to credit and debit cards.
June 17, 2015 | CPGmatters.com








Consumers Think Couponing Is Too Darned Difficult
Using paper coupons is soo hard – all that searching, cutting and remembering! Digital coupons aren’t much better – all that finding, sorting and clipping!
Surely, there most be an easier way? According to a new study, there is.
Forrester Consulting surveyed shoppers, in compiling its new report, “Creating Loyalty With Millennials And Young Parents: How Automated Redemption And Card-Linked Offers Will Solve The Adoption Dilemma For Digital Coupons.”
And that mouthful of a title kind of gives away the report’s conclusions – consumers, particularly younger ones, want their coupons to be easier to redeem, by having them linked directly to their credit or debit cards.
June 15, 2015 | Coupons In The News








Digital Coupons Drive Customer Loyalty For Millennials
Reaching the impactful millennial demographic is a major goal for most marketers. Reaching that goal could very well involve digital coupons, according to a new commissioned study conducted by Forrester Consulting on behalf of Linkable Networks.
CPG retailers and brands must adopt digital coupon redemption experiences that are automatic to reach millennial shoppers, especially those with children, because they find most digital coupons to be harder to use than traditional paper coupons, the study says.
Titled, “Creating Loyalty With Millennials and Young Parents: How Automated Redemption And Card-Linked Offers Will Solve The Adoption Dilemma For Digital Coupons,” the study surveyed 516 U.S. shoppers. What’s more, those shoppers say retailers and brands that offer simplicity will find millennials more inclined to try new retailers or products, driving customer acquisition and use coupons, along with driving loyalty.

Automatic Redemption Drives Shopper Loyalty for CPG Retailers and Brands
Retailers and brands that offer couponing simplicity will find Millennials more inclined to try new stores or products (driving customer acquisition) and use coupons (driving loyalty). According to a new commissioned study conducted by Forrester Consulting on behalf of Linkable Networks, consumer packaged goods (CPG) retailers and brands must adopt digital coupon redemption experiences that are automatic to reach Millennial shoppers, especially those with children, because they find most digital coupons to be harder to use than traditional paper coupons.
June 12, 2015 | Bulldog Reporter








How Digital Coupons Could Sway Millennial Shoppers
A Linkable Networks-commissioned study shows that Millennials are more likely to use coupons if they can automatically redeem them.
If consumer packaged goods (CPG) retailers and brands want to reach Millennial shoppers with coupons they need to offer digital coupons that offer automatic redemption.
Those were the findings of a recent study conducted by Forrester Consulting on behalf of Linkable Networks called “Creating Loyalty With Millennials and Young Parents: How Automated Redemption And Card-Linked Offers Will Solve The Adoption Dilemma For Digital Coupons.”
The study, which surveyed 516 U.S. shoppers found Millennial shoppers, especially those with children, found most digital coupons to be harder to use than traditional paper coupons. Sites, retailers and brands who offer simplicity will find Millennials more inclined to try new retailers or products, driving customer acquisition and use coupons, driving loyalty.

Study: Millennials Seek Automatic Digital Coupon Redemption
Millennials as a generation are known for wanting instant gratification, and that desire extends to digital coupons. According to a new commissioned study conducted by Forrester Consulting on behalf of Linkable Networks, CPG retailers and brands must adopt digital coupon redemption experiences that are automatic to reach millennial shoppers.
This is especially for millennials with children, because they find most digital coupons to be harder to use than traditional paper coupons. The study, “Creating Loyalty With Millennials and Young Parents: How Automated Redemption And Card-Linked Offers Will Solve The Adoption Dilemma For Digital Coupons” which surveyed 516 U.S. shoppers, finds that retailers and brands who offer simplicity will find millennials more inclined to try new retailers or products, driving customer acquisition and use coupons, driving loyalty.

Millennials Demand Seamless Redemption Of Digital Coupons
Coupons are a key tool for retailers, one that has consistently proven to work with most demographics. But in order to reach millennials, coupon strategies need to be digital, seamless and simple to redeem.
Millennial shoppers, especially those with children, are finding digital coupons today to be more difficult to redeem than traditional paper coupons, according to a new study by Forrester Consulting on behalf of Linkable Networks.
Shopper’s no. 1 pain point that keeps them from regularly using coupons is forgetting them. In fact, 79 percent said they would not buy an item if they forgot to bring the coupon to the store, resulting in a loss of sales and loyalty.

Millennial Shoppers Need Couponing Experience To Be Seamless, Easy-To-Use In Order To Shift To Digital

Adagio Teas Connects The Digital And Physical Worlds With Omnyverse
And even though they are extremely tech savvy and in tune with quality, Adagio Teas’ target customers also are frugal. “However, some would feel embarrassed if they presented a coupon, especially in-store,” Cramer said in an interview with Retail TouchPoints. “So we loved the idea of taking away the physical aspect of coupons. With card-linked offers, Adagio Teas achieves this and still allows customers to save money without the ‘stigma’ of using a paper coupon.”
May 28, 2015 | Retail TouchPoints








Adagio Teas takes the paper out of promotions
Traditionally, when something is printed on paper, it is considered more valuable and “real.” But for Adagio Teas, an omnichannel specialty retailer of gourmet tea, digital promotions are the most reliable.
“As an online vendor, we are sensitive to the effectiveness of promotions,” Michael Cramer, founder and CEO of Adagio Teas, said during an exclusive interview with Chain Store Age. Adagio Teas operates three stores in the Chicago area as well as a global e-commerce site.

First Affiliate Network Exclusively for Card-linked Offers Gains Traction
The first affiliate network built exclusively for card-linked digital offers, promotions and incentives is creating awareness among savings-minded consumers. The Omnyverse network from Linkable Networks has scaled quickly and already reaches more than 50 million consumers each month across more than 30 leading publishers, such as Slickdeals, Shopathome and savings.com. It’s similar to traditional affiliate networks with one significant difference – all its offers are linked to the shopper’s credit or debit card so they can use them in-store or online with proper first-click attribution no matter where they buy.

Solving Brand Loyalty Challenges for Retailers
CPG brands and retailers have struggled with engaging and influencing customers – things like print-at-home coupons and load-to-card initiatives are simply too cumbersome and archaic in this day and age. Achieving brand loyalty is the goal of Boston-based Linkable Networks, a direct-to-consumer loyalty company. According to Linkable Networks, millennials prefer to be rewarded for their customer loyalty than discounted on a purchase. And they want redemption to be automatic and hassle-free. This is Linkable’s offer to CPG brands and retailers. Its platform enables always-on loyalty by breaking down the walls between digital media, physical retail and consumers with something already in our pockets – a credit or debit card.

Linkable Networks  Our Solutions














































The shopper attribution platformreaching 180 million cardholders.







Our Solutions
To say we’ve been busy the last four years is an understatement. We have spent countless hours and focused our resources on building a scalable network that connects the 180 million cardholders from American Express, MasterCard and Visa to a national group of brands, retailers and restaurants. And we’ve done this in a way that keeps the consumer at the center. It starts with their needs and wants and expands out from there, letting consumers engage with the brands and merchants they love while being rewarded for their loyalty and patronage.
Going beyond just a “coupon,” Linkable enables you to reward, engage, activate and retain consumers in the store. Traditional couponing takes a lot of time and energy, the process of having to do work to save is one that is not trickling down into the millennial generation. Millennials, as well as digitally-savvy shoppers, want offers, but they want them to be easy and seamless – so, retailers and brands have to evolve to digital. Enter Linkable.












We offer retailers and brands the choice of a full-service or fully-integrated SaaS-based platform leveraging the ubiquitous reach of the more than 180 million credit and debit cardholders in the U.S. by directly saving, or linking, offers and coupons to a consumer’s card account. The Linkable Shopper Attribution Platform is the foundation for Linkable’s solutions:

Linkable Purchase Verification: All-digital coupons or rewards – store-wide or item-level – either linked to consumer’s credit/debit card or consumer transmits paper receipt or digital receipt – cash back settles to consumer’s credit or debit card within 24-48 hours without paper, a promotion code or another app.
Linkable Media: In-store attribution of digital media based on consumer purchases.
Linkable Loyalty: Automatically measures and aggregates purchases across any national retailer for use by Loyalty companies to reward and track consumer spending.
Omnyverse™ is our self-service network enabling advertisers to deliver performance-based offers through leading publishers that can be redeemed in-store, anywhere.










The experience millennials want.
Traditional couponing takes a lot of time and energy, the process of having to do work to save is one that is not trickling down into the millennial generation. Millennials want offers, but they want them to be easy and seamless – so, retailers and brands have to evolve to digital. The problem is that most have tried to provide a one-size-fits-all solution to couponing that, inherently, is based on their view of what they think consumers will do – not what consumers actually want. Typically these coupons just replicate a physical or print experience on a mobile device. Simply having a coupon on a smartphone doesn’t make for a better experience. In other words, it’s not about having the same thing – a coupon or a loyalty card – in a different format. What will drive scale for digital coupons and loyalty is when they’re smarter, easier and better than traditional coupons. This is what the Linkable Shopper Attribution Platform does. From promotions to loyalty to in-store conversion, Linkable adds attribution disguised as consumer value (a coupon, for example) to all of your digital media in a form that millennials love.
 











Bridge the gap between digital media and in-store sales. Seamlessly. Automatically. Digitally.









Not just digital. Smarter and digital.
The shift to digital will occur when digital coupons are as seamless as paying for an Uber. The most brilliant part of Uber is that payment is invisible. It just happens, automatically. Imagine if the same were true for coupons and rewards! Picture a scenario where your shoppers or members find a coupon or incentive for something they want or need to buy and all they have to do is save the coupon digitally to a credit or debit card. Brilliant, right!?! In doing so, they would receive their savings automatically when they pay. Nothing to clip, nothing to forget and nothing slowing down the checkout. And when redemption becomes automatic and seamless, you can focus on the experience and your shoppers.











Paperless digital-to-store. 100% attribution. Zero integration.

Linkable Networks  Forrester Study: Millennial Shoppers Need Couponing Experience to be Seamless, Easy-to-Use in Order to Shift to Digital













































Forrester Study: Millennial Shoppers Need Couponing Experience to be Seamless, Easy-to-Use in Order to Shift to Digital








June 9, 2015 | Press Release

Linkable Networks-commissioned study emphasizes how automatic redemption drives shopper usage and loyalty for CPG retailers and brands
BOSTON AND CHICAGO – According to a new commissioned study conducted by Forrester Consulting on behalf of Linkable Networks published today, CPG retailers and brands must adopt digital coupon redemption experiences that are automatic to reach millennial shoppers, especially those with children, because they find most digital coupons to be harder to use than traditional paper coupons. The study, “Creating Loyalty With Millennials and Young Parents: How Automated Redemption And Card-Linked Offers Will Solve The Adoption Dilemma For Digital Coupons” which surveyed 516 U.S. shoppers cites retailers and brands who offer simplicity will find millennials more inclined to try new retailers or products, driving customer acquisition and use coupons, driving loyalty.
“At a time when myths about coupons are prevalent – millennials don’t bother and they erode loyalty – the reality is when coupons are digital and intuitive they grow in usage and drive an increase in loyalty. Convenience is key in CPG,” said John Caron, Chief Marketing Officer, Linkable Networks. “For today’s influential millennial population, CPG marketers who consider Invisible Redemption, where through card-linked offers, coupons are connected to a shopper’s credit or debit cards and savings are seamlessly redeemed at the time of purchase, will win the race to scale digital couponing.”
The study’s analysis identified shoppers’ number one pain-point limiting them from regularly using coupons is forgetting them at checkout in-store. In fact, 79 percent of surveyed shoppers shared they would not buy an item if they forgot to bring a coupon in-store. For CPG marketers, this results in loss of sales and little opportunity to build loyalty. While digital experiences can help combat these losses, shopper adoption of digital is still limited as compared to traditional because digital is yet to be seamless and truly provide value to shoppers. With all-digital card-linked offers, retailers and brands can incentivize shoppers enough to try new brands, use more coupons – building loyalty – and increase visits to retailers who support automatic redemption. For example, the study found 63 percent of Millennials would experiment with a new brand if they received a card-link offer. Furthermore, 48 percent of Millennials would spend their dollars at another retailer that accepts card-linked offers.
According to the survey, 78 percent of shoppers report using a debit or credit card to pay for every day staples including grocery items and half of shoppers are interested in using card-linked offers, illustrating the importance of leveraging seamless and automatic coupon redemption specific to CPG retailers and brands.
Linkable Networks’ Chief Marketing Officer John Caron will be discussing this report in detail at FMI Connect 2015 during his session on Thursday, June 11, 2015 at 2 p.m. CT in room S101AB. A complimentary copy of the report is available for download on our Resources page.

Linkable Networks, Inc. Key Developments

Linkable Networks, Inc. Announces Enhancements to its Platform
Nov 2 16
Linkable Networks announced enhancements to its platform that enables retailers and brands to verify purchases independent of tender type – cash, credit, or debit – at the SKU-level, at any store, and for any brand. By using the Linkable Networks shopper attribution platform, named MyLinkables, retailers and brands gain faster insights into all consumer promotions linked and redeemed by shoppers in-store or online. Unlike other purchase verification solutions on the market, MyLinkables provides complete insight into media attribution, including exactly how and when each individual product purchase was completed, and enables verification for all types of purchases. By leveraging innovations in cloud computing and their proprietary data tracking solution, MyLinkables is easily deployed by any retailer or brand. National brands currently deploying promotions on MyLinkables include Unilever, ConAgra Foods, Kellogg’s and Clorox. Premier retailers gaining momentum in bridging their e-commerce and brick-and-mortar omnichannel efforts via MyLinkables include Petco, Saks Fifth Ave, Sephora and SuperValu.


News America Marketing Partners with Linkable Networks to Help Specialty Retailers Reach and Influence Millions of Shoppers
Feb 18 16
News America Marketing (NAM) and Linkable Networks announced a partnership that will deliver card-based savings opportunities to millions of price-sensitive consumers across the country via SmartSource Magazine and SmartSource.com. By harnessing the promotional power of the SmartSource brand name, specialty retailers and brands will now be able to access upwards of 70 million households to offer savings that can easily be redeemed in stores using Linkable Networks payment card-based savings technology. Through Linkable's Card Linked Offers, consumers simply link promotions to any payment card to get savings without using either promotion codes or coupons. By linking these offers directly to their payments cards, consumers are credited after the purchase is made. The process is exceptionally secure as the offers are valid for only single-time use, feature anti-stacking technology and retailers have the ability to control redemption levels.  Additionally, the entire path to purchase is traceable, with comprehensive site-to-store attribution. This partnership goes into effect immediately.


Linkable Networks Launches Fully-Digital Shopper Attribution Solution Bridging Digital and In-Store
Oct 7 15
Linkable Networks announced the launch of the Linkable Shopper Attribution Platform, enabling retailers to, for the first time, directly measure the impact of their digital media on in-store sales based on actual consumer transactions. A retailer’s in-store shopper data has previously been limited to test and control or panels for measurement. With the introduction of Linkable Shopper Attribution Platform, retailers no longer have to wonder what digital and social media investment is driving in-store sales. Measuring the purchase behavior of 180 million cardholders in the U.S., the Linkable Shopper Attribution Platform gives brands and retailers a new way to incentivize and reward consumers for purchasing specific products in-store, where 93% of all retail sales still occur. The SaaS-based Linkable Shopper Attribution Platform leverages the ubiquitous reach of the more than 180 million credit and debit cardholders in the U.S. by directly saving, or linking, offers and coupons to a consumer’s card account. As pioneers in the industry, Linkable has enabled any type of digital media to leverage the unique capabilities intrinsic to card-linked offers. In addition to being able to support whole-store offers and rewards, the Shopper Attribution Platform includes three industry firsts: SKU-level offers and rewards: Core to the Linkable platform is the ability for retailers, and their brand partners, to create digital offers that include or exclude specific items, categories, departments and locations.  This allows a retailer’s vendor brand to directly attribute their media dollars to in-store spending through their retail channels. Coupon anti-stacking: Linkable prevents the ability for consumers to “stack” digital and printed offers in a single transaction solving a big concern of retailers and brands as the industry shifts from print to digital coupons and promotions. Universal data connect: Linkable connects directly with the card networks, select processors or the retailer’s data center to provide multiple layers of data redundancy for card-linked offers.

About Linkable
Measuring the purchase behavior of 180 million cardholders in the U.S., Linkable gives brands and retailers a new way to incent and reward consumers for purchasing specific products in-store.
Since 2011, we’ve been nose-down building a scalable platform that provides brands and retailers the ability to engage, reward and incent their consumers directly and across any channel – online, mobile and in-store. Linkable Networks pioneered the concept of card-linked-offers and have taken it to the next level.  Our scan receipt, digital receipt, full-service and SaaS-based platforms enable the creation of actionable ads, coupons, offers, promotions, rebates and more that let you influence and reward consumers no matter where they shop.

How It Works



Consumer recognizes a Linkable™ offer wherever they see the Links.



The loyalty offer or coupon, from item-level to store-wide, is instantly linked to their credit card. No printing.No promo codes. No app.



Consumer shops wherever they want. In-store, mobile and online.



Consumer automatically receives cash-back, points or whatever they want! Nothing to forget. Nothing to redeem. Easy-peasy.
