	Baying Ecological Holding Group, Inc.






	Notes to Financial Statements




	September 30, 2016





	 



	NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS



	 


	Baying Ecological Holding Group, Inc. was formerly Toro Ventures Inc., which was incorporated on April 11, 2005, under the laws of the State of Nevada. The Company was originally in the fast food services industry.


	 


	The Company changed its name on January 9, 2014 to better reflect its new business direction, of a holding company eventually with various entities being managed. The Company has been identifying and seeking potential corporate partnerships with walnut industry entities.


	 


	The Company’s accounting year end is June 30.


	 



	NOTE 2 – GOING CONCERN



	 


	The Company’s financial statements as of December 31, 2016 have been prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred significant losses and has no assets.


	 


	In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management’s plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking equity and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.


	 



	NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	 



	Basis of Presentation





	 


	These financial statements are presented in United States dollars and have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.


	 



	Interim Financial Information



	 


	The accompanying condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 which has been derived from the Company's audited financial statements as of that date, and the unaudited financial information of the Company as of December 31, 2016 and for the three and six months ended December 31, 2016, has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8-03 of Regulation S-X.


	 


	In the opinion of management, such financial information includes all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the Company's financial position at such date and the operating results and cash flows for such periods. Operating results for the interim period ended December 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year. Certain information and footnote disclosure normally included in financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been omitted pursuant to the rules of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). These unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016 filed on September 20, 2016.

	Table of Contents







	 



	Use of Estimates



	 


	In preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include estimated useful lives and potential impairment of property and equipment, estimate of fair value of share based payments and derivative instruments and recorded debt discount, valuation of deferred tax assets and valuation of in-kind contribution of services and interest.


	 



	Cash and Cash Equivalents



	 


	The Company considers all highly liquid temporary cash investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.


	 



	Net Loss per Share



	 


	Net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period as defined by Financial Accounting Standards, ASC Topic 260, "Earnings per Share". Basic earnings per common share (“EPS”) calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding.


	 



	Business Segments



	 


	The Company operates in one segment and therefore segment information is not presented.


	 



	Revenue Recognition



	 


	The Company will recognize revenue on arrangements in accordance with FASB ASC No. 605, “Revenue Recognition”. In all cases, revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed and determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.


	 



	Fair Value of Financial Instruments



	 


	The Company applies the accounting guidance under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC 820-10, “Fair Value Measurements”, as well as certain related FASB staff positions. This guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from m selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact business and considers assumptions that marketplace participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance.


	 


	The guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy for measurements of fair value as follows:


	 







	 





	·





	Level 1 - quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.














	 





	·





	Level 2 - inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.














	 





	·





	Level 3 - unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.





	 






	 




	7
















	Table of Contents







	 


	The Company's financial instruments consist of accounts payable. The carrying amount of the Company's financial instruments approximates their fair value as of December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, due to the short-term nature of these instruments.


	 



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases which significantly changes the accounting for leases by requiring lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for leases greater than 12 months on their balance sheet. The lessor model stays substantially the same; however, there were modifications to conform lessor accounting with the lessee model, eliminate real estate specific guidance, further define certain lease and non-lease components, and change the definition of initial direct costs of leases requiring significantly more leasing related costs to be expensed upfront. ASU 2016-02 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and the Company is currently assessing the impact this standard will have on the Company's financial statements.


	 


	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09 "Compensation – Stock Compensation," which identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for equity-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted subject to certain requirements. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.


	 


	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. The amendments in this update provided guidance on eight specific cash flow issues. This update is to provide specific guidance on each of the eight issues, thereby reducing the diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, which will be effective for the Company for the quarter ending December 31, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is assessing the impact, if any, of implementing this guidance on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and liquidity.


	 


	The Company believes that there were no other accounting standards recently issued that had or are expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 


	 



	NOTE 4 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION



	 


	Mr. Zhouping Jiao, director of the Company, have advanced working capital to pay expenses of the Company. The advances are due on demand and non-interest bearing. The outstanding amount due to related parties was $146,647 and $126,762 as of December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016.


	 


	Mr. Parsh Patel, director and officer of the Company, provides various consulting and professional services to the Company for which he is compensated. The management fees were $9,000 and $9,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.


	 



	NOTE 5 – STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT



	 


	The Company authorized 75,000,000 common shares with a par value of $0.001.


	 


	On October 2015, Mr. Parsh Patel, CEO of the Company has advanced $3,000 as working capital to pay expenses of the Company that was contributed as additional paid-in capital of the Company.


	 



	NOTE 6 – INCOME TAXES



	 


	Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary different amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.

	At December 31, 2016, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $908,771 that may be offset against future taxable income to the year 2027. No tax benefit has been reported for the period ended December 31, 2016 financial statements since the potential tax benefit is offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount.


	 


	Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards for Federal Income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur, net operating loss carry forwards may be limited as to use in future years.

Management intends to achieve this goal by fully utilizing a strong technical force and cultural awareness and heritage to build a strong marketing plan and achieve peak brand operational capability.


	 


	Management has been identifying and seeking potential corporate partnerships with the Yangling Modern Agricultural Standardization Institute, which provides an array of technical support for us, as well as Shaanxi Yuanwangda Venture Capital Co., Ltd. in an effort to continue our operational plans. We have been researching an industry-wide chain of production standards for China’s entire walnut industry to full realize the development potential that will lead the industry. We intend to incorporate national policy regulations into every step of our business as well as eco-friendly, yet markedly efficient, methods to ensure the very best product is available to our consumers, while also securing the appropriate profit margins for our investors.


	 


	As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we intend to meet the following milestones to prepare ourselves for complete self-sufficiency and dominance throughout the walnut industry:


	 









	·



	Successful cultivation of large-scale, eco-efficient walnut reserves (including seed bases and harvesting techniques)







	 




	 








	·



	Independent development of a specialized compound, biological fertilizer that fights the most common forms of walnut disease and create a barrier to prevent future infection







	 




	 








	·



	Acquisition and retention of a top-tier production management team to ensure continued success and growth

	The Baying Precious & Delicious Food Club was an idea that has allowed us to directly reach our customers as we market our products to them. Specializing in selling high-quality and organic fruits, vegetables, cereals, and precious oils, we believe that this aspect of our corporate strategy will be a strong solidifier of profit and top-of-mind presence. In the end, the Club has nearly infinite profit making applications and as of now we are capitalizing on these: (i) membership card sales; (ii) direct profits from product sales; (iii) cooperation base supply; (iv) public media advertising revenue; and (v) website and periodical advertisement income.


	 


	We also intend on applying for and accepting subsidies from the following national organizations/branches of government to enrich our products and our production standards: (i) Department of Commerce: ‘Rural Construction Development’ project which is designed to assist companies with operations in rural areas who help serve local populations; (ii) Ministry of Agriculture: where the government provides subsidies for the construction of pollution-free base and food deep-processing factories countrywide; (iii) Development and Reform Commission: subsidies from government for agricultural machinery equipment; (iv) The Provincial Labor Union; and(v) funds from SME Promotion Bureau.


	 


	As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we have offices located in Troy Michigan and in China on the 6

	th

	Floor of Huihao Building, off of 3

	rd

	Keji Road, in the heart of Xi’an city.

	As at the six-month period ended December 31, 2016, our current assets were $767 and our current liabilities were $149,647, which resulted in a working capital deficit of $148,880. As at fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, our current assets were $1,978 and our current liabilities were $136,517. The increase in current liabilities of $13,130 was primarily due to the increase in amounts due to related parties of $19,885. Mr. Parsh Patel, our Chief Executive Officer, advanced $3,000 as working capital to pay our expenses. Mr. Zhouping Jiao, one of our directors, has advanced working capital to pay our expenses.

	PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING



	 


	We have incurred losses for the past two fiscal years and had a net loss of $14,341 at six-month period ended December 31, 2016. Management intends to finance our 2017 operations primarily with the potential revenue from walnut product sales and any cash short falls will be addressed through equity or debt financing, if available. We will need to raise additional capital, both internally and externally, to cover cash shortfalls and to compete in our markets. Management believes we will require an additional $1,200,000 in equity financing during the next 12 months to satisfy our cash requirements for operations and to facilitate our business plan.


	 


	These operating costs include cost of sales, general and administrative expenses, salaries and benefits and professional fees related to contracting personnel. If we cannot obtain financing to fund our operations in 2017, then we may be required to reduce our expenses and scale back our operations.


	 



	Going Concern



	 


	If we cannot obtain financing or generate sufficient revenue to fund our operations in 2017, then we may be required to reduce our expenses and scale back our operations. These factors raise substantial doubt of our ability to continue as a going concern. Footnote 2 to our financial statements provides additional explanation of Management’s views on our status as a going concern. The audited financial statements contained in this Annual Report do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability of assets or the amounts of liabilities that may result should we be unable to continue as a going concern.


	 


	Our independent registered accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph June 30, 2016, in their reports on the accompanying financial statements for June 30, 2016 regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements contain additional note disclosures describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure by our independent auditors.


	 



	OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS



	 


	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.


	 



	CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS



	 


	One of our directors, Mr. Zhouping Jiao, has advanced working capital to pay our expenses. The advances are due on demand and non-interest bearing. Our executive officer, Mr. Parsh Patel, also advanced $3,000 as working capital to pay our expenses. The outstanding amount due to related parties was $146,647 and $126,762 as of December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively.


	 


	Our executive officer, Mr. Parsh Patel, provides various consulting and professional services to us for which he is compensated. Management fees were $9,000 for both six-month periods ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These fees remain unpaid and have accrued.


	 



	RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS



	 


	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, requiring lessee’s to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months in the balance sheet. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.


	 


	We have implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and we do not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

	ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK




	 


	As a “smaller reporting company” as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information required by this Item.



	 






	ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES




	 



	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	 


	We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of December 31, 2016. Based on such evaluation, we have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely discussions regarding required disclosure.


	 



	Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting



	 


	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting for our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over our financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:


	 







	(1)






	pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairy reflect our transactions .








	(2)






	provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of our management and directors; and








	(3)




	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.





	 


	All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error or circumvention through collusion of improper overriding of controls. Therefore, even those internal control systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time.


	 


	Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014. In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSD) in

	Internal-Control-Integrated Framework

	and implemented a process to monitor and assess both the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls. Based on this assessment, management believes that as of December 31, 2016, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective.


	 


	We have instituted a remediation plan which involves reeducating our management, the accounting staff, and the administrative staff as to the elements of a completed sale. We increased the oversight of the process by increasing the frequency of involvement of outside accounting consultants. Internal systems are being put into place to track and document significant dates, such as delivery, installation and customer acceptance. In addition, the bookkeeping system has been modified so that all sales of extended warranties are automatically recorded as deferred revenue and that the amount of revenue that is ultimately recognized as warranty revenue is as the result of an analysis of the significant aspects of the warranty such as coverage and period.


	 



	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting



	 


	Our management has evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the second quarter ended December 31, 2016. In connection with such evaluation, there have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred since the beginning of our second quarter of 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. While there have been no changes, we have assessed our internal controls as being deficient and will be taking steps during 2017 to remedy such deficiencies.
