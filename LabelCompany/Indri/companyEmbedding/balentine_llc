We know that investors need more than what most wealth management firms can offer
Balentine provides a full range of comprehensive services for individuals and families seeking wealth management and planning solutions.

Our centralized decision-making process and our Building Blocks approach help us engage and empower our clients. Our service model is designed to make you feel understood, inspired, and connected. Our aim is to deliver the results you expect while making your life easier. Your needs, ambitions, and values are at the center of everything we do, and we translate your aspirations into solutions that help you realize your goals. We do this with full transparency in a completely conflict-free environment.

About Balentine | Balentine



































































 

 




















 













We know that investors need more than what most wealth management firms can offer
Balentine provides a full range of comprehensive services for individuals and families seeking wealth management and planning solutions. Many investment firms fail to keep up with the pace of change and focus on themselves and asset growth instead of the things that are important to their clients. Balentine is different. For 30 years, the Balentine legacy has been one of innovation, service to clients, and service to the community. Our centralized decision-making process and our Building Blocks approach help us engage and empower our clients. Our service model is designed to make you feel understood, inspired, and connected. Our aim is to deliver the results you expect while making your life easier. Your needs, ambitions, and values are at the center of everything we do, and we translate your aspirations into solutions that help you realize your goals. We do this with full transparency in a completely conflict-free environment.


The Balentine Difference



 


														Privately-Owned													
					
											We are employee owned, which ensures stability of purpose and alignment of interest.					
									



 


														Client Experience													
					
											We ensure the client experience drives the investment process, not vice-versa.					
									



 


														Full Balance Sheet Focus													
					
											Our focus is on your entire balance sheet, not just investable assets.					
									



 


														Efficient Management													
					
											We emphasize cost-effective and tax-efficient implementation solutions.					
									




Meet Our Team
A fresh, creative approach to wealth management requires bright minds. Balentine is focused on maintaining a high-performance culture and aims to be an employer of choice. All employees strive for excellence, act with integrity, display mutual respect, and have an entrepreneurial spirit. Our diverse talent base includes investment industry veterans and women in senior leadership roles. Giving back to the community is a top-down initiative. All these in combination create a unique culture of life-long learning and innovation.
