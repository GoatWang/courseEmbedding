Our Loan Process
A payday loan is a small dollar short-term advance used as an option to help a person with small, often unexpected expenses. Payday Loans are short-term in nature and not intended to be used long-term or for larger purchases like a home or a car. They are a safe and convenient way to allow a customer to stretch their buying power and help cover small, unplanned expenses. Whether you’re suffering from seasonal expenses like holiday bills and back to school costs or you need help with unexpected bills, or repairs, Check Into Cash can help.
How much can I borrow?
Check Into Cash advances range anywhere from $50 to $1,000 depending on your state of residence. The qualifications for our loans are typically less stringent than for conventional loans. In exchange for the cash you need, Check Into Cash charges a small fee. This fee along with the original amount borrowed is typically due on your next day of pay.
Where can I get a fast cash loan?
At Check Into Cash, we have made it easy and fast to get the cash you need, when you need it. Whether you are borrowing online or at one of more than 1,000 retail locations near you, we offer a hassle free approach to borrowing.

MOTOR VEHICLE TITLE LENDING IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA BORROWER RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES



Please take the time to carefully review the information contained in this pamphlet. It is designed to advise you of your rights and responsibilities in connection with obtaining a motor vehicle title loan in Virginia under Chapter 22 (§ 6.2-2200 et seq.) of Title 6.2 of the Code of Virginia.
If you have any questions about motor vehicle title lending or want additional information, you may contact the Virginia State Corporation Commission’s Bureau of Financial Institutions toll-free at (800) 552-7945 or on the Internet at http://www.scc.virginia.gov/bfi.
In General: You are responsible for evaluating whether a motor vehicle title loan is right for you. Alternatives may include among other things less expensive short-term  nancing from another  nancial institution, family, or friends, a cash advance on a credit card, or an account with overdraft protection.
Notice from Lender: A motor vehicle title lender is required to provide you with a clear and conspicuous printed notice advising you that a motor vehicle title loan is not intended to meet your long-term  nancial needs, that the interest rate on a motor vehicle title loan is high, and that if you fail to repay your loan in accordance with your loan agreement, the motor vehicle title lender may repossess and sell your motor vehicle.
Prohibition on Obtaining Loan if Motor Vehicle has Existing Lien / One Loan at a Time: Virginia law prohibits a motor vehicle title lender from making a motor vehicle title loan to you if (i) your certi cate of title indicates that your motor vehicle is security for another loan or has an existing lien or (ii) you currently have another motor vehicle title loan from either the same motor vehicle title lender or any other motor vehicle title lender conducting a motor vehicle title lending business in Virginia.
Prohibition on Obtaining Loan on Same Day Another Loan was Repaid: Virginia law prohibits a motor vehicle title lender from making a motor vehicle title loan to you on the same day that you repaid or satis ed in full a motor vehicle title loan from either the same motor vehicle title lender or any other motor vehicle title lender conducting a motor vehicle title lending business in Virginia.
Prohibition on Loans to Covered Members of the Armed Forces and their Dependents: Virginia law prohibits a motor vehicle title lender from making motor vehicle title loans to covered members of the armed forces and their dependents. If you are (i) on active duty under a call or order that does not specify a period of 30 days or less; or (ii) on active guard and reserve duty, then you are a covered member of the armed forces and a motor vehicle title lender is prohibited from making a motor vehicle title loan to you. A motor vehicle title lender is also prohibited from making a motor vehicle title loan to you if (i) you are married to a covered member of the armed forces; (ii) you are the child, as de ned in 38 U.S.C. § 101(4), of a covered member of the armed forces; or (iii) more than one-half of your support during the past 180 days was provided by a covered member of the armed forces.
Certi cate of Title / Other Security Interests: Prior to obtaining a motor vehicle title loan, you will be required to give a motor vehicle title lender the certi cate of title for your motor vehicle. The motor vehicle title lender is required to record its lien with the motor vehicle department in the state where your motor vehicle is registered and hold the certi cate of title until your loan is repaid or satis ed in full. The motor vehicle title lender cannot take an interest in more than one motor vehicle as security for a motor vehicle title loan. Apart from your motor vehicle and any accessories that are attached to it, the motor vehicle title lender cannot take an interest in any other property you own as security for a motor vehicle title loan.

In general, a motor vehicle title lender cannot seek a personal money judgment against you if you fail to pay any amount owed in accordance with your loan agreement. However, a motor vehicle title lender may seek a personal money judgment against you if you impair the motor vehicle title lender’s security interest by (i) intentionally damaging or destroying your motor vehicle; (ii) intentionally hiding your motor vehicle; (iii) giving the motor vehicle title lender a lien on a motor vehicle that has an undisclosed prior lien; (iv) selling your motor vehicle without the motor vehicle title lender’s written consent; or (v) securing another loan or obligation with a security interest in your motor vehicle without the motor vehicle title lender’s written consent.
In collecting or attempting to collect a motor vehicle title loan, a motor vehicle title lender is required to comply with the restrictions and prohibitions applicable to debt collectors contained in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S .C . § 1692 et seq., regarding harassment or abuse, false, misleading or deceptive statements or representations, and unfair practices in collections. A motor vehicle title lender is also prohibited from threatening or beginning criminal proceedings against you if you fail to pay any amount owed in accordance with your loan agreement.
Repossession and Sale of your Motor Vehicle: If you do not repay your motor vehicle title loan in accordance with your loan agreement, the motor vehicle title lender may repossess and sell your motor vehicle in order to recover any outstanding amounts that you owe.
If a motor vehicle title lender repossesses your motor vehicle, the motor vehicle title lender must send you a written notice at least 15 days prior to the sale of your motor vehicle. The notice will contain (i) the date and time after which your motor vehicle may be sold; and (ii) a written accounting of the outstanding balance on your motor vehicle title loan, the amount of interest accrued through the date the motor vehicle title lender took possession of your motor vehicle, and any reasonable costs incurred to date by the motor vehicle title lender in connection with repossessing, preparing for sale, and selling your motor vehicle. At any time prior to the sale of your motor vehicle, you may obtain your motor vehicle by paying the motor vehicle title lender the total amount speci ed in the notice. Payment must be made in cash or by certi ed check, cashier’s check, money order or, if the motor vehicle title lender is equipped to handle and willing to accept such payments, by using a credit card.
Within 30 days of a motor vehicle title lender receiving funds from the sale of your motor vehicle, you are entitled to receive any surplus from the sale in excess of the sum of the following: (i) the outstanding balance on your motor vehicle title loan; (ii) the amount of interest accrued on your motor vehicle title loan through the date the motor vehicle title lender repossessed your motor vehicle; and (iii) any reasonable costs incurred by the motor vehicle title lender in repossessing, preparing for sale, and selling your motor vehicle.
See section above on “Costs of Repossession and Sale” for additional information regarding the conditions that must be met in order for a motor vehicle title lender to collect the reasonable costs of repossessing, preparing for sale, and selling your motor vehicle.
Violation of the Virginia Consumer Protection Act: Losses suffered as the result of a motor vehicle title lender’s violation of Chapter 22 of Title 6.2 of the Code of Virginia may be pursued under the Virginia Consumer Protection Act (§ 59.1-196 et seq. of the Code of Virginia), which in some cases permits consumers to recover actual and punitive damages.
Complaints and Contacting the Bureau of Financial Institutions:
For assistance with any complaints you may have against a motor vehicle title lender, please contact the Bureau of Financial Institutions toll-free at (800) 552-7945 or on the Internet at http://www.scc.virginia.gov/b . Complaints must be  led in writing with the Bureau of Financial Institutions. Complaints should be mailed to the Bureau of Financial Institutions, Attn: Complaints, P.O. Box 640, Richmond, Virginia 23218-0640, or faxed to the Bureau of Financial Institutions, Attn:Complaints, at (804) 371-9416.

Loan Proceeds: You will receive your loan proceeds in the form of (i) cash; (ii) a check from the motor vehicle title lender; or (iii) a debit card. If you receive a check, the motor vehicle title lender is prohibited from charging you a fee for cashing the check. Similarly, a check casher located in the same of ce as the motor vehicle title lender is prohibited from charging you a fee for cashing the motor vehicle title lender’s check. If you receive a debit card, the motor vehicle title lender is prohibited from charging you an additional fee when you withdraw or use the loan proceeds.
Other Businesses: A motor vehicle title lender is prohibited from engaging in any other businesses in its motor vehicle title loan of ces unless permitted by order of the State Corporation Commission. A motor vehicle title lender is also prohibited by statute from selling you any type of insurance coverage.
Using Motor Vehicle Title Loan to Purchase Products or Services or Repay Other Loans: A motor vehicle title lender is prohibited from making you a motor vehicle title loan so that you can purchase another product or service sold at the motor vehicle title lender's business location. A motor vehicle title lender is also prohibited from making you a motor vehicle title loan so that you can repay another loan you may have from either the motor vehicle title lender or an af liate of the motor vehicle title lender.
Right to Cancel: You have the right to cancel your motor vehicle title loan at any time prior to the close of business on the next day the motor vehicle title lender is open following the date your loan is made by either returning the original loan proceeds check or paying the motor vehicle title lender the amount advanced to you in cash or by certi ed check, cashier’s check, money order or, if the motor vehicle title lender is equipped to handle and willing to accept such payments, by using a credit card. If you cancel your motor vehicle title loan, the motor vehicle title lender must mark your original loan agreement with the word "canceled" and return it to you along with your certi cate of title.
Cash Payments / Partial Payments / Prepayments: You have the right to receive a signed, dated receipt for each cash payment made in person, which will show the balance remaining on your motor vehicle title loan.
Additionally, you have the right to make a partial payment on your motor vehicle title loan at any time prior to its speci ed due date without penalty. However, a motor vehicle title lender may apply a partial payment  rst to any amounts that are due and unpaid at the time of such payment. If your motor vehicle title loan is current, a partial payment will reduce your outstanding balance as well as the total amount of interest that you will be required to pay.
You also have the right to prepay your motor vehicle title loan in full before its speci ed maturity date without penalty by paying the motor vehicle title lender the total outstanding balance on your loan, including any accrued and unpaid interest and other charges that you may owe on your motor vehicle title loan.
Lender to Return Original Loan Agreement and Certi cate of Title: Within 10 days after the date that you repay your motor vehicle title loan in full, the motor vehicle title lender must (i) mark your original loan agreement with the word “paid” or “canceled” and return it to you; (ii) take any action necessary to re ect the termination of its lien on your motor vehicle’s certi cate of title; and (iii) return the certi cate of title to you. If you have any questions or concerns regarding your certi cate of title, you should contact the motor vehicle department in the state where your motor vehicle is registered.
No Rollovers, Extensions, Etc.: A motor vehicle title lender cannot re nance, renew, extend, or rollover your motor vehicle title loan.
Failure to Repay: Pay back your motor vehicle title loan! Know when your payments are due and be sure to repay your motor vehicle title loan on time and in full. IF YOU DO NOT REPAY YOUR MOTOR VEHICLE TITLE LOAN IN ACCORDANCE WITH YOUR LOAN AGREEMENT, THE MOTOR VEHICLE TITLE LENDER MAY REPOSSESS AND SELL YOUR MOTOR VEHICLE (see section below on “Repossession and Sale of your Motor Vehicle”).

Maximum Loan Amount: A motor vehicle title lender cannot loan you more than 50% of the fair market value of your motor vehicle . The fair market value is generally based on the loan value for your motor vehicle according to a recognized pricing guide.
Minimum and Maximum Loan Term / Monthly Payments: Under Virginia law, your loan term cannot be either less than 120 days or more than 12 months. Your motor vehicle title loan will be repayable in substantially equal monthly installments of principal and interest. However, if you have a longer  rst payment period, your  rst monthly payment may be larger than your remaining monthly payments.
Interest and Other Loan Costs: The following are the maximum interest rates that a motor vehicle title lender is permitted to charge you PER MONTH on the principal amount of your loan that remains outstanding: (i) 22% per month on the portion of the outstanding balance up to and including $700; (ii) 18% per month on the portion of the outstanding balance between $700.01 and $1,400; and (iii) 15% per month on the portion of the outstanding balance of $1,400.01 and higher. As long as these maximum rates are not exceeded, a motor vehicle title lender is allowed to accrue interest using a single blended interest rate if the initial principal is higher than $700. In addition to interest, a motor vehicle title lender may charge you for the actual cost of recording its lien with the motor vehicle department in the state where your motor vehicle is registered.
If you make a payment more than seven calendar days after its due date, a motor vehicle title lender may impose a late charge of up to  ve percent of the amount of the payment.
A motor vehicle title lender is prohibited from accruing or charging you interest on or after (i) the date the motor vehicle title lender repossesses your motor vehicle; or (ii) 60 days after you fail to make a monthly payment on your loan, unless you are hiding your motor vehicle.
Other than interest and the costs speci cally mentioned in this section and the section below (“Costs of Repossession and Sale”), no additional amounts may be directly or indirectly charged, contracted for, collected, received, or recovered by a motor vehicle title lender.
Costs of Repossession and Sale: A motor vehicle title lender may charge you for any reasonable costs that it incurs in repossessing, preparing for sale, and selling your motor vehicle if (i) you default on your motor vehicle title loan; (ii) the motor vehicle title lender sends you a written notice at least 10 days prior to repossession advising you that your motor vehicle title loan is in default and that your motor vehicle may be repossessed unless you pay the outstanding principal and interest; and (iii) you fail to pay the amount owed prior to the date of repossession. A motor vehicle title lender is prohibited from charging you for any storage costs if the motor vehicle title lender takes possession of your motor vehicle.
Written Loan Agreement: A motor vehicle title lender must provide you with a written loan agreement, which must be signed by both you and an authorized representative of the motor vehicle title lender. Your motor vehicle title loan agreement is a binding, legal document that requires you to repay your loan. Make sure you read the entire loan agreement carefully before signing and dating it. A motor vehicle title lender must provide you with a duplicate original of your loan agreement at the time you sign it. If any provision of your loan agreement violates Chapter 22 (§ 6.2-2200 et seq.) of Title 6.2 of the Code of Virginia, the provision will not be enforceable against you.
Property Insurance: A motor vehicle title lender may require you to purchase or maintain property insurance for your motor vehicle. However, a motor vehicle title lender cannot require you to purchase or maintain property insurance from or through a particular provider or list of providers.
Prohibition on Obtaining Funds Electronically: A motor vehicle title lender is prohibited from electronically debiting your deposit account or obtaining any of your funds by electronic means.

LLCs (Limited Liability Companies)










LLC Basics




Limited liability companies combine the best parts of partnerships and corporations.


By Beth Laurence, J.D.




Share on Google Plus





Share on Facebook













 





A limited liability company (LLC) offers protection from personal liability for business debts, just like a corporation. However, unlike a corporation, which must pay its own taxes, an LLC is a pass-through tax entity: The profits and losses of the business pass through to its owners, who report them on their personal tax returns just as they would if they owned a partnership or sole proprietorship. Moreover, while setting up an LLC is more difficult than creating a partnership or sole proprietorship, running one is significantly easier than running a corporation.
Here are the main features of an LLC:
Limited Personal Liability
Like shareholders of a corporation, all LLC owners are protected from personal liability for business debts and claims. This means that if the business itself can't pay a creditor -- such as a supplier, a lender, or a landlord -- the creditor cannot legally come after an LLC member's house, car, or other personal possessions. Because only LLC assets are used to pay off business debts, LLC owners stand to lose only the money that they've invested in the LLC. This feature is often called "limited liability."
Exceptions to Limited Liability
While LLC owners enjoy limited personal liability for many of their business transactions, this protection is not absolute. This drawback is not unique to LLCs, however -- the same exceptions apply to corporations. An LLC owner can be held personally liable if he or she:

personally and directly injures someone
personally guarantees a bank loan or a business debt on which the LLC defaults
fails to deposit taxes withheld from employees' wages
intentionally does something fraudulent, illegal, or reckless that causes harm to the company or to someone else, or
treats the LLC as an extension of his or her personal affairs, rather than as a separate legal entity.

This last exception is the most important. If owners don't treat the LLC as a separate business, a court might decide that the LLC doesn't really exist and find that its owners are really doing business as individuals who are personally liable for their acts. To keep this from happening, make sure you and your co-owners:

Act fairly and legally. Do not conceal or misrepresent material facts or the state of your finances to vendors, creditors, or other outsiders.
Fund your LLC adequately. Invest enough cash in the business so that your LLC can meet foreseeable expenses and liabilities.
Keep LLC and personal business separate. Get a federal employer identification number, open up a business-only checking account, and keep your personal finances out of your LLC accounting books.
Create an operating agreement. Having a formal written operating agreement lends credibility to your LLC's separate existence. For more on this, see Nolo's article The LLC Operating Agreement.

For more information on LLC limited liability protection and the differences in state laws, see  LLCs and Limited  Liability - What Protection Do You Get?.  


Additional Protection: Business Insurance
A good liability insurance policy can shield your personal assets when limited liability protection does not. For instance, if you are a massage therapist and you accidentally injure a client's back, your liability insurance policy should cover you. Insurance can also protect your personal assets in the event that your limited liability status is ignored by a court.
In addition to protecting your personal assets in such situations, insurance can protect the LLC's assets from lawsuits and claims. But your LLC won't be protected if it doesn't pay its bills: Commercial insurance usually does not protect personal or corporate assets from unpaid business debts, whether or not they're personally guaranteed.
For more information on insurance, see Nolo's article Obtaining Small Business Insurance.
LLC Taxes
Unlike a corporation, an LLC is not considered separate from its owners for tax purposes. Instead, it is what the IRS calls a "pass-through entity," like a partnership or sole proprietorship. This means that business income passes through the business to the LLC members, who report their share of profits -- or losses -- on their individual income tax returns. Each LLC member must make quarterly estimated tax payments to the IRS.
While an LLC itself doesn't pay taxes, co-owned LLCs must file Form 1065, an informational return, with the IRS each year. This form, which partnerships also have to file, sets out each LLC member's share of the LLC's profits (or losses), which the IRS reviews to make sure LLC members are correctly reporting their income.
For more information on LLC taxes, see Nolo's article How LLCs Are Taxed.
LLC Management
The owners of most small LLCs participate equally in the management of their business. This arrangement is called "member management."
There is an alternative management structure -- somewhat awkwardly called "manager management" -- in which you designate one or more owners (or even an outsider) to take responsibility for managing the LLC. The nonmanaging owners (sometimes family members who have invested in the company) simply sit back and share in LLC profits.
In a manager-managed LLC, only the named managers get to vote on management decisions and act as agents of the LLC. Choosing manager management sometimes makes sense, but it might require you to deal with state and federal laws regulating the sale of securities. (For more information, see Nolo's Limited Liability Company (LLC) FAQ.)
Forming an LLC
To create an LLC, you file "articles of organization" (in some states called a "certificate of organization" or "certificate of formation") with the LLC division of your state government. This office is often in the same department as the corporations division, which is usually part of the secretary of state's office. Filing fees range from about $100 to $800. Now, in every state, you can  form an LLC with just one person.
Many states supply a blank one-page form for the articles of organization, on which you need only specify a few basic details about your LLC, such as its name and address, and contact information for a person involved with the LLC (usually called a "registered agent") who will receive legal papers on its behalf. Some states also require you to list the names and addresses of the LLC members.
In addition to filing articles of organization, you must create a written LLC operating agreement. You don't have to file your operating agreement with the state, but that doesn't mean you can get by without one. The operating agreement is a crucial document because it sets out the LLC members' rights and responsibilities, their percentage interests in the business, and their share of the profits.
To learn more about these and other details involved in setting up an LLC, read Nolo's article How to Form an LLC. To form your LLC right now, use Nolo's Online LLC, which will collect the required information and file your articles of organization with your state.
Ending an LLC
Under the laws of many states, unless your operating agreement says otherwise, when one member wants to leave the LLC, the company dissolves. In that case, the LLC members must fulfill any remaining business obligations, pay off all debts, divide any assets and profits among themselves, and then decide whether they want to start a new LLC to continue the business with the remaining members.
Your LLC operating agreement can prevent this kind of abrupt ending to your business by including "buy-sell," or buyout, provisions that set up guidelines for what will happen when one member retires, dies, becomes disabled, or leaves the LLC to pursue other interests. (For more information, see Nolo's article Plan Ahead for LLC Ownership Changes.)

What are 'Bank Deposits'
Bank deposits consist of money placed into banking institutions for safekeeping. These deposits are made to deposit accounts such as savings accounts, checking accounts and money market accounts. The account holder has the right to withdraw deposited funds, as set forth in the terms and conditions governing the account agreement.

BREAKING DOWN 'Bank Deposits'
      The deposit itself is a liability owed by the bank to the depositor, and the word refers to this liability rather than to the actual funds that have been deposited. When someone opens a bank account and makes a cash deposit, he surrenders legal title to the cash, and it becomes an asset of the bank. In turn, the account is a liability to the bank.There are several different types of deposit accounts including current accounts, savings accounts, call deposit accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs).Current Deposit AccountA current account, also called a demand account, is a basic checking account. Consumers deposit money which they can withdraw as desired on demand. These accounts often allow the account holder to withdraw funds using bank cards, checks or over-the-counter withdrawal slips. In some cases, banks charge monthly fees for current accounts, but they may waive the fee if the account holder meets other requirements such as setting up direct deposit or making a certain number of monthly transfers to a savings account.Savings AccountsSavings accounts offer the account holder interest on his deposits. However, in some cases, account holders may incur a monthly fee if they do not maintain a set balance or a certain number of deposits. Although savings accounts are not linked to paper checks or cards like current accounts, their funds are relatively easy for account holders to access. In contrast, money market accounts offer slightly higher interest rates than savings accounts, but account holders face limitations on the number of checks or transfers they can make from these accounts.Time Deposit AccountsLike a savings account, a time deposit account is an investment vehicle for consumers. Also known as certificates of deposit (CD), time deposit accounts tend to offer a higher rate of return than traditional savings accounts, but the money must stay in the account for a set period of time. In other countries, time deposit accounts feature alternative names such as term deposits, fixed-term accounts and savings bonds.Call Deposit AccountsFinancial institutions refer to these accounts as interest-bearing checking accounts, Checking Plus or Advantage Accounts. These accounts combine the features of checking and savings accounts, allowing consumers to easily access their money but also earn interest on their deposits.Federal Deposit Insurance CorporationThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) provides deposit insurance that guarantees the deposits of member banks up to $250,000 per depositor, per bank.

If this is your company...



We may be able to find you a more suitable carrier for your business insurance.  We have extensive data on carriers, their coverage, and company rates.  Rather than having an agent sell you, why not find which carrier is best for your business and approach them?  Contact Us to see if there is a better fit for your business.  We are not insurance agents, and are not trying to sell you anything.  We will simply tell you some carriers that may be better suited, and suggest agents in your area.

What is an Experience Mod Rating?



The Mod Rating is one of the two most important factors that effect a carrier's premium for workers comp insurance.  Each business in a state is provided a mod rating by the state's rating bureau which is a reflection of the amount of workers comp claims they have had.  If someone has an accident at work, your mod rating will increase and so will your premium.

What is an LCM?



A Loss Cost Multiplier, or LCM, is a rating for an insurance carrier that reflects their overhead in providing coverage for workers comp insurance.  It is one of the two main ratings that effect an insurance premium.  You are more likely to get a better premium from a carrier with a lower LCM, so it is important to know what your carrier's LCM is.  While a premium is generally the result of a formula, carriers are able to deviate plus or minus 25% from that formula.

             PRODUCT INFORMATION
            


    Certificates of Deposit - Branch Banks 2017
A certificate of deposit (CD) is a savings product offered by a bank in which a depositor (someone who has money to put into the bank) agrees to commit a certain amount
    of money for a set period of time, in return for a fixed rate of interest. While it is possible to withdraw the money earlier (breaking the CD) doing so comes with high
    interest penalties and is generally not advised.

   CD Terms

   The time period in which money is held in a certificate of deposit is called the term. Terms can run for any period of time but in general, banks use the following terms:
   3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 36 months, 48 months, and 60 months. Terms can either be described in months or years.  The term that is right for each
   individual depends on their goals, the rate they which to earn, and their future plans for the money. In general, if rates are going up, savers should avoid putting the
   money into a long-term CD. If rates are going down, then the opposite is true, and savers should try and lock into a good rate for an extended period of time.
   In stable rate environments, CDs that are over 12 months in length can enable depositors to pick up a slight premium over savings accounts.
CD Risk

  Almost all banks provide CDs to their consumers and they have been a mainstay of savers and retirement accounts for years. If FDIC insured, the CD represents a safe place
  to put money that will generate a predictable return.

   Inflation is the main risk of a CD. Inflation can often run higher than the inflation adjusted return on a CD, thus eroding the value of the money stored in the CD over time.
  This is especially true for longer-term CDs opened in low interest rate environments.

   How Interest is Paid

   The method of distributing the interest earned on a CD varies by bank. Some banks pay interest monthly, other semi-annually, and others at the maturity of the CD.
    One advantage of a branch-based bank is that a depositor can walk into the bank and receive their interest that day in the form of a check. Online banks tend to use
    electronic funds transfer or check via mail.
Interest Rate

  Since the financial crisis in 2008, CDs have become less popular because the yields they offer have dropped precipitously, making it difficult for retirees and savers
  to generate sufficient income. But investors looking for a place to stash some cash might still find CDs an attractive place for some of their savings. Online banks generally
  offer better rates on six month CDs but the accounts must be opened online. View online bank rates.

  When interest rates are falling, it is often preferable to lock in high rates for an extended period of time with a longer-term CD.  When interest rates are rising,
   depositors should avoid committing their money for long periods of time. To see interest rate trends, visit the 
   BestCashCow rate analysis page.


   ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES


    The advantages of a Certificate of Deposit from a branch bank are:


Funds deposited in FDIC banks and within insurance limits are protected by the full faith
   and credit of the United States government.
CDs provide a predictable, set rate of return.
Depositors can walk into a local branch and open the CD and fund it that day.
   Question and inquiries can also be handles in-person.


The disadvantages of branch-based CDs are:


The deposited money is committed for a certain period of time and can only be withdrawn
    with substantial penalties.
One year CDs from branch banks often pay less interest than from online banks. Please see those rates here.



All banks listed on BestCashCow are FDIC insured; BestCashCow.com strongly recommends that you stay within FDIC insurance limits and that if you are unsure of how the
 limits affect you, please visit the FDIC website.

The Chase rates are not correct, in fact Chase never heard of these rates, if they are correct please inform Abilene and Dallas, I could use the rate as small as it may be, but better than most, if they exist. Thanks

Why can banks 100 miles away offer rates 5 to 6 time higher on a one year CD , seems banks and or there management in this area simply refuse to be competitive and show no respect for the people , neighbors  and area they live and work in.

                 PRODUCT INFORMATION
              

One-Year CD - Online Banks 2017

Certificate of deposits are offering by most bank in a variety of maturity dates.
The 1-year rates in the table above are listed in descending order based on Annual Percentage Yield (“APY”) which is the rate of return that you will earn, when adjusted for compounding, over a 12 month period, and the way in which banks are required by US banking regulations to advertise their CD rates.


A certificate of deposit represents a time commitment between a depositor (someone who has money to put in the bank) and a bank.
The depositor agrees to leave a specified amount of money in the bank for a set period of time.
The bank agrees to keep the money safe and to provide a fixed rate of return.


A 1-year CD has a very brief time commitment and can also generate a rate of return above the prevailing savings rate.
Therefore, many people use 1-year CDs to slightly augment their rates of return over savings with only slightly more risk than they would have if they were entirely in savings accounts and money market accounts.

FDIC Insurance

   Provided the bank is FDIC-insured and the deposit amount is within FDIC limits, the principal is also secured by an agency of the United Stated federal
    government against loss.  Further information about FDIC
    insurance is found in this article
     and if you have specific questions about your own circumstances you should use the FDIC’s Electronic Deposit Insurance Estimator.
 
CD Risk

  The principal of a CD is safe and insured as long as the deposit amount is FDIC limits.
  Interest that accrues and is paid or deposited to the principal also is safe as long as the total balance remains within FDIC limits.


   A CD however bears two significant risks:




Liquidity risk If you think you may need access to
   your principal during the period of the time commitment for a major purchase or an unforeseen
   expense, CDs are generally not a good place to store money.  The terms of most CDs outline
   the penalty that will be assessed in order to access your capital.  This penalty is usually
   assessed in terms of time periods.  For example, a common penalty on a 1-year CD is 3 months,
    although you should always check this carefully in the terms and conditions before opening
    a CD as it could be longer.  Banks and credit unions are not obliged to offer an early
    withdrawal penalty, and may change or remove or even refuse to honor the early withdrawal
     penalty in their paperwork.  For further details, please read this
      article.

       BestCashCow never recommends a strategy involving the purchase of a CD when you have a high
       likelihood that you will need your capital.
   
Inflation risk Since CDs are considered a very safe investment when you stay within FDIC and NCUA-limits
   , they often do not pay much over the anticipated rate of inflation, and can often pay under this rate.  Were interest rates to rise
    (or the inflation rates to rise), the real or inflation -adjusted value of your CD can drop over time, especially when you factor
    in the tax consequences of ownership of a CD.  In the event of rates rising, you may be able to use the early withdrawal penalty
    to get your principal but for the reasons mentioned above, BestCashCow does not recommend relying on such a strategy.
   



Be sure to think about how CDs fit into your overall portfolio objectives.

CD Laddering

  An effective strategy used by many to bolster their savings strategy is to own CDs with various maturities.
   In other words, a depositor with $400,000 and put $100,000 in a 3 month CD, $100,000 in a 6 month CD, $100,000 in a 9 month CD and $100,000 in a one-year CD, then your liquidity risk in highly diminished because you are always near maturity on one of your CDs.
  (Note that no more than 2 of these CDs should be at the same bank in order to avoid exceeding FDIC limits).


  The reality is that we are in a very low interest rate environment, and any CD with a maturity of less than 1 year is going to pay below, perhaps well below, the prevailing rates in the leading online savings accounts or at brick-and-mortar banks.
  Therefore, the strategy outlined above would be largely absurd in the current environment.
  

    A laddering strategy that would make more sense for the same depositor who might otherwise hold $400,000 in cash would be to put $100,000 in a one year CD every three months.
    Liquidity risk in the same way is diminished as the depositor is never more than 3 months from maturity, yet the depositor is picking up some small improvement over the best savings rates than where all of his money to be in cash.


    Laddering strategies can also involve longer term CDs, but one that involves terms as little as 1 year can improve on the savings rates with minimal impairment to your liquidity.


    More information on CD laddering is available in this article.

How Interest is Paid

  The method of distributing the interest earned on a CD varies by bank.
  Some banks pay interest monthly, other semi-annually, and others at the maturity of the CD. In general, online banks pay the interest electronically either by adding it to the principal balance or with an ACH transfer back to the depositor's primary linked checking account.
  Other online banks may pay via a check in the mail.

Interest Rate

Currently, the most competitive banks offer 1-year rates that are slightly above the top online savings and money market rates.
Depositors need to decide if they want the fixed rate of the CD or the flexibility of the savings account (savings accounts do not come with any term time requirements).


In a rising rate environment, it is generally better to keep money flexible and liquid and put it into either short term CDs or savings or money market accounts. 
In a falling rate environment, it is generally better to lock the rate using a CD or some other fixed rate investment.
In a stable rate environment, you may be able to collect a small premium in exchange for your loss of liquidity.


Online banks generally offer CDs available to residents of any of the 50 states.
The CD must be opened online and funded either by online transfer or by mail.



       FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT
    

What are CD rates?
CD rates are the fix rate that the bank pays a depositor for entering a CD for the entire term of a CD.
   They are expressed in annual percentage yield (“APY”) terms, so that they are standardized.
   $100,000 invested in a one year CD at 1% will be worth $101,000 at maturity in exactly 1 year.
    $100,000 invested in a two-year CD at 1.50% will be worth $101,500 in exactly 1 year and worth
    $103,022.50 at maturity (assuming the interest is not paid out before maturity, but is added to
    the principal).  Please see BestCashCow’s Savings & CD Calculator to better
    understand the magic of compounded interest over time.
Do CDs Pay Interest Monthly or Yearly?

When opening a CD, it is important to consider how interest is credited or paid. Interest can be credited to the CD monthly, quarterly or annually.  For those CDs of one year or less, interest may be credited only at maturity.


When interest is paid, the CD holder may have arranged for the interest to be mailed to them as a check. The other option is for the interest to be added to the principal of the CD.


Regardless of how and when interest is paid, it is required to be expressed (standardized) by all banks in the form of an annual percentage yield (“APY”) rate.

How Is Interest on CDs Taxed?

Interest on CDs is taxed as ordinary income.  Your bank will provide you with a 1099-INT detailing the interest that you must report on your tax return at the end of each year.  Regardless of whether interest is paid in the form of a check or added to principal, CD holders need to report the interest in the year in which it is paid.  Purchasing a Certificate of Deposit of one-year or less that pays a single lump sum interest payment at maturity may defer tax on interest until the following year, but otherwise holders of CDs should generally expect to pay ordinary taxes on interest earned in every year in which they hold a CD.  Further detail is found in IRS Publication 550 (page 5). 

Why Are CD Rates So Low?
CD rates on terms of 1 and 2 years were very constantly low for many years from 2009 to 2015 as the Fed Funds
 rate was held at zero following the great recession.  Rates on longer term CDs were occasionally more interesting
  during this period (depending more heavily on the level and direction of the US Treasury Bond).
The US Federal Reserve’s action towards normalizing interest rates has been painfully
 slow (resulting from Brexit, European financial instability, etc.), and CD rates have remained
 at levels that are very low by historical norms.  However, we have seen CD rates rise in 2016
 and 2017 as the Federal Reserve has begun to slowly raise the Fed Funds rate.


   Are CD rates going up or down?  When are they expected to rise?
If the Federal Reserve accelerates its plan to raise the Fed Funds rate or if global economic
 developments were to cause US treasury rates to rise, we would quickly see higher CD rates.
 However, the global economic environment is uncertain with European long-term interest rates being
 negative.  Should the US also enter a recession and the US 10-year Treasury rate fall still further,
  it is possible that CD rates could fall further.
What is a good rate for a CD?
BestCashCow lists the best CD rates available from online banks above, and the best rates from
local
 banks and credit unions.  A good rate is the best rate that you can find at an
FDIC or NCUA-insured institution, provided that it compensates you adequately over the

best savings rates for the liquidity that you are giving up.  Only you can determine based
on your own personal circumstances whether that is a good CD rate for you.
 BestCashCow’s Savings & CD Calculator can help you to understand how much more
  interest a CD can generate over a savings account.

ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES


   The advantages of online one-year CDs are:




  Funds deposited in FDIC banks and within insurance limits are protected by the full faith and credit of the United States government.


   CDs provide a predictable, set rate of return.


   The CD can be opened from the comfort of your house.


   The CDs are generally available to any resident of the United States.




   The disadvantages of one year CDs are:
   




   One year CDs pay interest rates that are just above the leading rates offered on online and branch-based savings and money market accounts. There is a very slight premium for having the money locked up for one year.  Your own circumstances and tax rate will help you to determine if that premium provides adequate compensation to you for your loss of liquidity.


   The deposited money is committed for one year.


   The account must be opened online and all inquiries must be conducted online or via the phone.


   Depending on the bank, the opening and funding process can take several days to weeks although the bank generally locks the rate once the application has been received and approved.




   All banks listed on BestCashCow are FDIC insured; BestCashCow.com strongly recommends that you stay within FDIC insurance limits and that if you are unsure of how the limits affect you, please visit the FDIC website.

I have several 12 month and 14 month CDs at Synchrony Bank at 1.25 and 1.3% respectively. I also have Synchrony's on line savings account at 1.10% (extra .05 because I have a Lowes credit card account). I just follow the basic rule that you only lock up money you aren't going to need for whatever time period you choose. And this money is used as our cash portion of our portfolio. So the top priority is no risk - fairly liquid.

@H.Arneat, There isn't much to be gained, but short term rates aren't likely to move up that much in 2015 and one year isn't a lot of time so why not make the extra few dollars.  I went with CIT and Ally because you can raise your rate if there is a quick move up, but I did also consider Sallie Mae because it only has a 3 month withdrawal penalty.  What really seems crazy to me at the 3 and 6 month rates.  Years ago, those rates used to be the same as savings and money market rates and now they are much lower.  You'd need to make a mistake to open one of those.

I think you'd be crazy to invest in a 1 year CD now when the top yields are the same as an online savings account. Maybe the ones that allow you to reset but other than that, don't see the financial wisdom in doing so. Can anyone make an argument? I'm curious.

Unlike a savings account, however, a CD does not allow early withdrawal without penalty. For those who want to explore opening a CD, there's always a guide to the best CD options available.

Placement of funds through the ICS service is subject to the terms, conditions, and disclosures in the service agreements, including the Deposit Placement Agreement (“DPA”). Limits and customer eligibility criteria apply. In the ICS savings option, program withdrawals are limited to six per month. Although funds are placed at destination banks in amounts that do not exceed the FDIC standard maximum deposit insurance amount (“SMDIA”), a depositor’s balances at the relationship institution that places the funds may exceed the SMDIA (e.g., before ICS settlement for a deposit or after ICS settlement for a withdrawal) or be ineligible for FDIC insurance (if the relationship institution is not a bank). As stated in the DPA, the depositor is responsible for making any necessary arrangements to protect such balances consistent with applicable law. If the depositor is subject to restrictions on placement of its funds, the depositor is responsible for determining whether its use of ICS satisfies those restrictions. ICS and Insured Cash Sweep are registered service marks of Promontory Interfinancial Network, LLC.

Our Loan Process
A payday loan is a small dollar short-term advance used as an option to help a person with small, often unexpected expenses. Payday Loans are short-term in nature and not intended to be used long-term or for larger purchases like a home or a car. They are a safe and convenient way to allow a customer to stretch their buying power and help cover small, unplanned expenses. Whether you’re suffering from seasonal expenses like holiday bills and back to school costs or you need help with unexpected bills, or repairs, Check Into Cash can help.
How much can I borrow?
Check Into Cash advances range anywhere from $50 to $1,000 depending on your state of residence. The qualifications for our loans are typically less stringent than for conventional loans. In exchange for the cash you need, Check Into Cash charges a small fee. This fee along with the original amount borrowed is typically due on your next day of pay.
Where can I get a fast cash loan?
At Check Into Cash, we have made it easy and fast to get the cash you need, when you need it. Whether you are borrowing online or at one of more than 1,000 retail locations near you, we offer a hassle free approach to borrowing.

MOTOR VEHICLE TITLE LENDING IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA BORROWER RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES



Please take the time to carefully review the information contained in this pamphlet. It is designed to advise you of your rights and responsibilities in connection with obtaining a motor vehicle title loan in Virginia under Chapter 22 (§ 6.2-2200 et seq.) of Title 6.2 of the Code of Virginia.
If you have any questions about motor vehicle title lending or want additional information, you may contact the Virginia State Corporation Commission’s Bureau of Financial Institutions toll-free at (800) 552-7945 or on the Internet at http://www.scc.virginia.gov/bfi.
In General: You are responsible for evaluating whether a motor vehicle title loan is right for you. Alternatives may include among other things less expensive short-term  nancing from another  nancial institution, family, or friends, a cash advance on a credit card, or an account with overdraft protection.
Notice from Lender: A motor vehicle title lender is required to provide you with a clear and conspicuous printed notice advising you that a motor vehicle title loan is not intended to meet your long-term  nancial needs, that the interest rate on a motor vehicle title loan is high, and that if you fail to repay your loan in accordance with your loan agreement, the motor vehicle title lender may repossess and sell your motor vehicle.
Prohibition on Obtaining Loan if Motor Vehicle has Existing Lien / One Loan at a Time: Virginia law prohibits a motor vehicle title lender from making a motor vehicle title loan to you if (i) your certi cate of title indicates that your motor vehicle is security for another loan or has an existing lien or (ii) you currently have another motor vehicle title loan from either the same motor vehicle title lender or any other motor vehicle title lender conducting a motor vehicle title lending business in Virginia.
Prohibition on Obtaining Loan on Same Day Another Loan was Repaid: Virginia law prohibits a motor vehicle title lender from making a motor vehicle title loan to you on the same day that you repaid or satis ed in full a motor vehicle title loan from either the same motor vehicle title lender or any other motor vehicle title lender conducting a motor vehicle title lending business in Virginia.
Prohibition on Loans to Covered Members of the Armed Forces and their Dependents: Virginia law prohibits a motor vehicle title lender from making motor vehicle title loans to covered members of the armed forces and their dependents. If you are (i) on active duty under a call or order that does not specify a period of 30 days or less; or (ii) on active guard and reserve duty, then you are a covered member of the armed forces and a motor vehicle title lender is prohibited from making a motor vehicle title loan to you. A motor vehicle title lender is also prohibited from making a motor vehicle title loan to you if (i) you are married to a covered member of the armed forces; (ii) you are the child, as de ned in 38 U.S.C. § 101(4), of a covered member of the armed forces; or (iii) more than one-half of your support during the past 180 days was provided by a covered member of the armed forces.
Certi cate of Title / Other Security Interests: Prior to obtaining a motor vehicle title loan, you will be required to give a motor vehicle title lender the certi cate of title for your motor vehicle. The motor vehicle title lender is required to record its lien with the motor vehicle department in the state where your motor vehicle is registered and hold the certi cate of title until your loan is repaid or satis ed in full. The motor vehicle title lender cannot take an interest in more than one motor vehicle as security for a motor vehicle title loan. Apart from your motor vehicle and any accessories that are attached to it, the motor vehicle title lender cannot take an interest in any other property you own as security for a motor vehicle title loan.

In general, a motor vehicle title lender cannot seek a personal money judgment against you if you fail to pay any amount owed in accordance with your loan agreement. However, a motor vehicle title lender may seek a personal money judgment against you if you impair the motor vehicle title lender’s security interest by (i) intentionally damaging or destroying your motor vehicle; (ii) intentionally hiding your motor vehicle; (iii) giving the motor vehicle title lender a lien on a motor vehicle that has an undisclosed prior lien; (iv) selling your motor vehicle without the motor vehicle title lender’s written consent; or (v) securing another loan or obligation with a security interest in your motor vehicle without the motor vehicle title lender’s written consent.
In collecting or attempting to collect a motor vehicle title loan, a motor vehicle title lender is required to comply with the restrictions and prohibitions applicable to debt collectors contained in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S .C . § 1692 et seq., regarding harassment or abuse, false, misleading or deceptive statements or representations, and unfair practices in collections. A motor vehicle title lender is also prohibited from threatening or beginning criminal proceedings against you if you fail to pay any amount owed in accordance with your loan agreement.
Repossession and Sale of your Motor Vehicle: If you do not repay your motor vehicle title loan in accordance with your loan agreement, the motor vehicle title lender may repossess and sell your motor vehicle in order to recover any outstanding amounts that you owe.
If a motor vehicle title lender repossesses your motor vehicle, the motor vehicle title lender must send you a written notice at least 15 days prior to the sale of your motor vehicle. The notice will contain (i) the date and time after which your motor vehicle may be sold; and (ii) a written accounting of the outstanding balance on your motor vehicle title loan, the amount of interest accrued through the date the motor vehicle title lender took possession of your motor vehicle, and any reasonable costs incurred to date by the motor vehicle title lender in connection with repossessing, preparing for sale, and selling your motor vehicle. At any time prior to the sale of your motor vehicle, you may obtain your motor vehicle by paying the motor vehicle title lender the total amount speci ed in the notice. Payment must be made in cash or by certi ed check, cashier’s check, money order or, if the motor vehicle title lender is equipped to handle and willing to accept such payments, by using a credit card.

See section above on “Costs of Repossession and Sale” for additional information regarding the conditions that must be met in order for a motor vehicle title lender to collect the reasonable costs of repossessing, preparing for sale, and selling your motor vehicle.
Violation of the Virginia Consumer Protection Act: Losses suffered as the result of a motor vehicle title lender’s violation of Chapter 22 of Title 6.2 of the Code of Virginia may be pursued under the Virginia Consumer Protection Act (§ 59.1-196 et seq. of the Code of Virginia), which in some cases permits consumers to recover actual and punitive damages.
Complaints and Contacting the Bureau of Financial Institutions:
For assistance with any complaints you may have against a motor vehicle title lender, please contact the Bureau of Financial Institutions toll-free at (800) 552-7945 or on the Internet at http://www.scc.virginia.gov/b .

Box 640, Richmond, Virginia 23218-0640, or faxed to the Bureau of Financial Institutions, Attn:Complaints, at (804) 371-9416.

Loan Proceeds: You will receive your loan proceeds in the form of (i) cash; (ii) a check from the motor vehicle title lender; or (iii) a debit card. If you receive a check, the motor vehicle title lender is prohibited from charging you a fee for cashing the check. Similarly, a check casher located in the same of ce as the motor vehicle title lender is prohibited from charging you a fee for cashing the motor vehicle title lender’s check. If you receive a debit card, the motor vehicle title lender is prohibited from charging you an additional fee when you withdraw or use the loan proceeds.
Other Businesses: A motor vehicle title lender is prohibited from engaging in any other businesses in its motor vehicle title loan of ces unless permitted by order of the State Corporation Commission. A motor vehicle title lender is also prohibited by statute from selling you any type of insurance coverage.
Using Motor Vehicle Title Loan to Purchase Products or Services or Repay Other Loans: A motor vehicle title lender is prohibited from making you a motor vehicle title loan so that you can purchase another product or service sold at the motor vehicle title lender's business location. A motor vehicle title lender is also prohibited from making you a motor vehicle title loan so that you can repay another loan you may have from either the motor vehicle title lender or an af liate of the motor vehicle title lender.
Right to Cancel: You have the right to cancel your motor vehicle title loan at any time prior to the close of business on the next day the motor vehicle title lender is open following the date your loan is made by either returning the original loan proceeds check or paying the motor vehicle title lender the amount advanced to you in cash or by certi ed check, cashier’s check, money order or, if the motor vehicle title lender is equipped to handle and willing to accept such payments, by using a credit card. If you cancel your motor vehicle title loan, the motor vehicle title lender must mark your original loan agreement with the word "canceled" and return it to you along with your certi cate of title.
Cash Payments / Partial Payments / Prepayments: You have the right to receive a signed, dated receipt for each cash payment made in person, which will show the balance remaining on your motor vehicle title loan.
Additionally, you have the right to make a partial payment on your motor vehicle title loan at any time prior to its speci ed due date without penalty. However, a motor vehicle title lender may apply a partial payment  rst to any amounts that are due and unpaid at the time of such payment. If your motor vehicle title loan is current, a partial payment will reduce your outstanding balance as well as the total amount of interest that you will be required to pay.
You also have the right to prepay your motor vehicle title loan in full before its speci ed maturity date without penalty by paying the motor vehicle title lender the total outstanding balance on your loan, including any accrued and unpaid interest and other charges that you may owe on your motor vehicle title loan.
Lender to Return Original Loan Agreement and Certi cate of Title: Within 10 days after the date that you repay your motor vehicle title loan in full, the motor vehicle title lender must (i) mark your original loan agreement with the word “paid” or “canceled” and return it to you; (ii) take any action necessary to re ect the termination of its lien on your motor vehicle’s certi cate of title; and (iii) return the certi cate of title to you. If you have any questions or concerns regarding your certi cate of title, you should contact the motor vehicle department in the state where your motor vehicle is registered.
No Rollovers, Extensions, Etc.: A motor vehicle title lender cannot re nance, renew, extend, or rollover your motor vehicle title loan.
Failure to Repay: Pay back your motor vehicle title loan! Know when your payments are due and be sure to repay your motor vehicle title loan on time and in full. IF YOU DO NOT REPAY YOUR MOTOR VEHICLE TITLE LOAN IN ACCORDANCE WITH YOUR LOAN AGREEMENT, THE MOTOR VEHICLE TITLE LENDER MAY REPOSSESS AND SELL YOUR MOTOR VEHICLE (see section below on “Repossession and Sale of your Motor Vehicle”).

Maximum Loan Amount: A motor vehicle title lender cannot loan you more than 50% of the fair market value of your motor vehicle . The fair market value is generally based on the loan value for your motor vehicle according to a recognized pricing guide.
Minimum and Maximum Loan Term / Monthly Payments: Under Virginia law, your loan term cannot be either less than 120 days or more than 12 months. Your motor vehicle title loan will be repayable in substantially equal monthly installments of principal and interest. However, if you have a longer  rst payment period, your  rst monthly payment may be larger than your remaining monthly payments.
Interest and Other Loan Costs: The following are the maximum interest rates that a motor vehicle title lender is permitted to charge you PER MONTH on the principal amount of your loan that remains outstanding: (i) 22% per month on the portion of the outstanding balance up to and including $700; (ii) 18% per month on the portion of the outstanding balance between $700.01 and $1,400; and (iii) 15% per month on the portion of the outstanding balance of $1,400.01 and higher. As long as these maximum rates are not exceeded, a motor vehicle title lender is allowed to accrue interest using a single blended interest rate if the initial principal is higher than $700. In addition to interest, a motor vehicle title lender may charge you for the actual cost of recording its lien with the motor vehicle department in the state where your motor vehicle is registered.
If you make a payment more than seven calendar days after its due date, a motor vehicle title lender may impose a late charge of up to  ve percent of the amount of the payment.
A motor vehicle title lender is prohibited from accruing or charging you interest on or after (i) the date the motor vehicle title lender repossesses your motor vehicle; or (ii) 60 days after you fail to make a monthly payment on your loan, unless you are hiding your motor vehicle.
Other than interest and the costs speci cally mentioned in this section and the section below (“Costs of Repossession and Sale”), no additional amounts may be directly or indirectly charged, contracted for, collected, received, or recovered by a motor vehicle title lender.
Costs of Repossession and Sale: A motor vehicle title lender may charge you for any reasonable costs that it incurs in repossessing, preparing for sale, and selling your motor vehicle if (i) you default on your motor vehicle title loan; (ii) the motor vehicle title lender sends you a written notice at least 10 days prior to repossession advising you that your motor vehicle title loan is in default and that your motor vehicle may be repossessed unless you pay the outstanding principal and interest; and (iii) you fail to pay the amount owed prior to the date of repossession. A motor vehicle title lender is prohibited from charging you for any storage costs if the motor vehicle title lender takes possession of your motor vehicle.
Written Loan Agreement: A motor vehicle title lender must provide you with a written loan agreement, which must be signed by both you and an authorized representative of the motor vehicle title lender. Your motor vehicle title loan agreement is a binding, legal document that requires you to repay your loan. Make sure you read the entire loan agreement carefully before signing and dating it. A motor vehicle title lender must provide you with a duplicate original of your loan agreement at the time you sign it. If any provision of your loan agreement violates Chapter 22 (§ 6.2-2200 et seq.) of Title 6.2 of the Code of Virginia, the provision will not be enforceable against you.
Property Insurance: A motor vehicle title lender may require you to purchase or maintain property insurance for your motor vehicle. However, a motor vehicle title lender cannot require you to purchase or maintain property insurance from or through a particular provider or list of providers.
Prohibition on Obtaining Funds Electronically: A motor vehicle title lender is prohibited from electronically debiting your deposit account or obtaining any of your funds by electronic means.

The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for payday loans varies in each state and depends on the advance amount, fees, and terms of the transaction. The APR for a $100 single-payment payday loan may range from 260.71% to 782.14% on 14 day terms. As a member of CFSA, Check Into Cash abides by the spirit of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) as applicable to collect past due accounts. Delinquent accounts may be turned over to a third party collection agency which may adversely affect your credit score. Non-sufficient funds and late fees may apply. Automatic renewals are not available. Renewing a loan will result in additional finance charges and fees.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
