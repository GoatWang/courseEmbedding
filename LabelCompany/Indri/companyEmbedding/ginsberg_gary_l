Biography[edit]
Ginsberg was a founding editor and legal counsel of George, the magazine started by John F. Kennedy, Jr.,[1]—a friend from Brown University—after having served in the Clinton administration as a lawyer in the White House Counsel's office and at the Justice Department.[2]
Ginsberg was a close confidant of Rupert Murdoch and Peter Chernin, serving for eleven years[1] as News Corporation's executive vice president for marketing and corporate affairs,[3] until his departure in late 2009. Earlier in 2009, Chernin had stepped down; Chernin was president of News Corp., for years Mr. Murdoch’s top lieutenant, and was also closely associated with Democratic politics. Mr. Ginsberg had been close to Mr. Chernin. In 2002 Ginsberg arranged a lunch and a meeting between Mr. Clinton and Murdoch in Harlem and then a tour for the ex-President of the New York Post newsroom. The Post ultimately endorsed Hillary Clinton for Senate in 2006 and Mr. Murdoch held a fund-raiser for her that year at the News Corp.’s New York headquarters. However, "efforts by Mr. Ginsberg to broker close ties between Mr. Murdoch and President Obama, which led to a meeting ... before the [2008] election, did not result in an endorsement. (The Post endorsed Senator John McCain for president.)"[1] Ginsberg was also "a point man for News Corp.’s 2007 purchase of Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal."[2]
Ginsberg joined Time Warner in February 2010. His new job was described "as a senior adviser to its CEO Jeff Bewkes..., executive vice president, ... [and] responsible for a range of corporate issues, including communications and marketing, and for evangelism across the media industry for Mr. Bewkes’s initiatives. Mr. Ginsberg’s hiring at Time Warner follows the recently announced departure of that company’s head of corporate communications, Edward Adler, Mr. Ginsberg will take on a broader role at the company."[2]
Before Edward Skyler was named to the post in March, 2010, Ginsberg had reportedly been in discussion with Citigroup about its senior public and governmental relations position.[3]
Ginsberg has also volunteered his services as a speechwriter to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, having confirmed that he has worked on "a lot" of them.[4] One-time Israeli Ambassador to the United States Michael B. Oren made seven references to Ginsberg's contributions to crafting Netanyahu's speeches in his 2015 memoir Ally: My Journey Across the American-Israeli Divide.[5]
Personal life[edit]
Ginsberg and his wife, former TV producer Susanna Aaron, live in the West Village with their two children Sam ('96) and Alec Ginsberg ('99).[6] Ginsberg is of Jewish heritage.[7]
Ginsberg serves as a member of the Advisory Board of the Genesis Prize Foundation.[8]

Gary GinsbergBornGary L. Ginsberg(1962-08-30) 30 August 1962 (age 53)EthnicityJewishOccupationCommunications Chief at Time WarnerSpouse(s)Susanna AaronChildrenAlec Ginsberg, Sam Ginsberg










Gary Ginsberg (born August 30, 1962) is a lawyer, American political operative and corporate adviser who worked as a lawyer in the Clinton White House. After time at George and eleven years at News Corporation, he is currently at Time Warner. He has provided pro-bono service as a speechwriter to Benjamin Netanyahu on a number of important occasions.BiographyGinsberg was a founding editor and legal counsel of George, the magazine started by John F. Kennedy, Jr.,[2]—a friend from Brown University—after having served in the Clinton administration as a lawyer in the White House Counsel's office and at the Justice Department.[3]Ginsberg was a close confidant of Rupert Murdoch and Peter Chernin, serving for eleven years[2] as News Corporation's executive vice president for marketing and corporate affairs,[4] until his departure in late 2009. Earlier in 2009, Chernin had stepped down; Chernin was president of News Corp., for years Mr. Murdoch’s top lieutenant, and was also closely associated with Democratic politics. Mr. Ginsberg had been close to Mr. Chernin. In 2002 Ginsberg arranged a lunch and a meeting between Mr. Clinton and Murdoch in Harlem and then a tour for the ex-President of the New York Post newsroom. The Post ultimately endorsed Hillary Clinton for Senate in 2006 and Mr. Murdoch held a fund-raiser for her that year at the News Corp.’s New York headquarters. However, "efforts by Mr. Ginsberg to broker close ties between Mr. Murdoch and President Obama, which led to a meeting ... before the [2008] election, did not result in an endorsement. (The Post endorsed Senator John McCain for president.)"[2] Ginsberg was also "a point man for News Corp.’s 2007 purchase of Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal."[3]Ginsberg joined Time Warner in February 2010. His new job was described "as a senior adviser to its CEO Jeff Bewkes..., executive vice president, ... [and] responsible for a range of corporate issues, including communications and marketing, and for evangelism across the media industry for Mr. Bewkes’s initiatives. Mr. Ginsberg’s hiring at Time Warner follows the recently announced departure of that company’s head of corporate communications, Edward Adler, Mr. Ginsberg will take on a broader role at the company."[3]Before Edward Skyler was named to the post in March, 2010, Ginsberg had reportedly been in discussion with Citigroup about its senior public and governmental relations position.[4]Ginsberg has also volunteered his services as a speechwriter to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, having confirmed that he has worked on "a lot" of them.[5] One-time Israeli Ambassador to the United States Michael B. Oren made seven references to Ginsberg's contributions to crafting Netanyahu's speeches in his 2015 memoir Ally: My Journey Across the American-Israeli Divide.[6]Personal lifeGinsberg and his wife, former TV producer Susanna Aaron, live in the West Village with their two children Sam ('96) and Alec Ginsberg ('99).[7] Ginsberg is of Jewish heritage.[8]Ginsberg serves as a member of the Advisory Board of the Genesis Prize Foundation.[9]

Consumer products as sources of chemical exposures to children:  case study of triclosanGinsberg, Gary L.; Balk, Sophie J.Current Opinion in Pediatrics:  April 2016 - Volume 28 - Issue 2 - p 235–242

          doi: 10.1097/MOP.0000000000000329
THERAPEUTICS AND TOXICOLOGY: Edited by Robert O. Wright


Abstract

                  Author Information
                



Purpose of review: Consumer products are often overlooked as sources of children's exposures to toxic chemicals. Various regulatory bodies have developed lists of chemicals of concern that can be found in products contacted by children. However, this information has not been summarized for health practitioners. This review organizes such chemicals and products into four categories, with the antibacterial agent triclosan used to illustrate the potential risks to children from a common ingredient in consumer products.
Recent findings: Biomonitoring, house dust, indoor air, and product testing document children's exposures to a wide variety of chemicals. An increasing number of epidemiology studies have shown associations between these exposures and health effects in children. Triclosan is an example of a chemical contained in high contact products (e.g., soaps, lotions, and toothpaste) not necessarily designed for children. Triclosan exposure in children has been associated with increased responsiveness to airway allergens, with it also capable of endocrine disruption. However, the utility and necessity of this chemical in consumer products has not been demonstrated in most cases.
Summary: Triclosan and the other examples provided show that a changing marketplace with little regulatory oversight of chemical uses can lead to unanticipated exposures and potential health risks to children.
