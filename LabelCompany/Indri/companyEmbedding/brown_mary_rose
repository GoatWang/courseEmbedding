The Wine Experts



“They’re their own perfect little tornado.” See what prompted noted winemaker Joel Gott to say this about the formidable wine-buying duo of Devon and Doug: 




Colors and Bubbles – The Main Wine Types
Red Wines
Color
Runs the gamut from dark pink to ink
Common Flavors
Everything red, everything dark, dark fruits, dark berries, leather, tobacco, coffee, cocoa, warm spices, black pepper — you get the idea.
Darker grape varieties are often used for making red wines, but it’s the amount of contact with the skin of the grape that truly determines color. More contact with the skin: darker wine. Skin contact also imparts a kaleidoscope of possible flavors and textures, contributing to body and complexity.
Extra credit: Tannins, those sometimes bitter or astringent notes, often very pleasant in well-balanced wines, come from grape skins. You won’t find tannins in a white wine.
Try These
El Terrano Tempranillo
Dark fruit aromas, loads of blackberry and currant flavors. Wild herbs in the mouthwatering finish.
Monterustico Rosso
Amazing quality from one of the best producers out there. Intense structure. More, please.
Criterion Coonawarra Cabernet Sauvignon
Grilling steak or ribs? Try this. Cherry, black plum, hint of eucalyptus. Quintessential complexity.
White Wines
Color
Near clear to honey
Common Flavors
White fruits, tropical fruits, citrus, peaches, butter, honey, vanilla, chalky minerality, white pepper — and many more.
Minimal grape skin contact allows room for the juice in a white wine to speak more clearly, subtle notes taking on greater significance. Because flaws in color or flavor are difficult to mask, a delicate hand is highly prized in the making of white wines.
Extra credit: Broadly speaking, as vineyards move farther north, they produce wines with more acidity, creating crisp, refreshing, mouthwatering white wines. 
Try These
Andover Estate Chardonnay
Beautifully balances between apricot flavors, buttery notes and a crisp finish. Super food-friendly.
El Terrano Albariño
Zippy, fresh. Saline minerality. Yes to paella, grilled shrimp or tapas. You can’t find it anywhere else.
Criterion Pinot Grigio Friuli Grave
An ideal example of pinot grigio. Peachy, juicy, crisp — perfect with seafood, light pasta or risotto.
Rosé Wines
Color
Gentle pink to light orange
Common Flavors
Strawberry, raspberry, cranberry, pomegranate, pink grapefruit, red currant, watermelon
Rosé wines came about as a way to quench a French summer thirst, like a white wine, but with a flavorful nod to the red wines that France highly treasures. Today, Rosés are on fire, making up nearly 40% of all wine purchases, and rightfully so — they’ve thrown off their “sweet and simple” shackles and are unabashedly delicious.
Extra credit: In the most common method, very short contact times with grape skins (1-2 days, as opposed to weeks for Reds) are dialed in by Rosé makers to get just the profile they want. Secondary method: Sometimes winemakers, wanting a denser red wine, will siphon off some early pink juice. This pink juice is then made into Rosé. 
Try These
Globerati Rosé
Crisp, delicate. Notes of wild strawberry. Perfect match for pork loin, rich salads, aged soft cheeses.
Innovación Malbec-Syrah Rosé
Fresh strawberries, blackberries. Light and elegant finish. More than 6 glasses of wine per 1-liter bottle!
El Terrano Rosado
Sipping feels like diving into a bowl of fresh raspberries and strawberries. Pair with goat cheese, tapas, pork chops. 
Bubbly
“Always have a backup bottle of bubbly on hand.” – Doug Bell, Global Beverage Buyer
Bubbly exists in its own world, apart from all other wines in both style and winemaking process. 
And…it’s a blast! The key players:
Champagne
To be called Champagne, it must be from the same named region of France. The most complex of the bunch, often with tantalizing notes of fresh-baked brioche, and running the spectrum from brut (driest) to demi-sec (a dessert Sparkler!), there’s a reason it’s the King of Bubbly. 
Prosecco
Italy’s offering to the world of sparkling wine is the fastest growing style in the category. While it lacks the complexity of its French counterpart, it makes up for it with reliably vibrant peach and apricot notes. And prosecco bubbles are famously unstoppable!
Cava
Spain’s Sparkler, because it is in-bottle fermented like Champagne, shares more in common with its French counterpart than prosecco. Almost always dry, cava often displays floral aromatics and citrus notes. 
Try These
Presto Prosecco
Pair with brunch. Crisp, lively. Apple and orange blossom notes. Touch of honey.

Madame Liberté Brut
A celebration bubbly! Zippy acidity, refreshing green apple notes. Touch of toast. Serve well chilled.

J. Lassalle Champagne Brut Premier Cru
A masterful example of a Grower Champagne. Refined, crisp. White peach and a graceful floral component. 
The Criterion® Line
Certain regions of the world are famous for a specific style of wine, like malbec from Argentina, sauvignon blanc from New Zealand or syrah from Australia. Have you ever wanted to know exactly what these sought-after wines are supposed to taste like? Our Criterion line of wines answers that question, with each wine providing a reference point for just how a wine from that region should taste. Each wine is an educational guide — the tastiest one you’ll ever try!
How to Store Your Wine
For short-term storage, keep your unopened wine bottles in a cool, dark place with a constant temperature — the main thing is to avoid big temperature changes. A closet, cabinet or under the bed works well here, ideally under 75°F. For long-term storage, wine is best when laid on its side (especially if it has a cork — otherwise the cork will dry out), in a cool, dark place between 55 and 60°F.
Cooking with Wine
