Investment Philosophy







Overpaying for a stock is one of the greatest investment risks. It can be managed by developing an intimate knowledge of every stock in the portfolioAPS’ investment philosophy is centered on investigative research, rigorous valuation and constant testing of our own investment theses. Our investment philosophy and approach have remained unchanged since APS’ founding in 1995.Investigative Research, Beyond Bottom-UpAsian markets have traditionally been inefficient and they are best exploited by 1) experienced local investment professionals and 2) probing research. We conduct on-site visits; field investigations including interviews with former employees, competitors, suppliers, industry specialists and other stakeholders; and verification of information and data with independent sources. The extensive, granular body of knowledge we collect through this approach enables us to more effectively value a stock, conduct due diligence and think independently of consensus.Rigorous ValuationDuring some market cycles, investors tend to price securities irrationally and incorrectly. Thus, tools such as economic forecasting and modelling cannot be used reliably to produce outperformance and reduce downside risk in the retail-dominated Asian markets. Instead, portfolio risk can be mitigated by constructing a portfolio of alpha-diversified strategies (please see our explanation of alpha groups in the Alpha Groups & Generation section ). Our focus is on each company’s intrinsic worth, and whether the listed price reflects that worth. The key to our success over the years is to buy at inexpensive valuations and to sell when a stock’s valuation becomes overstretched compared to its fundamentals. Sell DisciplineWe adhere to a clear sell discipline and exit when: 1) prices run ahead of fundamentals; 2) initial assumptions are proven wrong; 3) there are major changes in the fundamentals of either the industry or company. Redefining RiskIn our view, there are risks greater than volatility, such as overpaying for a security vis-à-vis its fundamentals. That is why we examine every stock inside-out before making investment decisions—an intimate understanding of a company helps us to evaluate its behaviour under a variety of circumstances such as business and economic cycles, political fluctuations, regulatory changes, structural events, management changeovers, among others.We also focus on a relatively concentrated portfolio of high-conviction stocks, which allows us to initiate positions at reasonable valuations. Our portfolios are also managed with liquidity risk in mind. Only a small proportion of the portfolio is exposed to illiquid stocks from time to time, and as appropriate, in order to earn an illiquidity premium. Competitive Advantages From APS’ Investment Approach1. Our investment decisions are based on insights that can only be gained through a disciplined and rigorously applied process. It goes beyond bottom-up research. 2. When the company’s internal or external circumstances evolve, we have sufficient facts to test and validate our investment theses and make rational decisions, without being influenced by market noise.3. This knowledge gives us the conviction to stay invested when less-informed investors irrationally run for the exit, revise our investment theses as needed and set valuation targets.

Alpha Groups







APS’ portfolios are “alpha diversified” for optimal alpha generationEvery stock in our portfolios is classified under 1 of 4 alpha groups: Structural alpha stocks possess structural strengths and/or core competencies and will likely outperform over the longer term. The investment horizon is normally more than 3 years.Dynamic alpha stocks are subject to cyclical factors such as troughs and peaks in sectors such as semi-conductor, property and airlines. The investment horizon is about 2 years. Economic alpha stocks are undervalued; they have a healthy earnings growth rate yet trade at a large discount to intrinsic value. The investment horizon is 1-3 years.Opportunistic alpha stocks are experiencing special events such as restructuring, product repositioning, mergers and acquisitions, etc. The investment horizon is relatively short, at 6-12 months.

Best Long/Short Asset Manager - Singapore  & Most Consistent Asian L/S Fund: APS Asia Pacific Long Short Fund








CONTACT DETAILSCompany: APS Asset Management               Email: cs@aps.com.sgWeb: www.aps.com.sgAddress: 3 Anson Road#23-01 Springleaf TowerSingapore 079909Phone: (65) 6333 8600Fax: (65) 6333 8900APS Asset Management was founded in 1995 by its CIO, Wong Kok Hoi, in Singapore. Since then, the firm has grown significantly, starting with assets under management of about USD15 million, which have since grown to USD2.8 billion as of the end of August in 2015. 
APS started with just seven staff in one office, which has now expanded to more than 60 staff and six offices worldwide. Despite these expansions, the core values and vision of APS have not changed. In the beginning, Mr Wong founded APS for three reasons. These include serving global institutional asset owners, specialising in Asian investments as well as employing investigative research and independent thinking in the investment process. All three foundations have remained constant throughout APS’ history. Today, nearly 80% of our AUM are from pensions, endowments and foundations and the rest are from family offices, financial institutions, sovereign wealth funds, corporates and high net-worth individuals.As mentioned before, APS’ investment decisions are predicated on investigative research and independent thinking. Our company research includes interviews with suppliers, competitors, peers, customers, former employees, industry specialists, management, employees and other relevant stakeholders. Through this process, our analysts walk the ground, visit facilities, test the products where possible and read the fine print. This process gives APS sufficient knowledge to make and, importantly, maintain high-conviction decisions even when the market temporarily runs against our contrarian stock selections for years at a stretch. Knowing each stock inside-out also allows us to revise our investment theses when circumstances change, and effectively value a stock and to set valuation targets.APS is a boutique in the sense that we are highly specialised, have our skin in the game alongside investors and are agile, decisive and bold. Our corporate infrastructure has the depth and breadth expected of a firm serving global institutional asset owners. We have fully staffed, in-house teams for investment, risk management, compliance, trading, investment administration, client services, marketing, sales and corporate functions. APS’ headquarters is in Singapore and we have three research offices in Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen, as well as an office in Tokyo and a representative office in New York.

  Interview with APS Asia Pacific Hedge Fund  
 November 2002 |  Matt Schmidt, Eurekahedge  






 












Reflections on 2002 and Prospects for the Coming Year
Wong Kok Hoi is the Managing Director and Chief Investment Officer of APS Asset Management based in Singapore. He has been the lead manager of the APS Asia Pacific Hedge Fund since its launch in April 2002. Prior to establishing APS, Mr. Wong was employed by Citibank and the GIC in Singapore. He has 20 years of investment experience. The APS Asia Pacific Hedge Fund is an Asia including Japan, equity long/short fund. It was up 20.26% for the year 2002.
Interview with Wong Kok Hoi

How did the marketing efforts go at the Goldman Sachs conference in Tokyo, and what are the marketing plans for 2003?
The trip to the Goldman conference in Tokyo was fruitful. We had more than 10 "one-on-one" meetings with prospective investors. Two fund-of-funds are now looking seriously at investing in our fund. Currently, the fund size is US$10 million. Now that we have built a track-record we are planning a roadshow to the States and Europe early next year. We believe we should meet with some success because our performance has been strong since its inception in April 2002, up 20%, making it one of the best funds this year. This is despite the volatility and uncertainties in the Asian markets.

What are the current risks for your portfolio if the United States proceeds with military action in Iraq in the first quarter of 2003? How are you addressing these issues today?
The APS Asia Pacific Hedge Fund is very much a market-neutral fund, i.e. with low net exposure to the market. We create our alphas from pure stock selection rather than market-directional bets. Therefore, events such as a war in Iraq or terrorists attacks don't affect our fund negatively. We will make money for as long as our stock-picking skills continue to be sharp. This comes from diligent work into company fundamental research and valuation work. This has been our competitive edge all these years.


The annualised standard deviation for the fund is quite high at 20% per annum since the fund was launched in April 2002. Is this volatility a concern or are you marketing the fund as a high risk/return product?
I am aware that the investment community in general has a fascination with standard deviation as a measure of risk. At APS we take a different view. We do not see volatility in isolation; we see it together with mean return. In our view, a fund with a minus 5% return with a standard deviation of 5% is a riskier investment than a fund with a mean return of 20% with a standard deviation of 20%, regardless of the angle from which you look at it. I will bet my house on the later fund anytime. We at APS believe that we reduce the risk of the fund by undertaking careful company research and doing detailed valuation work, and by so doing we aim to push the mean return of the fund as far to the right as possible. We don't think by tweaking the standard deviation you are actually reducing portfolio risk. I wish investing was as simple as we studied in textbooks. Since we launched our fund, it has not broken below par value. You can't say that our fund is risky when you don't lose money, can you? We think you reduce your fund risk by not making big bets especially with your short positions and not by guessing the market direction. Hence, we never thought, not even for a moment, that we are running a high risk/return fund.

You made very healthy returns in going short Japanese banks, is this a trade that you still view as having profit potential?
Firstly, we don't take trading positions, which is unique for long/short hedge funds. All our positions are established for the long-term. Many Japanese banks have negative equity so although we had made a killing by shorting them we don't think it is time to square our positions yet. I need to see some signs that the economy is about to turn the corner before I square my positions.

What other sectors are you finding interesting in Japan for both the long and short portfolios?
Selective stocks in the drug, video game, electronic, auto and consumer finance sectors make interesting long candidates and the majority of stocks in the remaining sectors are excellent short candidates. In a nutshell, I think Japan is a fertile ground for short candidates.


What countries and sectors in your mandate are you most optimistic about for 2003?
We are bullish on the manufacturing, consumer finance, drug, and consumer sectors. We have no preference for any country. We are particularly bearish on banks, property, telecommunications and government-run companies.

How are you finding the current conditions to borrow in Korea? Are you shorting individual names in Taiwan through swap arrangements?
Currently, we do not have short positions in either Taiwan or Korea. However, we are currently looking at some Korean stocks. Swaps are expensive and we eschew paying high costs.

You also run an extensive relative-value book in the fund. What is the relationship of this book with the investment style for the rest of the fund and the firm?
That is correct. About 60% of our positions within the fund are correlated in one way or another. We have, for instance, a pair between Japanese banks and Korean credit card companies such as LG Card. We believe that over the long run, credit-card companies are certainly more profitable than Japanese banks. Korean credit-card companies are making a spread of about 13-14% versus the 2-3% that banks are struggling to make. Long-run sustainable ROEs of LG Card for instance is expected to be above 30% as against Japanese banks making negative or low single-digit ROEs. LG Card is selling at a forward PE of about 4x and price-to-book of close to 1x.
This is definitely a classic example of what we do at APS: investing in companies with strong structural and competitive advantages that will last for at least 3-5 years - and buying them when they are still cheap. We are prepared to hold these stocks long-term and "weather" the market gyrations in between. We will then short stocks that suffer structural weaknesses and are overvalued. Once the positions are taken, we will keep a very close watch on any possible changes in the fundamentals of these companies.


What are your views on exposure (both net and gross) going into January 2003?
	Initially when we first started out the fund, we wanted to leverage the fund quite substantially. However, with the benefit of our experience so far, we found out that this was not possible. To date, our gross and net exposures have been less than 220% and 15%, respectively. Going forward, our net exposure will decline even further. We really want to generate alpha through our stock picking skills and nothing else.

Can you discuss your current views on Venture Manufacturing (Singapore) and Samsung Electronics (South Korea), the two biggest holdings in the fund at the end of November?
	Venture Manufacturing remains the most profitable contract manufacturer in the world today. The company's first-half results, announced in September 2002, showed that the company continued to surprise investors on the upside. Its net profits were up not 5% or 10% but 35% in times when other contract manufacturers are bleeding. Credit must go to senior management. We have invested in and tracked the company for 7 years now; and we think management is first class. We are not selling yet because the company will continue to benefit from the accelerating outsourcing trend.

	Samsung Electronics is a story that most people are familiar with. It is the world leader in DRAMs and TFT-LCD, and is rapidly increasing global market share in the mobile handset business. The company is immensely profitable with free cashflow that alone is expected to be US$5.5bn this year (pre-tax profits exceeding US$12bn). With so much cash, the company is able to invest in building fabs and R&D that pulls it ahead in the technological race, while its competitors lag behind. The amazing thing is that the stock is not priced at 20-25x PE as you might expect, but is priced at about 8x PE! We think that the company will be a very powerful and dominant technology company this decade.

Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at www.direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus or summary prospectus. Index performance does not include any fees or expenses, are unmanaged and cannot be invested in directly.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

                            WisdomTree now has the WisdomTree Dynamic Long/Short U.S.
                            Equity Fund (DYLS) and the WisdomTree Dynamic Bearish U.S. Equity Fund (DYB) enabling

WisdomTree Dynamic Long/Short U.S. Equity Fund

DYLS is a primarily long1
                                    strategy that is designed to add short2 exposure to hedge risk and reduce
                                    the net long exposure. The Fund can be 100%, 50%, or 0% net long, depending on market
                                    conditions. 
                                


WisdomTree Dynamic Bearish U.S. Equity Fund


                                    DYB is able to be net short or market neutral when the market environment 
                                    is considered poor or mixed, and can have a small net long position when 
                                    the environment is deemed more attractive. The Fund can be 25% net long, 0% net long or 100% net short.

Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Funds before investing. To obtain a prospectus containing this and other important information, please call 866.909.WISE (9473), or visit wisdomtree.com to view or download a prospectus. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing.

                                        There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal. The Fund invests in derivatives, including as a substitute to gain short exposure to equity securities. Derivative investments can be volatile, and these investments may be less liquid than other securities, and more sensitive to the effects of varied economic conditions. Derivatives used by the Fund to offset its exposure to market volatility may not perform as intended. The Fund may engage in “short sale” transactions and will lose value if the security or instrument that is the subject of a short sale increases in value. A Fund that has exposure to one or more sectors may increase the Fund’s vulnerability to any single economic or regulatory development. This may result in greater share price volatility. The composition of the respective Index underlying each Fund is heavily dependent on quantitative models and data from one or more third parties and the Index may not perform as intended. The Fund invests in the securities included in, or representative of, its Index regardless of their investment merit and the Fund does not attempt to outperform its Index or take defensive positions in declining markets.  Please read the Fund’s prospectus for specific details regarding the Fund’s risk profile.

        Regardless of whether you believe markets are efficient or return premiums exist, in any given year smart beta indexes that focus on capturing return premiums or “factors” are either going to out- or underperform market cap-weighted indexes. Over long periods, we feel that focusing on fundamentals and rebalancing back to those fundamentals at periodic intervals can add value over complete market cycles, partly by tilting toward known return premiums. In 2015, value and size (i.e., small caps) underperformed, but momentum, quality and low volatility outperformed.1   
Now the question is what factors will perform best in 2016 and whether the answer changes depending on the direction of the market. WisdomTree recently created the WisdomTree Dynamic Long/Short U.S. Equity Index (WTDLS), designed to generate alpha at the core with a multi-factor stock selection model along with the ability to hedge market risk dynamically. 
Key Features to WisdomTree Approach 
WisdomTree has been a pioneer in fundamental indexing for almost a decade, typically focusing on signal factors such as value, quality and size; but now we are pleased to introduce this new multi-factor approach. The WisdomTree Dynamic Long U.S. Equity Index (WTDL) is the long component of WTDLS and comprises approximately 100 stocks with the highest combined fundamentals, which are low volatility weighted and rebalanced quarterly. 
•	Fundamental Selection: Stocks are graded on a combination of growth, quality and value factors, and the most attractive stocks in each sector are selected for inclusion. It is important to note that each sector has its own unique factor scoring system, because we believe a different set of fundamentals may potentially work better in one sector as opposed to another. By combining quality and value factors, which we believe complement each other, we hope to smooth the return variance in the short term, while still tapping into the long-term return premiums. 
 
•	Low-Volatility Weighting: In each sector, the Index assigns higher weights to stocks that exhibit lower volatility characteristics, as measured by the stocks’ standard deviation and beta to the market. We know that low volatility weighting has historically worked as a single factor, so we believe applying it to a multi-factor selection model will also add value.  
 
•	Sector-Neutral Capping: The Index targets a sector-neutral allocation when compared to the largest 500 U.S. stocks by market capitalization. We believe this keeps the Index properly diversified and eliminates the potential for the fundamental selection or low-volatility weighting to significantly over- or under-weight certain sectors. We are confident about the stock selection and weighting process, so we wanted to rely on that to drive the relative return differentials instead of taking sector bets against a cap-weighted index.
To get a sense of the outcome from the selection and weighting process, we compared WTDL against popular market cap-weighted style and factor indexes. 
 
Index Valuations

For definitions of terms and indexes in the chart, visit our glossary. 
 
•	Attractive across Multiple Valuation Measures: We find it impressive, but not surprising, that WTDL scored high on multiple valuation measures. As of 12/31/2015, WTDL had the highest dividend yield; it also showed similar price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios as the S&P 500 Value Index, both indicators highlighting its tilt toward value. WTDL had the second-highest quality metrics, defined by return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA), a very close second only to the MSCI USA Quality Index, which focuses more directly on that factor. Lastly, WTDL had higher profit margins than the S&P 500 Index and very similar growth expectations. 
 
Dynamic Hedging Indicator
The above table highlights how WTDL had diversified exposure across multiple factors—but what if markets are choppy? For one thing, the low-volatility weighting methodology could help smooth the returns and lower market drawdowns, but a primary driver will be the dynamic hedging indicator.  
The dynamic hedging indicator uses growth and quality indicators such as profit margins and popular valuation measures to determine the hedge ratio or short percentage. So when the fundamentals, or profits, of the universe are deteriorating, the dynamic indicator would look to hedge the portfolio or increase the short percentage. Similarly, as valuations become more stretched, adding risk to the portfolio, the indicator would look to hedge as well. 
While our hedging indicator will certainly not get every market downdraft timed perfectly, it did start getting more bearishly positioned toward the end of 2015 and signaled to be 100% hedge for January 2016, making the net equity exposure for WTDLS 0% (or market neutral). We believe the factor diversity and dynamic equity exposure this index provides deserve a second look, given the recent market volatility and uncertainty for 2016.
