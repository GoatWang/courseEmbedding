Proven Brands
Local and National advertisers recognize the affinity that consumers have with CBS RADIO’s brands across our 117 radio stations and digital properties in 26 markets. Radio enjoys the highest and most stable reach of all media, reaching 93% of adults 18 and over across the country. CBS RADIO stations reach approximately 65 million listeners per week, making us the second-largest radio group in the United States. Our portfolio of large-market stations and digital properties provides a strong national footprint and uniquely positions us to create best-in-class local and national campaigns so advertisers can reach their most desirable audiences.











EventsPlus
If you’re looking to take your events to the next level, CBS RADIO has the only customizable end-to-end events services platform designed to fit a client’s needs, grow attendance, and increase revenue. Events Plus can serve as your local, regional, and national sponsorship sales and marketing team as well as handling all other backend activities such as ticketing solutions, so clients can concentrate on doing what you do best: putting on great events. Events Plus can expand and contract based on a client’s needs for each individual event. Clients can take the full suite of services or pick only one to help create the most profitable, engaging, and memorable events possible.











CBS RADIO ANALYTICS
At CBS RADIO, we can measure the impact of audience delivery and engagement so that your campaigns show proven results. Through Airtime Analytics, an exclusive tool offered only by CBS RADIO in the markets where we operate, we qualify our audiences and track web traffic to decipher the right mix of creative content and placement and optimize along the way. Armed with that data, we can make recommendations on how to maximize performance and enhance your media mix. We help answer the age-old questions: “How hard are my media dollars working?” “Do I have the right creative?” “How engaged is my audience?” 











CONCERTS. FESTIVALS. SPEAKERS. SPORTS!
CBS RADIO delivers valuable audiences and access to a diverse range of live events, from concerts and multi-day music festivals to speaker series and sports-related events. Annually, we produce, co-produce, or co-promote approximately 600 live events offering unique, out-of-home experiences for our audiences, as well as sponsorship and consumer engagement opportunities for our advertisers. Some of our most high-profile, advertiser-favorite national events include “We Can Survive” and “Stars and Strings.”  Both are sure-to-sell-out concerts that pair marquee experiences with world-class artists. On the local front, we offer heritage events such as KROQ’s “Acoustic Christmas,” two consecutive nights of the biggest rock artists in the world, and “Triple Ho Show,” a holiday favorite hosted by KMVQ in San Francisco, which featured chart-topping stars Justin Bieber and Britney Spears in 2016.
