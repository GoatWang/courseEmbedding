			Mr. Dove, 60, was named the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer on January 1, 2017, pursuant to the succession process announced in May 2016 and discussed in more detail below. He held the positions for the Company of President and Chief Operating Officer from December 2004 to January 2017, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer from February 2000 to November 2004 and Executive Vice President - Business Development from August 1997 to January 2000. Mr. Dove also served as President and Chief Operating Officer of the general partner of Pioneer Southwest Energy Partners L.P. ("Pioneer Southwest"), which was a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company, from June 2007 through the Company's acquisition of Pioneer Southwest in December 2013. Mr. Dove joined Parker & Parsley Petroleum Company, a predecessor of the Company (together with its predecessor companies, "Parker & Parsley"), in 1994 as a Vice President and was promoted to Senior Vice President - Business Development in October 1996, in which position he served until the Company's formation in August 1997. Before joining Parker & Parsley, Mr. Dove was employed with Diamond Shamrock Corp and its successor, Maxus Energy Corp., in various capacities in international exploration and production, marketing, refining, and planning and development. The Board believes that Mr. Dove is qualified to serve on the Board based on his professional experience and education, and particularly, his role as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, his experience as the former Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, his educational background and work experience in petroleum engineering, his deep knowledge of the Company resulting from his long tenure with the Company and its predecessor, and his extensive knowledge of the energy industry. Mr. Dove's severance agreement provides that his failure to be re-elected constitutes "good reason" under his severance agreement whether or not his resignation is accepted by the Board, which would entitle him to terminate his employment and receive the benefits described in the section below entitled "Executive Compensation Tables - Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control."

.Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

The 1980s film WarGames contains an important lesson for OPEC and shale producers about the futility of trying to manage the oil market. Released in 1983, the movie blended new concerns about home computers and hacking with older concerns about the accidental start of nuclear conflict and mutually assured destruction.

OIL: Oil is slightly higher in Asia, WTI last trading up $0.14 at $43.52. WTI dropped on Friday, hitting lows of $42.63 after hitting the lowest since July 2016 last week at just above $42/bbl. Analysts say the market is being supported by dip buying/short covering around these levels, though caution that demand is shakey with the supply glut still weighing. Markets look ahead to the API inventory figures later, a decline of 2mln bbls is expected. - It doesn't look good for the supply overhang, the chairman of Pioneer Natural Resources said that US shale producers will still breakeven even if prices fall to around $25/bbl. meaning it could be some time before producers are squeezed out of the market. Markets will watch the EIA energy conference in Washington for further shale producer commentary. - An article out earlier today from oilprice.com reported comments from Iranian Oil Terminals Company that Kharg oil terminal in Iran has increased its crude oil loading capacity to 8mln BPD. - MNI technical analysis sees support at $43.22 the June 26 hourly support, resistance is seen at $43.65 the June 26 high.

Crude oil's bear market is highlighting the haves and have nots among U.S. shale producers, with the stronger promising to keep pumping even as prospects dim for some of their financially strapped peers. Crude prices have dropped more than 20 percent since late February, in part because of rising U.S. shale production that is offsetting OPEC's efforts to tame global stockpiles.

Cash, people and equipment are pouring into the prolific Permian shale basin in Texas as business booms in the largest U.S. oilfield. The speed of the recovery in the U.S. shale industry in the past year has surprised oil investors after a global supply glut led to a two-year crude price slump and bankrupted many shale firms.

Energy stocks led S&P 500 decliners on Tuesday, as crude oil prices extended recent losses after OPEC stopped short of more aggressive action to cut production. July West Texas Intermediate crude declined by 35 cents, or 0.7%, to $49.46 a barrel, as traders returned to their desks after the holiday weekend. Devon Energy (DVN) was the biggest decliner, falling 2.8%.

You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.
