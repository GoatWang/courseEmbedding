Company History

AdvancePierre® Foods benefits from the rich history and niche expertise of four family-owned and operated food companies joined under the AdvancePierre Foods name.

Our story begins with a young Cincinnati lawyer and passionate foodie, Samuel Dinerman. His culinary talents earned him the nickname "Pierre" and when he founded his own business selling frozen food products to restaurants in 1946, he lent it his nickname.


Decades later, in 1973, another chapter of the AdvancePierre Foods story was written when Paul Allen and David McLaughlin founded Advance Food Company, an Oklahoma-based manufacturer of hamburger patties and breaded beef. After getting its start supplying local restaurants, grocers and regional foodservice distributors, the company's footprint expanded. In 2001, it joined forces with Excel Specialty Products, a subsidiary of Cargill, to form Advance Brands, LLC.


Pierre Foods, Advance Foods and Advance Brands united in 2010 to create AdvancePierre Foods. Their individual storylines were woven together with a common thread: the never-ending pursuit to delight customers. In 2011, the company further deepened its expertise with the purchase of Barber Foods®, a maker of stuffed chicken breasts and other chicken products based in Portland, Maine.


In 2015, AdvancePierre Foods further fortified its position as the nation's market leader in sandwiches with the acquisition of the wholesale and manufacturing operations of Landshire, Inc., an Illinois-based maker of sandwiches, and the acquisition of the manufacturing assets of Better Bakery, maker of premium, handcrafted stuffed sandwiches.


On July 15, 2016, AdvancePierre Foods Holdings, Inc., began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol “APFH.” Transitioning from a private company to a public entity marked an exciting and important milestone for the company.


Less than three months after going public, AdvancePierre Foods acquired Allied Specialty Foods, strengthening our leadership position in raw Philly steak while providing us entry into the fully cooked offering.

From value-added proteins and breads to sandwich assembly, packaging and nationwide distribution, today's AdvancePierre Foods delivers superior value to customers and quality food experiences for their patrons. We invite our customers to continue crafting the AdvancePierre Foods story through ongoing collaboration and innovation.

Highly Strategic and Accretive Acquisition Expands Raw Philly Steak
      Market Leadership, Provides Entry into Fully Cooked Offering

CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      AdvancePierre Foods (NYSE: APFH) (“AdvancePierre”), a leading national
      producer and distributor of sandwiches, sandwich components and other
      entrées and snacks, today announced it has completed the acquisition of
      Allied Specialty Foods, Inc. (“Allied”), a pioneering manufacturer of
      raw and cooked beef and chicken Philly steak products, from Steven Zoll,
      for $60 million in cash, subject to certain post-closing adjustments.
	
      “We are pleased to add Allied’s synergistic product platform and unique
      capabilities to our existing portfolio and network,” said John Simons,
      President and CEO of AdvancePierre. “The Philly steak category is primed
      for growth, and this acquisition strengthens our position, brings us
      additional products and production capacity, and expands our geographic
      reach.”
	
      Founded in 1956, Allied has been an innovative leader in the
      manufacturing of raw and fully-cooked Philly steak products for
      foodservice customers nationwide. Allied’s customer base is
      predominantly in the foodservice industry, which it currently serves
      from a 20,000-sq.-ft. manufacturing facility in Vineland, New Jersey,
      with two cook lines, three raw slicing lines and one breakaway steak
      line. In June 2016, the company began building a new 70,000-sq.-ft.
      facility with seven raw slicing/breakaway lines and four cook lines,
      which is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2017.
	
      “The addition of Allied further expands AdvancePierre’s market-leading
      position in the Philly steak platform by providing entry into
      fully-cooked product offerings,” said Dean Hollis, Chairman of the
      AdvancePierre Board of Directors. “The transaction is a great example of
      AdvancePierre’s strategy of strengthening and growing its core business
      through disciplined, accretive acquisitions. We continue to evaluate a
      significant number of highly attractive, synergistic acquisition
      opportunities on the horizon and believe AdvancePierre is
      well-positioned and capitalized to pursue future opportunities as they
      arise.”
	
Transaction Consideration

      AdvancePierre funded the total purchase price entirely from existing
      cash. The company expects the acquisition will be accretive to fiscal
      2017 earnings per share by $0.07 - $0.09, reflecting $11-13 million of
      earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)
      including the realization of expected cost synergies.

Since the initial public offering in 1970, when sales were $115 million, Sysco has grown to $37 billion in sales for fiscal year 2010.

Many solid customer relationships have been nurtured along the way, countless dining trends and meal alternatives have evolved, and today the decision to consume meals prepared away from home is as much necessity as choice. Since then, the industry it serves has expanded from $35 billion to more than $200 billion.

Operating from more than 180 locations throughout the United States, Canada and Ireland, Sysco's product lines are as diverse as the 45,000 employees who support its daily operations. They include not only the ingredients needed to prepare meals, but also numerous ancillary preparation and serving items. As a result, Sysco can make a difference in its customers' lives and the success of their businesses
