Mike d. Severely disabled loyal client. March 2017.Catania & Catania PATricia O. ratedCan't say enough good things about Catania & Catania. I have been working with Paul Catania and Lisa Keeler for the last three years on a very unique lawsuit I was involved in and I am so thankful to have had their support and expertise on my side. They walked me through every aspect of the legal process, made sure I understood everything I needed to, and got me involved when necessary. Working with Paul made my case as simple as possible while still providing me with the greatest outcome I could have possibly hoped for. He made contacting and communicating with him very easy and I felt that I could call him anytime and he would have time to talk with me. As a college student, he took the time to explain everything to me in terms that I understood. Paul provided guidance to me throughout the legal process and he always respected my decisions.Working with Paul and his team exceeded my expectations. I would recommend them to anyone and everyone who needs a top notch lawyer with the experience to win your case, but who will also be sensitive to you and your situation. The Law Offices of Patrick LeducApril J. ratedI just want to thank you for all your help with my son, I don't know what I would do with out you, this has been a very heartbreaking time for me.  Steven has been going to NA and bible study and has read all of the new testament, he actually got up in front of his bible study group and did a 10 minute talk and what coming to the bible study has meant to him and reading this NIV Bible has meant to him and how it has changed him.  Now I know you haven't been around my son in a social setting, but that is not Steven he has never been one to get up in front of people and speak, he is very nervous, and actually introverted.  I was so proud of him. Tiny steps, I continue to pray for him every day and me, and my girls.. and  again will never be able to thank you enough.  Patrick is a wonderful, humble man, who can be aggressive when he needs to be.  He explains everything to you, so that you know what to expect before it happens, it was indeed a blessing having Patrick as our lawyer.Catania & Catania PAPaul M. ratedWe  called Catania & Catania  for a social security disability needs.  We had called other attorney offices, trying to get help filing for disability. Only to keep getting  the runaround.  The first time we called Catania & Catania   we received the attention we needed we got the information we needed  and was told we needed to do.  Jennifer Whinnery  and everyone we spoke to was very professional and polite.   if we called the office and needed to speak with her and she wasn't available she always  call back  promptly.  Even when we met her in person she was a delight to be around. Ourcase is not complete yet but we have been told it may take a while.   I would recommend their services to all my family and friends because they do not leave you hanging alone without letting you know what's going on it is really nice to know that people is listening when you're talking. Hope I never need to call them again but if I do it is great to know that they are there.The Law Offices of Patrick LeducMary P. ratedExcellent Attorney   Getting that phone call from jail was one of the worst days of my life. My son was facing several felonies and serious prison time.   Since I lived out of town, that made it much worst.   I contacted Attorney Patrick Leduc.  After our first conversation, I knew I had the right lawyer.  He immediately started working on my son’s case.   He is an extraordinarily person.   Attorney Leduc is a hard working, highly effective advocate for his clients.  He listens, and answered all my questions.  He kept me informed on all assignments and progress throughout the entire process.  My son’s case is now a misdemeanor.  He is more than an Attorney; he is also a mentor for my son.   He is a man of faith, and really cares about his clients    His knowledge, values, skills, experience and expertise are the reasons I strongly recommend Attorney Leduc. Law Offices of Buddy D. Ford, P.A.fallinember ratedI needed an immediate appointment with a law firm to discuss my options so I would not lose my home to foreclosure and called many firms in the area. This was the only firm that was willing to fit me in immediately! Not only was I able to get an appointment that day, the lady on the phone made me feel at ease. I have never needed an attorney before so receiving a threatening letter in the mail freaked me out. I really appreciated how this firm made me feel! This was such an embarrassing situation and to reach out for help is embarrassing and I really appreciated the way I was treated. They gave me the answers to my questions and now I am able to move forward with the firm and get this foreclosure matter resolved. I NEVER write reviews but I was impressed!Law Offices of Scott P. DavisJeff M. ratedI have never worked with an attorney until my divorce last year.  I was very fortunate to have Mr. Davis represent me through this long, difficult, and emotional process.   Mr. Davis patiently guided me through every step of my case and always made me feel like my case was very important to him.  Mr. Davis was compassionate, patient, and easy to talk to.  He kept me informed with all aspects regarding my case and returned my calls and emails in a timely manner.  He was relentless in his negotiations with the other attorney and did an amazing job in court when we were unable to settle out of court.  I highly recommend him.  Law Offices of Buddy D. Ford, P.A.rpatel13 ratedMr. Ford came highly recommended to me by word of mouth in the hotel industry who had much success with their hotels and was surprised to learn that his firm has represented many hotels with similar issues with much success over the years. I consulted with Mr. Ford regarding my hotel and looking into possibly doing a reorganization and with the positive recommendations from others in the industry and with the advice from the firm, I trusted to hire Mr. Ford.

Hands down the best lawyer . -kristlynn; N.Y Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online.

How we think
Every modern deck carries with it a thousand year heritage bearing a rich variety of influences from gaming through to fortune telling. As the tradition has developed, political and social circumstances, historical quirks and coincidences as well as manufacturing and technical refinements have all come together in shaping the evolution of its design.
Today’s finest playing cards are designed and manufactured to incredibly high standards. Each deck can be considered not just a pack of cards but an object of great beauty and an item to be both shared and cherished.
What we do
“It is our mission to help gamers, magicians, cardists and collectors better celebrate and enjoy their beloved decks by creating beautiful display cases, care products and other accessories that enhance their performance, longevity and exposition”
“We combine the work of expert manufacturers and consultants with in-house processes to create luxury products which would complement any collection of cards”

History

Deck Finesse is the creation of magician and playing card collector Robert D.Adams. After discovering the wonderful modern card collecting scene via the magic industry he soon became an enthusiast of modern decks as well as developing a keen interest in the fascinating history of playing cards.
After several years of eagerly amassing decks Robert felt that his collection wasn’t being looked after or displayed to its full potential. It seemed that there was nothing available which would do the cards justice. So to better show off and care for the cards he put together some original accessories.
Keen to contribute to the fantastic communities of card collectors and to enable people to get the best out of their collections, we began to develop and refine these ideas as the basis of our product range.
