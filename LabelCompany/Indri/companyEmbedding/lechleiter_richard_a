Work Product Developed in Connection With the Rent Reset Process
(June 19th, 2006)
LOUISVILLE, Ky. (June 19, 2006)  Kindred Healthcare, Inc. (Kindred) (NYSE:KND) today announced that it has filed a lawsuit seeking injunctive and declaratory relief arising out of a demand by Ventas, Inc. (Ventas) (NYSE:VTR) that Kindred turn over to Ventas the fair market rental appraisals commissioned by Kindred in connection with the rent reset process. The filing of the lawsuit was specifically prompted by the delivery of a June 14, 2006 letter by Ventas counsel to Kindreds lender, JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, (JPM), asserting that an Event of Default exists under Ventas Master Lease Agreements with Kindred as a result of Kindreds refusal to turn over its fair market rental appraisals to Ventas. Kindred believes that Ventas position is a meritless ploy designed to obtain materials to which Ventas has no entitlement, so as to afford Ventas an unfair advantage in the rent reset process.
