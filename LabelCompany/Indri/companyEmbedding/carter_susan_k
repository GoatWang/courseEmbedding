Girls will love Andrea's new adventures in Circle C Milestones, the continuation of Susan K. Marlow's two popular Circle C seriesIt's no secret that Andrea Carter would rather ride her beloved palomino, Taffy, than do anything else. Now Taffy's having her first foal, and Andi can't wait to train it to become as good a companion as its mother. The only distraction from those delightful plans is the fear that something may go wrong. When her foaling fears are realized, Andi is grateful for her brother Chad's intervention. It looks like smooth sailing from now on Unfortunately, life as a teenager might not be all fun and games after all. There's a new girl at school assigned to sit beside Andi--but Macy Walker is nothing like the other girls. She's homeless and ill-bred, and her mistakes do more than make Andi uncomfortable; they put her life in danger. Meanwhile, cattle rustlers have suddenly descended on the Valley and the Circle C ranch is a target. These outlaws mean business--and their business is theft.When the thieves change from stealing cattle to stealing horses, it means heartbreaking loss for Andi. Her unpleasant classmate Macy may hold the key to getting Taffy's foal back. Can Andi trust Macy to do the right thing? Does she have a choice?Picking up the story line of Andrea Carter and the Price of Truth, Thick as Thieves sees Andi growing up just in time for her loyal readers to grow alongside her. The Circle C Milestones series will follow Andi from age 14 to 17, as she begins to tackle the more serious issues facing an older audience and--eventually--discovers love.

Without warning, the enormous animal reared up and screamed a challenge. The blood drained from Andi's face at the sound. Her mind shouted, Jump down! But she couldn't move. She choked back a cry and watched in horror as the stallion's huge black hooves bore down on her. Twelve-year-old Andrea "Andi" Carter attracts trouble the way her palomino horse, Taffy, draws flies on a hot summer day. Andi's entire family and the ranch hands at the Circle C treat her like a pesky kid, and Andi sometimes wonders if her family would be better off without her. So after one really frightening event where she gets into major trouble, she saddles up Taffy and runs away from home. But her escape doesn't earn her the freedom she expected. In fact, encounters with a horse thief and a vicious girl convince Andi that life on her own can be downright terrifying. Susan K. Marlow, like Andi, sometimes finds herself in bizarre messes, but it's usually because she's trying to help someone. Currently, Susan uses her elementary education degree as she teaches her youngest two children at home in Washington State.

Overview
Horses, adventure, and the old West--mixed with a solid message for today's tweens--make this a must-read for tweens. Twelve-year-old Andrea "Andi" Carter attracts trouble the way her palomino horse, Taffy, attracts flies on a hot summer day. Andi's entire family and the staff at the Circle C Ranch treat her like such a pesky kid that she sometimes wonders if they would all be better off without her. After a particularly scary incident where Andi gets in trouble once again, she saddles up Taffy and runs away from home. But her escape quickly leads to frightening encounters with a horse thief and a vicious young lady. All of which makes Andi realize that there really is no place like home.

Very Enjoyable Read!


                            Published by Thriftbooks.com User, 12 years ago
                        

                            In this wonderful teen novel we meet perky 12-year old Andi and her beloved horse Taffy. Andi is the type of girl that loves adventure, is curious about everything and always seems to get into trouble, despite her best efforts not to. After causing a ruckus and almost losing her life by being careless with a wild horse, Andi is afraid she will be sent to her aunts since her family is at wits end with her daily bouts of trouble and something must be done. Overhearing her family discussing her possible future, Andi decides she will run away and make it on her own.  Bad move! Her youth does not give her the wisdom that is needed to be on the look-out for the many unsavory people that lurk in the world, and so she loses her beloved horse Taffy to a horse thief, almost loses her own life,  and learns the hard way how those not as fortunate as herself must live just to survive.   I really enjoyed this book.  It was a quick paced read and kept my interest from beginning to end.  It has some great teaching elements in it and a wonderful storyline. I recommend it highly, a very enjoyable read. 
                        





A Fast Read for a Long Ride


                            Published by Thriftbooks.com User, 12 years ago
                        

                            Irrepressible Andi Carter gets picked on one too many times by her family and off she goes on a totally unexpected and often unwelcome Wild West adventure. She loses her way, she loses her horse, she loses her freedom, and she almost loses her life. But she comes out all right, thanks to the inner strengths she picked up in that family of hers, and to the faith they helped instill in her. Like Dorothy of Kansas, Andi of California learns the hard way that "there's no place like home." A page-turner that's completely safe for the whole family to read.
                        





Recomended for pre-teens


                            Published by Thriftbooks.com User, 12 years ago
                        

                            Pre-teens will love LONG RIDE HOME. They will indentify with Andi Carter who only seems to do things that get her into trouble. Readers will be swept up in the high dreama of a girl's love for her horse. The surprising twist at the end will leave them clamoring for more books by Susan K Marlou.

                            Andi and her palomino Taffy rode straight into my heart the moment I met them. I laughed, cried, and relived my tomboy years spend wishing I could have lived on a cattle ranch in the Old West. It was sad to tell Andi and her friends good-bye at the end of the book, but I hope to meet them again in sequels sure to be just as inspiring, entertaining, and well-crafted as "Andrea Carter and the Long Ride Home." Author/educator Susan K. Marlow has used her interest in and extensive knowlege of California in the 1800s to create a book to be read and reread. Colleen L. Reece, Author of 140 books

                            I previewed this book for my daughter and couldn't put it down.  My daughter felt the same way when I finally finished and gave it to her.  I was happy to have her read it because she enjoys adventure and because even though Andrea makes some poor choices she ends up learning lessons through the consequences.  It is nice to be able to give my child a fun book that also has positive messages.

I laughed, cried, and relived my tomboy years spend wishing I could have lived on a cattle ranch in the Old West. It was sad to tell Andi and her friends good-bye at the end of the book, but I hope to meet them again in sequels sure to be just as inspiring, entertaining, and well-crafted as "Andrea Carter and the Long Ride Home." Author/educator Susan K. Marlow has used her interest in and extensive knowlege of California in the 1800s to create a book to be read and reread. Colleen L. Reece, Author of 140 books

                            I previewed this book for my daughter and couldn't put it down.  My daughter felt the same way when I finally finished and gave it to her.  I was happy to have her read it because she enjoys adventure and because even though Andrea makes some poor choices she ends up learning lessons through the consequences.  It is nice to be able to give my child a fun book that also has positive messages.
