Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) are sold only by prospectus. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing which contains a detailed explanation of the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Investors should consult their accounting, legal, or tax advisor.


* Information labeled “Fee-Based Account” provides information pertaining to units purchased through registered investment advisers, certified financial planners or registered broker-dealers who in each case either charge investor accounts periodic fees for brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such services in connection with an investment account for which a comprehensive “wrap fee” charge is imposed. You should consult your financial advisor to determine whether you can benefit from these accounts and whether your unit purchases are eligible for this discount. To purchase units in these accounts, your financial advisor must purchase units designated with one of the Fee Account CUSIP numbers, if available. The amounts shown are different from what would be applicable for units purchased in other accounts (i.e. “Commission-Based Accounts”) not eligible for this discount.  See your prospectus and consult your financial advisor for more information about eligibility and applicability of the Fee-Based Account discount.

Our VisionOur Team 






 





Capturing Results Through Innovation and Discipline Through a structured and disciplined approach we will provide exclusivity and customized investment strategies for our clients.  We will be distinguishable by the personal relationships we build with our clients, truly listening to and understanding their financial goals and objectives.


Right around the midpoint in life, humans tend to learn that if you make a decision in an emotional state of mind, you have a great chance of making the wrong choice.  Among the most damaging emotions of all are greed and fear.


Fortunately, life experience serves you well and success is achieved in family and in business.  This wisdom brings financial rewards.  Sound decision making allows you to achieve substantial life goals and to surround yourself with friends and colleagues who have the same long-range vision.  


Yet when it comes to investing in the market, seasoned life veterans inadvertently join hands with an entire population that never learned the same lessons.  Unknowingly, their investments are commingled with approximately 85% of the marketplace who make investment decisions based on greed and fear.  This herd mentality drives the market impacting your holdings at this very moment…

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks

              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

("ICBA").  Howe Barnes Hoefer & Arnett, Inc. ("Howe Barnes"), selected the      
stocks for the portfolio.  Howe Barnes considered a variety of factors in       
selecting the stocks, including:                                                

*  financial criteria of the company (or its bank or thrift subsidiary);    

*  regulatory capital levels;                                               

*  net interest margins;                                                    

*  return on average assets;                                                

*  return on average equity;                                                

*  adequacy of loan loss reserve;                                           

*  level of non-performing and non-accrual loans; and                       

*  loan charge-off history.                                                 

While many of the stocks pay dividends, Howe Barnes did not specifically    
consider dividend payments in selecting the stocks.

 PRINCIPAL RISKS

As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in this trust.  The
trust also might not perform as well as you expect.  This can happen for reasons
such as these:                                                                  

*  STOCK PRICES WILL FLUCTUATE.  The value of your investment may fall over     
time.                                                                     

*  THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AN ISSUER MAY WORSEN, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION IN 
THE VALUE OF YOUR UNITS.  This may occur at any point in time, including  
during the initial offering period.                                       

*  AN ISSUER MAY BE UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO DECLARE DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE, OR  
 MAY REDUCE THE LEVEL OF DIVIDENDS DECLARED.  This may result in a reduction
in the value of your units.                                               

*  THE TRUST INVESTS EXCLUSIVELY IN COMMON STOCKS OF COMMUNITY BANK HOLDING     
COMPANIES.  Negative developments in the community banking industry will  
affect the value of your investment more than would be the case in a more 
diversified portfolio.                                                    

*  THE TRUST INVESTS SIGNIFICANTLY IN STOCKS OF SMALL AND MID-SIZE COMPANIES.   
These stocks are often more volatile and have lower trading volumes than  
stocks of larger companies.  Small and mid-size companies may have limited
products or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly
available information.                                                    

*  WE<FN1>* DO NOT ACTIVELY MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO.  Except in limited            
circumstances, the trust will hold shares of the same stocks even if their
market value declines.  The trust is not managed or supervised by Howe    
Barnes, ICBA Capital Markets, LLC or its affiliates, or any ICBA-related  
entity.

 EXAMPLE

This example helps you compare the cost of this trust with other unit trusts
and mutual funds.  In the example we assume that the expenses do not change and 
that the trust's annual return is 5%.  Your actual returns and expenses will    
vary.  Based on these assumptions, you would pay these expenses for every       
$10,000 you invest in the trust:                                                

1 year                           $378                       
3 years (life of trust)          $437                       

 These amounts are the same regardless of whether you sell your investments at
the end of a period or continue to hold your investment.

 THE TRUST

The trust invests primarily in common stocks of bank holding companies whose
subsidiary banks are members of the ICBA.  Howe Barnes selected the stocks for  
the portfolio.  Howe Barnes considered a variety of factors in selecting the    
stocks, including:                                                              

*  financial criteria of the company (or its bank or thrift subsidiary);    

*  regulatory capital levels;                                               

*  net interest margins;                                                    

*  return on average assets;                                                

*  return on average equity;                                                

*  adequacy of loan loss reserve;                                           

*  level of non-performing and non-accrual loans; and                       

*  loan charge-off history.                                                 

While many of the stocks pay dividends, Howe Barnes did not specifically    
consider dividend payments in selecting the stocks.                             

Howe Barnes feels that the stocks in the portfolio have the potential to    
increase in value over time primarily due to strong or improving fundamental    
characteristics such as:                                                        

*  management strength and depth;                                           

*  strategic banking locations in stable or growing market areas;           

*  strong asset quality; and                                                

*  potential earnings growth.                                               

In addition, continued bank and thrift consolidation may create attractive  
investment opportunities among community bank and thrift stocks.                

 Community banks are independent, locally owned and operated institutions with
assets ranging from less than $10 million to a few billion dollars.  There are  
more than 5,000 community banks, including both commercial banks and savings and
loans.  Community banks often offer comprehensive retail banking services and   
products such as checking and savings products, electronic banking, automated   
teller machines, credit and debit cards, mortgage and consumer loan products,   
investment products, and small business and agricultural lending.  Nearly 1,380 
community bank stocks are currently publicly-traded.                            

The ICBA represents the largest constituency of community banks of all sizes
and charter types in the United States, and is dedicated exclusively to         
protecting the interests of the community banking industry.  ICBA aggregates the
power of its members to provide:  a voice for community banking interests in    
government affairs; resources to enhance community bank education and           
marketability, and; profitability options to help community banks compete in an 
ever-changing marketplace.  With nearly 4,700 members, the ICBA is dedicated    
exclusively to enhancing the franchise value of the nation's community banks for
the benefit of their customers and the communities they serve.                  

ICBA Securities Corporation ("ICBA Securities") is a subsidiary of the ICBA 
Services Network, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the ICBA.  ICBA Securities 
provides sophisticated investment portfolio management assistance to more than  
1,500 community banks.  ICBA Securities is a broker-dealer registered with the  
Securities and Exchange Commission and a member

HOW TO BUY UNITS

 You can buy units of the trust by contacting your financial professional.  It
is anticipated that units will be sold only on the trust's inception date.  Unit
prices are available daily on the Internet at WWW.AAMPORTFOLIOS.COM.  The public
offering price of units includes:                                               

*  the net asset value per unit plus                                        

*  the sales fee.                                                           

 The "net asset value per unit" is the value of the securities, cash and other
assets in the trust reduced by the liabilities of the trust divided by the total
units outstanding.  We often refer to the public offering price of units as the 
"offer price" or "purchase price."  We must receive your order to buy units     
prior to the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange (normally  
4:00 p.m. Eastern time) to give you the price for that day.  If we receive your 
order after this time, you will not receive the price computed on that day.     
Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction or other fee for processing unit
purchase orders.                                                                

VALUE OF THE SECURITIES.  We determine the value of the securities as of the
close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on each day that        
exchange is open.  We generally determine the value of securities using the last
sale price for securities traded on a national securities exchange.  For this   
purpose, the trustee provides us closing prices from a reporting service        
approved by us.  In some cases we will price a security based on its fair value 
after considering appropriate factors relevant to value of the security.  We    
will only

do this if a security is not principally traded on a national securities        
exchange or if the market quotes are unavailable or inappropriate.              

 We determined the initial prices of the securities shown under "Portfolio" in
this prospectus as described above at the close of regular trading on the New   
York Stock Exchange on the business day before the date of this prospectus.  On 
the first day we sell units we will compute the unit price as of the close of   
regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange or the time the registration     
statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission becomes effective,  
if later.                                                                       

SALES FEE.  You pay a fee in connection with purchasing units.  We refer to 
this fee as the "sales fee."  The maximum sales fee equals 3.50% of the public  
offering price per unit at the time of purchase.  The sales fee will be reduced 
by 1/2 of 1% on each October 25, commencing October 25, 2008 to a minimum sales 
fee of 2.50% You pay the sales fee at the time you buy units.                   

REDUCING YOUR SALES FEE.  We offer a variety of ways for you to reduce the  
fee you pay.  It is your financial professional's responsibility to alert us of 
any discount when you order units.                                              

Large Purchases.  You can reduce your sales fee by increasing the size of   
your investment.  If you purchase units in the initial offering period in the   
amount of $500,000 or more on any single day from any one broker-dealer, the    
sales fee is 2.50% of the public offering price per unit.                       

 Fee Accounts.  We waive a portion of the sales fee for purchases made through
registered investment advisers, certified financial planners or registered      
broker-dealers who charge periodic fees in lieu of commissions or who charge for
financial planning or for investment advisory or asset management services or   
provide these services as part of an investment account where a comprehensive   
"wrap fee" is imposed.  You should consult your financial advisor to determine  
whether you can benefit from these accounts.  Fee account purchases may be made 
at the public offering price per unit less the applicable dealer concession.    

 This discount applies during the initial offering period and in the secondary
market.  Certain fee account investors may be assessed transaction or other fees
on the purchase and/or redemption of units by their broker-dealer or other      
processing organizations for providing certain transaction or account           
activities.  We reserve the right to limit or deny purchases of units in fee    
accounts by investors or selling firms whose frequent trading activity is       
determined to be detrimental to the trust.                                      

Employees.  The sales fee applicable to initial offering period purchases   
made by officers, directors and employees of Howe Barnes and its affiliates and 
their family members (spouses, children and parents) is 1.00% of the public     
offering price per unit.                                                        

RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS.  The portfolio may be suitable for purchase in tax-    
advantaged retirement accounts.  You should contact your financial professional 
about the accounts offered and any additional fees imposed.                     

HOW TO SELL YOUR UNITS

You can sell or redeem your units on any business day the New York Stock    
Exchange is open by contacting your financial professional.  Unit prices are    
available daily on the internet at WWW.AAMPORTFOLIOS.COM or through your        
financial professional.  The sale and redemption price of units is equal to the 
net asset value per unit.  The

P-->4879th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�9th
sale and redemption price is sometimes referred to as the "liquidation price."  
Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction or other fee for processing unit
redemption or sale requests.                                                    

SELLING UNITS.  We may maintain a secondary market for units.  This means   
that if you want to sell your units, we may buy them at the current net asset   
value.  We may then resell the units to other investors at the public offering  
price or redeem them for the redemption price.  Our secondary market repurchase 
price is the same as the redemption price.  Certain broker-dealers might also   
maintain a secondary market in units.  You should contact your financial        
professional for current repurchase prices to determine the best price          
available.  We may discontinue our secondary market at any time without notice. 
Even if we do not make a market, you will be able to redeem your units with the 
trustee on any business day for the current redemption price.                   

REDEEMING UNITS.  You may also redeem your units directly with the trustee, 
The Bank of New York, on any day the New York Stock Exchange is open.  The      
redemption price that you will receive for units is equal to the net asset value
per unit.  The trustee must receive your completed redemption request prior to  
the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange for you to receive  
the net asset value for a particular day.  If your request is received after    
that time or is incomplete in any way, you will receive the next net asset value
computed after the trustee receives your completed request.                     

If you redeem your units, the trustee will generally send you a payment for 
your units no later than seven days after it receives all necessary             
documentation (this will usually only take three business days).  The only time 
the trustee can delay your payment is if the New York Stock Exchange is closed  
(other than weekends or holidays), the Securities and Exchange Commission       
determines that trading on that exchange is restricted or an emergency exists   
making sale or evaluation of the securities not reasonably practicable, and for 
any other period that the Securities and Exchange Commission permits.           

To redeem your units, you must send the trustee any certificates for your   
units.  You must properly endorse your certificates or sign a written transfer  
instrument with a signature guarantee.  The trustee may require additional      
documents such as a certificate of corporate authority, trust documents, a death
certificate, or an appointment as executor, administrator or guardian.  The     
trustee cannot complete your redemption or send your payment to you until it    
receives all of these documents in complete form.                               

You can request an in-kind distribution of the securities underlying your   
units if you tender at least 2,500 units for redemption (or such other amount as
required by your financial professional's firm).  This option is generally      
available only for securities traded and held in the United States.  In         
addition, the trustee reserves the right to pay unit redemption proceeds through
an in-kind distribution of securities with respect to redemption requests of    
$100,000 or more.  The trustee will make any in-kind distribution of securities 
by distributing applicable securities in book entry form to the account of your 
financial professional at Depository Trust Company.  You will receive whole     
shares of the applicable securities and cash equal to any fractional shares.    
You may not request this option in the last 30 days of your trust's life.  We   
may discontinue this option upon sixty days notice.                             

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the unitholder requesting an in kind      
distribution is

P-->48710th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�10th
the sponsor or an affiliated person of the trust, the trustee may make an in    
kind distribution to such unitholder provided that no one with a pecuniary      
incentive to influence the in kind distribution may influence selection of the  
distributed securities, the distribution must consist of a pro rata distribution
of all portfolio securities (with limited exceptions) and the in kind           
distribution may not favor such affiliated person to the detriment of any other 
unitholder.                                                                     

 DISTRIBUTIONS

 DISTRIBUTIONS.  Your trust generally pays distributions of its net investment
income along with any excess capital on each distribution date to unitholders of
record on the preceding record date.  The record and distribution dates are     
shown under "Essential Information" in the "Investment Summary" section of this 
prospectus.  In some cases, your trust might pay a special distribution if it   
holds an excessive amount of cash pending distribution.  For example, this could
happen as a result of a merger or similar transaction involving a company whose 
stock is in your portfolio.  The trust will also generally make required        
distributions or distributions to avoid imposition of tax at the end of each    
year because it is structured as a "regulated investment company" for federal   
tax purposes.  The amount of your distributions will vary from time to time as  
companies change their dividends or trust expenses change.                      

ESTIMATED ANNUAL DISTRIBUTIONS.  The estimated net annual distributions are 
shown under "Essential Information" in the "Investment Summary" section of this 
prospectus.  We generally base the estimate of the income the trust may receive 
on annualizing the most recent ordinary dividend declared by an issuer (or      
adding the most recent interim and final dividends declared for certain foreign 
issuers) or on scheduled income payments.  However, dividend conventions for    
certain companies and/or certain countries differ from those typically used in  
the United States and in certain instances, dividends paid or declared over     
several years or other periods were used to estimate annual distributions.  Due 
to this and various other factors, actual dividends received by the trust will  
most likely differ from the most recent annualized dividends or scheduled income
payments.  The actual net annual distributions you will receive will vary with  
changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends received and with the    
sale of securities.                                                             

REPORTS.  The trustee or your financial professional will make available to 
you a statement showing income and other receipts of your trust for each        
distribution.  Each year the trustee will also provide an annual report on your 
trust's activity and certain tax information.  You can request copies of        
security evaluations to enable you to complete your tax forms and audited       
financial statements for your trust, if available.                              

INVESTMENT RISKS

 All investments involve risk.  This section describes the main risks that can
impact the value of the securities in your portfolio.  You should understand    
these risks before you invest.  If the value of the securities falls, the value 
of your units will also fall.  We cannot guarantee that your trust will achieve 
its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period.  

MARKET RISK is the risk that the value of the securities in your trust will 
fluctuate.  This could cause the value of your units to fall below your original
purchase price.  Market value fluctuates in response to various factors.  These 
can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the financial                 

                                             Understanding Your Investment     9

P-->48711th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�11th
condition of a security's issuer, perceptions of the issuer, or ratings on a    
security.  Even though we supervise your portfolio, you should remember that we 
do not manage your portfolio.  Your trust will not sell a security solely       
because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund.                

DIVIDEND PAYMENT RISK is the risk that an issuer of a security is unwilling 
or unable to pay income on a security.  Stocks represent ownership interests in 
the issuers and are not obligations of the issuers.  Common stockholders have a 
right to receive dividends only after the company has provided for payment of   
its creditors, bondholders and preferred stockholders.  Common stocks do not    
assure dividend payments.  Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer's 
board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time.           

CONCENTRATION RISK is the risk that the value of your trust is more         
susceptible to fluctuations based on factors that impact a particular industry  
because the portfolio concentrates in companies within that industry.  A        
portfolio "concentrates" in an industry when stocks in a particular industry    
make up 25% or more of the portfolio.                                           

The trust invests significantly in COMMUNITY BANKS AND THEIR HOLDING        
COMPANIES.  Any negative impact on this industry will have a greater impact on  
the value of units than on a portfolio diversified over several industries.  You
should understand the risks of this industry before you invest.  These issuers  
face risks related to general economic conditions, volatile interest rates,     
economic recession, competition from other financial services companies,        
government regulation and portfolio concentrations in geographic markets and in 
commercial and residential real estate loans.  Changes in interest rates can    
significantly impact the operating results of financial institutions.  Increased
interest rates may increase a bank's interest income but may also increase the  
interest the bank pays on depository accounts and may lead to a decreased demand
for loans.  Lower interest rates may lead to increased prepayments on loans.  If
a loan is paid off early, the lending bank is subject to reinvestment risk to   
the extent that it is unable to reinvest the prepayments at rates which are     
comparable to the rates on the prepaid loans.  Economic conditions in real      
estate markets can also significantly impact banks because they often invest    
substantial assets in loans secured by real estate.                             

Federal and state laws regulate financial institutions extensively.  Any    
increase or change in regulations could adversely affect banks and thrifts.  In 
recent years, however, federal legislation has reduced certain barriers to      
interstate banking and branching by financial institutions.  In addition, the   
Federal Reserve Board has liberalized regulations that limit the ability of non-
bank subsidiaries of banks to engage in securities-related businesses.  This and
any future liberalization of banking regulations could result in increased      
competition which could negatively impact some companies.  Banks also face      
significant competition from other financial companies that offer a broader     
array of products such as securities and brokerage companies, credit unions,    
mortgage banking companies and insurance companies.                             

SMALL AND MID-SIZE COMPANIES.  The trust invests significantly in stocks    
issued by small and mid-size companies.  The share prices of these companies are
often more volatile than those of larger companies as a result of several       
factors common to many such issuers, including limited trading volumes, products
or financial resources, management inexperience and less publicly available     
information.

LIQUIDITY RISK is the risk that the value of a security will fall if trading
in the security is limited or absent.  No one can guarantee that a liquid       
trading market will exist for any security.                                     

LEGISLATION OR LITIGATION RISK is the risk that various legislative         
initiatives will be proposed from time to time in the United States and abroad  
which may have a negative impact on certain of the companies represented in the 
trust.  In addition, litigation regarding any of the issuers of the securities  
or of the industries represented by these issuers may negatively impact the     
share prices of these securities.  No one can predict what impact any pending or
threatened litigation will have on the share prices of the securities.          

NO FDIC GUARANTEE.  An investment in the trust is not a deposit of any bank 
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or
any other government agency.                                                    

 HOW THE TRUST WORKS

YOUR TRUST.  Your trust is a unit investment trust registered under the     
Investment Company Act of 1940.  We created the trust under a trust agreement   
between Fixed Income Securities, L.P. (as depositor/sponsor, evaluator and      
supervisor) and The Bank of New York (as trustee).  We provide services to unit 
trusts through our Advisor's Asset Management division.  To create your trust,  
we deposited securities selected by Howe Barnes with the trustee (or contracts  
to purchase securities along with an irrevocable letter of credit or other      
consideration to pay for the securities).  In exchange, the trustee delivered   
units of your trust to us.  Each unit represents an undivided interest in the   
assets of your trust.  These units remain outstanding until redeemed or until   
your trust terminates.  At the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the      
trust's inception date, the number of units may be adjusted so that the public  
offering price per unit equals $10.  The number of units and fractional interest
of each unit in the trust will increase or decrease to the extent of any        
adjustment.                                                                     

 CHANGING YOUR PORTFOLIO.  Your trust is not a managed fund.  Unlike a managed
fund, your portfolio will remain relatively fixed.  Your trust will generally   
buy and sell securities:                                                        

*  to pay expenses,                                                         

*  to issue additional units or redeem units,                               

*  in limited circumstances to protect the trust,                           

*  to make required distributions or avoid imposition of taxes on the trust,
or                                                                    

*  as permitted by the trust agreement.                                     

When your trust sells securities, the composition and diversity of the      
securities in the portfolio may be altered.  If a public tender offer has been  
made for a security or a merger, acquisition or similar transaction has been    
announced affecting a security, the trustee may either sell the security or     
accept a tender offer if the supervisor determines that the action is in the    
best interest of unitholders.  The trustee will distribute any cash proceeds to 
unitholders.  If your trust receives securities or other property, it will      
either hold the securities or property in the portfolio or sell the securities  
or property and distribute the proceeds.  If any contract for the purchase of   
securities fails, the sponsor will refund the cash and sales fee attributable to
the failed contract to unitholders on or before the next distribution date      
unless substantially all of the moneys held to cover the purchase are reinvested
in substitute securities in accordance with the trust agreement.  The sponsor   
may direct the reinvestment of security sale                                    

                                            Understanding Your Investment     11

P-->48713th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�13th
proceeds if the sale is the direct result of serious adverse credit factors     
which, in the opinion of the sponsor, would make retention of the securities    
detrimental to the trust.  In such a case, the sponsor may, but is not obligated
to, direct the reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet  
the criteria for inclusion in the trust on the trust's inception date.  The     
sponsor may also instruct the trustee to take action necessary to ensure that   
the portfolio continues to satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment 
company.                                                                        

We anticipate that the trust's initial offering will be one day; however, if
we sell additional units we will increase the size of your trust.  If we create 
additional units, we will seek to replicate the existing portfolio.  When your  
trust buys securities, it may pay brokerage or other acquisition fees.  You     
could experience a dilution of your investment because of these fees and        
fluctuations in security prices between the time we create units and the time   
your trust buys the securities.  When your trust buys or sells securities, we   
may direct that it place orders with and pay brokerage commissions to brokers   
that sell units or are affiliated with your trust or the trustee.               

AMENDING THE TRUST AGREEMENT.  The sponsor and the trustee can change the   
trust agreement without your consent to correct any provision that may be       
defective or to make other provisions that will not materially adversely affect 
your interest (as determined by the sponsor and the trustee).  We cannot change 
this agreement to reduce your interest in your trust without your consent.      
Investors owning two-thirds of the units in your trust may vote to change this  
agreement.                                                                      

 TERMINATION OF YOUR TRUST.  Your trust will terminate on the termination date
set forth under "Essential Information" in the "Investment Summary" section of  
this prospectus.  The trustee may terminate your trust early if the value of the
trust is less than 40% of the original value of the securities in the trust at  
the time of deposit.  At this size, the expenses of your trust may create an    
undue burden on your investment.  Investors owning two-thirds of the units in   
your trust may also vote to terminate the trust early.  The trustee will        
liquidate the trust in the event that a sufficient number of units not yet sold 
to the public are tendered for redemption so that the net worth of the trust    
would be reduced to less than 40% of the value of the securities at the time    
they were deposited in the trust.  If this happens, we will refund any sales    
charge that you paid.                                                           

The trustee will notify you of any termination and sell any remaining       
securities.  The trustee will send your final distribution to you within a      
reasonable time following liquidation of all the securities after deducting     
final expenses.  Your termination distribution may be less than the price you   
originally paid for your units.                                                 

THE SPONSOR.  The sponsor of the trust is Fixed Income Securities, L.P.     
acting through its Advisor's Asset Management division.  We are a broker-dealer 
specializing in providing trading and support services to broker-dealers,       
registered representatives, investment advisers and other financial

or become bankrupt, the trustee may replace us, continue to operate your trust  
without a sponsor, or terminate your trust.                                     

We and your trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring our employees who 
have access to information on trust transactions to report personal securities  
transactions.  The purpose of the code is to avoid potential conflicts of       
interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct with respect to your     
trust.                                                                          

THE TRUSTEE.  The Bank of New York is the trustee of your trust with its    
principal unit investment trust division offices located at 2 Hanson Place, 12th
Floor, Brooklyn, New York 11217.  You can contact the trustee by calling the    
telephone number on the back cover of this prospectus or by writing to its unit 
investment trust office.  We may remove and replace the trustee in some cases   
without your consent.  The trustee may also resign by notifying us and          
investors.                                                                      

HOW WE DISTRIBUTE UNITS.  We sell units to the public through broker-dealers
and other firms.  We pay part of the sales fee to these distribution firms when 
they sell units.  Units are available through Howe Barnes or your financial     
professional who delivered this prospectus.  During the initial offering period,
the distribution fee (the broker-dealer concession or agency commission) allowed
to Howe Barnes is 3.20% of the public offering price per unit at the time of the
transaction.  During the initial offering period, the broker-dealer concession  
or agency commission allowed by Howe Barnes to other broker-dealers and selling 
firms is 2.50% of the public offering price per unit at the time of the         
transaction (except in purchases of $500,000 or more where a reduced commission 
may apply).  For secondary market transactions, the distribution fee will be    
3.20% and will reduce by 1/2 of 1% on each October 25, commencing October 25,
2008 to a minimum distribution fee of 2.20%.  No distribution fee is paid to    
broker-dealers or other selling firms in connection with unit sales in          
investment accounts that charge a "wrap fee" or periodic fees for investment    
advisory, financial planning or asset management services in lieu of            
commissions.                                                                    

Any sales fee discount is borne by the broker-dealer or selling firm out of 
the distribution fee.  We reserve the right to change the amount of concessions 
or agency commissions from time to time.                                        

We may provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits, additional   
compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell units of this trust and our
other products.  This compensation is intended to result in additional sales of 
our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial advisors for past   
sales.  We may make these payments for marketing, promotional or related        
expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining retail        
customers and financial advisors, advertising, sponsorship of events or         
seminars, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities   
designed to promote the sale of the our products.  These arrangements will not  
change the price you pay for your units.                                        

 We generally register units for sale in various states in the U.S.  We do not
register units for sale in any foreign country.  This prospectus does not       
constitute an offer of units in any state or country where units cannot be      
offered or sold lawfully.  We may reject any order for units in whole or in     
part.                                                                           

We may gain or lose money when we hold units in the primary or secondary    
market due to fluctuations in unit prices.  The gain or loss is equal to the    
difference between the price we pay for units and the price at which we sell or 
redeem

them.  We may also gain or lose money when we deposit securities to create      
units.  The amount of our profit or loss on the initial deposit of securities   
into the trust is shown in the "Notes to Portfolio."
 TAXES

 This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax consequences
of owning units of the trust.  This section is current as of the date of this   
prospectus.  Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these summaries
do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers.  For example,     
these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a           
corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker-dealer, or other investor with special 
circumstances.  In addition, this section does not describe your state, local or
foreign tax consequences.                                                       

This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to
the sponsor.  The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any conclusions  
set forth in this section.  In addition, our counsel was not asked to review,   
and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax         
treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust.  This may not be          
sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal   
tax law.                                                                        

As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual     
circumstances from your own tax advisor.                                        

TRUST STATUS.  The trust intends to qualify as a "regulated investment      
company" under the federal tax laws.  If the trust qualifies as a regulated     
investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax law, the   
trust generally will not pay federal income taxes.                              

DISTRIBUTIONS.  Trust distributions are generally taxable.  After the end of
each year, you will receive a tax statement that separates your trust's         
distributions into two categories, ordinary income distributions and capital    
gains dividends.  Ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your     
ordinary tax rate, however, as further discussed below, certain ordinary income 
distributions received from the trust may be taxed at the capital gains tax     
rates.  Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term      
capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your units.  To determine   
your actual tax liability for your capital gains dividends, you must calculate  
your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after considering all of   
your other taxable transactions, as described below.  In addition, the trust may
make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and thus 
will generally not be taxable to you.  The tax status of your distributions from
your trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in        
additional units or receive them in cash.  The income from your trust that you  
must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts
used to pay a deferred sales fee, if any.  The tax laws may require you to treat
distributions made to you in January as if you had received them on December 31 
of the previous year.                                                           

DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION.  A corporation that owns units generally will 
not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many        
dividends received from the trust because the dividends received deduction is   
generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies.  
However, certain ordinary income dividends on units that are attributable to    
qualifying dividends received by the trust from certain corporations may be     
designated by the trust as being eligible for the dividends received deduction.

P-->48716th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�16th
SALE OR REDEMPTION OF UNITS.  If you sell or redeem your units, you will    
generally recognize a taxable gain or loss.  To determine the amount of this    
gain or loss, you must subtract your tax basis in your units from the amount you
receive in the transaction.  Your tax basis in your units is generally equal to 
the cost of your units, generally including sales charges.  In some cases,      
however, you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units.   

CAPITAL GAINS AND LOSSES AND CERTAIN ORDINARY INCOME DIVIDENDS.  If you are 
an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is    
generally 15% (generally 5% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax        
brackets).  These new capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable   
years beginning before January 1, 2011.  For later periods, if you are an       
individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is       
generally 20% (10% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax brackets).  The 
20% rate is reduced to 18% and the 10% rate is reduced to 8% for long-term      
capital gains from most property acquired after December 31, 2000 with a holding
period of more than five years.                                                 

Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term     
capital loss for the taxable year.  Capital gain or loss is long-term if the    
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the     
holding period for the asset is one year or less.  You must exclude the date you
purchase your units to determine your holding period.  However, if you receive a
capital gain dividend from your trust and sell your unit at a loss after holding
it for six months or less, the loss will be recharacterized as long-term capital
loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received.  The tax rates for    
capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the  
same as for ordinary income.  The Internal Revenue Code treats certain capital  
gains as ordinary income in special situations.                                 

Ordinary income dividends received by an individual unitholder from a       
regulated investment company such as the trust are generally taxed at the same  
rates that apply to net capital gain (as discussed above), provided certain     
holding period requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are        
attributable to qualifying dividends received by the trust itself.  These       
special rules relating to the taxation of ordinary income dividends from        
regulated investment companies generally apply to taxable years beginning before
January 1, 2011.  The trust will provide notice to its unitholders of the amount
of any distribution which may be taken into account as a dividend which is      
eligible for the new capital gains tax rates.                                   

IN-KIND DISTRIBUTIONS.  Under certain circumstances, as described in this   
prospectus, you may receive an in-kind distribution of trust securities when you
redeem units or when your trust terminates.  This distribution is subject to    
taxation and you will recognize gain or loss, generally based on the value at   
that time of the securities and the amount of cash received.                    

EXCHANGES.  If you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over  
into a future trust, it is considered a sale for federal income tax purposes and
any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain, and any loss will be    
treated as a capital loss.  However, any loss realized on a sale or exchange    
will be disallowed to the extent that units disposed of are replaced (including 
through reinvestment of dividends) within a period of 61 days beginning 30 days 
before and ending 30 days after disposition of units or to the extent that the  
unitholder, during such period, acquires or enters into an option or contract to
acquire, substantially identical stock or securities.  In such a                

                                            Understanding Your Investment     15

P-->48717th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�17th
case, the basis of the units acquired will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed
loss.                                                                           

DEDUCTIBILITY OF TRUST EXPENSES.  Generally, expenses incurred by your trust
will be deducted from the gross income received by your trust and only your     
share of the trust's net income will be paid to you and reported as taxable     
income to you.  However, if the units of your trust are held by fewer than 500  
unitholders at any time during a taxable year, your trust will generally not be 
able to deduct certain expenses from income, thus resulting in your reported    
share of the trust's taxable income being increased by your share of those      
expenses, even though you do not receive a corresponding cash distribution.  In 
this case you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses; however,      
certain miscellaneous itemized deductions, such as investment expenses, may be  
deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed  
2% of the individual's adjusted gross income.                                   

 FOREIGN TAX CREDIT.  If your trust invests in any foreign securities, the tax
statement that you receive may include an item showing foreign taxes your trust 
paid to other countries.  In this case, dividends taxed to you will include your
share of the taxes your trust paid to other countries.  You may be able to      
deduct or receive a tax credit for your share of these taxes.                   

FOREIGN INVESTORS.  If you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other  
than a U.S. citizen or resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or   
trust), you should be aware that, generally, subject to applicable tax treaties,
distributions from the trust will be characterized as dividends for federal     
income tax purposes (other than dividends which the trust designates as capital 
gain dividends) and will be subject to U.S. income taxes, including withholding 
taxes, subject to certain exceptions described below.  However, distributions   
received by a foreign investor from the trust that are properly designated by   
the trust as capital gain dividends may not be subject to U.S. federal income   
taxes, including withholding taxes, provided that the trust makes certain       
elections and certain other conditions are met.  In the case of dividends with  
respect to taxable years of the trust beginning prior to 2008, distributions    
from the trust that are properly designated by the trust as an interest-related 
dividend attributable to certain interest income received by the trust or as a  
short-term capital gain dividend attributable to certain net short-term capital 
gain income received by the trust may not be subject to U.S. federal income     
taxes, including withholding taxes when received by certain foreign investors,  
provided that the trust makes certain elections and certain other conditions are
met.                                                                            

EXPENSES

Your trust will pay various expenses to conduct its operations.  The "Fees
and Expenses" section of the "Investment Summary" in this prospectus shows the  
estimated amount of these expenses.                                             

Your trust will pay a fee to the trustee for its services.  The trustee also
benefits when it holds cash for your trust in non-interest bearing accounts.    
Your trust will reimburse us as supervisor, evaluator and sponsor for providing 
portfolio supervisory services, for evaluating your portfolio and for providing 
bookkeeping and administrative services.  Our reimbursements may exceed the     
costs of the services we provide to your trust but will not exceed the costs of 
services provided to all of our unit investment trusts in any calendar year.    
All of these fees may adjust for inflation without your approval.

various governmental charges, fees for extraordinary trustee services, costs of 
taking action to protect your trust, costs of indemnifying the trustee and the  
sponsor, legal fees and expenses, expenses incurred in contacting you and costs 
incurred to reimburse the trustee for advancing funds to meet distributions.    
Your trust may pay the costs of updating its registration statement each year.  
The trustee will generally pay trust expenses from distributions received on the
securities but in some cases may sell securities to pay trust expenses.

UNITHOLDERS                                                                     
ADVISOR'S DISCIPLINED TRUST 175                                                 

We have audited the accompanying statement of financial condition, including the
trust portfolio on page 4, of Advisor's Disciplined Trust 175, as of October 25,
2007, the initial date of deposit.  The statement of financial condition is the 
responsibility of the trust's sponsor.  Our responsibility is to express an     
opinion on this statement of financial condition based on our audit.            

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards of the Public      
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require    
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the statement of financial condition is free of material misstatement.  The     
trust is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its   
internal control over financial reporting.  Our audit included consideration of 
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit        
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the trust's internal control over 
financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also   
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and        
disclosures in the statement of financial condition, assessing the accounting   
principles used and significant estimates made by the sponsor, as well as       
evaluating the overall statement of financial condition presentation.  Our      
procedures included confirmation with The Bank of New York, trustee, of cash or 
an irrevocable letter of credit deposited for the purchase of securities as     
shown in the statement of financial condition as of October 25, 2007.  We       
believe that our audit of the statement of financial condition provides a       
reasonable basis for our opinion.                                               

In our opinion, the statement of financial condition referred to above presents 
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Advisor's           
Disciplined Trust 175 as of October 25, 2007, in conformity with accounting     
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

GENERAL INFORMATION                                                             

  Each trust is one of a series of separate unit investment trusts created
under the name Advisor's Disciplined Trust and registered under the Investment  
Company Act of 1940.  Each trust was created as a common law trust on the       
inception date described in the prospectus under the laws of the state of       
New York.  Each trust was created under a trust agreement among Fixed Income    
Securities, L.P. (as sponsor, evaluator and supervisor) and The Bank of New York
(as trustee).  The sponsor provides services to unit investment trusts through  
its Advisor's Asset Management division.                                        

When your trust was created, the sponsor delivered to the trustee     
securities or contracts for the purchase thereof for deposit in the trust and   
the trustee delivered to the sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of  
units of the trust.  At the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the trust's 
inception date, the number of units may be adjusted so that the public offering 
price per unit equals $10.  The number of units, fractional interest of each    
unit in the trust and estimated income distributions per unit will increase or  
decrease to the extent of any adjustment.  Additional units of each trust may be
issued from time to time by depositing in the trust additional securities (or   
contracts for the purchase thereof together with cash or irrevocable letters of 
credit) or cash (including a letter of credit or the equivalent) with           
instructions to purchase additional securities.  As additional units are issued 
by a trust as a result of the deposit of additional securities by the sponsor,  
the aggregate value of the securities in the trust will be increased and the    
fractional undivided interest in the trust represented by each unit will be     
decreased.  The sponsor may continue to make additional deposits of securities  
into a trust, provided that such additional deposits will be in amounts, which  
will generally maintain the existing relationship among the shares of the       
securities in such trust.  Thus, although additional units will be issued, each 
unit will generally continue to represent the same number of shares of each     
security.  If the sponsor deposits cash to purchase additional securities,      
existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a 
reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of  
the securities between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the          
securities and because the trust will pay any associated brokerage fees.        

The trustee has not participated in the selection of the securities   
deposited in the trust and has no responsibility for the composition of the     
trust portfolio.                                                                

     Each unit initially offered represents an undivided interest in the related
trust.  To the extent that any units are redeemed by the trustee or additional  
units are issued as a result of additional securities being deposited by the    
sponsor, the fractional undivided interest in a trust represented by each       
unredeemed unit will increase or decrease accordingly, although the actual      
interest in such trust represented by such fraction will remain unchanged.      
Units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender to the trustee by      
unitholders, which may include the sponsor, or until the termination of the     
trust agreement.                                                                

A trust consists of (a) the securities listed under "Portfolio" in the
prospectus as may continue to be held from time to time in the trust, (b) any   
additional securities acquired and held by the trust pursuant to the provisions 
of the trust agreement and (c) any cash held in the accounts of the trust.      
Neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any failure  
in any of

the securities.  However, should any contract for the purchase of any of the    
securities initially deposited in a trust fail, the sponsor will, unless        
substantially all of the moneys held in the trust to cover such purchase are    
reinvested in substitute securities in accordance with the trust agreement,     
refund the cash and sales fee attributable to such failed contract to all       
unitholders on the next distribution date.                                      

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES                                               

     The trust seeks to provide capital appreciation by investing in a portfolio
of common stocks of bank holding companies whose subsidiary banks are members of
the Independent Community Bankers of America.  Howe Barnes Hoefer & Arnett,     
Inc., selected the stocks for the portfolio.  There is, of course, no guarantee 
that the trust will achieve its objective.  The prospectus provides additional  
information regarding the trust's objective and investment strategy.            

     The trust is a unit investment trust and is not an "actively managed" fund.
Traditional methods of investment management for a managed fund typically       
involve frequent changes in a portfolio of securities on the basis of economic, 
financial and market analysis.  The portfolio of a trust, however, will not be  
actively managed and therefore the adverse financial condition of an issuer will
not necessarily require the sale of its securities from a portfolio.            

     The sponsor may not alter the portfolio of a trust by the purchase, sale or
substitution of securities, except in special circumstances as provided in the  
trust agreement.  Thus, the assets of a trust will generally remain unchanged   
under normal circumstances.  The trust agreement provides that the sponsor may  
(but need not) direct the trustee to dispose of a security in certain events    
such as the issuer having defaulted on the payment on any of its outstanding    
obligations or the price of a security has declined to such an extent or other  
such credit factors exist so that in the opinion of the supervisor the retention
of such securities would be detrimental to the trust.                           

If a public tender offer has been made for a security or a merger,    
acquisition or similar transaction has been announced affecting a security, the 
trustee may either sell the security or accept a tender offer if the supervisor 
determines that the action is in the best interest of unitholders.  The trustee 
will distribute any excess cash proceeds to unitholders.  If your trust receives
securities or other property, it will either hold the securities or property in 
the portfolio or sell the securities or property and distribute the proceeds.   
The sponsor may direct the reinvestment of security sale proceeds if the sale is
the direct result of serious adverse credit factors which, in the opinion of the
sponsor, would make retention of the securities detrimental to the trust.  In   
such a case, the sponsor may, but is not obligated to, direct the reinvestment  
of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria for inclusion in
the trust on the trust's inception date. The sponsor may also instruct the      
trustee to take action necessary to ensure that the portfolio continues to      
satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company for federal tax    
purposes if the trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company.

     The trustee may sell securities, designated by the supervisor, from a trust
for the purpose of redeeming units of such trust tendered for redemption and the
payment of expenses.                                                            

 -3-

P-->48724th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�24th
   In addition, if a trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment
company, the trustee may dispose of certain securities and take such further    
action as may be needed from time to time to ensure that a trust continues to   
satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company, including the     
requirements with respect to diversification under Section 851 of the Internal  
Revenue Code, and as may be needed from time to time to avoid the imposition of 
any tax on a trust or undistributed income of a trust as a regulated investment 
company.                                                                        

   Proceeds from the sale of securities (or any securities or other property
received by a trust in exchange for securities) are credited to the Capital     
Account of a trust for distribution to unitholders or to meet redemptions.      
Except for failed securities and as provided herein, in the prospectus or in the
trust agreement, the acquisition by a trust of any securities other than the    
portfolio securities is prohibited.                                             

     Because certain of the securities in certain of the trusts may from time to
time under certain circumstances be sold or otherwise liquidated and because the
proceeds from such events will be distributed to unitholders and will not be    
reinvested, no assurance can be given that a trust will retain for any length of
time its present size and composition.  Neither the sponsor nor the trustee     
shall be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in any security.  
In the event of a failure to deliver any security that has been purchased for a 
trust under a contract ("Failed Securities"), the sponsor is authorized under   
the trust agreement to direct the trustee to acquire other securities           
("Replacement Securities") to make up the original corpus of such trust.        

    The Replacement Securities must be purchased within 20 days after delivery
of the notice that a contract to deliver a security will not be honored and the 
purchase price may not exceed the amount of funds reserved for the purchase of  
the Failed Securities.  The Replacement Securities must be equity securities of 
the type selected for the trust and must not adversely affect the federal income
tax status of the trust.  Whenever a Replacement Security is acquired for a     
trust, the trustee shall notify all unitholders of the trust of the acquisition 
of the Replacement Security and shall, on the next monthly distribution date    
which is more than 30 days thereafter, make a pro rata distribution of the      
amount, if any, by which the cost to the trust of the Failed Security exceeded  
the cost of the Replacement Security.  Once all of the securities in a trust are
acquired, the trustee will have no power to vary the investments of the trust,  
i.e., the trustee will have no managerial power to take advantage of market     
variations to improve a unitholder's investment.                                

    If the right of limited substitution described in the preceding paragraphs
is not utilized to acquire Replacement Securities in the event of a failed      
contract, the sponsor will refund the sales fee attributable to such Failed     
Securities to all unitholders of the trust and the trustee will distribute the  
cash attributable to such Failed Securities not more than 30 days after the date
on which the trustee would have been required to purchase a Replacement         
Security.  In addition, unitholders should be aware that, at the time of receipt
of such cash, they may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in other securities
at a return equal to or in excess of the return which such proceeds would have  
earned for unitholders of such trust.                                           

  In the event that a Replacement Security is not acquired by a trust, the
income for such trust may be reduced.

P-->48725th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�25th
   To the best of the sponsor's knowledge, there is no litigation pending as
of the trust's inception in respect of any security that might reasonably be    
expected to have a material adverse effect on the trust.  At any time after the 
trust's inception, litigation may be instituted on a variety of grounds with    
respect to the securities.  The sponsor is unable to predict whether any such   
litigation may be instituted, or if instituted, whether such litigation might   
have a material adverse effect on the trust.  The sponsor and the trustee shall 
not be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in any security.    

RISK FACTORS                                                                    

     MARKET RISK. Because the trust invests in stocks, you should understand the
risks of investing in stocks before purchasing units. These risks include the   
risk that the financial condition of the company or the general condition of the
stock market may worsen and the value of the stocks (and therefore units) will  
fall. Stocks are especially susceptible to general stock market movements. The  
value of stocks often rises or falls rapidly and unpredictably as market        
confidence and perceptions of companies change. These perceptions are based on  
factors including expectations regarding government economic policies,          
inflation, interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, political climates
and economic or banking crises. The value of units will fluctuate with the value
of the stocks in the trust and may be more or less than the price you originally
paid for your units. As with any investment, we cannot guarantee that the       
performance of the trust will be positive over any period of time. Because the  
trust is unmanaged, the Trustee will not sell stocks in response to market      
fluctuations as is common in managed investments. In addition, because some     
trusts hold a relatively small number of stocks, you may encounter greater      
market risk than in a more diversified investment.                              

  DIVIDENDS. Stocks represent ownership interests in a company and are not
obligations of the company. Common stockholders have a right to receive payments
from the company that is subordinate to the rights of creditors, bondholders or 
preferred stockholders of the company. This means that common stockholders have 
a right to receive dividends only if a company's board of directors declares a  
dividend and the company has provided for payment of all of its creditors,      
bondholders and preferred stockholders. If a company issues additional debt     
securities or preferred stock, the owners of these securities will have a claim 
against the company's assets before common stockholders if the company declares 
bankruptcy or liquidates its assets even though the common stock was issued     
first. As a result, the company may be less willing or able to declare or pay   
dividends on its common stock.                                                  

  BANKING INDUSTRY. Your trust is concentrated in securities of issuers in
the banking industry.  Banks and their holding companies are especially subject 
to the adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, portfolio
concentrations in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real     
estate loans, and competition from new entrants in their fields of business.    
Banks are highly dependent on net interest margin. Bank profits have come under 
pressure as net interest margins have contracted. There is no certainty that    
such conditions will continue. Banks receive significant consumer mortgage fee  
income as a result of activity in mortgage and refinance markets. If initial    
home purchasing and refinancing activity were to subside as a result of         
increasing interest rates and other factors, this income would diminish.        
Economic conditions in the real estate markets, which have been weak in the     
past, can have a

substantial effect upon banks because they generally have a portion of their    
assets invested in loans secured by real estate.                                

Banks and their holding companies are subject to extensive federal    
regulation and, when such institutions are state-chartered, to state regulation 
as well. Such regulations impose strict capital requirements and limitations on 
the nature and extent of business activities that banks may pursue. Furthermore,
bank regulators have a wide range of discretion in connection with their        
supervisory and enforcement authority and may substantially restrict the        
permissible activities of a particular institution if deemed to pose significant
risks to the soundness of such institution or the safety of the federal deposit 
insurance fund. Regulatory actions, such as increases in the minimum capital    
requirements applicable to banks and increases in deposit insurance premiums    
required to be paid by banks and thrifts to the Federal Deposit Insurance       
Corporation ("FDIC"), can negatively impact earnings and the ability of a       
company to pay dividends. Neither federal insurance of deposits nor governmental
regulations, however, insures the solvency or profitability of banks or their   
holding companies, or insures against any risk of investment in the securities  
issued by such institutions.                                                    

  The statutory requirements applicable to, and regulatory supervision of,
banks and their holding companies have increased significantly and have         
undergone substantial change in the past. To a great extent, these changes are  
embodied in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act,    
enacted in August 1989; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement   
Act of 1991, and the regulations promulgated under these laws. The impact of    
these laws on the business, financial condition and prospects of the Securities 
in the Trust's portfolio cannot be predicted with certainty. The Gramm-Leach-   
Bliley financial services overhaul legislation allows banks, securities firms   
and insurance companies to form one-stop financial conglomerates marketing a    
wide range of financial service products to investors. This legislation will    
likely result in increased merger activity and heightened competition among     
existing and new participants in the field. Legislation to liberalize interstate
banking has also been enacted. Under the legislation, banks are able to purchase
or establish subsidiary banks in any state. Since mid-1997, banks have been     
allowed to turn existing banks into branches. Consolidation may continue. The   
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board 
require the expanded use of market value accounting by banks and have imposed   
rules requiring market accounting for investment securities held in trading     
accounts or available for sale. Adoption of additional such rules may result in 
increased volatility in the reported health of the industry, and mandated       
regulatory intervention to correct such problems. Additional legislative and    
regulatory changes may be forthcoming. For example, the bank regulatory         
authorities have proposed substantial changes to the Community Reinvestment Act 
and fair lending laws, rules and regulations, and there can be no certainty as  
to the effect, if any, that such changes would have on the securities in the    
trust's portfolio. In addition, from time to time the deposit insurance system  
is reviewed by Congress and federal regulators, and proposed reforms of that    
system could, among other things, further restrict the ways in which deposited  
moneys can be used by banks or reduce the dollar amount or number of deposits   
insured for any depositor. Such reforms could reduce profitability, as          
investment opportunities available to bank institutions become more limited and 
as consumers look for savings vehicles other than bank deposits. Banks face     
significant competition from other financial institutions such as mutual funds, 
credit unions, mortgage banking companies and insurance companies, and          

 -6-

P-->48727th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�27th
increased competition may result from legislative broadening of regional and    
national interstate banking powers. Among other benefits, such legislation      
allows banks and bank holding companies to acquire across previously prohibited 
state lines and to consolidate their various bank subsidiaries into one unit.   
The sponsor makes no prediction as to what, if any, manner of bank regulatory   
actions might ultimately be adopted or what ultimate effect such actions might  
have on the trust's portfolio.                                                  

 The Federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 generally prohibits a bank
holding company from (1) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the 
outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding  
company, (2) acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company, (3)   
acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank, or (4) merging or      
consolidating with another bank holding company, without first obtaining Federal
Reserve Board ("FRB") approval. In considering an application with respect to   
any such transaction, the FRB is required to consider a variety of factors,     
including the potential anti-competitive effects of the transaction, the        
financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting         
institutions, the managerial resources of the resulting institution, the        
convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve, 
the record of performance of each combining organization under the Community    
Reinvestment Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the prospective      
availability to the FRB of information appropriate to determine ongoing         
regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws. In addition, the federal    
Change In Bank Control Act and various state laws impose limitations on the     
ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of banks
or bank holding companies.                                                      

   The FRB has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by
bank holding companies. In the policy statement, the FRB expressed its view that
a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash     
dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in ways that
would weaken its financial health, such as by borrowing. The FRB also may impose
limitations on the payment of dividends as a condition to its approval of       
certain applications, including applications for approval of mergers and        
acquisitions. The sponsor makes no prediction as to the effect, if any, such    
laws will have on the securities or whether such approvals, if necessary, will  
be obtained.                                                                    

 SMALL-CAP AND MID-CAP COMPANIES. Small and mid-size company stocks have
customarily involved more investment risk than large company stocks. Small and  
mid-size companies may have limited product lines, markets or financial         
resources; may lack management depth or experience; and may be more vulnerable  
to adverse general market or economic developments than large companies. Some of
these companies may distribute, sell or produce products which have recently    
been brought to market and may be dependent on key personnel.                   

     The prices of small and mid-size company securities are often more volatile
than prices associated with large company issues, and can display abrupt or     
erratic movements at times, due to limited trading volumes and less publicly    
available information. Also, because small and mid-size companies normally have 
fewer shares outstanding and these shares trade less frequently than large      
companies, it may be more difficult for a trust which contains these securities 
to buy                                                                          

 -7-

P-->48728th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�28th
and sell significant amounts of such shares without an unfavorable impact on    
prevailing market prices.                                                       

ADDITIONAL DEPOSITS.  The trust agreement authorizes the sponsor to   
increase the size of a trust and the number of units thereof by the deposit of  
additional securities, or cash (including a letter of credit or the equivalent) 
with instructions to purchase additional securities, in such trust and the      
issuance of a corresponding number of additional units.  In connection with     
these deposits, existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their   
investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations 
in the prices of the securities between the time of the deposit and the purchase
of the securities and because a trust will pay the associated brokerage fees and
other acquisition costs.                                                        

ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUST                                                     

  DISTRIBUTIONS TO UNITHOLDERS.  Income received by a trust is credited by
the trustee to the Income Account for the trust.  All other receipts are        
credited by the trustee to a separate Capital Account for the trust.  The       
trustee will normally distribute any income received by a trust on each         
distribution date or shortly thereafter to unitholders of record on the         
preceding record date. The trust will also generally make required distributions
or distributions to avoid imposition of tax at the end of each year if it has   
elected to be taxed as a "regulated investment company" for federal tax         
purposes.  Unitholders will receive an amount substantially equal to their pro  
rata share of the available balance of the Income Account of the trust.  All    
distributions will be net of applicable expenses.  There is no assurance that   
any actual distributions will be made since all dividends received may be used  
to pay expenses.  In addition, excess amounts from the Capital Account of a     
trust, if any, will be distributed at least annually to the unitholders then of 
record.  Proceeds received from the disposition of any of the securities after a
record date and prior to the following distribution date will be held in the    
Capital Account and not distributed until the next distribution date applicable 
to the Capital Account.  The trustee shall be required to make a distribution   
from the Capital Account if the cash balance on deposit therein available for   
distribution shall be sufficient to distribute at least $0.01 per unit.  The    
trustee is not required to pay interest on funds held in the Capital or Income  
Accounts (but may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits from the  
use of such funds).                                                             

    The distribution to the unitholders as of each record date will be made on
the following distribution date or shortly thereafter and shall consist of an   
amount substantially equal to the unitholders' pro rata share of the available  
balance of the Income Account of the trust after deducting estimated expenses.  
Because dividends are not received by a trust at a constant rate throughout the 
year, such distributions to unitholders are expected to fluctuate.  Persons who 
purchase units will commence receiving distributions only after such person     
becomes a record owner.  A person will become the owner of units, and thereby a 
unitholder of record, on the date of settlement provided payment has been       
received.  Notification to the trustee of the transfer of units is the          
responsibility of the purchaser, but in the normal course of business the       
selling broker-dealer provides such notice.                                     

 The trustee will periodically deduct from the Income Account of a trust
and, to the extent funds are not sufficient therein, from the Capital Account of
a trust amounts necessary to pay the                                            

 -8-

P-->48729th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�29th
expenses of the trust.  The trustee also may withdraw from said accounts such   
amounts, if any, as it deems necessary to establish a reserve for any           
governmental charges payable out of a trust.  Amounts so withdrawn shall not be 
considered a part of a trust's assets until such time as the trustee shall      
return all or any part of such amounts to the appropriate accounts.  In         
addition, the trustee may withdraw from the Income and Capital Accounts of a    
trust such amounts as may be necessary to cover redemptions of units.           

 DISTRIBUTION REINVESTMENT.  Unitholders may reinvest distributions into
additional units of their trust without a sales fee.                            

STATEMENTS TO UNITHOLDERS.  With each distribution, the trustee will  
furnish to each unitholder a statement of the amount of income and the amount of
other receipts, if any, which are being distributed, expressed in each case as a
dollar amount per unit.                                                         

     The accounts of a trust are required to be audited annually, at the related
trust's expense, by independent public accountants designated by the sponsor,   
unless the sponsor determines that such an audit would not be in the best       
interest of the unitholders of the trust.  The accountants' report will be      
furnished by the trustee to any unitholder upon written request.  Within a      
reasonable period of time after the end of each calendar year, the trustee shall
furnish to each person who at any time during the calendar year was a unitholder
of a trust a statement, covering the calendar year, setting forth for the trust:

(A)  As to the Income Account:                                        

          (1)  the amount of income received on the securities (including income
         received as a portion of the proceeds of any disposition of
securities);                                      

        (2)  the amounts paid for purchases of replacement securities or for
     purchases of securities otherwise pursuant to the trust
agreement, if any, and for redemptions;           

         (3)  the deductions, if any, from the Income Account for payment into
the Reserve Account;                              

         (4)  the deductions for applicable taxes and fees and expenses of the
             trustee, the depositor, the evaluator, the supervisor, counsel,

  RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS.  A unitholder may at any time tender units to the
trustee for redemption.  The death or incapacity of any unitholder will not     
operate to terminate a trust nor entitle legal representatives or heirs to claim
an accounting or to bring any action or proceeding in any court for partition or
winding up of a trust.  No unitholder shall have the right to control the       
operation and management of a trust in any manner, except to vote with respect  
to the amendment of the trust agreement or termination of a trust.              

     AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION.  The trust agreement may be amended from time to
time by the sponsor and trustee or their respective successors, without the     
consent of any of the unitholders, (i) to cure any ambiguity or to correct or   
supplement any provision which may be defective or inconsistent with any other  
provision contained in the trust agreement, (ii) to make such other provision in
regard to matters or questions arising under the trust agreement as shall not   
materially adversely affect the interests of the unitholders or (iii) to make   
such amendments as may be necessary (a) for the trust to continue to qualify as 
a regulated investment company for federal income tax purposes if the trust has 
elected to be taxed as such under the United States Internal Revenue Code of    
1986, as amended, or (b) to prevent the trust from being deemed an association  
taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes if the trust has not   
elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company under the United States   
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  The trust agreement may not be      
amended, however, without the consent of all unitholders then outstanding, so as
(1) to permit, except in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof, the  
acquisition hereunder of any securities other than those specified in the       
schedules to the trust agreement or (2) to reduce the percentage of units the   
holders of which are required to consent to certain of such amendments.  The    
trust agreement may not be amended so as to reduce the interest in a trust      
represented by units without the consent of all affected unitholders.  Except   
for the amendments, changes or modifications described above, neither the       
sponsor nor the trustee may consent to any other amendment, change or           
modification of the trust agreement without the giving of notice and the        
obtaining of the approval or consent of unitholders representing at least 66    
2/3% of the units then outstanding of the affected trust.  No amendment may     
reduce the aggregate percentage of units the holders of which are required to   
consent to any amendment, change or modification of the trust agreement without 
the consent of the unitholders of all of the units then outstanding of the      
affected trust and in no event may any amendment be made which would (1) alter  
the rights to the unitholders as against each other, (2) provide the trustee    
with the power to engage in business or investment activities other than as     
specifically provided in the trust agreement, (3) adversely affect the tax      
status of the trust for federal income tax purposes or result in the units being
deemed to be sold or exchanged for federal income tax purposes or (4) unless the
trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company for federal     
income tax purposes, result in a variation of the investment of unitholders in  
the trust.  The trustee will notify unitholders of the substance of any such    
amendment.

P-->48732nd�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�32nd
The trust agreement provides that a trust shall terminate upon the    
liquidation, redemption or other disposition of the last of the securities held 
in the trust but in no event is it to continue beyond the mandatory termination 
date.  If the value of a trust shall be less than the applicable minimum value  
stated in the prospectus (generally 40% of the total value of securities        
deposited in the trust during the initial offering period), the trustee may, in 
its discretion, and shall, when so directed by the sponsor, terminate the trust.
A trust may be terminated at any time by the holders of units representing 66   
2/3% of the units thereof then outstanding.  In addition, the sponsor may       
terminate a trust if it is based on a security index and the index is no longer 
maintained.  A trust will be liquidated by the trustee in the event that a      
sufficient number of units of the trust not yet sold are tendered for redemption
by the sponsor, so that the net worth of the trust would be reduced to less than
40% of the value of the securities at the time they were deposited in the trust.
If a trust is liquidated because of the redemption of unsold units by the       
sponsor, the sponsor will refund to each purchaser of units the entire sales fee
paid by such purchaser.                                                         

 Beginning nine business days prior to, but no later than, the scheduled
termination date described in the prospectus, the trustee may begin to sell all 
of the remaining underlying securities on behalf of unitholders in connection   
with the termination of the trust.  The sponsor may assist the trustee in these 
sales and receive compensation to the extent permitted by applicable law.  The  
sale proceeds will be net of any incidental expenses involved in the sales.     

   The sponsor will generally instruct the trustee to sell the securities as
quickly as practicable during the termination proceedings without in its        
judgment materially adversely affecting the market price of the securities, but 
it is expected that all of the securities will in any event be disposed of      
within a reasonable time after a trust's termination.  The sponsor does not     
anticipate that the period will be longer than one month, and it could be as    
short as one day, depending on the liquidity of the securities being sold.  The 
liquidity of any security depends on the daily trading volume of the security   
and the amount that the sponsor has available for sale on any particular day.   
Of course, no assurances can be given that the market value of the securities   
will not be adversely affected during the termination proceedings.              

     Approximately thirty days prior to termination of a trust, the trustee will
notify unitholders of the termination and provide a form allowing qualifying    
unitholders to elect an in-kind distribution.  A unitholder who owns the minimum
number of units described in the prospectus may request an in-kind distribution 
from the trustee instead of cash.  The trustee will make an in-kind distribution
through the distribution of each of the securities of the trust in book entry   
form to the account of the unitholder's bank or broker-dealer at Depository     
Trust Company.  The unitholder will be entitled to receive whole shares of each 
of the securities comprising the portfolio of a trust and cash from the Capital 
Account equal to the fractional shares to which the unitholder is entitled.  The
trustee may adjust the number of shares of any security included in a           
unitholder's in-kind distribution to facilitate the distribution of whole       
shares.  The sponsor may terminate the in-kind distribution option at any time  
upon notice to the unitholders.  Special federal income tax consequences will   
result if a unitholder requests an in-kind distribution.                        

 Within a reasonable period after termination, the trustee will sell any
securities remaining in a trust and, after paying all expenses and charges      
incurred by the trust, will distribute to                                       

-12-

P-->48733rd�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�33rd
unitholders thereof (upon surrender for cancellation of certificates for units, 
if issued) their pro rata share of the balances remaining in the Income and     
Capital Accounts of the trust.                                                  

The sponsor may, but is not obligated to, offer for sale units of a   
subsequent series of a trust at approximately the time of the mandatory         
termination date.  If the sponsor does offer such units for sale, unitholders   
may be given the opportunity to purchase such units at a public offering price  
that includes a reduced sales fee.  There is, however, no assurance that units  
of any new series of a trust will be offered for sale at that time, or if       
offered, that there will be sufficient units available for sale to meet the     
requests of any or all unitholders.                                             

THE TRUSTEE.  The trustee is The Bank of New York, a trust company    
organized under the laws of New York. The Bank of New York has its principal    
unit investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, Brooklyn, 
New York 11217, (800) 848-6468. The Bank of New York is subject to supervision  
and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New York and the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits are insured  
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent permitted by law.    

   The trustee, whose duties are ministerial in nature, has not participated
in selecting the portfolio of any trust.  In accordance with the trust          
agreement, the trustee shall keep records of all transactions at its office.    
Such records shall include the name and address of, and the number of units held
by, every unitholder of a trust.  Such books and records shall be open to       
inspection by any unitholder at all reasonable times during usual business      
hours.  The trustee shall make such annual or other reports as may from time to 
time be required under any applicable state or federal statute, rule or         
regulation.  The trustee shall keep a certified copy or duplicate original of   
the trust agreement on file in its office available for inspection at all       
reasonable times during usual business hours by any unitholder, together with a 
current list of the securities held in each trust.  Pursuant to the trust       
agreement, the trustee may employ one or more agents for the purpose of custody 
and safeguarding of securities comprising a trust.                              

    Under the trust agreement, the trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of a trust created by the trust agreement by executing an     
instrument in writing and filing the same with the sponsor.                     

The trustee or successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of    
resignation to all unitholders then of record, not less than sixty days before  
the date specified in such notice when such resignation is to take effect.  The 
sponsor upon receiving notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a     
successor trustee promptly.  If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has
been appointed and has accepted the appointment within thirty days after        
notification, the retiring trustee may apply to a court of competent            
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor.  In case at any time the       
trustee shall not meet the requirements set forth in the trust agreement, or    
shall become incapable of acting, or if a court having jurisdiction in the      
premises shall enter a decree or order for relief in respect of the trustee in  
an involuntary case, or the trustee shall commence a voluntary case, under any  
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in      
effect, or any receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator 
(or similar official) for the trustee or for any substantial part of its        
property shall be appointed, or the trustee shall generally fail to pay its     
debts as they become due, or shall fail to meet such                            

-13-

P-->48734th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�34th
written standards for the trustee's performance as shall be established from    
time to time by the sponsor, or if the sponsor determines in good faith that    
there has occurred either (1) a material deterioration in the creditworthiness  
of the trustee or (2) one or more grossly negligent acts on the part of the     
trustee with respect to a trust, the sponsor, upon sixty days' prior written    
notice, may remove the trustee and appoint a successor trustee, as hereinafter  
provided, by written instrument, in duplicate, one copy of which shall be       
delivered to the trustee so removed and one copy to the successor trustee.      
Notice of such removal and appointment shall be mailed to each unitholder by the
sponsor.  Upon execution of a written acceptance of such appointment by such    
successor trustee, all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of the        
original trustee shall vest in the successor.  The trustee must be a corporation
organized under the laws of the United States, or any state thereof, be         
authorized under such laws to exercise trust powers and have at all times an    
aggregate capital, surplus and undivided profits of not less than $5,000,000.   

 THE SPONSOR.  The sponsor of the trust is Fixed Income Securities, L.P.
acting through its Advisor's Asset Management division.  The sponsor is a       
broker-dealer specializing in providing services to broker-dealers, registered  
representatives, investment advisers and other financial professionals. The     
sponsor's headquarters are located at 18925 Base Camp Road, Monument, Colorado
80132. You can contact the Advisor's Asset Management division at 8100 East 22nd
Street North, Suite 900B, Wichita, Kansas 67226-2309 or by using the contacts   
listed on the back cover of the prospectus. The sponsor is a registered broker- 
dealer and investment adviser and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory 
Authority, Inc. (FINRA) and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation      
(SIPC), and a registrant of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB).   

  If at any time the sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under
the trust agreement or shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a  
bankrupt or insolvent or shall have its affairs taken over by public            
authorities, then the trustee may (a) appoint a successor sponsor at rates of   
compensation deemed by the trustee to be reasonable and not exceeding such      
reasonable amounts as may be prescribed by the Securities and Exchange          
Commission, (b) terminate the trust agreement and liquidate any trust as        
provided therein, or (c) continue to act as trustee without terminating the     
trust agreement.                                                                

    THE EVALUATOR AND SUPERVISOR.  Fixed Income Securities, L.P., the sponsor,
also serves as evaluator and supervisor.  The evaluator and supervisor may      
resign or be removed by the sponsor and trustee in which event the sponsor or   
trustee is to use its best efforts to appoint a satisfactory successor.  Such   
resignation or removal shall become effective upon acceptance of appointment by 
the successor evaluator.  If upon resignation of the evaluator no successor has 
accepted appointment within thirty days after notice of resignation, the        
evaluator may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of 
a successor.  Notice of such resignation or removal and appointment shall be    
mailed by the trustee to each unitholder.                                       

LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY.  The sponsor, evaluator, and supervisor are 
liable for the performance of their obligations arising from their              
responsibilities under the trust agreement but will be under no liability to the
unitholders for taking any action or refraining from any action in good faith   
pursuant to the trust agreement or for errors in judgment, except in cases of   
its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or its reckless       
disregard for its duties                                                        

-14-

P-->48735th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�35th
thereunder.  The sponsor shall not be liable or responsible in any way for      
depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale of any securities.          

   The trust agreement provides that the trustee shall be under no liability
for any action taken in good faith in reliance upon prima facie properly        
executed documents or for the disposition of moneys, securities or certificates 
except by reason of its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct,  
or its reckless disregard for its duties under the trust agreement, nor shall   
the trustee be liable or responsible in any way for depreciation or loss        
incurred by reason of the sale by the trustee of any securities.  In the event  
that the sponsor shall fail to act, the trustee may act and shall not be liable 
for any such action taken by it in good faith.  The trustee shall not be        
personally liable for any taxes or other governmental charges imposed upon or in
respect of the securities or upon the interest thereof.  In addition, the trust 
agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the     
trustee.                                                                        

 The trustee and unitholders may rely on any evaluation furnished by the
evaluator and shall have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof.  The trust 
agreement provides that the determinations made by the evaluator shall be made  
in good faith upon the basis of the best information available to it, provided, 
however, that the evaluator shall be under no liability to the trustee or       
unitholders for errors in judgment, but shall be liable for its gross           
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or its reckless disregard for its   
obligations under the trust agreement.                                          

  EXPENSES OF THE TRUST.  The sponsor will not charge a trust any fees for
services performed as sponsor.  The sponsor will receive a portion of the sale  
commissions paid in connection with the purchase of units and will share in     
profits, if any, related to the deposit of securities in the trust.             

     The trustee receives for its services that fee set forth in the prospectus.
The trustee's fee which is calculated and paid monthly is based on the total    
number of units of the related trust outstanding as of January 1 for any annual 
period, except during the initial offering period the fee will be based on the  
units outstanding at the end of each month.  The trustee benefits to the extent 
there are funds for future distributions, payment of expenses and redemptions in
the Capital and Income Accounts since these Accounts are non-interest bearing   
and the amounts earned by the trustee are retained by the trustee.  Part of the 
trustee's compensation for its services to a trust is expected to result from   
the use of these funds.                                                         

The supervisor will charge a trust a surveillance fee for services    
performed for the trust in an amount not to exceed that amount set forth in the 
prospectus but in no event will such compensation, when combined with all       
compensation received from other unit investment trusts for which the sponsor   
both acts as sponsor and provides portfolio surveillance, exceed the aggregate  
cost to the sponsor of providing such services.  Such fee shall be based on the 
total number of units of the related trust outstanding as of January 1 for any  
annual period, except during the initial offering period the fee will be based  
on the units outstanding at the end of each month.                              

     For evaluation of the securities in a trust, the evaluator shall receive an
evaluation fee in an amount not to exceed that amount set forth in the          
prospectus but in no event will such                                            

-15-

P-->48736th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�36th
compensation, when combined with all compensation from other unit investment    
trusts for which the sponsor acts as sponsor and provides evaluation services,  
exceed the aggregate cost of providing such services.  Such fee shall be based  
on the total number of units of the related trust outstanding as of January 1   
for any annual period, except during the initial offering period the fee will be
based on the units outstanding at the end of each month.                        

For providing bookkeeping and administrative services to a trust, the 
sponsor shall receive an administration fee in an amount not to exceed that     
amount set forth in the prospectus but in no event will such compensation, when 
combined with all compensation from other unit investment trusts for which the  
sponsor acts as sponsor and provides evaluation services, exceed the aggregate  
cost of providing such services.  Such fee shall be based on the total number of
units of the related trust outstanding as of January 1 for any annual period,   
except during the initial offering period the fee will be based on the units    
outstanding at the end of each month.                                           

The trustee's fee, sponsor's fee for providing bookkeeping and        
administrative services to the trust, supervisor's fee and evaluator's fee are  
deducted from the Income Account of the related trust to the extent funds are   
available and then from the Capital Account.  Each such fee (other than any     
creation and development fee) may be increased without approval of unitholders  
by amounts not exceeding a proportionate increase in the Consumer Price Index or
any equivalent index substituted therefor.                                      

The following additional charges are or may be incurred by the trust: 
(a) fees for the trustee's extraordinary services; (b) expenses of the trustee  
(including legal and auditing expenses and reimbursement of the cost of advances
to the trust for payment of expenses and distributions, but not including any   
fees and expenses charged by an agent for custody and safeguarding of           
securities) and of counsel, if any; (c) various governmental charges;           
(d) expenses and costs of any action taken by the trustee to protect the trust  
or the rights and interests of the unitholders; (e) indemnification of the      
trustee for any loss, liability or expense incurred by it in the administration 
of the trust not resulting from negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on  
its part or its reckless disregard of its obligations under the trust agreement;
(f) indemnification of the sponsor for any loss, liability or expense incurred  
in acting in that capacity without gross negligence, bad faith or willful       
misconduct or its reckless disregard for its obligations under the trust        
agreement; and (g) expenditures incurred in contacting unitholders upon         
termination of the trust.  The fees and expenses set forth herein are payable   
out of a trust and, when owing to the trustee, are secured by a lien on the     
trust.  If the balances in the Income and Capital Accounts are insufficient to  
provide for amounts payable by the trust, the trustee has the power to sell     
securities to pay such amounts.  These sales may result in capital gains or     
losses to unitholders.  A trust may pay the costs of updating its registration  
statement each year.                                                            

PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS AND BROKERAGE ALLOCATION                                 

When a trust sells securities, the composition and diversity of the   
securities in the trust may be altered.  In order to obtain the best price for a
trust, it may be necessary for the sponsor to specify minimum amounts in which  
blocks of securities are to be sold.  In effecting purchases and sales of a     
trust's portfolio securities, the sponsor may direct that orders be placed with 
and

brokerage commissions be paid to brokers, including brokers which may be        
affiliated with the trust, the sponsor or dealers participating in the offering 
of units.                                                                       

PURCHASE, REDEMPTION AND PRICING OF UNITS                                       

     PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE.  Units of a trust are offered at the public offering
price thereof.  The public offering price per unit is equal to the net asset    
value per unit plus the applicable sales fee referred to in the prospectus.  The
sales fee as a percentage of the public offering price is set forth in the      
prospectus.  Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction fee for processing 
unit purchases.                                                                 

As indicated above, the initial public offering price of the units was
established by dividing the aggregate underlying value of the securities by the 
number of units outstanding.  Such price determination as of the opening of     
business on the date a trust was created was made on the basis of an evaluation 
of the securities in the trust prepared by the evaluator.  After the opening of 
business on this date, the evaluator will appraise or cause to be appraised     
daily the value of the underlying securities as of the close of regular trading 
on the New York Stock Exchange on days the New York Stock Exchange is open and  
will adjust the public offering price of the units commensurate with such       
valuation.  Such public offering price will be effective for all orders received
at or prior to the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on   
each such day.  Orders received by the trustee, sponsor or any dealer for       
purchases, sales or redemptions after that time, or on a day when the New York  
Stock Exchange is closed, will be held until the next determination of price.   

  Had units of a trust been available for sale at the close of business on
the business day before the inception date of the trust, the public offering    
price would have been as shown under "Essential Information" in the prospectus. 
The public offering price per unit of a trust on the date of the prospectus or  
on any subsequent date will vary from the amount stated under "Essential
Information" in the prospectus in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of 
the underlying securities.  Net asset value per unit is determined by dividing  
the value of a trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all    
liabilities, by the total number of units outstanding.  The portfolio securities
are valued by the evaluator as follows: If the security is listed on a national 
securities exchange, the evaluation will generally be based on the last sale    
price on the exchange (unless the evaluator deems the price inappropriate as a  
basis for evaluation).  If the security is not so listed or, if so listed and   
the principal market for the security is other than on the exchange, the        
evaluation will generally be made by the evaluator in good faith based on an    
appraisal of the fair value of the securities using recognized pricing methods. 

     The foregoing evaluations and computations shall be made as of the close of
regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, on each business day commencing 
with the trust's inception date of the securities, effective for all sales made 
during the preceding 24-hour period.                                            

   Although payment is normally made three business days following the order
for purchase, payments may be made prior thereto.  A person will become the     
owner of units on the date of settlement provided payment has been received.    
Cash, if any, made available to the sponsor prior to the date of settlement for 
the purchase of units may be used in the sponsor's business and may             

-17-

P-->48738th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�38th
be deemed to be a benefit to the sponsor, subject to the limitations of the     
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  If a unitholder desires to have certificates  
representing units purchased, such certificates will be delivered as soon as    
possible following his written request therefor.                                

     PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION OF UNITS.  The sponsor intends to qualify the units for
sale in a number of states.  Units will be sold through dealers who are members 
of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and through others.     
Sales may be made to or through dealers at prices which represent discounts from
the public offering price as set forth in the prospectus.  Certain commercial   
banks may be making units available to their customers on an agency basis.  The 
sponsor reserves the right to change the discounts from time to time.           

   We may provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits, additional
compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell shares of units of this    
trust and our other products. This compensation is intended to result in        
additional sales of our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial 
advisors for past sales. We may make these payments for marketing, promotional  
or related expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining    
retail customers and financial advisors, advertising, sponsorship of events or  
seminars, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities   
designed to promote the sale of the our products. These arrangements will not   
change the price you pay for your units.                                        

  The sponsor reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any order
for the purchase of units.                                                      

     PROFITS OF SPONSOR.  The sponsor will receive gross sales fees equal to the
percentage of the offering price of the units of such trusts stated in the      
prospectus and will pay a portion of such sales fees to dealers and agents.  In 
addition, the sponsor may realize a profit or a loss resulting from the         
difference between the purchase prices of the securities to the sponsor and the 
cost of such securities to a trust.  The sponsor may also realize profits or    
losses with respect to securities deposited in a trust which were acquired from 
underwriting syndicates of which the sponsor was a member.  An underwriter or   
underwriting syndicate purchases securities from the issuer on a negotiated or  
competitive bid basis, as principal, with the motive of marketing such          
securities to investors at a profit.  The sponsor may realize additional profits
or losses during the initial offering period on unsold units as a result of     
changes in the daily evaluation of the securities in a trust.                   

   MARKET FOR UNITS.  After the initial offering period, while not obligated
to do so, the sponsor may, subject to change at any time, maintain a market for 
units of the trust offered hereby and to continuously offer to purchase said    
units at the net asset value determined by the evaluator.  While the sponsor may
repurchase units from time to time, it does not currently intend to maintain an 
active secondary market for units.  Unitholders who wish to dispose of their    
units should inquire of their broker as to current market prices in order to    
determine whether there is in existence any price in excess of the redemption   
price and, if so, the amount thereof.  Unitholders who sell or redeem units     
prior to such time as the entire creation and development fee on such units has 
been collected will not be assessed the amount of the remaining creation and    
development fee at the time of such sale or redemption.  The offering price of  
any units resold by the sponsor will be in accord with that described in the    
currently effective prospectus describing                                       

-18-

P-->48739th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�39th
such units.  Any profit or loss resulting from the resale of such units will    
belong to the sponsor.  If the sponsor decides to maintain a secondary market,  
it may suspend or discontinue purchases of units of the trust if the supply of  
units exceeds demand, or for other business reasons.                            

  REDEMPTION.  A unitholder who does not dispose of units in the secondary
market described above may cause units to be redeemed by the trustee by making a
written request to the trustee at its unit investment trust division office and,
in the case of units evidenced by a certificate, by tendering such certificate  
to the trustee properly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or      
instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the trustee.  Unitholders must  
sign the request, and such certificate or transfer instrument, exactly as their 
names appear on the records of the trustee and on any certificate representing  
the units to be redeemed.  Additional documentation may be requested, and a     
signature guarantee is always required, from corporations, executors,           
administrators, trustees, guardians or associations.  The signatures must be    
guaranteed by a participant in the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program 
("STAMP") or such other signature guaranty program in addition to, or in        
substitution for, STAMP, as may be accepted by the trustee.  A certificate      
should only be sent by registered or certified mail for the protection of the   
unitholder.  Since tender of the certificate is required for redemption when one
has been issued, units represented by a certificate cannot be redeemed until the
certificate representing such units has been received by the purchasers.        

Redemption shall be made by the trustee no later than the seventh day 
following the day on which a tender for redemption is received (the "Redemption 
Date") by payment of cash equivalent to the redemption price, determined as set 
forth below under "Computation of Redemption Price," as of the close of regular 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange next following such tender, multiplied by
the number of units being redeemed.  Any units redeemed shall be canceled and   
any undivided fractional interest in the related trust extinguished.  The price 
received upon redemption might be more or less than the amount paid by the      
unitholder depending on the value of the securities in the trust at the time of 
redemption.  Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction fee for processing 
redemption requests.                                                            

  Under regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service, the trustee is
required to withhold a specified percentage of the principal amount of a unit   
redemption if the trustee has not been furnished the redeeming unitholder's tax 
identification number in the manner required by such regulations.  Any amount so
withheld is transmitted to the Internal Revenue Service and may be recovered by 
the unitholder only when filing a tax return.  Under normal circumstances, the  
trustee obtains the unitholder's tax identification number from the selling     
broker.  However, any time a unitholder elects to tender units for redemption,  
such unitholder should make sure that the trustee has been provided a certified 
tax identification number in order to avoid this possible "back-up withholding."
In the event the trustee has not been previously provided such number, one must 
be provided at the time redemption is requested.  Any amounts paid on redemption
representing interest shall be withdrawn from the Income Account of a trust to  
the extent that funds are available for such purpose.  All other amounts paid on
redemption shall be withdrawn from the Capital Account for a trust.             

  Unitholders tendering units for redemption may request a distribution in
kind (a "Distribution In Kind") from the trustee in lieu of cash redemption of  
an amount and value of                                                          

-19-

P-->48740th�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�40th
securities per unit equal to the redemption price per unit as determined as of  
the evaluation time next following the tender, provided that the tendering      
unitholder meets the requirements stated in the prospectus and the unitholder   
has elected to redeem at least thirty days prior to the termination of the      
trust. If the unitholder meets these requirements, a Distribution In Kind will  
be made by the trustee through the distribution of each of the securities of the
trust in book entry form to the account of the unitholder's bank or broker-     
dealer at Depository Trust Company.  The tendering unitholder shall be entitled 
to receive whole shares of each of the securities comprising the portfolio of   
the trust and cash from the Capital Account equal to the fractional shares to   
which the tendering unitholder is entitled.  The trustee shall make any         
adjustments necessary to reflect differences between the redemption price of the
units and the value of the securities distributed in kind as of the date of     
tender.  If funds in the Capital Account are insufficient to cover the required 
cash distribution to the tendering unitholder, the trustee may sell securities. 
The in kind redemption option may be terminated by the sponsor at any time.     

The trustee is empowered to sell securities in order to make funds    
available for the redemption of units.  To the extent that securities are sold  
or redeemed in-kind, the size of a trust will be, and the diversity of a trust  
may be, reduced but each remaining unit will continue to represent approximately
the same proportional interest in each security.  Sales may be required at a    
time when securities would not otherwise be sold and may result in lower prices 
than might otherwise be realized.  The price received upon redemption may be    
more or less than the amount paid by the unitholder depending on the value of   
the securities in the portfolio at the time of redemption.                      

 The trustee is irrevocably authorized in its discretion, if the sponsor
does not elect to purchase any unit tendered for redemption, in lieu of         
redeeming such units, to sell such units in the over-the-counter market for the 
account of tendering unitholders at prices which will return to the unitholders 
amounts in cash, net after brokerage commissions, transfer taxes and other      
charges, equal to or in excess of the redemption price for such units.  In the  
event of any such sale, the trustee shall pay the net proceeds thereof to the   
unitholders on the day they would otherwise be entitled to receive payment of   
the redemption price.                                                           

    The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed (1) for any
period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than customary 
weekend and holiday closings, or during which (as determined by the Securities  
and Exchange Commission) trading on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted;  
(2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which        
disposal by the trustee of securities is not reasonably practicable or it is not
reasonably practicable to fairly determine the value of the underlying          
securities in accordance with the trust agreement; or (3) for such other period 
as the Securities and Exchange Commission may by order permit.  The trustee is  
not liable to any person in any way for any loss or damage which may result from
any such suspension or postponement.                                            

COMPUTATION OF REDEMPTION PRICE.  The redemption price for units of each
trust is computed by the evaluator as of the evaluation time stated in the      
prospectus next occurring after the tendering of a unit for redemption and on   
any other business day desired by it, by:                                       

-20-

P-->48741st�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�41st
A.   Adding:  (1) the cash on hand in the trust other than cash deposited in the
     trust to purchase securities not applied to the purchase of such securities
 and (2) the aggregate value of each issue of the securities held in the
trust as determined by the evaluator as described above;              

B.   Deducting therefrom (1) amounts representing any applicable taxes or       
   governmental charges payable out of the trust and for which no deductions
have been previously made for the purpose of additions to the Reserve 
   Account; (2) an amount representing estimated accrued expenses, including
  but not limited to fees and expenses of the trustee (including legal and
  auditing fees), the evaluator, the sponsor and counsel, if any; (3) cash
     held for distribution to unitholders of record as of the business day prior
 to the evaluation being made; and (4) other liabilities incurred by the
trust; and                                                            

C.   Finally dividing the results of such computation by the number of units of 
the trust outstanding as of the date thereof.                         

RETIREMENT PLANS.  A trust may be suited for purchase by Individual   
Retirement Accounts, Keogh Plans, pension funds and other qualified retirement  
plans.  Generally, capital gains and income received under each of the foregoing
plans are deferred from Federal taxation.  All distributions from such plans are
generally treated as ordinary income but may, in some cases, be eligible for    
special income averaging or tax-deferred rollover treatment.  Investors         
considering participation in any such plan should review specific tax laws      
related thereto and should consult their attorneys or tax advisers with respect 
to the establishment and maintenance of any such plan.  Such plans are offered  
by brokerage firms and other financial institutions.  The trust will lower the  
minimum investment requirement for IRA accounts.  Fees and charges with respect 
to such plans may vary.                                                         

OWNERSHIP OF UNITS.  Ownership of units will not be evidenced by      
certificates unless a unitholder, the unitholder's registered broker/dealer or  
the clearing agent for such broker/dealer makes a written request to the        
trustee.  Units are transferable by making a written request to the trustee and,
in the case of units evidenced by a certificate, by presenting and surrendering 
such certificate to the trustee properly endorsed or accompanied by a written   
instrument or instruments of transfer which should be sent by registered or     
certified mail for the protection of the unitholder.  Unitholders must sign such
written request, and such certificate or transfer instrument, exactly as their  
names appear on the records of the trustee and on any certificate representing  
the units to be transferred.  Such signatures must be guaranteed as described   
above.                                                                          

  Units may be purchased and certificates, if requested, will be issued in
denominations of one unit or any multiple thereof, subject to the minimum       
investment requirement.  Fractions of units, if any, will be computed to three  
decimal places.  Any certificate issued will be numbered serially for           
identification, issued in fully registered form and will be transferable only on
the books of the trustee.  The trustee may require a unitholder to pay a        
reasonable fee, to be determined in the sole discretion of the trustee, for each
certificate re-issued or transferred and to pay any governmental charge that may
be imposed in connection with each such transfer or interchange.  The trustee at
the present time does not intend to charge for the normal transfer or           
interchange of certificates.  Destroyed, stolen, mutilated or lost certificates 
will be replaced upon

delivery to the trustee of satisfactory indemnity (generally amounting to 3% of 
the market value of the units), affidavit of loss, evidence of ownership and    
payment of expenses incurred.                                                   

TAXATION                                                                        

 The prospectus contains a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax
issues concerning your trust and the purchase, ownership and disposition of     
trust units. The discussion below supplements the prospectus discussion and is  
qualified in its entirety by the prospectus discussion. Prospective investors   
should consult their own tax advisors with regard to the federal tax            
consequences of the purchase, ownership, or disposition of trust units, as well 
as the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, locality, non-U.S. 
country, or other taxing jurisdiction.                                          

     The federal income tax summary below and in the prospectus is based in part
on the advice of counsel to your trust. The Internal Revenue Service could      
disagree with any conclusions set forth in these discussions. In addition, our  
counsel was not asked to review, and has not reached a conclusion with respect  
to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be held by your trust. This
may not be sufficient for prospective investors to use for the purpose of       
avoiding penalties under federal tax law.                                       

     If so indicated in the prospectus, your trust intends (i) to elect and (ii)
to qualify annually as a regulated investment company under the Code and to     
comply with applicable distribution requirements so that it will not pay federal
income tax on income and capital gains distributed to its unitholders.          

  To qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment generally
accorded to regulated investment companies, your trust must, among other things,
(a) derive in each taxable year at least 90% of its gross income from dividends,
interest, payments with respect to securities loans and gains from the sale or  
other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies or other income    
derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or  
currencies, and net income from certain publicly traded partnerships; (b)       
diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of the taxable year, 
(i) at least 50% of the market value of the trust's assets is represented by    
cash and cash items (including receivables), U.S. government securities, the    
securities of other regulated investment companies and other securities, with   
such other securities of any one issuer generally limited for the purposes of   
this calculation to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of the trust's   
total assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of   
such issuer, and (ii) not more than 25% of the value of its total assets is     
invested in the securities (other than U.S. government securities or the        
securities of other regulated investment companies) of any one issuer, or two or
more issuers which the trust controls and are engaged in the same, similar or   
related trades or businesses, or the securities of certain publicly traded      
partnerships; and (c) distribute at least 90% of its investment company taxable 
income (which includes, among other items, dividends, interest and net short-   
term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses but excludes net   
capital gain, if any) and at least 90% of its net tax-exempt interest income    
each taxable year.                                                              

-22-

P-->48743rd�Page�of�47TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�43rd
     As a regulated investment company, your trust generally will not be subject
to U.S. federal income tax on its investment company taxable income (as that    
term is defined in the Code, but without regard to the deduction for dividends  
paid) and net capital gain (the excess of net long-term capital gain over net   
short term capital loss), if any, that it distributes to unitholders. The trusts
intend to distribute to its unitholders, at least annually, substantially all of
its investment company taxable income and net capital gain. If your trust       
retains any net capital gain or investment company taxable income, it will      
generally be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the    
amount retained. In addition, amounts not distributed on a timely basis in      
accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a       
nondeductible 4% excise tax unless, generally, your trust distributes during    
each calendar year an amount equal to the sum of (1) at least 98% of its        
ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the   
calendar year, (2) at least 98% of its capital gains in excess of its capital   
losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending    
October 31 of the calendar year, and (3) any ordinary income and capital gains  
for previous years that were not distributed during those years. To prevent     
application of the excise tax, your trust intends to make its distributions in  
accordance with the calendar year distribution requirement. Further, if your    
trust retains any net capital gain, the trust may designate the retained amount 
as undistributed capital gains in a notice to unitholders who, if subject to    
federal income tax on long-term capital gains (i) will be required to include in
income for federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital gain, their share  
of such undistributed amount, and (ii) will be entitled to credit their         
proportionate share of the tax paid by the trust against their federal income   
tax liabilities if any, and to claim refunds to the extent the credit exceeds   
such liabilities. A distribution will be treated as paid on December 31 of the  
current calendar year if it is declared by your trust in October, November or   
December with a record date in such a month and paid by your trust during       
January of the following calendar year. These distributions will be taxable to  
unitholders in the calendar year in which the distributions are declared, rather
than the calendar year in which the distributions are received.                 

     If your trust failed to qualify as a regulated investment company or failed
to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement in any taxable year, the trust would
be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income (even if such income  
were distributed to its unitholders) and all distributions out of earnings and  
profits would be taxed to unitholders as ordinary dividend income.              

 If the trust is treated as holding directly or indirectly 10 percent or
more of the combined voting power of the stock of a foreign corporation, and all
U.S. shareholders collectively own more than 50 percent of the vote or value of 
the stock of such corporation, the foreign corporation may be treated as a      
"controlled foreign corporation" (a "CFC") from a U.S. tax perspective.  In such
circumstances, the trust will be required to include certain types of passive   
income and certain other types of income relating to insurance, sales and       
services with related parties and oil related income in the trust's taxable     
income whether or not such income is distributed.                               

  If the trust holds an equity interest in any "passive foreign investment
companies" ("PFICs"), which are generally certain foreign corporations that     
receive at least 75% of their annual gross income from passive sources (such as 
interest, dividends, certain rents and royalties

or capital gains) or that hold at least 50% of their assets in investments      
producing such passive income, the trust could be subject to U.S. federal income
tax and additional interest charges on gains and certain distributions with     
respect to those equity interests, even if all the income or gain is timely     
distributed to its unitholders.  The trust will not be able to pass through to  
its unitholders any credit or deduction for such taxes.  The trust may be able  
to make an election that could ameliorate these adverse tax consequences.  In   
this case, the trust would recognize as ordinary income any increase in the     
value of such PFIC shares, and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to   
the extent it did not exceed prior increases included in income. Under this     
election, the trust might be required to recognize in a year income in excess of
its distributions from PFICs and its proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock   
during that year, and such income would nevertheless be subject to the          
distribution requirement and would be taken into account for purposes of the 4% 
excise tax (described above). Dividends paid by PFICs will not be treated as    
qualified dividend income.                                                      

PERFORMANCE INFORMATION                                                         

    Information contained in this Information Supplement or in the prospectus,
as it currently exists or as further updated, may also be included from time to 
time in other prospectuses or in advertising material.  Information on the      
performance of a trust strategy or the actual performance of a trust may be     
included from time to time in other prospectuses or advertising material and may
reflect sales fees and expenses of a trust.  The performance of a trust may also
be compared to the performance of money managers as reported in SEI Fund        
Evaluation Survey or of mutual funds as reported by Lipper Analytical Services  
Inc. (which calculates total return using actual dividends on ex-dates          
accumulated for the quarter and reinvested at quarter end), Money Magazine Fund 
Watch (which rates fund performance over a specified time period after sales fee
and assuming all dividends reinvested) or Wiesenberger Investment Companies     
Service (which states fund performance annually on a total return basis) or of  
the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index, the American Stock Exchange Index  
(unmanaged indices of stocks traded on the New York and American Stock          
Exchanges, respectively), the Dow Jones Industrial Average (an index of 30      
widely traded industrial common stocks) or the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (an  
unmanaged diversified index of 500 stocks) or similar measurement standards     
during the same period of time.
