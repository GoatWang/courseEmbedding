My review is not for Aubrey. My review is to help the consumer, my fellow neighbor and  citizen, for the person whom seems lost and not know where to turn, smothered in fear and confusion. This is how I felt. I felt as if the legal train was moving so fast, I had to get ahead of it. I hired attorneys in the past and crossed my fingers hoping that I "picked" a "good " one. I had a heck of a time, being male and in family court. Nothing against the system or anyone in particular....it's just that that is how it is. I felt everyone was against me....that an opinion was falsely formed about me from people not even knowing who I am as a person.  Being the good parent is not enough, so how do you get that across? So frustrating and demeaning!  Out of money and still climbing the hill, I was filing papers myself in the absence of an affordable attorney, when at the courthouse I overheard a conversation speaking to the talents of this family attorney, Aubrey Srednicki. Every now and then, she would appear by appointment, and do almost pro-bono consultation. I needed help on filing papers, and she not only helped me, but she was insistent on making sure that I understood her direction to the tee. After asking midway through our chat for her card, upon conclusion she then made sure to give me her card and stated that she would be there for me, and work with my budget.. Aubrey was not "selling" me....which so many do. As far as I thought, we were parting ways, and I finally met a very nice genuine person, that truly has a vocation here vs. a job. Long story longer....I wound up needing her, and I retained Ms. Srednicki a few months later, and everything she had told me months back came true. Nothing changed. No shell game, no look at the monkey, no bait and switch! She did work with me financially, and the level of confidence she gave me after our next conversation felt like a win to me right there. In other words, I had much more wind in my sails after a few conversations with her, than I did with 3 attorneys prior....and we hadn't even stepped foot in a courtroom as of yet. This is all true. I already have my daughter Full Time & Sole Custodial physical & Legal custody thanks to Aubrey. She didn't play the court game, she didn't drag anything out unnecessarily or bleed m monetarily, She gathers the facts, structures it in a very matter of fact format and delivery, and I watched the miracle unfold right before my eyes. This may seem over the top....maybe. But I remember. I can feel that ugly feeling in my gut right now just typing about it. This is for the folks that are as confused and scared and feel as lonely as I did. I remember, therefore I am passing on a good thing just as a good person hoping to help my fellow man or woman. Any attorney can have a great deal of knowledge....but what are they willing to do for you for the right reasons? Some say it and it ends right there, but Aubrey does it......cannot get any simpler than that!Owens & Perkins, Attorneys at LawCandy T. ratedI remember watching C.D. Owen's video on YouTube about how his practice is based on helping clients get to the point where they can think straight. When I watched that video, I knew that's where I needed to be at. I needed to think straight. C.D. was so confident in his firm that in his video he recommends that for a client, the most important thing is to look at the credentials of the law firm. I did. I ended up watching the videos of all the attorneys within Owens & Perkins and Kris Leonhardt stood out. In Kris' video, she advocates that she's different because of her ability to take reasonable approaches to help get her client what they want. And let me tell you, choosing Kris was one of the best decisions I have ever made in my life. I did get to the point where I could finally think straight because I trusted Kris to help win my case in modifying parenting time. She was supportive 100% of the way and I can't tell you just how amazing it is when you have a lawyer that believed in what you were fight for. I felt Kris was more of a friend than a lawyer. She listened to what I wanted and didn't let me settle on what I didn't want. She is one of the most compassionate, genuine lawyers I have ever met. You will not go wrong in choosing Kris Leonhardt to represent you. I can promise you that.  Law Office of Aubrey Srednicki, PLLCamazed001 ratedAubrey was always very quick to respond, to any questions or information. She was also very knowledgeable, and made sure that I understood every step, and bit of information. She is also very calm, yet knows when to be stern without being cocky like some other attorneys. Not only did she seem very compassionate about the case, but she also treated me on a personal level, rather than as just a case number. She made sure she addressed the most important concerns I had, and got the critical information out in trial. Even being a high conflict case, she was always positive, and never seemed to be doubting there would be a positive outcome. Aubrey helped me to finally get some headway in my case and protected the well being of my children aggressively. I don't think I could have hired anyone better. Owens & Perkins, Attorneys at Lawowensperkins ratedBrian and his team by far took on this case as if they were defending their own rights. Their attention to detail, guidance and professionalism were flawless! Brian did an amazing job preparing all the documentation for the case. Brian did an amazing job articulating my case in a very strategic, yet realistic manner. He was always very up front and honest about what he felt I could and could not get in this case and I can honestly say that I feel that he did his best to at the same time get me as much as was possible while also keeping my costs reasonable. Brain always returned my calls and emails and communicated everything in the case as it happened. I highly recommend Brain and Perkins and Owens Law Firm for any legal matter. Law Office of Aubrey Srednicki, PLLCApril H. ratedWe are very pleased with Aubrey. After we made our research online and decided to go with her based on all the good reviews she had. She got our temporary order paper work ready and drafted the next day of meeting with her!! After that she has responded to every email we sent her very promptly and let me tell you she never keeps you waiting around wondering when she will reply. Thats mostly important to us. Everything worked great we have court next week its only been about a month that we met with Aubrey and already going to court. Hopefully we don't need to go any further with this and our issue will get solved on the court date but if not we are not hesitating on having Aubrey representing us in our case. Thank you Aubrey!!!!!Owens & Perkins, Attorneys at Lawmword897 ratedOUTSTANDING LAW FIRM DEDICATED TO HELPING PEOPLEI am so thankful that my friend referred me to Owens and Perkins.  I live out of state and my sister died in Arizona.  I am trying to handle all of her affairs but I didn't know what I was doing.  I spoke with Owens and Perkins and they explained the entire process to me, let me know my options and suggested the best way to handle everything.  As it turns out, they gave me enough information that I can do this on my own, but if I was going to hire an attorney for this I would certainly hire them.  And, if I run into more problems, I know where I can get all of my questions answered.  Truly an outstanding law firm dedicated to helping people.R.D. Smith Lawrichardwhiston ratedI came to R.D. Smith Law at th...I came to R.D. Smith Law at the recommendation of another attorney.I had gone to several attorneys before because I had a conflict in a lawsuit where I felt my first attorney did not represent me well. It was a very long process, as most lawsuits are. But, I think what most impressed me with Roger was not only his knowledge of the law, but also that he wanted my opinion and input. I also liked that he was very well written . . . More than anything else I would have to say that he seemed to have a vested interest in my case,that it wasn't just "attorney for hire" that he truly wanted to win. As a result he represented me very well.Owens & Perkins, Attorneys at LawLannie O. rated"10 Years of Trust & Results - I have been a client of Owens & Perkins, P.C. for over 10 years. I have relied on their expertise in all important matters pertaining to my business, family and regarding estate planning. In every case they have met or exceeded my expectations. Michelle Perkins has been my attorney, on occasion I have been referred to other attorneys in the Firm depending on their specialty and areas of practice. I have always received sound advice, excellent service and most importantly RESULTS. I feel most fortunate to have found such a Law Firm and recommend their services to anyone. "Owens & Perkins, Attorneys at LawJackie M. ratedThe lawyers at Owens and Perkins are strong capable litigators. They resolve cases effectively and expeditiously, particularly in the area of family law. They understand the peculiarities of divorce and child custody matters, and they know how to navigate a courtroom. They are well-connected and what I would consider first-class legal talent. Their straightforward approach was comforting and their ability to devise creative strategies to complicated legal problems is to be rivaled. You won't be disappointed with the quality of legal representation you receive when you retain Owens and Perkins. Owens & Perkins, Attorneys at LawGeorge S. ratedIn the years since I first retained Owens & Perkins, I have received such loyal service that I've felt like part of their family. They have gone beyond my wildest expectations in their service. They have not only shown professionalism but exhibited bull-dog determination like a hockey mom. Their kindness and honesty during some of the hardest times I've faced in my life have been a strength for me and our continuing relationship is a blessing. My mother and I don't believe we could have made it to this point without their constant help and understanding. Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.
