MEMs Process







FormFactor maintains the worlds’ largest and most advanced MEMS fabrication facility dedicated to probe card manufacturing. 
Highly customized MEMS-based probe cards are essential enablers of our customers’ technology roadmaps. Because beyond superior electrical performance characteristics, MEMS contacts can scale to new device requirements for finer pad pitch and higher pin counts.
Over the last decade, we have invested $150+ million in facilities and equipment. Today, our MEMs operations span more than 27,000 ft2 of Class 100 cleanroom space, and 20,000 ft2 Class 1000 cleanroom space. In these advanced cleanrooms patterning of complex multi-material structures is executed with micron-level accuracy.
Leading DRAM and Flash device manufacturers turn to our 3D MEMS MicroSpring® contact technology for its ultra-low force and very high contact precision. Superior position accuracy is enabled by the use of semiconductor processes like photolithography and plating. The proliferation of this unique 3D MEMS technology with other FormFactor technical innovations has enabled massively high parallel test. This has extended the breadth of wafer probe applications and shifted demand from conventional cantilever probe cards.
SoC customers rely on our 2D vertical MEMS technologies to optimize performance and reduce test costs for given applications. Here, multiple materials allow for a good balance between electrical and mechanical properties.

					Full Description



FormFactor, Inc., incorporated on April 15, 1993, is a provider of test and measurement solutions. The Company's segments include the Probe Cards segment and Systems segment. The Company designs, manufactures and sells multiple product lines, including probe cards, analytical probes, probe stations, integrated measurement systems, thermal sub-systems, reliability test systems, and related services. Its products provide electrical information from a range of semiconductor and electro-optical devices and integrated circuits (devices) from development to production.Probe Cards segment consists of probe card products and analytical probes. Probe cards are used in the semiconductor manufacturing industry to perform wafer test, which is the testing of the semiconductor die, or chips, while those die are constituted on the semiconductor wafer. Wafer test enables semiconductor manufacturers to determine whether chips will meet specifications and be saleable before the wafer is diced, and the die are singulated and individually packaged. Analytical probes are used in semiconductor engineering device characterization.Probe products are used to test a range of semiconductor device types, including system on a chip products, mobile application processors, microprocessors, microcontrollers, graphic processors, radio frequency, analog, mixed signal, image sensors, electro-optical, dynamic random access memory (DRAM), NAND flash memory and NOR flash memory devices. In both engineering and production use, the analytical probes and probe cards serve as the electrical and mechanical interface between the chip(s) being tested and the test instrument that generates the electrical signal used to evaluate the device performance.Systems segment consists of wafer probing, thermal and reliability products to enable precision on-wafer measurement of integrated circuits. Systems products are used in the early phases of the development and characterization of semiconductor processes. Many of the Company's systems products are also used in production applications to test semiconductor devices prior to completion of the manufacturing process and include probe stations, thermal subsystems and reliability test systems.Probe cards utilize a range of technologies and product architectures, including micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) technologies. Probe cards are customized for customers' wafer and chip designs by modifying and adapting its standard product architectures to meet an individual customer's design layout and electrical test requirements. As of December 31, 2016, the Company offered over 50 different analytical probe models for engineering and production testing. Analytical probes are used for a set of applications, including device characterization, electrical simulation model development, failure analysis and prototype design debugging. Its customers for analytical probes include universities, research institutions, semiconductor integrated device manufacturers, semiconductor foundries and fabless semiconductor companies. Probing systems are required in the development of new generations of semiconductor processes and designs. The Company offers pre-configured and customized measurement systems for production testing, power device characterization, vacuum probing, cryogenic probing, high-pressure probing, and a range of other specific applications.Thermal subsystems produce thermal chucks and other test systems used in probe stations. Thermal chuck systems enable the testing of devices across a range of temperatures. The Company's reliability test systems enable customers to develop products that are less susceptible to a range of phenomenon that can degrade semiconductor device performance, such as electro-migration, stress migration, time dependent dielectric breakdown, stress induced leakage current, hot carrier injection and bias temperature instability. In addition to routine installation services at the time of sale, the Company offers services to enable its customers to maintain and utilize its products and to enhance its customer relationships. In addition to maintenance services, its applications engineers assist its customers in test methodologies to make measurements during process and product development, and during mass production. Its customers include companies that design or make semiconductor products in the foundry and logic, DRAM and Flash markets.The Company competes with Advantest Corporation, AMST Co., Ltd., Feinmetall GmbH, Japan Electronic Materials Corporation, Korea Instrument Co., Ltd., M2N Co., Ltd., Microfriend Inc., Micronics Japan Co., Ltd., MPI Corporation, Micro Square Technology Inc., NHK Spring Co., Ltd., Soulbrain Engineering, SV Probe, Inc., Synergie CAD, Technoprobe S.p.A, TSE Co., Ltd., Wentworth Laboratories Inc., WILL-Technology Co., Ltd., Yokowo, Micronics Japan Company, Ltd., TechnoProbe Co Ltd, GGB Industries Inc, Vector Semiconductor Co.

FormFactor, Inc. Kicks Off 2017 on a High Note
FormFactor's first-quarter results handily beat its own guidance, and management provided investors with a bullish outlook.











                Brian Feroldi
            

                (TMFTypeoh)



            
            May 4, 2017 at 6:20PM
            
            





The trend toward connectivity is helping to drive volume growth in the semiconductor industry. In turn, companies that supply products to semiconductor manufacturers are also witnessing growing demand. That includes FormFactor (NASDAQ:FORM), a leading provider of probe cards that are used to test semiconductor chips and wafers.
Coming into Wednesday's first-quarter earnings report, investors were expecting FormFactor to post another strong quarter of revenue and profit growth thanks to last year's massive Cascade Microtech acquisition. Let's take a closer look at the company's first-quarter results to see how it performed during the period.

What happened with FormFactor this quarter?

FormFactor's eye-popping revenue growth is still largely a result of last year's Cascade Microtech acquisition. Sequentially, revenue was up 4%. This figure was above the high end of management's guidance range.
On a non-GAAP (adjusted) basis, gross margin was 42.6% for the period. That is a 20-basis-point improvement over the prior quarter.
On a GAAP basis, FormFactor's net income was $5.2 million, or $0.07 per share. 
On a non-GAAP basis -- which excludes items like stock-based compensation and restructuring charges -- net income was $17.3 million, or $0.24 per share. This figure was also a penny better than the top end of management's prediction.
Cash generation during the first quarter was $13 million. That represents a sharp reversal from the year-ago period where the company consumed $400,000 in cash.
Free cash flow was $15.5 million.






What management had to say
Mike Slessor, FormFactor's CEO, said that the company's strong start to the year was owed to "robust demand from all our customers."
He also expressed belief that the company is in a great position to keep delivering strong results and drive shareholder value:

We continue to see strong momentum across all our product lines, as our large customers continue their technology node transitions and new design introductions. We are in a stronger position than we were one year ago, and are benefiting from significant scale, diversified market drivers, and a broad portfolio of leading test and measurement products. Our focus remains on execution to drive continued revenue growth and EPS expansion.

Mike Ludwig, FormFactor's CFO, also reaffirmed that the company is "on track" to realize the $10 million to $12 million of annual cost savings that were promised as part of the Cascade Microtech deal.
Looking ahead
During its call with investors, management stated that FormFactor is benefiting from strong end-market demand for semiconductors. They believe that this demand will stay robust for quite some time thanks to continued data center buildout, strong consumer demand for mobile devices, and increased semiconductor usage by automakers.
In response to that optimism, the company offered up following guidance for the second quarter 2017:



Metric
Q2 2017 Forecast
Q2 2016





Revenue


$130 million to $138 million


$83.1 million




Non-GAAP EPS


$0.24 to $0.30


$0.13




Data source: FormFactor.
This forecast compared favorably to the $127 million in revenue and $0.23 in EPS that market watchers were expecting. 
FormFactor's strong start to the year and upbeat guidance caused traders to significantly bid up the company's stock once trading started in the morning following this announcement. With revenue, margins, and profits expected to rise from here, it is easy to understand why investors are feeling good about this company's prospects.
