                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

      Fitch Rates CNH Equipment Trust 2016-A
    





February 17, 2016 02:08 PM Eastern Standard Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings to the CNH Equipment 
      Trust 2016-A notes:
    

      --$174,900,000 class A-1 'F1+sf';
    

      --$161,500,000 class A-2a 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$161,500,000 class A-2b 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$265,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$67,990,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$19,110,000 class B 'A+sf'; Outlook Stable
    

      Fitch's stress and rating sensitivity analysis are discussed in the 
      presale report, 'CNH Equipment Trust 2016-A', dated Feb. 4, 2016, which 
      is available on Fitch's web site. The presale report details how Fitch 
      addresses the key rating drivers summarized below.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High AG Concentration: The 2016-A collateral pool consists of 88% 
      Agricultural and 12% Construction equipment. While the concentrations 
      are consistent with CNH Industrial Capital securitizations dating back 
      to 2009, the AG concentrations in all these transactions are 
      significantly higher relative to CNH Industrial Capital transactions 
      issued prior to 2009.
    

      Consistent Collateral Concentrations: The pool contains 55% used 
      equipment, the highest since 2011-A. While AG concentrations remain high 
      at 88%, historical AG losses have been low. Additionally, geographic 
      diversity, diversification within the AG sector, and equipment 
      versatility help mitigate the high concentration.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement: Credit enhancement (CE) for the 2016-A 
      transaction is consistent with the prior transactions. Class A CE 
      remains at 4.50%, and class B CE remains at 2.25%. The transaction also 
      benefits from 2.67% in excess spread. The available CE is sufficient to 
      support Fitch's 1.15% cumulative net loss (CNL) proxy.
    

      Quality Origination, Underwriting and Servicing: CNH Industrial Capital 
      has demonstrated adequate abilities as originator, underwriter and 
      servicer, as evidenced by historical delinquency and loss performance of 
      securitized trusts and the managed portfolio.
    

      Integrity of Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction 
      should provide that a bankruptcy of the trust would not impair the 
      timeliness of payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings to increased losses over the 
      life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the notes display 
      limited sensitivity to increased defaults and losses, showing limited 
      impact on the rating of the notes under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case 
      loss) scenario. The notes could experience downgrades of up to two 
      rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst 
      & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on comparing or 
      recalculating certain information with respect to 184 receivables. Fitch 
      considered this information in its analysis and the findings did not 
      have an impact on our analysis/conclusions. A copy of the ABS Due 
      Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction 
      may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of this rating 
      action commentary (RAC).
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      presale report dated February 4, 2016. Fitch's analysis of the 
      Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this transaction can be found in 
      'CNH Equipment Trust 2016-A - Appendix'. These R&Ws are compared to 
      those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special 
      report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in 
      Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated June 12, 2015.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      accompanying presale report, available at 'www.fitchratings.com' 
      or by clicking on the above link.

ARTICLE II
 

CONVEYANCE OF
RECEIVABLES
 

Section 2.1.
                                                             
Conveyance of
Receivables . 
In consideration of CNHCR’s payment of $752,285,518.96 (the
“Purchase Price”) in the manner set out in
Section 2.5(a), and the other consideration (including the
terms and covenants) contained herein, CNHICA does hereby sell,
transfer, assign, set over and otherwise convey to CNHCR, without
recourse (subject to the obligations herein), all of its right,
title, interest in, to and under (collectively, the “CNHICA
Assets”):
 

(i)                                     
the Receivables, including all
documents constituting chattel paper included therewith, and all
obligations of the Obligors thereunder, including all monies paid
thereunder on or after the Cutoff Date;
 

(ii)                                  
the security interests in the
Financed Equipment granted by Obligors pursuant to the Receivables
and any other interest of CNHICA in such Financed
Equipment;
 

(iii)                               
any proceeds with respect to the
Receivables from claims on insurance policies covering Financed
Equipment or Obligors (to the extent not used to purchase
Substitute Equipment);
 

(iv)                              
any proceeds from recourse to
Dealers with respect to the Receivables;
 

(v)                                 
any Financed Equipment that shall
have secured the Receivables and that shall have been acquired by
or on behalf of CNHCR; and
 





 

(vi)                              
the proceeds of any and all of the
foregoing.
 

Section 2.2.
                                                             
[Reserved]
 

Section 2.3.
                                                             
Intention of the
Parties .  The
parties to this Agreement intend that the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be, and shall be treated as, a purchase by CNHCR and a
sale by CNHICA of the Receivables and not as a lending transaction,
such that in the event of a filing of a petition for relief by or
against CNHICA under the Bankruptcy Code, (i) such Receivables
would not be property of CNHICA’s bankruptcy estate under
Section 541 of the Bankruptcy Code, (ii) the bankruptcy
court would not compel the turnover of such Receivables or
collections thereon by CNHCR to CNHICA under Section 542 of
the Bankruptcy Code, and (iii) the bankruptcy court would
determine that payments on such Receivables not in the possession
of CNHICA would not be subject to the automatic stay provisions of
Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code imposed upon the
commencement of CNHICA’s bankruptcy case.  The foregoing
sale, assignment, transfer and conveyance does not constitute, and
is not intended to result in a creation or assumption by CNHCR of,
any obligation or liability with respect to any Receivables, nor
shall CNHCR be obligated to perform or otherwise be responsible for
any obligation of CNHICA or any other Person in connection with the
Receivables or under any agreement or instrument relating thereto,
including any contract or any other obligation to any
Obligor.  If (but only to the extent that) the transfer of the
Assets hereunder is characterized by a court or other governmental
authority as a loan rather than a sale, CNHICA shall be deemed
hereunder to have granted to CNHCR a security interest in all of
CNHICA’s right, title and interest in and to the
Assets.  Such security interest shall secure all of
CNHICA’s obligations (monetary or otherwise) under this
Agreement and the other Basic Documents to which it is a party,
whether now or hereafter existing or arising, due or to become due,
direct or indirect, absolute or contingent.  CNHCR shall have,
with respect to the property described in Section 2.1, and in
addition to all the other rights and remedies available to CNHCR
under this Agreement and applicable law, all the rights and
remedies of a secured party under any applicable UCC, and this
Agreement shall constitute a security agreement under applicable
law.
 

Section 2.4.
                                                             
The Closing
.  The sale and purchase of the
Receivables shall take place at a closing at the offices of
Greenberg Traurig, LLP, 77 West Wacker Drive, Suite 3100,
Chicago, Illinois  60601 on the Closing Date,
simultaneously with the closings under:  (a) the Sale and
Servicing Agreement, (b) the Trust Agreement, (c) the
Administration Agreement and (d) the Indenture.
 

Section 2.5.
                                                             
Payment of the Purchase
Price .
 

(a)                                 
Receivables.
  The Purchase Price is payable
in cash in an amount of $752,285,518.96 on the Closing
Date.
 

Section 2.6.
                                                             
Cross-Collateralization
.  To the extent CNHICA retains
any interest in any item of Financed Equipment securing the
repayment of any Receivable, as a result of the related Obligor
agreeing to cross-collateralize all obligations owed by such
Obligor to CNHICA or otherwise, CNHICA acknowledges and agrees that
its interest in the Financed Equipment shall be expressly
subordinate and junior in priority to the repayment of all amounts
outstanding under such Receivable prior to becoming available to
pay any amount outstanding under any
 





 
other obligation owed by such Obligor to
CNHICA.  CNHICA hereby represents, warrants and covenants that
NH Credit has not retained, and will not retain, any interest in
any item of Financed Equipment securing the repayment of any
Receivable, whether as a result of the related Obligor agreeing to
cross-collateralize obligations or otherwise.

CNHICA makes the following
representations and warranties as to the Receivables on which CNHCR
relies in accepting the Receivables and in transferring the

and assignment of the Receivables to CNHCR and the subsequent
assignment and transfer of such Receivables to the Trust pursuant
to the Sale and Servicing Agreement and the Grant to the Indenture
Trustee pursuant to the Indenture:
 

(i)                                     
Characteristics of
Receivables.   Each
Receivable is a Retail Installment Contract and: 
(A) (1) (i) was originated in the United States of
America by a Dealer in connection with the retail sale of Financed
Equipment in the ordinary course of such Dealer’s business,
and (ii) was purchased by CNHICA from a Dealer and validly
assigned by such Dealer to CNHICA in accordance with its terms,
except that some of the Receivables were purchased by NH Credit
from Dealers (after being originated as provided above),
securitized in a previous CNH Equipment Trust and purchased by
CNHICA through the exercise of a clean-up call relating to that
previous securitization or (2) was originated in the United
States of America by CNHICA in connection with the financing or
refinancing, as applicable, of Financed Equipment in the ordinary
course of CNHICA’s business, and in the case of the foregoing
clauses (1) and (2), was fully and properly executed by the
parties thereto, (B) has created a valid, subsisting and
enforceable first priority security interest in the Financed
Equipment in favor of CNHICA except to the extent that such
security interest has been assigned by CNHICA to CNHCR, by CNHCR to
the Issuing Entity and by the Issuing Entity to the Indenture
Trustee, (C) contains customary and enforceable provisions
such that the rights and remedies of the holder thereof are
adequate for realization against the collateral of the benefits of
the security, and (D) provides for fixed payments on a
periodic basis that fully amortize the Amount Financed by maturity
and yield interest at the Annual Percentage Rate.
 





 

(ii)                                  
Schedule of Receivables; No
Adverse Selection of Receivables; Accuracy of Computer
Tape.   The
information set forth on Schedule A to the CNHICA Assignment
delivered on the Closing Date is true and correct in all material
respects as of the opening of business on the Cutoff Date.  No
selection procedures believed by CNHICA to be adverse to the
interests of the Trust, the Noteholders or the Certificateholders
were or will be utilized in selecting the Receivables.  The
computer tape regarding the Receivables made available to CNHCR and
its assigns is true and correct in all respects regarding the
characteristics of the Receivables.
 

(iii)                               
Compliance with Law.
  Each Receivable and the sale
of the related Financed Equipment complied in all material respects
at the time it was originated or made and at the execution of this
Agreement with all requirements of applicable federal, state and
local laws and regulations thereunder, including usury law, the
Federal Truth-in-Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the
Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act,
the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act,
the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Regulations B and
Z, the Wisconsin Consumer Act and state adaptations of the National
Consumer Act and of the Uniform Consumer Credit Code, and other
consumer credit laws and equal credit opportunity and disclosure
laws, in each case, to the extent applicable.
 

(iv)                              
Binding Obligation.
  Each Receivable represents
the genuine, legal, valid and binding payment obligation in writing
of the Obligor, enforceable by the holder thereof in accordance
with its terms.
 

(v)                                 
No Government Obligor.
  None of the Receivables is
due from the United States of America or any state or from any
agency, department or instrumentality of the United States of
America or any state.
 

(vi)                              
Security Interest in Financed
Equipment.  
Immediately prior to the sale, assignment and transfer thereof,
each Receivable shall be secured by a validly perfected first
priority security interest in the Financed Equipment in favor of
CNHICA as secured party or all necessary and appropriate actions
have been commenced that would result in the valid perfection of a
first priority security interest in the Financed Equipment in favor
of CNHICA as secured party.
 

(vii)                           
Receivables in Force.
  No Receivable has been
satisfied, subordinated or rescinded, nor has any Financed
Equipment been released from the Lien granted by the related
Receivable in whole or in part (other than with respect to
equipment released from a Lien in accordance with the Servicing
Procedures).
 

(viii)                        
No Amendment or
Waiver.   No
provision of a Receivable has been waived, altered or modified in
any respect, except pursuant to a document, instrument or writing
included in the Receivable Files and no such amendment, waiver,
alteration or modification causes such Receivable not to conform to
the other warranties contained in this Section.
 

(ix)                              
No Defenses.
  No right of rescission,
setoff, counterclaim or defense has been asserted or threatened or
exists with respect to any Receivable.
 






 

(x)                                 
No Liens.   To the best of CNHICA’s knowledge,
no Liens or claims, including claims for work, labor or materials,
relating to any of the Financed Equipment have been filed that are
Liens prior to, or equal or coordinate with, the security interest
in the Financed Equipment granted by any Receivable, except those
pursuant to the Basic Documents.
 

(xi)                              
No Default; Delinquency
Limitations.   No
Receivable is a non-performing Receivable or has a payment that is
more than 90 days overdue as of the Cutoff Date and, except for a
payment default continuing for a period of not more than 90 days,
no default, breach, violation or event permitting acceleration
under the terms of any Receivable has occurred and is continuing;
and no continuing condition (other than a payment default
continuing for a period of not more than 90 days) that with notice
or the lapse of time would constitute such a default, breach,
violation or event permitting acceleration under the terms of any
Receivable has arisen; and CNHICA has not waived any of the
foregoing.  Receivables that are considered
“delinquent” (as defined in Item 1101(d) of
Regulation AB) constitute less than 20% of the aggregate
Statistical Contract Value of all of the Trust’s Receivables
as of the Cutoff Date.
 

(xii)                           
Title.   It is the intention of CNHICA that the
transfers and assignments contemplated herein c

Fitch Rates CNH Equipment Trust 2016-A

      Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings to the CNH Equipment 
      Trust 2016-A notes:
    

      --$174,900,000 class A-1 'F1+sf';
    

      --$161,500,000 class A-2a 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$161,500,000 class A-2b 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$265,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$67,990,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$19,110,000 class B 'A+sf'; Outlook Stable
    

      Fitch's stress and rating sensitivity analysis are discussed in the 
      presale report, 'CNH Equipment Trust 2016-A', dated Feb. 4, 2016, which 
      is available on Fitch's web site. The presale report details how Fitch 
      addresses the key rating drivers summarized below.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High AG Concentration: The 2016-A collateral pool consists of 88% 
      Agricultural and 12% Construction equipment. While the concentrations 
      are consistent with CNH Industrial Capital securitizations dating back 
      to 2009, the AG concentrations in all these transactions are 
      significantly higher relative to CNH Industrial Capital transactions 
      issued prior to 2009.
    

      Consistent Collateral Concentrations: The pool contains 55% used 
      equipment, the highest since 2011-A. While AG concentrations remain high 
      at 88%, historical AG losses have been low. Additionally, geographic 
      diversity, diversification within the AG sector, and equipment 
      versatility help mitigate the high concentration.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement: Credit enhancement (CE) for the 2016-A 
      transaction is consistent with the prior transactions. Class A CE 
      remains at 4.50%, and class B CE remains at 2.25%. The transaction also 
      benefits from 2.67% in excess spread. The available CE is sufficient to 
      support Fitch's 1.15% cumulative net loss (CNL) proxy.
    

      Quality Origination, Underwriting and Servicing: CNH Industrial Capital 
      has demonstrated adequate abilities as originator, underwriter and 
      servicer, as evidenced by historical delinquency and loss performance of 
      securitized trusts and the managed portfolio.
    

      Integrity of Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction 
      should provide that a bankruptcy of the trust would not impair the 
      timeliness of payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings to increased losses over the 
      life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the notes display 
      limited sensitivity to increased defaults and losses, showing limited 
      impact on the rating of the notes under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case 
      loss) scenario. The notes could experience downgrades of up to two 
      rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst 
      & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on comparing or 
      recalculating certain information with respect to 184 receivables. Fitch 
      considered this information in its analysis and the findings did not 
      have an impact on our analysis/conclusions. A copy of the ABS Due 
      Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction 
      may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of this rating 
      action commentary (RAC).
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      presale report dated February 4, 2016. Fitch's analysis of the 
      Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this transaction can be found in 
      'CNH Equipment Trust 2016-A - Appendix'. These R&Ws are compared to 
      those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special 
      report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in 
      Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated June 12, 2015.

Fitch Assign Ratings to CNH Equipment Trust 2016-B | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Assign Ratings to CNH Equipment Trust 2016-B
    





May 31, 2016 03:09 PM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings to the CNH Equipment 
      Trust 2016-B notes:
    

      --$190,500,000 class A-1 'F1+sf';
    

      --$222,600,000 class A-2a 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$110,000,000 class A-2b 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$246,600,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$72,790,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$19,390,000 class B 'A+sf'; Outlook Stable
    

      Fitch's stress and rating sensitivity analysis are discussed in the 
      presale report titled 'CNH Equipment Trust 2016-B', dated May 19, 2016, 
      which is available on Fitch's web site. The presale report details how 
      Fitch addresses the key rating drivers summarized below.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High AG Concentration: The 2016-B collateral pool consists of 87% AG and 
      13% CO. While the concentrations are consistent with CNH Industrial 
      Capital securitizations dating back to 2009, the AG concentrations in 
      all these transactions are significantly higher relative to CNH 
      Industrial Capital transactions issued prior to 2009.
    

      Consistent Collateral Concentrations: The pool contains 53% used 
      equipment, one of the highest since 2011-A. While AG concentrations 
      remain high at 87%, historical AG losses have been low. Additionally, 
      geographic diversity, diversification within the AG sector, and 
      equipment versatility help mitigate the high concentration.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement: Credit enhancement (CE) for the 2016-B 
      transaction is consistent with the prior transactions. Class A CE 
      remains at 4.50%, and class B CE remains at 2.25%. The transaction also 
      benefits from 2.36% in excess spread. The available CE is sufficient to 
      support Fitch's 1.15% cumulative net loss (CNL) proxy.
    

      Quality Origination, Underwriting and Servicing: CNH Industrial Capital 
      and affiliates have demonstrated adequate abilities as originator, 
      underwriter and servicer, as evidenced by historical delinquency and 
      loss performance of securitized trusts and the managed portfolio.
    

      Integrity of Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction 
      should provide that a bankruptcy of the trust would not impair the 
      timeliness of payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings to increased losses over the 
      life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the notes display 
      limited sensitivity to increased defaults and losses, showing limited 
      impact on the rating of the notes under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case 
      loss) scenario. The notes could experience downgrades of up to two 
      rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Additionally, Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence 
      information from Ernst & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence 
      focused on comparing or recalculating certain information with respect 
      to 184 receivables. Fitch considered this information in its analysis 
      and the findings did not have an impact on our analysis/conclusions. A 
      copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection 
      with this transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the 
      bottom of this rating action commentary (RAC).
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      presale report dated May 19, 2016. Fitch's analysis of the 
      Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this transaction can be found in 
      'CNH Equipment Trust 2016-B - Appendix'. These R&Ws are compared to 
      those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special 
      report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in 
      Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated March 2, 2016.
