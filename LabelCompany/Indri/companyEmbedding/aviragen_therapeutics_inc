Discovery and Development











We have historically focused our research and drug development capabilities on discovering and developing small molecule compounds that can prevent or treat infectious diseases. Infectious diseases are caused by pathogens that are present in the environment, such as viruses and bacteria, which enter the body through various means and overwhelm its natural defenses and cause an infection. The severity of an infectious disease varies depending on the nature of the infectious pathogen, as well as the degree to which the body’s immune system or available therapies can prevent or fight the infection.
The use of anti-infective drugs has led to a significant reduction in the morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases. However, for many infectious diseases current treatment options are associated with suboptimal treatment outcomes, significant adverse or toxic side effects, the emergence of drug resistant pathogens, complex dosing schedules and inconvenient methods of administration. These factors often lead to patients prematurely discontinuing treatment or not fully complying with treatment dosing schedules, resulting in a treatment failure. Moreover, a patient’s failure to comply fully with a recommended dosing schedule can both exacerbate the emergence of drug-resistant strains. We believe there remain significant unmet needs for new therapies for infectious disease and related respiratory and inflammatory disorders.

					Full Description



Aviragen Therapeutics, Inc., formerly Biota Pharmaceuticals, Inc., incorporated on March 14, 1969, is focused on the discovery and development of direct-acting antivirals to treat infections that affect patients globally. The Company has three product candidates in clinical development that address viral infections that have limited therapeutic options. Its products include vapendavir, an oral treatment for human rhinovirus (HRV) upper respiratory infections in moderate-to-severe asthmatics in Phase IIb SPIRITUS trial; BTA585, an oral fusion (F) protein inhibitor in Phase II development for the treatment and prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections, and BTA074, a topical antiviral treatment in Phase II development for condyloma caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) Types 6 and 11. The Company also has preclinical RSV non-fusion inhibitor program. The Company has focused its research and drug development capabilities on discovering and developing small molecule compounds that can prevent or treat infectious diseases.Vapendavir (BTA798)The Company is developing vapendavir (BTA798), an antiviral capsid binder that is designed to bind to a conserved pocket in the HRV capsid and interfere with receptor binding and/or related early steps in the infectious cycle. Vapendavir is an inhibitor of picornaviruses. The ongoing Phase IIb SPIRITUS clinical trial of vapendavir is being conducted in North America and Europe.BTA585The Company's lead compound, BTA585, is a potent, non-cytotoxic and selective inhibitor of the RSV F protein. BTA585 exerts its antiviral activity by interfering with the earliest stage of infection by inhibiting the attachment and/or fusion of the virus to the host cell. BTA585 is equally active against both RSV A and B subtypes but has no known activity against other pathogenic viruses. The ongoing double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase IIa trial is designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and antiviral activity of orally dosed BTA585 in volunteers challenged intranasally with RSV.BTA074BTA074 is in development for the treatment of genital warts caused by HPV. BTA074 is a potent and selective inhibitor of the interaction between two viral proteins from HPV6 and HPV11, E1 and E2, an interaction that is a step for HPV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication and thus, viral production and pathogenesis. This inhibition results from the binding of BTA074 to the E2 protein. BTA074 is a directing acting antiviral specific to HPV and possesses mechanism of action that can be exploited to treat infections caused by HPV Types 6 and 11. BTA074 is developed by combining chemo-informatics modeling and in cellulo screening of E1/E2 protein-protein interactions. The Phase II trial is designed as a double-blind placebo controlled, randomized, Phase II study, the primarily objective of which is to assess the pharmacokinetics of twice daily topical treatments of BTA074 5% gel in genital warts patients.The Company competes with MedImmune, GSK and Merck.

Aviragen Therapeutics Receives Non-Compliance Letter From The Nasdaq
Apr 3 17
On March 28, 2017, Aviragen Therapeutics, Inc. received a letter from the staff (the “Staff”) of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) providing notification that, for the previous 30 consecutive business days, the bid price for the Company’s common stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has been provided an initial period of 180 calendar days, or until September 25, 2017, to regain compliance. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of the Company’s common stock must be $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days at any time before September 25, 2017, unless the Staff exercises its discretion to extend this 10 business day period pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(F). If the Company regains compliance, Nasdaq will provide the Company with written confirmation and will close the matter. Nasdaq’s notification letter has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s common stock and the common stock will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “AVIR.” If the Company does not regain compliance with Rule 5550(a)(2) by September 25, 2017, the Company may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day compliance period. To qualify, the Company would need to transfer the listing of its common stock to The Nasdaq Capital Market, provided that it meets the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market except for the bid price requirement, and will need to provide written notice of its intention to cure its deficiency during the second compliance period. If it meets these criteria, Nasdaq staff will notify the Company that it has been granted an additional 180 calendar day compliance period. However, if it appears to the Staff that the Company will not be able to cure the deficiency, or if the Company is otherwise not eligible, Nasdaq would notify the Company that its securities would be subject to delisting. In the event of such a notification, the Company may appeal the Staff’s determination to delist its securities, but there can be no assurance the Staff would grant the Company’s request for continued listing. The Company intends to monitor the bid price of its common stock and its minimum market value of listed securities and will consider options available to it to achieve compliance.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
