David Laney

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

David M. Laney (born January 19, 1949, in Dallas, Texas) is an attorney, an administrator of transportation programs, and a Republican supporter and fundraiser.
Personal and Education Laney grew up in Dallas, Texas, where he graduated from St. Mark's School of Texas in 1967. He then graduated from Stanford University and the law school at Southern Methodist University.
Legal Career Laney practiced at the law firm of Jenkens & Gilchrist from 1977 to 2003 and was Managing Partner of that firm from 1990 to 2002. Between 2003 and 2007, he was a partner with the law firm of Jackson Walker LLP in Dallas where he practiced in the area of corporate and financial law.
Transportation administration Laney was chair of Amtrak's board of directors from 2003 to 2007.[1][2][3] [4]
Laney was previously the chairman of the Texas Transportation Commission,[2] [5]
Political and public involvement Laney became a campaign "Pioneer" for George W. Bush by raising over $100,000 for his 2000 presidential campaign. He also made significant donations to Republican campaigns in the 2008 elections.[6][7]
Texas Governor William Clements appointed Laney to the Texas Finance Commission from 1989 to 1995. That committee was responsible for regulatory oversight of state chartered banking and thrift institutions. He served as Governor Bush’s Texas Commissioner of Transportation (Chair of the Texas Transportation Commission) from 1995 to 2001.
In 2002, Mr. Laney was nominated by President George W. Bush to the board of directors of Amtrak and confirmed by the U.S. Senate for a five-year term. In 2007, he completed his term as Chairman of Amtrak’s board of directors.
Volunteer efforts and honors In 2010, Laney was inducted into the Texas Transportation Hall of Honor.[3][8]
Laney served on the Board of Trustees at Stanford University from 1998-2003. He currently serves on the board of Matador Reources.

               Company: Redeye
Job Details
               In 2000, 2002, 2003 and 2004, Redeye was awarded Distributor of the Year (Small Division) by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers (NARM). Redeye strives to service our catalog to all pertinent accounts on a per title basis.  This includes major chains like: Best Buy, Borders, Handleman, Wherehouse, Tower, Virgin, Musicland and Transworld. One-stops like AEC, Super D, Norwalk, Baker & Taylor, Arrow/ATM, ARC and Galaxy. On-line retailers like: Amazon, Insound, Aware, VP, Village, Miles of Music and Home Grown Network. And as always, we deal directly with the majority of the top independents in the country including all of the Coalition of Independent Music Stores, (CIMS), the Music Monitor Network (MMN), the AIMS Coalition, Newbury Comics, Amoeba Records and many others. Redeye also has strong relations with many foreign accounts and international distributors.  Based in Haw River, NC (near Raleigh/Durham/Chapel Hill), Redeye began in 1996 by focusing on the rich independent music of the southeast and providing an outlet for the Artists that made up the scene with a distribution option which allowed them access to all the major accounts located in their region. Since then, we have developed a strong distribution network nationally and work to provide our services to a broad range of accounts and regions.  Our goal is to make Redeye's catalog representative of what's going on in the various vibrant music scenes across the country. Scanning our 3,000-plus title catalog, we hope you'll find all the best in regional music including all genres such as pop, rock, indie rock, punk, bluegrass, country, electronica, jazz, alternative country, blues, jazz, reggae, hip hop, techno and much more. We're very proud of our catalog of great labels and exclusive titles available to our accounts.  We're happy to offer such strong exclusive lines to our customers as Ashmont, MidFi, Yep Roc, Burning Music, Hot Tomato, Bonfire Records, Kitchen Table, Undertow Music Collective, Constant Ivy, Aware, Diesel Only, Rainbow Quartz, Burnt Toast Vinyl, Silent Planet and many more. We also offer exclusive titles by such bands as Little Feat, Burning Spear, Paul Weller, The Minus 5, Nick Lowe, The Iguanas, Doyle Bramhall, Caitlin Cary, The Pernice Brothers, Martin Sexton, Jeru the Damaja, Supersuckers, Carbon Leaf, Leftover Salmon, Widespread Panic, The Samples, Tim Reynolds, Guster, Pat McGee Band, Jason Ringenberg and many more. Our full catalog also includes a select group of non-exclusive labels including Darla, Le Grand Magistery, Parasol and Hidden Agenda. Redeye has also played an important part in the development of many independent artists such as: John Mayer, Shawn Mullins, The Polyphonic Spree and Marc Broussard.  If you are a retail manager or buyer and would like a catalog mailed to you, please click here. Redeye has an ongoing commitment to strengthening our relationships with our accounts and vendors. Our dedicated staff of music-loving individuals will always make themselves accessible to everyone from the accounts to the Artists we work with (our current staff includes 36 people). The face of the industry is quickly changing and Redeye is proud to be at the forefront of this change!

How Do I Create P' Charts (Laney) in Excel Using SigmaXL?




P' and U' (Laney) Control Charts are attribute control charts that should be used when the subgroup/sample size is very large (i.e. > 5,000) and assumptions are not met.  Typically you will see that the control limits do not �look right�, being very tight with many data points appearing to be out-of-control.  This problem is also referred to as �overdispersion�.  This occurs when the assumption of a Binomial distribution for defectives or Poisson distribution for defects is not valid.  Individuals charts are often recommended in these cases, but Laney�s P� and U� charts are a preferred alternative.
