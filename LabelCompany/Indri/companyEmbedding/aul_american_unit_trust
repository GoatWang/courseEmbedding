** Disclaimer: Investors should consider
				carefully the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of
				the fund before investing. The prospectus contains this and other
				information about the fund. The AUL American Unit Trust prospectus
				and the underlying fund prospectuses may be accessed at www.eretirement.aul.com
				or by calling American United Life Insurance Company at
				1-800-403-4173.
 1 The total return
				figures shown are net of the ordinary operating expenses for each
				fund, but do not reflect a deduction for any contract related
				charges and fees such as mortality & expense risk charges,
				administrative expenses, premium tax charges, maintenance fees or
				other expenses that might be incurred under a group variable annuity
				contract. If included in these total return figures, any such
				charges would lower the performance shown. For a complete
				description of the charges, expenses or fees that apply to your
				contract, please contact your Employer or Plan Administrator. For a
				more complete description of the performance calculation and other
				important information, see "Things You Should Know About Your
				Investments" at www.eretirement.aul.com or write to AUL at P.O.
				Box 6148, Indianapolis, Indiana 46206-6148.
The above returns are historical and past
				performance does not guarantee future results. Current performance
				may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. The investment
				return and principal value of the Investment Accounts will
				fluctuate, so that a participant's units when redeemed may be
				worth more or less than their original cost.
				Any performance reported before AUL first offered
				an investment option is hypothetical and was calculated by adjusting
				the underlying fund's performance by current applicable contract
				charges.
				Unit values given in this statement are based on
				net asset values provided by the funds and are not independently
				verified by AUL. If AUL receives inaccurate information, the unit
				value may be affected accordingly. If an error is subsequently
				discovered by any fund and reported to AUL, a participant's
				account will be recalculated to reflect the correct fund value,
				provided that the error was material under federal securities laws.




















				
				Diversification cannot eliminate the risk of
				investment losses.
 2 Lesser of 10
				years or since inception.
 3 An investment in
				high yield securities may be subject to more credit risks than
				higher quality securities.
 4 Sector funds may
				experience greater short-term price volatility than more diversified
				equity funds, and are most suitable for the aggressive portion of an
				investment portfolio.
 5 There are
				additional risks associated with international investing, such as
				currency fluctuations, economic and political factors, etc. not
				associated with investing exclusively in the U.S.
 6 The inception
				date of each T. Rowe Price R share class fund is September 30, 2002.
				Performance reported prior to this date was calculated by adjusting
				the underlying fund's performance for any asset-based charge
				specific to the R share class.
 7 Micro-, Small-
				and Mid-Cap company stocks are more volatile than large company
				stocks.
 8 Investors cannot
				invest directly in any index.
 9 Allianz/PIMCO
				funds are distributed by Allianz Global Investors Distributors LLC.
				The PIMCO Funds: Multi-Manager Series (MMS) stock funds have been
				renamed the Allianz Funds. The PIMCO Funds: Pacific Investment
				Management Series (PIMS) bond funds will remain the PIMCO Funds.
 10 The inception
				date of each Allianz/PIMCO R Share Class fund is December 31, 2002.
				The performance numbers show performance of a fund's
				Institutional Class shares, adjusted to reflect the distribution
				and/or service (12b-1) fees, administrative fees and
				other expenses paid by Class R shares. Although Institutional Class
				and Class R shares would have similar annual returns (because all of
				a fund's shares represent interests in the same portfolio of
				securities). Class R performance would be lower than Institutional
				Class performance because of the lower expenses paid by
				Institutional Class shares.
 11 The Franklin
				Flex Cap Growth Fund invests primariliy in California companies'
				equity securities, and events and conditions in California are
				likely to affect the fund's investments and its performance.
				These events may include changes in the economic and political
				conditions within that state, which are unpredictable and can change
				at any time. It also invests in technology stocks, which can be
				highly volatile.

     This  Prospectus  describes  individual  variable  annuity  contracts  (the
"Contracts")  offered by American United Life Insurance Company(R) ("AUL" or the
"Company").  AUL  designed  the  Contracts  for use in  connection  with non-tax
qualified  retirement  plans and  deferred  compensation  plans for  individuals
("Non-Qualified  Plans").   Contract  Owners  may  also  use  the  Contracts  in
connection  with  retirement  plans that meet the  requirements of Sections 401,
403(b), 408, 408A, or 457 of the Internal Revenue Code.                         

     This Prospectus describes two variations of Contracts:  Contracts for which
premiums  may vary in amount  and  frequency,  subject  to  certain  limitations
("Flexible  Premium  Contracts")  and Contracts  for which  premiums may vary in
amount and  frequency,  only in the first  Contract  Year  ("One  Year  Flexible
Premium  Contracts").  Both Contracts  provide for the accumulation of values on
either a variable  basis,  a fixed basis,  or both.  The Contracts  also provide
several options for fixed annuity payments to begin on a future date.           

     A Contract  Owner may  allocate  premiums  designated  to  accumulate  on a
variable basis to one or more of the Investment  Accounts of a separate  account
of AUL. The separate  account is named the AUL  American  Individual  Unit Trust
(the  "Variable  Account").  Each  Investment  Account of the  Variable  Account
invests in shares of one of the following mutual fund portfolios:               

AUL American Equity                          Fidelity VIP II Contrafund         
AUL American Bond                            Fidelity VIP Equity-Income         
AUL American Managed                         Fidelity VIP Growth                
AUL American Money Market                    Fidelity VIP High Income           
AUL American Tactical Asset Allocation       Fidelity VIP II Index 500          
Alger American Growth                        Fidelity VIP Overseas              
American Century VP Capital Appreciation     PBHG Growth II                     
American Century VP International            PBHG Technology & Communications   
Calvert Social Mid Cap Growth                T. Rowe Price Equity Income        
Fidelity VIP II Asset Manager                                                   

     Premiums  allocated to an Investment  Account of the Variable  Account will
increase or decrease in dollar value depending on the investment  performance of
the corresponding mutual fund portfolio in which the Investment Account invests.
These  amounts are not  guaranteed.  In the  alternative,  a Contract  Owner may
allocate premiums to AUL's Fixed Account. Such allocations will earn interest at
rates that are paid by AUL as described in "The Fixed Account."                 

     This Prospectus  concisely sets forth  information  about the Contracts and
the Variable Account that a prospective  investor should know before  investing.
Certain  additional  information  is  contained in a  "Statement  of  Additional
Information,"  dated May 1, 2001,  which has been filed with the  Securities and
Exchange  Commission  (the "SEC").  The Statement of Additional  Information  is
incorporated  by reference  into this  Prospectus.  A  prospective  investor may
obtain a copy of the  Statement  of  Additional  Information  without  charge by
calling or writing to AUL at the telephone number or address  indicated above. A
postage pre-paid envelope is included for this purpose. The table of contents of
the  Statement  of  Additional  Information  is  located  at  the  end  of  this
Prospectus.                                                                     

     Neither the  Securities and Exchange  Commission  nor any state  securities
commission has approved or  disapproved  of these  securities or passed upon the
adequacy or accuracy of the prospectus.  Any representation to the contrary is a
criminal offense.                                                               

     This prospectus  should be accompanied by the current  prospectuses for the
fund or funds  being  considered.  Each of  these  prospectuses  should  be read
carefully and retained for future reference.                                    

 The date of this Prospectus is May 1, 2001.

 SUMMARY

     This  summary  is  intended  to  provide  a  brief  overview  of  the  more
significant  aspects of the Contracts.  Later sections of this  Prospectus,  the
Statement of Additional  Information,  and the Contracts provide further detail.
Unless the context indicates  otherwise,  the discussion in this summary and the
remainder of the  Prospectus  relates to the portion of the Contracts  involving
the Variable Account.  The pertinent Contract and "The Fixed Account" section of
this Prospectus briefly describe the Fixed Account.                             

PURPOSE OF THE CONTRACTS 

     AUL  offers  the  individual   variable  annuity  contracts   ("Contracts")
described in this  Prospectus  for use in connection  with taxable  contribution
retirement plans and deferred  compensation plans for individuals  (collectively
"non-Qualified  Plans"). AUL also offers the Contracts for use by individuals in
connection  with  retirement  plans that meet the  requirements of Sections 401,
403(b),  457, 408, or 408A of the Internal  Revenue  Code,  allowing for pre-tax
contributions  (collectively  "Qualified  Plans").  While a  Contract  Owner may
benefit from tax deferral  under a Qualified  Plan without the use of a variable
annuity  contract,  variable  annuities may provide  additional  investment  and
insurance or annuity-related  benefits to individual Contract Owners. A variable
annuity contract  presents a dynamic concept in retirement  planning designed to
give Contract  Owners  flexibility  in attaining  investment  goals.  A Contract
provides for the  accumulation  of values on a variable basis, a fixed basis, or
both,  and  provides  several  options for fixed  annuity  payments.  During the
Accumulation  Period,  a Contract  Owner can  allocate  premiums  to the various
Investment  Accounts of the Variable  Account or to the Fixed Account.  See "The
Contracts."

TYPES OF CONTRACTS 

     AUL  offers  two  variations  of  contracts  that  are  described  in  this
Prospectus.  With  Flexible  Premium  Contracts,  premiums  payments may vary in
amount and frequency,  subject to the limitations described below. With One Year
Flexible Premium  Contracts,  premiums payments may vary in amount and frequency
only during the first Contract Year.  Premium payments may not be made after the
first Contract Year.                                                            

THE VARIABLE ACCOUNT AND THE FUNDS 

     AUL will allocate premiums  designated to accumulate on a variable basis to
the Variable Account.  See "Variable Account." The Variable Account is currently
divided into  subaccounts  referred to as Investment  Accounts.  Each Investment
Account invests  exclusively in shares of one of the portfolios of the following
mutual funds:

P-->485BPOS10th�Page�of�65TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�10th
     Each of the Funds has a different  investment  objective.  A Contract Owner
may allocate premiums to one or more of the Investment  Accounts available under
a Contract. Premiums allocated to a particular Investment Account will increase 
or decrease in dollar value  depending  upon the  investment  performance of the
corresponding  mutual fund  portfolio in which the Investment  Account  invests.
These amounts are not  guaranteed.  The Contract Owner bears the investment risk
for amounts allocated to an Investment Account of the Variable Account.         

FIXED ACCOUNT 

     The Contract  Owner may allocate  premiums to the Fixed  Account,  which is
part of AUL's  General  Account.  Amounts  allocated  to the Fixed  Account earn
interest at rates periodically  determined by AUL.  Generally,  any current rate
that exceeds the guaranteed rate will be effective for the Contract for a period
of at least one year.  These rates are  guaranteed  to be at least an  effective
annual rate of 3%. See "The Fixed Account."

PREMIUMS 

     For Flexible  Premium  Contracts,  the Contract  Owner may vary premiums in
amount and frequency.  The minimum  premium  payment is $50. For the first three
Contract Years,  premiums must total, on a cumulative  basis, at least $300 each
Contract Year. For One Year Flexible Premium  Contracts,  the Contract Owner may
pay premiums only during the first Contract  Year.  The minimum  premium is $500
with a minimum  total  first year  premium of $5,000.  See  "Premiums  under the
Contracts."

TRANSFERS 

     A Contract  Owner may transfer his or her Variable  Account Value among the
available  Investment  Accounts  or to the Fixed  Account at any time during the
Accumulation  Period.  The Contract  Owner may transfer part of his or her Fixed
Account Value to one or more of the  available  Investment  Accounts  during the
Accumulation  Period,  subject to certain  restrictions.  The  minimum  transfer
amount from any one Investment Account or from the Fixed Account is $500. If the
Contract Value in an Investment Account or the Fixed Account prior to a transfer
is less than $500,  then the minimum  transfer  amount is the  Contract  Owner's
remaining Contract Value in that Account. If, after any transfer,  the remaining
Contract  Value in an  Investment  Account or in the Fixed Account would be less
than  $500,  then AUL will  treat  that  request  for a  transfer  of the entire
Contract Value in that Investment Account.                                      

     If we  determine  that the  transfers  made by or on  behalf of one or more
Owners are to the  disadvantage  of other Owners,  we may restrict the rights of
certain  Owners.  We also reserve the right to limit the size of  transfers  and
remaining  balances,  to limit the number and  frequency  of  transfers,  and to
discontinue telephone, interactive voice response or internet based transfers.  

     Amounts  transferred from the Fixed Account to an Investment Account cannot
exceed  20% of the  Owner's  Fixed  Account  Value as of the  beginning  of that
Contract Year. See "Transfers of Account Value."

WITHDRAWALS 

     The Contract Owner may surrender the Contract or take a partial  withdrawal
from the Contract  Value at any time before the Annuity  Date.  Withdrawals  and
surrender are subject to the limitations under any applicable Qualified Plan and
applicable  law.  The minimum  withdrawal  amount is $200 for  Flexible  Premium
Contracts and $500 for One Year Flexible Premium Contracts.                     

     Certain  retirement  programs,  such as 403(b)  Programs,  are  subject  to
constraints on withdrawals and full surrenders. See "403(b) Programs-Constraints
on  Withdrawals."  See "Cash  Withdrawals" for more  information,  including the
possible charges and tax consequences of full and partial withdrawals.          

THE DEATH BENEFIT 

     If a Contract  Owner dies during the  Accumulation  Period,  AUL will pay a
death  benefit to the  Beneficiary.  The amount of the death benefit is equal to
the Death  Proceeds.  A death benefit will not be payable if the Contract  Owner
dies on or after the Annuity Date,  except as may be provided  under the Annuity
Option elected. See "The Death Proceeds" and "Annuity Period."

CHARGES 

     AUL will deduct  certain  charges in  connection  with the operation of the
Contracts and the Variable  Account.  These charges include a withdrawal  charge
assessed  upon partial  withdrawal  or  surrender,  a mortality and expense risk
charge, a premium tax charge, and an administrative fee. In addition,  the Funds
pay  investment  advisory fees and other  expenses.  For further  information on
these charges and expenses, see "Charges and Deductions."

FREE LOOK RIGHT 

     The  Contract  Owner has the right to return  the  Contract  for any reason
within ten days of receipt (or a longer period if required by state law). If the
Contract Owner  exercises  this right,  AUL will treat the Contract as void from
its inception.  AUL will refund to the Contract Owner the greater of (1) premium
payments,  or (2) the Contract  Value minus amounts  deducted for premium taxes.

DOLLAR COST AVERAGING 

     Owners may purchase  units of an  Investment  Account over a period of time
through the Dollar Cost  Averaging  ("DCA")  Program.  Under a DCA Program,  the
Owner  authorizes AUL to transfer a specific dollar amount from the AUL American
Money Market  Investment  Account into one or more other Investment  Accounts at
the unit values  determined  on the dates of the  transfers.  An Owner may elect
monthly,  quarterly,  semi-annual, or annual DCA transfers. These transfers will
continue  automatically until AUL receives notice to discontinue the Program, or
until there is not enough  money in the AUL  American  Money  Market  Investment
Account to continue the Program.  To participate in the program,  AUL requires a
minimum  transfer amount of $500, and a minimum deposit of $10,000.  For further
information, see the explanation under "Dollar Cost Averaging Program."

 EXPENSE TABLE

     The purpose of the following table is to assist  investors in understanding
the  various  costs  and  expenses  that  Contract   Owners  bear  directly  and

"Variable  Account Annual  Expenses" are fixed and specified  under the terms of
the  Contract.  Expenses of the Funds as shown under "Fund Annual  Expenses" are
not fixed or specified  under the terms of the Contract,  and may vary from year
to year. The fees in this expense table have been provided by the Funds and have
not been independently verified by AUL. The table does not reflect AUL's charges
for premium taxes that may be imposed by various jurisdictions. See "Premium Tax
Charge." The information  contained in the table is not generally  applicable to
amounts  allocated to the Fixed Account or to annuity  payments under an Annuity
Option.

     (3)AUL  has  currently  agreed to waive its  advisory  fee if the  ordinary                            
expenses  of a  Portfolio  exceed 1% and,  to the extent  necessary,  assume any                            
expenses in excess of its advisory  fee so that the expenses of each  Portfolio,                            
including the advisory fee but excluding extraordinary expenses, will not exceed                            
1% of the  Portfolio's  average daily net asset value per year.  The Adviser may                            
terminate  the policy of reducing its fee and/or  assuming Fund expenses upon 30                            
days written notice to the Fund and such policy will be terminated automatically                            
by the termination of the Investment Advisory  Agreement.  During 2000, expenses                            
did not exceed 1% of the average daily net asset value.                                                     

     (4) "Other Expenses"  reflect an indirect fee. Net fund operating  expenses                            
after  reductions  for fees paid  indirectly  would be 1.02% for  Social Mid Cap                            
Growth.  Total  expenses have been restated to reflect  expenses  expected to be                            
incurred in 2001.                                                                                           

     (5) Actual annual class operating  expenses were lower because a portion of                            
the  brokerage  commissions  that the fund  paid was used to reduce  the  fund's                            
expenses, and/or because through arrangements with the fund's custodian, credits                            
realized as a result of  uninvested  cash balances were used to reduce a portion                            
of the fund's  custodian  expenses.  See the  accompanying  fund  prospectus for                            
details.                                                                                                    

     (6) The fund's  manager has  voluntarily  agreed to  reimburse  the class's                            
expenses if they  exceed a certain  level.  Including  this  reimbursement,  the                            
annual class operating expenses were 0.28%. This arrangement may be discontinued                            
by the fund's manager at any time.                                                                          

     (7) You should  know that for the  fiscal  year ended  December  31,  2001,                            
Pilgrim Baxter has  contractually  agreed to waive that portion,  if any, of the                            
annual  management fees payable by the Portfolio and to pay certain  expenses of                            
the  Portfolio  to the extent  necessary  to ensure  that the total  annual fund                            
operating  expenses do not exceed 1.20%.  In addition,  in  connection  with Old                            
Mutual  plc's  acquisition  of Pilgrim  Baxter's  parent  company,  United Asset                            
Management  Corporation,  Old Mutual and Pilgrim  Baxter have agreed to maintain                            
this expense limitation  agreement until December 31, 2002. You should also know                            
that in any fiscal year in which the  Portfolio's  assets are  greater  than $75                            
million and its total annual fund  operating  expenses are less than 1.20%,  the                            
Portfolio's  Board of Directors  may elect to reimburse  Pilgrim  Baxter for any                            
fees it waived or expenses it  reimbursed on the  Portfolio's  behalf during the                            
previous two fiscal years.  In 2000,  the Board elected to reimburse  $50,092 in                            
waived fees for the Growth II Portfolio.                                                                    

     (8) Management fee includes operating expenses.

EXAMPLES  (for any Investment Account)                                          

     The following examples show expenses that a Contract Owner would pay at the
end of one, three,  five, or ten years if at the end of those time periods,  the
Contract  is  (1)  surrendered,  (2)  annuitized,  or  (3)  not  surrendered  or
annuitized.  The information  below represents  expenses on a $1,000 premium and
assumes a 5% return per year.  For a  Contract  that is  surrendered,  and for a
Contract that is  annuitized,  the example shows  expenses for Flexible  Premium
Contracts and One Year Flexible Premium Contracts. Expenses will be the same for
both  Contracts  if not  surrendered  or  annuitized.  Column  (2)  reflects  an
assumption that a life annuity or survivorship annuity is elected. Under certain
circumstances, a withdrawal charge may apply upon annuitization. See "Withdrawal
Charge." These  examples  should not be considered a  representation  of past or
future expenses.  Because Fund expenses may vary, actual expenses may be greater
or less than those shown.  The assumed 5% return is hypothetical  and should not
be considered a representation  of past or future returns,  which may be greater
or less than the assumed amount.

PERFORMANCE OF THE INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS

     The  following  tables  present  the return on  investment  for each of the
Investment  Accounts.  The return on investment  figures in the first and second
tables (including charges) represents a change in an Accumulation Unit allocated
to an Investment Account and takes into account Variable Account charges such as
the  mortality  and expense  risk  charge,  withdrawal  charges,  and a pro-rata
portion of the  administrative  charge.  The return on investment figures in the
third table  (excluding  charges) include the mortality and expense risk charge,
but do not reflect the deduction of withdrawal  charges or a pro-rata portion of
the administrative  charge. For the periods that a particular Investment Account
has been in operation (see the Inception Date of Investment Account column), the
figures represent actual performance. Therefore, the performance figures for the
one year and three year  periods  ending  12/31/00  and the Lessor of 5 Years or
Since Inception represent actual  performance.  For the periods that precede the
creation  of  the  Investment  Account,  if the  mutual  fund  portfolio  was in
existence  (see  Inception  Date  of  Mutual  Fund  column),  results  represent
hypothetical   returns  that  the   Investment   Accounts  that  invest  in  the
corresponding  Mutual Fund  Portfolios  would have achieved had they invested in
such Portfolios for the periods indicated.  Therefore,  the performance  figures
for the 5 year  period  ending  12/31/00,  and the  Lessor  of 10 Years or Since
Inception may be hypothetical,  or they may represent actual performance,  based
on the  inception  date of a particular  Investment  Account and the mutual fund
portfolio.

INFORMATION ABOUT AUL, THE VARIABLE ACCOUNT, AND THE FUNDS

AMERICAN UNITED LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY(R) 

     AUL is a stock  insurance  company  existing under the laws of the State of
Indiana.  It was originally  incorporated as a fraternal  society on November 7,
1877, under the laws of the Federal  government,  and reincorporated as a mutual
insurance  company  under  the laws of the  State  of  Indiana  in  1933.  It is
qualified to do business in 49 states and the District of Columbia.  AUL has its
principal business office located at One American Square, Indianapolis,  Indiana
46282.                                                                          

     On December 17, 2000, AUL converted from a mutual life insurance company to
a stock life insurance company ultimately controlled by a mutual holding company
("Mutual  Holding  Company").  This  transaction  was  intended  to  result in a
corporate structure that provides, among other things, better access to external
sources of capital.  Upon conversion,  the insurance company issued voting stock
to a  newly-formed  stock  holding  company  ("Stock  Holding  Company").  It is
anticipated  that the Stock Holding  Company could,  at some future time,  offer
shares of its stock publicly or privately;  however,  the Mutual Holding Company
must always hold at least 51% of the voting stock of the Stock Holding  Company,
which  in turn  owns  100% of the  voting  stock  of AUL.  No  plans  have  been
formulated to issue any shares of capital stock or debt  securities of the Stock
Holding Company at this time.                                                   

     Since  AUL  was  previously  a  mutual  life  insurance   company,   owners
("policyholders")  of  AUL's  annuity  contracts  and  life  insurance  policies
("policies") had certain membership  interests in AUL consisting  principally of
the right to vote on the election of the Board of Directors and on other matters
and certain rights upon liquidation or dissolution of AUL. After the conversion,
policyholders continue to be policyholders in the same insurance company, but no
longer  have  a  membership   interest  in  the   insurance   company;   rather,
policyholders  have  substantially  the same membership  interests in the Mutual
Holding  Company.  After the conversion,  persons who acquire  policies from AUL
automatically  become members in the Mutual Holding Company. The conversion does
not, in any way,  increase premium  payments or reduce policy benefits,  values,
guarantees or other policy  obligations  to  policyholders.  The  conversion was
approved  by AUL  policyholders  and  the  Insurance  Commissioner  of  Indiana.
Following the conversion, the insurance company name did not change. The name of
the Mutual Holding Company is American United Mutual Insurance  Holding Company.
The name of the Stock Holding Company is OneAmerica Financial Partners, Inc.    

     AUL  conducts a  conventional  life  insurance,  reinsurance,  and  annuity
business.  At December 31, 2000, AUL had assets of $10,932,623,000 and equity of
$847,568,000.                                                                   

     The principal  underwriter  for the  Contracts is AUL,  which is registered
with the SEC as a broker-dealer.                                                

VARIABLE ACCOUNT 

     AUL  American  Individual  Unit Trust was  established  by AUL on April 14,
1994,  under  procedures  established  under Indiana law. The income,  gains, or
losses of the Variable  Account are credited to or charged against the assets of
the Variable  Account  without regard to other income,  gains, or losses of AUL.
Assets  in  the  Variable  Account   attributable  to  the  reserves  and  other
liabilities under the Contracts are not chargeable with liabilities arising from
any other  business  that AUL  conducts.  AUL owns the  assets  in the  Variable
Account and is required to maintain sufficient assets in the Variable Account to
meet all Variable Account  obligations under the Contracts.  AUL may transfer to
its General Account assets that exceed  anticipated  obligations of the Variable
Account.  All  obligations  arising under the  Contracts  are general  corporate
obligations of AUL. AUL may invest its own assets in the Variable  Account,  and
may  accumulate  in the Variable  Account  proceeds  from  Contract  charges and
investment results applicable to those assets.                                  

     The Variable Account is currently divided into sub-accounts  referred to as
Investment  Accounts.  Each Investment Account invests  exclusively in shares of
one of the Funds.  Premiums may be allocated to one or more Investment  Accounts
available  under  a  Contract.  AUL  may  in  the  future  establish  additional
Investment  Accounts  of  the  Variable  Account,  which  may  invest  in  other
securities, mutual funds, or investment vehicles.                               

     The Variable  Account is registered with the SEC as a unit investment trust
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"). Registration with the
SEC does not involve  supervision by the SEC of the administration or investment
practices of the Variable Account or of AUL.                                    

THE FUNDS 

     Each of the Funds is a diversified,  open-end management investment company
commonly referred to as a mutual fund, or a portfolio thereof. Each of the Funds
is  registered  with the SEC  under  the 1940 Act.  Such  registration  does not
involve  supervision  by the SEC of the  investments  or investment  policies or
practices of the Fund. Each Fund has its own investment  objective or objectives
and policies.  The shares of a Fund are  purchased by AUL for the  corresponding
Investment  Account at the Fund's net asset value per share,  i.e.,  without any
sales load.  All dividends and capital gain  distributions  received from a Fund
are automatically  reinvested in such Fund at net asset value,  unless otherwise
instructed    by   AUL.   AUL   has   entered   into    agreements    with   the
Distributors/Advisers  of Alger  Management,  Inc.,  American  Century  Variable
Portfolios,  Inc., Calvert Variable Series, Inc., Fidelity Investments,  Pilgrim
Baxter & Associates,  and T. Rowe Price Equity

merger or acquisition,  or a reduction in industry  capacity that should lead to
improved  pricing;  companies  whose  earnings  potential  has  increased  or is
expected to increase more than generally perceived;  companies that have enjoyed
recent  market  popularity  but which appear to have  temporarily  fallen out of
favor for reasons that are considered non-recurring or short-term; and companies
that are  undervalued  in relation to securities of other  companies in the same
industry.

THE CONTRACTS 
GENERAL                                                                         

     The  Contracts  are offered for use in  connection  with non-tax  qualified
retirement  plans by an  individual.  The Contracts are also eligible for use in
connection   with  certain  tax  qualified   retirement   plans  that  meet  the
requirements of Sections 401, 403(b),  408 or 408A of the Internal Revenue Code.
Certain Federal tax advantages are currently  available to retirement plans that
qualify as (1)  self-employed  individuals'  retirement plans under Section 401,
such as HR-10  Plans,  (2) pension or  profit-sharing  plans  established  by an
employer for the benefit of its employees  under Section 401, (3) Section 403(b)
annuity  purchase  plans  for  employees  of  public  schools  or a  charitable,

 PREMIUMS AND CONTRACT VALUES DURING THE ACCUMULATION PERIOD

APPLICATION FOR A CONTRACT 

     Any person or, in the case of Qualified Plans, any qualified  organization,
wishing to purchase a Contract must submit an application and an initial premium
to AUL,  and provide any other form or  information  that AUL may  require.  AUL
reserves the right to reject an application  or premium for any reason,  subject
to AUL's underwriting standards and guidelines.                                 

PREMIUMS UNDER THE CONTRACTS 

     Premiums  under Flexible  Premium  Contracts may be made at any time during
the Contract Owner's life and before the Contract's  Annuity Date.  Premiums for
Flexible  Premium  Contracts  may vary in amount and  frequency but each premium
payment must be at least $50.  Premiums must accumulate a total of at least $300
each Contract Year for the first three  Contract  Years.  Premiums may not total
more than $12,000 in any one Contract Year unless otherwise agreed to by AUL.   

     For One Year Flexible  Premium  Contracts,  premiums may vary in amount and
frequency except that additional                                                

19

P-->485BPOS23rd�Page�of�65TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�23rd
premiums will only be accepted during the first Contract Year. Each such premium
payment must be at least $500;  premiums must total at least $5,000 in the first
Contract Year for non-qualified  plans and $2,000 in the first Contract Year for
qualified  plans,  and all premiums  combined may not exceed  $1,000,000  unless
otherwise agreed to by AUL.                                                     

     If the minimum premium amounts under Flexible  Premium or One Year Flexible
Premium  Contracts  are not met, AUL may,  after 60 days notice,  terminate  the
Contract  and pay an  amount  equal to the  Contract  Value  as of the  close of
business  on the  effective  date of  termination.  AUL may change  the  minimum
premiums permitted under a Contract,  and may waive any minimum required premium
at its discretion.                                                              

     Annual premiums under any Contract purchased in connection with a Qualified
Plan will be subject to maximum limits imposed by the Internal  Revenue Code and
possibly by the terms of the  Qualified  Plan.  See the  Statement of Additional
Information for a discussion of these limits or consult the pertinent  Qualified
Plan document. Such limits may change without notice.                           

     Initial  premiums  must be  credited to a Contract no later than the end of
the second  Business Day after it is received by AUL at its Home Office if it is
preceded  or  accompanied  by a  completed  application  that  contains  all the
information  necessary  for issuing the  Contract  and  properly  crediting  the
premium.  If AUL does not  receive a complete  application,  AUL will notify the
applicant that AUL does not have the necessary  information to issue a Contract.
If the  necessary  information  is not provided to AUL within five Business Days
after the Business Day on which AUL first receives an initial  premium or if AUL
determines  it cannot  otherwise  issue a Contract,  AUL will return the initial
premium to the  applicant,  unless  consent is  received  to retain the  initial
premium until the application is made complete.                                 

     Subsequent  premiums  (other than initial  premiums) are credited as of the
end of the  Valuation  Period  in  which  they are  received  by AUL at its Home
Office.                                                                         

FREE LOOK PERIOD 

     The Owner has the right to return the  Contract  for any reason  within the
Free Look Period which is a ten day period beginning when the Owner receives the
Contract.  If a  particular  state  requires  a longer  Free Look  Period,  then
eligible  Owners in that state will be allowed  the longer  statutory  period in
which to return the Contract.  The returned Contract will be deemed void and AUL
will refund the greater of (1) premium payments and (2) any Contract Value as of
the end of the  Valuation  Period in which AUL receives  the  Contract  plus any
amounts deducted for premium taxes.                                             

ALLOCATION OF PREMIUMS 

     Initial  premiums will be allocated  among the  Investment  Accounts of the
Variable  Account or to the Fixed Account as  instructed by the Contract  Owner.
Allocation  to the  Investment  Accounts  and the Fixed  Account must be made in
increments of 5% or 33 1/3%.                                                    

     A  Contract  Owner may change the  allocation  instructions  at any time by
giving Proper Notice of the change to AUL at its Home Office and such allocation
will  continue  in  effect  until  subsequently  changed.  Any  such  change  in
allocation  instructions  will  be  effective  upon  receipt  of the  change  in
allocation  instructions by AUL at its Home Office. Changes in the allocation of
future premiums have no effect on premiums already paid. Such amounts,  however,
may be transferred among the Investment  Accounts of the Variable Account or the
Fixed Account in the manner described in "Transfers of Account Value."

TRANSFERS OF ACCOUNT VALUE 

     All or part of an  Owner's  Contract  Value  may be  transferred  among the
Investment  Accounts of the Variable Account or to the Fixed Account at any time
during the  Accumulation  Period upon receipt of a proper written request by AUL
at its Home  Office.  The minimum  amount that may be  transferred  from any one
Investment Account is $500 or, if less than $500, the Owner's remaining Contract
Value in the Investment Account, provided however, that amounts transferred from
the Fixed Account to an Investment Account during any given Contract Year cannot
exceed  20% of the  Owner's  Fixed  Account  Value as of the  beginning  of that
Contract Year. If, after any transfer,  the Owner's remaining  Contract Value in
an Investment Account or in the Fixed Account would be less than $500, then such
request  will be treated  as a request  for a  transfer  of the entire  Contract
Value.  Currently,  there are no limitations on the number of transfers  between
Investment  Accounts  available  under  a  Contract  or the  Fixed  Account.  In
addition,  no charges are  currently  imposed upon  transfers.  AUL reserves the
right,  however,  at a future  date,  to change the  limitation  on the  minimum
transfer, to assess transfer charges, to change the limit on remaining balances,
to limit the number and  frequency  of  transfers,  and to suspend any  transfer
privileges.  If we determine  that the transfers  made by or on behalf of one or
more Owners are to the disadvantage of other Owners,  we may restrict the rights
of certain Owners.  We also reserve the right to limit the size of transfers and
remaining  balances,  to limit the number and  frequency  of  transfers,  and to
discontinue  telephone,  interactive voice response or internet based transfers.
Any  transfer  from an  Investment  Account  of the  Variable  Account  shall be
effected as of the end of the  Valuation  Date in which AUL receives the request
in proper form.  AUL has  established  procedures  to confirm that  instructions
communicated by telephone or via the internet are genuine, which include the use
of personal identification numbers and recorded telephone calls. Neither AUL nor
its agents,  will be liable for acting upon instructions  believed by AUL or its
agents to be genuine, provided AUL has complied with its procedures.            

     Part of a Contract Owner's Fixed Account Value may be transferred to one or
more Investment  Accounts of the Variable Account during the Accumulation Period
subject to certain limitations as described in "The Fixed Account."

DOLLAR COST AVERAGING PROGRAM 

     Owners who wish to purchase units of an Investment Account over a period of
time may do so through the Dollar Cost Averaging ("DCA") Program.  The theory of
dollar  cost  averaging  is that  greater  numbers  of  Accumulation  Units  are
purchased at times when the unit prices are  relatively  low                    

20

P-->485BPOS24th�Page�of�65TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�24th
than are  purchased  when the  prices  are  higher.  This has the  effect,  when
purchases are made at different  prices,  of reducing the aggregate average cost
per Accumulation  Unit to less than the average of the Accumulation  Unit prices
on the same purchase dates. However,  participation in the Dollar Cost Averaging
Program does not assure a Contract  Owner of greater  profits from the purchases
under the  Program,  nor will it prevent or  necessarily  alleviate  losses in a
declining market.                                                               

     For example, assume that a Contract Owner requests that $1,000 per month be
transferred from the Money Market Investment  Account to the AUL American Equity
Investment  Account.  The following table  illustrates the effect of dollar cost
averaging over a six month period.                                              

                                                                [Download Table]

              Transfer          Unit            Units  
Month          Amount           Value         Purchased

  1            $1,000            $20             50    
  2            $1,000            $25             40    
  3            $1,000            $30             33.333
  4            $1,000            $40             25    
  5            $1,000            $35             28.571
  6            $1,000            $30             33.333

The average  price per unit for these  purchases is the sum of the prices ($180)
divided by the number of monthly  transfers  (6) or $30.  The  average  cost per
Accumulation Unit for these purchases is the total amount  transferred  ($6,000)
divided by the total number of Accumulation Units purchased (210.237) or $28.54.
THIS TABLE IS FOR ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF FUTURE
RESULTS.                                                                        

     Under a DCA  Program,  the owner  deposits  premiums  into the AUL American
Money Market  Investment  Account and then authorizes AUL to transfer a specific
dollar  amount from the Money Market  Investment  Account into one or more other
Investment Accounts at the unit values determined on the dates of the transfers.
This may be done monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually. These transfers
will  continue  automatically  until  AUL  receives  notice to  discontinue  the
Program,  or until  there is not  enough  money in the Money  Market  Investment
Account to continue the Program, whichever occurs first.                        

     Currently,  the minimum required amount of each transfer is $500,  although
AUL  reserves the right to change this  minimum  transfer  amount in the future.
Transfers to or from the Fixed Account are not  permitted  under the Dollar Cost
Averaging  Program.  At least ten days advance written notice to AUL is required
before the date of the first proposed transfer under the DCA Program. AUL offers
the  Dollar  Cost  Averaging  Program  to  Contract  Owners at no charge and the
Company reserves the right to temporarily discontinue,  terminate, or change the
Program at any time.  Contract  Owners may change  the  frequency  of  scheduled
transfers, or may increase or decrease the amount of scheduled transfers, or may
discontinue participation in the Program at any time by providing written notice
to AUL,  provided that AUL must receive written notice of such a change at least
five days before a previously scheduled transfer is to occur.                   

     Contract Owners may initially elect to participate in the DCA Program,  and
if this  election is made at the time the  Contract is applied  for, the Program
will  take  effect  on the  first  monthly,  quarterly,  semi-annual,  or annual
transfer  date  following  the premium  receipt by AUL at its Home  Office.  The
Contract Owner may select the  particular  date of the month,  quarter,  or year
that the  transfers  are to be made and such  transfers  will  automatically  be
performed on such date,  provided  that such date  selected is a day that AUL is
open for business and provided  further that such date is a Valuation  Date.  If
the date  selected is not a Business  Day or is not a Valuation  Date,  then the
transfer will be made on the next  succeeding  Valuation Date. To participate in
the Program, a minimum deposit of $10,000 is required.                          

CONTRACT OWNER'S VARIABLE ACCOUNT VALUE 

ACCUMULATION UNITS 

     Premiums  allocated to the Investment  Accounts  available under a Contract
are credited to the Contract in the form of  Accumulation  Units.  The number of
Accumulation  Units to be credited is  determined  by dividing the dollar amount
allocated to the particular  Investment  Account by the Accumulation  Unit value
for the particular  Investment  Account as of the end of the Valuation Period in
which the premium is credited.  The number of Accumulation  Units so credited to
the  Contract  shall not be  changed by a  subsequent  change in the value of an
Accumulation  Unit, but the dollar value of an  Accumulation  Unit may vary from
Valuation Date to Valuation Date depending upon the investment experience of the
Investment Account and charges against the Investment Account.                  

ACCUMULATION UNIT VALUE 

     AUL determines the Accumulation  Unit value for each Investment  Account of
the Variable  Account on each Valuation  Date. The  Accumulation  Unit value for
each Investment  Account was initially set at one dollar $1 for the Money Market
Investment Account and $5 for all other Investment  Accounts.  Subsequently,  on
each Valuation Date, the Accumulation Unit value for each Investment  Account is
determined by multiplying the Net Investment  Factor determined as of the end of
the Valuation Date for the  particular  Investment  Account by the  Accumulation
Unit value for the Investment Account as of the immediately  preceding Valuation
Period.  The Accumulation  Unit value for each Investment  Account may increase,
decrease,  or remain  the same from  Valuation  Period  to  Valuation  Period in
accordance with the Net Investment Factor.                                      

NET INVESTMENT FACTOR 

     The Net Investment Factor is used to measure the investment  performance of
an Investment  Account from one Valuation Period to the next. For any Investment
Account for a Valuation  Period,  the Net  Investment  Factor is  determined  by
dividing (a) by (b) and then subtracting (c) from the result where:             

(a)  is equal to:                                                     

21

          (1)  the net asset value per share of the Fund in which the Investment
               Account  invests,  determined  as of the  end  of  the  Valuation
Period, plus                                      

          (2)  the per share  amount of any dividend or other  distribution,  if
              any, paid by the Fund during the Valuation Period, plus or minus

          (3)  a credit or charge with respect to taxes if any, paid or reserved
               for AUL during the Valuation Period that are determined by AUL to
               be  attributable  to  the  operation  of the  Investment  Account
               (although no Federal  income taxes are  applicable  under present
law and no such charge is currently assessed);    

     (b)  is the net asset value per share of the Fund  determined as of the end
of the preceding Valuation Period; and                      

     (c)  is a daily charge factor determined by AUL to reflect the fee assessed
          against the assets of the  Investment  Account for the  mortality  and
expense risk charge.                                        

 CASH WITHDRAWALS AND THE DEATH PROCEEDS

CASH WITHDRAWALS 

     During the lifetime of the  Annuitant,  at any time before the Annuity Date
and  subject  to  the  limitations  under  any  applicable  Qualified  Plan  and
applicable  law, a Contract may be  surrendered  or a partial  withdrawal may be
taken from a Contract. A surrender or withdrawal request will be effective as of
the end of the Valuation Date that a proper written request in a form acceptable
to AUL is received by AUL at its Home Office.                                   

     A full surrender of a Contract will result in a withdrawal payment equal to
the Owner's  Contract Value  allocated to the Variable  Account as of the end of
the Valuation Period during which a proper withdrawal request is received by AUL
at its Home Office, minus any applicable withdrawal charge. A partial withdrawal
may be  requested  for a  specified  percentage  or dollar  amount of an Owner's
Contract  Value. A request for a partial  withdrawal will result in a payment by
AUL equal to the  amount  specified  in the  partial  withdrawal  request.  Upon
payment,  the Owner's  Contract  Value will be reduced by an amount equal to the
payment and any applicable withdrawal charge.  Requests for a partial withdrawal
that would  leave a Contract  Value of less than $5000 for a  non-qualified  One
Year Flexible Premium  Contract ($2,000 for a qualified  contract) and less than
the required  cumulative minimum for a Flexible Premium Contract will be treated
as a request for a full surrender. AUL may change or waive this provision at its
discretion.                                                                     

     The minimum amount that may be withdrawn from a Contract  Owner's  Contract
Value is $200 for  Flexible  Premium  Contracts  and $500 for One Year  Flexible
Premium Contracts. If the remaining Contract Value is less than these amounts, a
request for a  withdrawal  will be treated as a surrender  of the  Contract.  In
addition,  the  Contracts may be issued in  connection  with certain  retirement
programs that are subject to constraints on withdrawals and full surrenders.    

     The  amount  of a  partial  withdrawal  will be taken  from the  Investment
Accounts and the Fixed Account as instructed, and if the Owner does not specify,
in proportion to the Owner's Contract Value in the various  Investment  Accounts
and the Fixed Account.  A partial  withdrawal  will not be effected until proper
instructions are received by AUL at its Home Office.                            

     A  surrender  or a partial  withdrawal  may  result in the  deduction  of a
withdrawal  charge  and may be  subject  to a premium  tax charge for any tax on
premiums that may be imposed by various states and municipalities.  See "Premium
Tax Charge." A surrender or withdrawal  that results in receipt of proceeds by a
Contract  Owner may result in receipt of taxable  income to the  Contract  Owner
and, in some instances, a tax penalty. In addition,  distributions under certain
Qualified  Plans may result in a tax  penalty.  See "Tax Penalty For All Annuity
Contracts."  Owners of Contracts used in connection with a Qualified Plan should
refer to the  terms of the  applicable  Qualified  Plan for any  limitations  or
restrictions  on  cash  withdrawals.  The tax  consequences  of a  surrender  or
withdrawal under the Contracts should be carefully considered.  See "Federal Tax
Matters."

THE DEATH PROCEEDS 

     If a  Contract  Owner  dies at or after  age 76,  the  amount  of the Death
Proceeds is equal to the Contract  Owner's  Contract  Value as of the end of the
Valuation Period in which due proof of death and instructions  regarding payment
are  received by AUL at its Home  Office.  If a Contract  Owner or, as described
below, an Annuitant,  dies before age 76, the Death Proceeds will be the greater
of the Contract  Value as of the end of the Valuation  Period in which due proof
of death and  instructions  regarding  payment  are  received by AUL at its Home
Office or the value given by (a)-(b)-(c)+(d) where: (a) is the net premiums; (b)
is any amounts withdrawn  (including any withdrawal charges) prior to death; (c)
is the annual fees assessed  prior to death;  and (d) is the interest  earned on
(a)-(b)-(c), credited at an annual effective rate of 4% until the date of death.

DEATH OF THE OWNER 

     If the Contract  Owner dies before the Annuity Date and the  Beneficiary is
not the Contract Owner's  surviving  spouse,  the Death Proceeds will be paid to
the  Beneficiary.  Such Death  Proceeds  will be paid in a lump-sum,  unless the
Beneficiary  elects to have this value applied under a settlement  option.  If a
settlement  option is elected,  the Beneficiary  must be named the Annuitant and
payments must begin within one year of the Contract  Owner's  death.  The option
also must have payments  which are payable over the life of the  Beneficiary  or
over  a  period  which  does  not  extend  beyond  the  life  expectancy  of the
Beneficiary.                                                                    

     If the Contract  Owner dies before the Annuity Date and the  Beneficiary is
the Contract Owner's surviving spouse,  the surviving spouse will become the new
Contract  Owner.  The Contract will  continue  with its terms  unchanged and the

22

P-->485BPOS26th�Page�of�65TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�26th
Contract  Owner's  spouse will assume all rights as Contract  Owner.  Within 120
days of the original  Contract  Owner's death,  the Contract  Owner's spouse may
elect to receive  the Death  Proceeds  or  withdraw  any of the  Contract  Value
without any early withdrawal charge. However,  depending upon the circumstances,
a tax penalty may be imposed upon such a withdrawal.                            

     Any  amount  payable  under a  Contract  will not be less than the  minimum
required by the law of the state where the Contract is delivered.               

DEATH OF THE ANNUITANT 

     If the Annuitant dies before the Annuity Date and the Annuitant is not also
the Contract  Owner,  then: (1) if the Contract Owner is not an individual,  the
Death Proceeds will be paid to the Contract  Owner in a lump-sum;  or (2) if the
Contract Owner is an  individual,  a new Annuitant may be named and the Contract
will  continue.  If a new  Annuitant  is  not  named  within  120  days  of  the
Annuitant's death, the Contract Value, less any withdrawal charges, will be paid
to the Contract Owner in a lump-sum.                                            

     The death benefit will be paid to the  Beneficiary  or Contract  Owner,  as
appropriate, in a single sum or under one of the Annuity Options, as directed by
the Contract Owner or as elected by the  Beneficiary.  If the  Beneficiary is to
receive  annuity  payments  under an Annuity  Option,  there may be limits under
applicable law on the amount and duration of payments that the  Beneficiary  may
receive, and requirements respecting timing of payments. A tax adviser should be
consulted in considering payout options.                                        

PAYMENTS FROM THE VARIABLE ACCOUNT 

     Payment of an amount from the Variable Account  resulting from a surrender,
partial  withdrawal,  transfer from an Owner's  Contract Value  allocated to the
Variable Account, or payment of the Death Proceeds, normally will be made within
seven days from the date a proper  request  is  received  at AUL's Home  Office.
However,  AUL can postpone the  calculation  or payment of such an amount to the
extent permitted under  applicable law, which is currently  permissible only for
any period:  (a) during  which the New York Stock  Exchange is closed other than
customary weekend and holiday closings; (b) during which trading on the New York
Stock  Exchange is  restricted,  as  determined  by the SEC; (c) during which an
emergency, as determined by the SEC, exists as a result of which (1) disposal of
securities held by the Variable Account is not reasonably practicable, or (2) it
is not  reasonably  practicable  to  determine  the  value of the  assets of the
Variable  Account;  or (d) for such other periods as the SEC may by order permit
for the protection of investors. For information concerning payment of an amount
from the Fixed Account, see "The Fixed Account."

CHARGES AND DEDUCTIONS

PREMIUM TAX CHARGE 

     Various  states and  municipalities  impose a tax on  premiums  received by
insurance  companies.  Whether or not a premium tax is imposed will depend upon,
among other things,  the Owner's state of residence,  the  Annuitant's  state of
residence,  the insurance tax laws, and AUL's status in a particular  state. AUL
assesses a premium  tax charge to  reimburse  itself for  premium  taxes that it
incurs. This charge will be deducted as premium taxes are incurred by AUL, which
is usually when an annuity is effected.  Premium tax rates  currently range from
0% to 3.5%, but are subject to change.                                          

WITHDRAWAL CHARGE 

     No  deduction  for sales  charges  is made from  premiums  for a  Contract.
However,  if a cash  withdrawal  is made or the Contract is  surrendered  by the
Owner,  then depending on the type of Contract,  a withdrawal  charge (which may
also be referred to as a contingent  deferred sales charge),  may be assessed by
AUL on the amount  withdrawn if the  Contract  has not been in  existence  for a
certain period of time. An amount  withdrawn  during a Contract Year referred to
as the Free  Withdrawal  Amount will not be subject to an  otherwise  applicable
withdrawal  charge.  The Free Withdrawal  Amount is 12% of the Contract Value at
the time of the first withdrawal in any Contract Year in which the withdrawal is
being  made.  Any  transfer  of  Contract  Value  from the Fixed  Account to the
Variable  Account  will  reduce  the  Free  Withdrawal   Amount  by  the  amount
transferred.  The chart below  illustrates  the amount of the withdrawal  charge
that applies to both  variations of Contracts  based on the number of years that
the Contract has been in existence.

     In no event will the  amount of any  withdrawal  charge,  when added to any
withdrawal  charges  previously  assessed  against any amount  withdrawn  from a
Contract,  exceed 8.5% of the total premiums paid on a Flexible Premium Contract
or 8% of the total  premiums paid on a One Year Flexible  Premium  Contract.  In
addition,  no withdrawal  charge will be imposed upon payment of Death  Proceeds
under the Contract.                                                             

23

P-->485BPOS27th�Page�of�65TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�27th
     A withdrawal charge may be assessed upon annuitization of a Contract. For a
Flexible Premium Contract, no withdrawal charge will apply if the Contract is in
its fifth  Contract  Year or later and a life  annuity or  survivorship  annuity
option is selected.  For a One Year  Flexible  Premium  Contract,  no withdrawal
charge will apply if a life annuity or survivorship option is selected or if the
Contract is in its fourth Contract Year or later and the fixed income option for
a period of 10 or more years is chosen.  Otherwise,  the withdrawal  charge will
apply.                                                                          

     The withdrawal  charge will be used to recover certain expenses relating to
sales of the Contracts,  including commissions paid to sales personnel and other
promotional costs. AUL reserves the right to increase or decrease the withdrawal
charge  for any  Contracts  established  on or after the  effective  date of the
change,  but the  withdrawal  charge will not exceed 8.5% of the total  premiums
paid on a Flexible  Premium  Contract or 8% of the total  premiums paid on a One
Year Flexible Premium Contract.                                                 

MORTALITY AND EXPENSE RISK CHARGE 

     AUL deducts a daily charge from the assets of each  Investment  Account for
mortality  and expense  risks  assumed by AUL.  The charge is equal to an annual
rate of 1.25% of the average daily net assets of each Investment  Account.  This
amount is intended to compensate AUL for certain mortality and expense risks AUL
assumes in  offering  and  administering  the  Contracts  and in  operating  the
Variable Account.  The 1.25% charge is based on original  estimates of 0.40% for
expense risk and 0.85% for mortality risk.                                      

     The  expense  risk is the risk that AUL's  actual  expenses  in issuing and
administering the Contracts and operating the Variable Account will be more than
the charges  assessed for such expenses.  The mortality risk borne by AUL is the
risk that the Annuitants,  as a group, will live longer than the AUL's actuarial
tables  predict.  AUL may  ultimately  realize a profit  from this charge to the
extent it is not needed to address mortality and  administrative  expenses,  but
AUL may realize a loss to the extent the charge is not  sufficient.  AUL may use
any  profit  derived  from this  charge for any lawful  purpose,  including  any
distribution expenses not covered by the withdrawal charge.                     

ANNUAL CONTRACT FEE 

     AUL deducts an Annual  Contract fee from each Owner's  Contract Value equal
to the lesser of 2.0% of the Contract Value or $30 per year. The fee is assessed
every  year  on a  Contract  if  the  Contract  is in  effect  on  the  Contract
Anniversary,  and is assessed only during the  Accumulation  Period.  The Annual
Contract fee is waived on each Contract  Anniversary when the Contract Value, at
the time the charge would otherwise have been imposed,  exceeds $50,000.  When a
Contract  Owner  annuitizes  or  surrenders  on any day  other  than a  Contract
Anniversary,  a pro rata portion of the charge for that portion of the year will
not be assessed. The charge is deducted  proportionately from the Contract Value
allocated  among the Investment  Accounts and the Fixed Account.  The purpose of
this fee is to reimburse AUL for the expenses  associated with administration of
the  Contracts  and  operation of the Variable  Account.  AUL does not expect to
profit from this fee.                                                           

OTHER CHARGES 

     AUL may charge the  Investment  Accounts  of the  Variable  Account for the
federal,  state, or local income taxes incurred by AUL that are  attributable to
the Variable  Account and its Investment  Accounts.  No such charge is currently
assessed.                                                                       

VARIATIONS IN CHARGES 

     AUL  may  reduce  or  waive  the  amount  of  the  withdrawal   charge  and
administrative charge for a Contract where the expenses associated with the sale
of the Contract or the  administrative  costs  associated  with the Contract are
reduced. For example, the withdrawal and/or administrative charge may be reduced
in connection  with  acquisition of the Contract in exchange for another annuity
contract  issued by AUL. AUL may also reduce or waive the withdrawal  charge and
administrative  charge on Contracts sold to the directors or employees of AUL or
any of its affiliates or to directors or any employees of any of the Funds.     

GUARANTEE OF CERTAIN CHARGES 

     AUL  guarantees  that the  mortality  and  expense  risk  charge  shall not
increase.  AUL may  increase  the Annual  Contract  fee,  but only to the extent
necessary  to  recover  the  expenses  associated  with  administration  of  the
Contracts and operations of the Variable Account.                               

EXPENSES OF THE FUNDS 

     Each Investment Account of the Variable Account purchases shares at the net
asset  value  of the  corresponding  Fund.  The net  asset  value  reflects  the
investment  advisory fee and other expenses that are deducted from the assets of
the Fund. The advisory fees and other expenses are not fixed or specified  under
the terms of the Contract and are described in the Funds' Prospectuses.         

ANNUITY PERIOD
GENERAL                                                                         

     On the Annuity Date, the adjusted  value of the Owner's  Contract Value may
be applied to provide an annuity under one of the options  described  below. The
adjusted  value will be equal to the value of the Owner's  Contract  Value as of
the Annuity Date,  reduced by any applicable  premium or similar taxes,  and any
applicable  withdrawal  charge.  For a Flexible Premium Contract,  no withdrawal
charge will apply if the Contract is in its fifth  Contract  Year or later and a
life annuity or survivorship annuity option is selected. For a One Year Flexible
Premium  Contract,  no  withdrawal  charge  will  apply  if a  life  annuity  or
survivorship  annuity  option is  selected  or if the  Contract is in its fourth
Contract  Year or later and the fixed  income  option for a period of 10 or more
years is chosen. Otherwise, the withdrawal charge will apply.                   

24

P-->485BPOS28th�Page�of�65TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�28th
     The Contracts  provide for three Annuity  Options,  any one of which may be
elected, except as otherwise noted. A lump-sum distribution may also be elected.
Other Annuity  Options may be available  upon request at the  discretion of AUL.
All Annuity  Options are fixed and the annuity  payments  are based upon annuity
rates that vary with the Annuity  Option  selected and the age of the  Annuitant
(as  adjusted),  except  that in the case of  Option 1, the  Income  for a Fixed
Period Option,  age is not a consideration.  The annuity rates are based upon an
assumed  interest  rate of 3%,  compounded  annually.  Generally,  if no Annuity
Option has been selected for a Contract Owner,  annuity payments will be made to
the Annuitant under Option 2, the life annuity with 120 guaranteed payments. For
Contracts used in connection  with certain  Employee  Benefit Plans and employer
sponsored 403(b)  programs,  annuity payments to Contract Owners who are married
will be made under  Option 3, with the  Contract  Owner's  spouse as  contingent
Annuitant,  unless the Contract  Owner  otherwise  elects and obtains his or her
spouse's consent.                                                               

     Once annuity payments have commenced, a Contract Owner cannot surrender his
or her  annuity  and receive a lump-sum  settlement  in lieu  thereof and cannot
change the Annuity Option. If, under any option,  monthly payments are less than
$100 each,  AUL has the right to make  either a lump-sum  settlement  or to make
larger payments on a less frequent basis.  AUL also reserves the right to change
the minimum payment amount.                                                     

Annuity payments will begin as of the Annuity Date.                   

     A Contract Owner may designate an Annuity Date, Annuity Option,  contingent
Annuitant,  and Beneficiary on an Annuity Election Form that must be received by
AUL at its  Home  Office  prior  to the  Annuity  Date.  AUL  may  also  require
additional  information before annuity payments commence.  If the Contract Owner
is an individual,  the Annuitant may be changed at any time prior to the Annuity
Date. The Annuitant  must also be an individual and must be the Contract  Owner,
or someone chosen from among the Contract  Owner's  spouse,  parents,  brothers,
sisters, and children.  Any other choice requires AUL's consent. If the Contract
Owner is not an  individual,  a change in the  Annuitant  will not be  permitted
without AUL's consent.  The Beneficiary,  if any, may be changed at any time and
the Annuity Date and Annuity Option may also be changed at any time prior to the
Annuity Date. For Contracts used in connection with a Qualified Plan,  reference
should  be made to the terms of the  Qualified  Plan for  pertinent  limitations
regarding annuity dates and options.  To help ensure timely receipt of the first
annuity payment, a transfer of a Contract Owner's Contract Value in the Variable
Account  should be made to the  Fixed  Account  at least two weeks  prior to the
Annuity Date.                                                                   

ANNUITY OPTIONS 

OPTION 1 - INCOME FOR A FIXED PERIOD 

     An annuity  payable  monthly for a fixed period (not more than 20 years) as
elected,  with the guarantee  that if, at the death of the  Annuitant,  payments
have been made for less than the selected fixed period, annuity payments will be
continued during the remainder of said period to the Beneficiary.               

OPTION 2 - LIFE ANNUITY 

     An annuity  payable  monthly during the lifetime of the Annuitant that ends
with the last  monthly  payment  before  the death of the  Annuitant.  A minimum
number of  payments  can be  guaranteed  such as 120 or the  number of  payments
required to refund the proceeds applied.                                        

OPTION 3 - SURVIVORSHIP ANNUITY 

     An annuity  payable monthly during the lifetime of the Annuitant and, after
the death of the Annuitant, an amount equal to 50%, or 100% (as specified in the
election) of such annuity, will be paid to the contingent Annuitant named in the
election if and so long as such contingent Annuitant lives.                     

     An  election  of this  option is  automatically  cancelled  if  either  the
Contract  Owner or the  contingent  Annuitant  dies  before  the  Annuity  Date.

SELECTION OF AN OPTION 
Contract  Owners  should  carefully  review the Annuity  Options with their
financial or tax  advisers.  For Contracts  used in connection  with a Qualified
Plan, reference should be made to the terms of the applicable Qualified Plan for
pertinent limitations  respecting the form of annuity payments, the commencement
of  distributions,  and other matters.  For instance,  annuity  payments under a
Qualified  Plan  generally must begin no later than April 1 of the calendar year
following  the calendar  year in which the Contract  Owner reaches age 70 1/2 if
the  Participant  is no longer  employed.  For Option 1, the period  elected for
receipt of annuity  payments under the terms of the Annuity Option generally may
be no longer than the joint life  expectancy of the Annuitant and Beneficiary in
the year that the  Annuitant  reaches  age 70 1/2 and must be shorter  than such
joint life expectancy if the  Beneficiary is not the  Annuitant's  spouse and is
more than 10 years younger than the Annuitant. Under Option 3, if the contingent
Annuitant is not the  Annuitant's  spouse and is more than 10 years younger than
the Annuitant, the 100% election specified above may not be available.          

 THE FIXED ACCOUNT

     Contributions  or  transfers  to the  Fixed  Account  become  part of AUL's
General Account. The General Account is subject to regulation and supervision by
the Indiana  Insurance  Department as well as the insurance laws and regulations
of other  jurisdictions in which the Contracts are  distributed.  In reliance on
certain  exemptive and exclusionary  provisions,  interests in the Fixed Account
have not been  registered as securities  under the  Securities  Act of 1933 (the
"1933  Act")                                                                    

25

P-->485BPOS29th�Page�of�65TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�29th
and the Fixed Account has not been registered as an investment company under the
1940 Act.  Accordingly,  neither the Fixed Account nor any interests therein are
generally  subject to the  provisions  of the 1933 Act or the 1940 Act.  AUL has
been advised that the staff of the SEC has not reviewed the  disclosure  in this
Prospectus  relating to the Fixed  Account.  This  disclosure,  however,  may be
subject to certain  generally  applicable  provisions of the federal  securities
laws  relating  to the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  statements  made in the
Prospectus.  This  Prospectus  is  generally  intended to serve as a  disclosure
document  only for  aspects of a Contract  involving  the  Variable  Account and
contains  only  selected  information  regarding  the  Fixed  Account.  For more
information regarding the Fixed Account, see the Contract itself.               

INTEREST 

     A Contract  Owner's Fixed Account Value earns  interest at fixed rates that
are paid by AUL. The Account Value in the Fixed Account earns interest at one or
more interest rates  determined by AUL at its discretion and declared in advance
("Current  Rate"),  which are guaranteed to be at least an annual effective rate
of 3% ("Guaranteed  Rate"). AUL will determine a Current Rate from time to time,
and any Current  Rate that exceeds the  Guaranteed  Rate will be in effect for a
period of at least one year.  If AUL  determines a Current Rate in excess of the
Guaranteed  Rate,  premiums  allocated or transfers to the Fixed Account under a
Contract  during the time the Current Rate is in effect are  guaranteed  to earn
interest at that particular Current Rate for at least one year.                 

     Amounts  contributed  or  transferred to the Fixed Account earn interest at
the Current Rate then in effect.  If AUL changes the Current Rate,  such amounts
contributed  or  transferred  on or after the effective  date of the change earn
interest at the new Current Rate;  however,  amounts  contributed or transferred
prior to the effective date of the change may earn interest at the prior Current
Rate or other  Current Rate  determined  by AUL.  Therefore,  at any given time,
various  portions  of a  Contract  Owner's  Fixed  Account  Value may be earning
interest at different  Current  Rates for different  periods of time,  depending
upon when such portions were originally  contributed or transferred to the Fixed
Account. AUL bears the investment risk for Contract Owner's Fixed Account Values
and for paying  interest at the Current  Rate on amounts  allocated to the Fixed
Account.                                                                        

WITHDRAWALS 

     A Contract Owner may make a full surrender or a partial withdrawal from his
or her Fixed  Account Value  subject to the  provisions of the Contract.  A full
surrender of a Contract  Owner's Fixed Account Value will result in a withdrawal
payment equal to the value of the Contract Owner's Fixed Account Value as of the
day the surrender is effected, minus any applicable withdrawal charge. A partial
withdrawal  may be requested for a specified  percentage or dollar amount of the
Contract Owner's Fixed Account Value. For a further discussion of surrenders and
partial  withdrawals  as generally  applicable  to a Contract  Owner's  Variable
Account Value and Fixed Account Value, see "Cash Withdrawals."

TRANSFERS 

     A Contract  Owner's Fixed Account Value may be  transferred  from the Fixed
Account to the  Variable  Account  subject to certain  limitations.  The minimum
amount that may be  transferred  from the Fixed Account is $500 or, if the Fixed
Account  Value is less  than $500  after  the  transfer,  the  Contract  Owner's
remaining  Fixed  Account  Value.  If the amount  remaining in the Fixed Account
after  a  transfer  would  be less  than  $500,  the  remaining  amount  will be
transferred with the amount that has been requested. The maximum amount that may
be  transferred  in any one  Contract  Year is the  lesser of 20% of a  Contract
Owner's Fixed Account  Value as of the last Contract  Anniversary  preceding the
request,  or the Contract Owner's entire Fixed Account Value if it would be less
than $500 after the transfer.  Transfers and  withdrawals of a Contract  Owner's
Fixed  Account  Value  will be  effected  on a last-in  first-out  basis.  For a
discussion of transfers as generally  applicable to a Contract  Owner's Variable
Account Value and Fixed Account Value, see "Transfers of Account Value."

CONTRACT CHARGES 

     The withdrawal charge will be the same for amounts surrendered or withdrawn
from a Contract  Owner's  Fixed  Account  Value as for  amounts  surrendered  or
withdrawn  from a Contract  Owner's  Variable  Account Value.  In addition,  the
annual fee will be the same whether or not a Owner's Contract Value is allocated
to the  Variable  Account or the Fixed  Account.  The charge for  mortality  and
expense risks will not be assessed  against the Fixed  Account,  and any amounts
that AUL pays for income taxes  allocable  to the  Variable  Account will not be
charged against the Fixed Account. In addition, the investment advisory fees and
operating  expenses paid by the Funds will not be paid directly or indirectly by
Contract  Owners to the  extent the  Contract  Value is  allocated  to the Fixed
Account;  however,  such Contract  Owners will not participate in the investment
experience of the Variable Account. See "Charges and Deductions."

PAYMENTS FROM THE FIXED ACCOUNT 

     Surrenders,  withdrawals,  and transfers from the Fixed Account and payment
of Death  Proceeds  based upon a Contract  Owner's  Fixed  Account  Value may be
delayed for up to six months after a written  request in proper form is received
by AUL at its Home  Office.  During  the  period of  deferral,  interest  at the
applicable  interest  rate or rates will continue to be credited to the Contract
Owner's Fixed Account Value.

MORE ABOUT THE CONTRACTS

DESIGNATION AND CHANGE OF BENEFICIARY 

     The Beneficiary  designation  contained in an application for the Contracts
will remain in effect until  changed.  The interests of a  Beneficiary  who dies
before the Contract  Owner will pass to any  surviving  Beneficiary,  unless the
Contract Owner specifies otherwise.  Unless otherwise provided, if no designated
Beneficiary  is living upon the death of the Contract Owner prior to the Annuity
Date, the Contract Owner's estate is the Beneficiary. Unless otherwise provided,
if no designated Beneficiary under an Annuity Option is living after the Annuity
Date,  upon the death of the  Annuitant,  the Owner is the  Beneficiary.  If the
Contract Owner is not an individual, the Contract Owner will be the Beneficiary.

     Subject  to  the  rights  of an  irrevocably  designated  Beneficiary,  the
designation  of a  Beneficiary  may be  changed or revoked at any time while the
Contract Owner is living by filing with AUL a written beneficiary designation or
revocation in such form as AUL may require. The change or revocation will not be
binding upon AUL until it is received by AUL at its Home  Office.  When it is so
received, the change or revocation will be effective as of the date on which the
beneficiary  designation or revocation was signed,  but the change or revocation
will be without  prejudice to AUL if any payment has been made or any action has
been taken by AUL prior to receiving the change or revocation.                  

     For Contracts issued in connection with Qualified  Plans,  reference should
be  made  to the  terms  of the  particular  Qualified  Plan,  if  any,  and any
applicable  law  for  any  restrictions  on  the  beneficiary  designation.  For
instance,  under an  Employee  Benefit  Plan,  the  Beneficiary  (or  contingent
Annuitant) must be the Contract Owner's spouse if the Contract Owner is married,
unless the spouse  properly  consents to the  designation  of a Beneficiary  (or
contingent Annuitant) other than the spouse.                                    

ASSIGNABILITY 

     A Contract  Owner may  assign a  Contract,  but the rights of the  Contract
Owner and any  Beneficiary  will be secondary to the  interests of the assignee.
AUL assumes no responsibility for the validity of an assignment.  Any assignment
will not be binding  upon AUL until  received  in  writing  at its Home  Office.
Because an assignment may be a taxable event,  Contract  Owners should consult a
tax advisor as to the tax consequences resulting from such an assignment.       

     However,  under certain  Qualified  Plans,  no benefit or privilege under a
Contract may be sold, assigned,  discounted, or pledged as collateral for a loan
or as security for the  performance of an obligation or for any other purpose to
any person or entity other than AUL.                                            

PROOF OF AGE AND SURVIVAL 

     AUL may require  proof of age, sex, or survival of any person on whose life
annuity payments depend.                                                        

MISSTATEMENTS 

     If the  age or  sex  of an  Annuitant  or  contingent  Annuitant  has  been
misstated,  the  correct  amount  paid or  payable  by AUL  shall be such as the
Contract would have provided for the correct age and sex.                       

ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PREMIUMS 

     AUL  reserves  the right to refuse to accept new premiums for a Contract at
any time.                                                                       

 FEDERAL TAX MATTERS
INTRODUCTION                                                                    

     The  Contracts  described  in  this  Prospectus  are  designed  for  use in
connection with non-tax  qualified  retirement plans for individuals and for use
by  individuals  in connection  with  retirement  plans under the  provisions of
Sections 401,  403(b),  457, 408 or 408A of the Internal  Revenue Code ("Code").
The  ultimate  effect of Federal  income  taxes on values  under a Contract,  on
annuity payments, and on the economic benefits to the Owner, the Annuitant,  and
the  Beneficiary or other payee,  may depend upon the type of Qualified Plan for
which  the  Contract  is  purchased  and a  number  of  different  factors.  The
discussion  contained  herein and in the Statement of Additional  Information is
general in nature.  It is based upon AUL's  understanding of the present Federal
income  tax  laws as  currently  interpreted  by the  Internal  Revenue  Service
("IRS"),  and is not intended as tax advice. No representation is made regarding
the likelihood of  continuation of the present Federal income tax laws or of the
current  interpretations  by the IRS.  Future  legislation  may  affect  annuity
contracts  adversely.  Moreover,  no attempt is made to consider any  applicable
state or other laws.  Because of the  inherent  complexity  of such laws and the
fact that tax results will vary according to the terms of the Qualified Plan and
the   particular   circumstances   of  the  individual   involved,   any  person
contemplating the purchase of a Contract,  or receiving annuity payments under a
Contract, should consult a qualified tax adviser.                               

AUL DOES NOT MAKE ANY GUARANTEE  REGARDING THE TAX STATUS OF ANY CONTRACT OR ANY
TRANSACTION INVOLVING THE CONTRACTS. CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR.                  

DIVERSIFICATION STANDARDS 

     Treasury Department  regulations under Section 817(h) of the Code prescribe
asset  diversification  requirements  which  are  expected  to  be  met  by  the
investment companies whose shares are sold to the Investment  Accounts.  Failure
to meet these requirements would jeopardize the tax status of the Contracts. See
the Statement of Additional Information for additional details.                 

     In   connection   with   the   issuance   of  the   regulations   governing
diversification  under  Section  817(h) of the  Code,  the  Treasury  Department
announced  that it would issue  future  regulations  or rulings  addressing  the
circumstances in which a variable contract owner's control of the investments of

27

P-->485BPOS31st�Page�of�65TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�31st
a separate  account may cause the  contract  owner,  rather  than the  insurance
company, to be treated as the owner of the assets held by the separate account. 

     If the variable  contract  owner is considered  the owner of the securities
underlying the separate  account,  income and gains produced by those securities
would be included currently in a contract owner's gross income. It is not clear,
at present,  what these regulations or rulings may provide.  It is possible that
when the  regulations  or  rulings  are  issued,  the  Contracts  may need to be
modified  in order to remain  in  compliance.  AUL  intends  to make  reasonable
efforts to comply  with any such  regulations  or rulings so that the  Contracts
will be  treated as annuity  contracts  for  Federal  income  tax  purposes  and
reserves  the  right  to make  such  changes  as it deems  appropriate  for that
purpose.                                                                        

TAXATION OF ANNUITIES IN GENERAL - NON-QUALIFIED PLANS 

     Section  72 of the Code  governs  taxation  of  annuities.  In  general,  a
Contract  Owner is not taxed on  increases  in value  under an annuity  contract
until  some form of  distribution  is made  under  the  contract.  However,  the
increase in value may be subject to tax currently  under certain  circumstances.
See  "Contracts  Owned  by  Non-Natural   Persons"  below  and  "Diversification
Standards" above.                                                               

1. Surrenders or Withdrawals Prior to the Annuity Date                      

     Code  Section 72 provides  that  amounts  received  upon a total or partial
surrender or withdrawal from a contract prior to the annuity date generally will
be treated as gross  income to the  extent  that the cash value of the  contract
(determined  without  regard  to any  surrender  charge in the case of a partial
withdrawal)   exceeds  the  "investment  in  the  contract."  In  general,   the
"investment  in the contract" is that portion,  if any, of premiums paid under a
contract less any distributions  received previously under the contract that are
excluded  from the  recipient's  gross income.  The taxable  portion is taxed at
ordinary income tax rates.  For purposes of this rule, a pledge or assignment of
a contract is treated as a payment  received on account of a partial  withdrawal
of a  contract.  Similarly,  loans  under a contract  generally  are  treated as
distributions under the contract.                                               

2. Surrenders or Withdrawals on or after the Annuity Date                 

     Upon  receipt of a lump-sum  payment,  the  recipient  is taxed if the cash
value of the contract exceeds the investment in the contract.                   

3. Amounts received as an Annuity                                         

     For amounts received as an Annuity,  the taxable portion of each payment is
determined by using a formula known as the "exclusion  ratio," which establishes
the ratio that the investment in the contract bears to the total expected amount
of annuity payments for the term of the contract.  That ratio is then applied to
each payment to determine the non-taxable portion of the payment. That remaining
portion of each payment is taxed at ordinary  income rates.  Once the excludible
portion of annuity  payments to date equals the investment in the contract,  the
balance of the annuity payments will be fully taxable.                          

     Withholding  of Federal income taxes on all  distributions  may be required
unless a recipient who is eligible  elects not to have any amounts  withheld and
properly  notifies AUL of that  election.  Special rules apply to withholding on
distributions  from  Employee  Benefit  Plans that are  qualified  under Section
401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.                                            

4. Penalty Tax on Certain Surrenders and Withdrawals                        

     With  respect to amounts  withdrawn  or  distributed  before the  recipient
reaches age 59 1/2, a penalty tax is imposed equal to 10% of the portion of such
amount which is  includible  in gross  income.  However,  the penalty tax is not
applicable to withdrawals: (1) made on or after the death of the owner (or where
the owner is not an  individual,  the death of the "primary  annuitant,"  who is
defined as the individual the events in whose life are of primary  importance in
affecting  the  timing  and  amount  of the  payout  under  the  contract);  (2)
attributable to the recipient's  becoming totally disabled within the meaning of
Code Section 72(m)(7);  or (3) which are part of a series of substantially equal
periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life
expectancy) of the recipient, or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of
the  recipient  and his  beneficiary.  The 10%  penalty  also  does not apply in
certain other circumstances described in Code Section 72.                       

     If the penalty tax does not apply to a surrender or  withdrawal as a result
of  the  application  of  item  (3)  above,  and  the  series  of  payments  are
subsequently modified (other than by reason of death or disability), the tax for
the first year in which the  modification  occurs will be increased by an amount
(determined in accordance with IRS regulations) equal to the tax that would have
been imposed but for item (3) above,  plus interest for the deferral period,  if
the  modification  takes place (a) before the close of the period  which is five
years from the date of the first payment and after the recipient  attains age 59
1/2, or (b) before the recipient reaches age 59 1/2.                            

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 

1. Distribution-at-Death Rules                                              

     In order to be treated as an annuity contract,  a contract must provide the
following two distribution  rules: (a) if the owner dies on or after the Annuity
Commencement  Date,  and before the entire  interest  in the  contract  has been
distributed,  the remaining  interest must be distributed at least as quickly as
the method in effect on the owner's death;  and (b) if the owner dies before the
Annuity Date, the entire  interest in the contract must generally be distributed
within  five  years  after the date of death,  or, if  payable  to a  designated
beneficiary,  must be annuitized over the life of that designated beneficiary or
over a period not  extending  beyond the life  expectancy  of that  beneficiary,
commencing  within  one  year  after  the date of  death  of the  owner.  If the
designated beneficiary is the spouse of the owner, the contract may be continued
in the name of the spouse as owner.                                             

     For purposes of determining the timing of distributions under the foregoing
rules, where the owner is not an                                                

28

P-->485BPOS32nd�Page�of�65TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�32nd
individual,  the primary  annuitant  is  considered  the owner.  In that case, a
change in the  primary  annuitant  will be  treated  as the death of the  owner.
Finally,  in the case of joint owners, the  distribution-at-death  rules will be
applied  by  treating  the death of the first  owner as the one to be taken into
account in determining  how generally  distributions  must commence,  unless the
sole surviving owner is the deceased owner's spouse.                            

2. Gift of Annuity Contracts                                                

     Generally, gifts of contracts (not purchased in connection with a Qualified
Plan) before the Annuity  Commencement  Date will trigger income tax on the gain
on the  contract,  with the donee  getting  a  stepped-up  basis for the  amount
included  in the  donor's  income.  This  provision  does not  apply to  certain
transfers  incident  to a  divorce.  The  10%  penalty  tax  on  pre-age  59 1/2
withdrawals and distributions and gift tax also may be applicable.              

3. Contracts Owned by Non-Natural Persons                                   

     If the contract is held by a non-natural person (for example, a corporation
in connection with its non-tax qualified deferred  compensation plan) the income
on that contract  (generally the net surrender value less the premium  payments)
is includible in taxable income each year.  Other taxes (such as the alternative
minimum tax and the  environmental  tax imposed under Code Section 59A) may also
apply. The rule does not apply where the contract is acquired by the estate of a
decedent, where the contract is held by certain types of retirement plans, where
the contract is a qualified funding asset for structured settlements,  where the
contract is purchased on behalf of an employee upon  termination  of an Employee
Benefit Plan, and in the case of a so-called immediate annuity. Code Section 457
(deferred  compensation)  plans for employees of state and local governments and
tax-exempt organizations are not within the purview of the exceptions.  However,
the income of state and local governments and tax-exempt organizations generally
is exempt from federal income tax.                                              

4. Multiple Contract Rule                                                   

     For  purposes  of  determining  the amount of any  distribution  under Code
Section 72(e)  (amounts not received as  annuities)  that is includable in gross
income,  all annuity  contracts  issued by the same insurer to the same contract
owner during any calendar year must be  aggregated  and treated as one contract.
Thus,  any  amount  received  under any such  contract  prior to the  contract's
Annuity Commencement Date, such as a partial surrender,  dividend, or loan, will
be taxable  (and  possibly  subject to the 10% penalty tax) to the extent of the
combined income in all such contracts.  In addition, the Treasury Department has
broad  regulatory  authority in applying this provision to prevent  avoidance of
the purposes of this new rule.                                                  

QUALIFIED PLANS 

     The Contract may be used with certain types of Qualified Plans as described
under  "The  Contracts."  The  tax  rules  applicable  to  participants  in such
Qualified  Plans vary according to the type of plan and the terms and conditions
of the plan  itself.  No attempt is made  herein to  provide  more than  general
information  about the use of the Contract  with the various  types of Qualified
Plans. Contract Owners,  Annuitants,  and Beneficiaries,  are cautioned that the
rights of any person to any benefits under such Qualified  Plans will be subject
to the terms  and  conditions  of the plans  themselves  and may be  limited  by
applicable law, regardless of the terms and conditions of the Contract issued in
connection therewith.  For example, AUL may accept beneficiary  designations and
payment  instructions  under the  terms of the  Contract  without  regard to any
spousal consents that may be required under the Code or the Employee  Retirement
Income  Securities  Act of 1974  ("ERISA").  Consequently,  a  Contract  Owner's
Beneficiary designation or elected payment option may not be enforceable.       

   The  following  are brief  descriptions  of the various  types of Qualified
Plans and the use of the Contract therewith:                                    

1. Individual Retirement Annuities                                          

     Code  Section  408  permits an  eligible  individual  to  contribute  to an
individual  retirement  program  through the purchase of  Individual  Retirement
Annuities ("IRAs"). The Contract may be purchased as an IRA. IRAs are subject to
limitations  on the  amount  that may be  contributed,  the  persons  who may be
eligible,  and on the time when distributions must commence.  Depending upon the
circumstances  of the  individual,  contributions  to an IRA  may be  made  on a
deductible or non-deductible basis. IRAs may not be transferred, sold, assigned,
discounted, or pledged as collateral for a loan or other obligation.  The annual
premium for an IRA may not exceed $2,000.  Any refund of premium must be applied
to payment  of future  premiums  or the  purchase  of  additional  benefits.  In
addition,  distributions  from  certain  other types of  Qualified  Plans may be
placed on a tax-deferred basis into an IRA.                                     

2. Roth IRA                                                                 

     Effective  January 1, 1998, a Roth IRA under Code Section 408A is available
for retirement  savings for individuals with earned income.  The Contract may be
purchased  as  a  Roth  IRA.   Roth  IRA  allows  an  individual  to  contribute
non-deductible  contributions for retirement purposes,  with the earnings income
tax-deferred,  and the potential  ability to withdraw the money income  tax-free
under certain circumstances.  Roth IRAs are subject to limitations on the amount
that may be  contributed,  the  persons who may be  eligible,  and the time when
distributions must commence.  Roth IRAs may not be transferred,  sold, assigned,
discounted, or pledged as collateral for a loan or other obligation.  The annual
premium for a Roth IRA may not exceed  $2,000,  reduced by any  contribution  to
that individual's IRA. In addition,  a taxpayer may elect to convert an IRA to a
Roth IRA,  accelerating deferred income taxes on previous earnings in the IRA to
a current year.                                                                 

3. Corporate Pension and Profit Sharing Plans                               

     Code Section 401(a) permits corporate  employers to establish various types
of  retirement  plans  for  their  employees.  For this  purpose,  self-employed
individuals  (proprietors or partners operating a trade or business) are treated
as employees  eligible to participate in such plans.  Such                      

29

P-->485BPOS33rd�Page�of�65TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�33rd
retirement  plans may permit  the  purchase  of  Contracts  to provide  benefits
thereunder.                                                                     

     In order for a retirement plan to be "qualified" under Code Section 401, it
must: (1) meet certain minimum standards with respect to participation, coverage
and vesting;  (2) not discriminate in favor of "highly  compensated"  employees;
(3) provide  contributions  or benefits that do not exceed certain  limitations;
(4)  prohibit  the use of plan  assets for  purposes  other  than the  exclusive
benefit  of the  employees  and their  beneficiaries  covered  by the plan;  (5)
provide  for  distributions  that  comply  with  certain  minimum   distribution
requirements;  (6) provide for certain spousal survivor benefits; and (7) comply
with numerous other qualification requirements.                                 

     A  retirement  plan  qualified  under  Code  Section  401 may be  funded by
employer  contributions,  employee  contributions or a combination of both. Plan
participants are not subject to tax on employer contributions until such amounts
are  actually  distributed  from  the  plan.  Depending  upon  the  terms of the
particular plan,  employee  contributions  may be made on a pre-tax or after-tax
basis. In addition,  plan  participants  are not taxed on plan earnings  derived
from  either  employer  or  employee   contributions  until  such  earnings  are
distributed.                                                                    

4. Tax-Deferred Annuities                                                   

     Section 403(b) of the Code permits the purchase of "tax-deferred annuities"
by public schools and organizations  described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Code,
including certain charitable,  educational and scientific  organizations.  These
qualifying  employers  may pay premiums  under the  Contracts for the benefit of
their  employees.  Such  premiums are not  includable in the gross income of the
employee until the employee receives distributions from the Contract. The amount
of premiums to the  tax-deferred  annuity is limited to certain maximums imposed
by the Code. Furthermore,  the Code sets forth additional restrictions governing
such items as transferability, distributions, nondiscrimination and withdrawals.
Any employee  should  obtain  competent  tax advice as to the tax  treatment and
suitability of such an investment.                                              

5.  Deferred Compensation Plans                                             

     Section 457 of the Code permits  employees  of state and local  governments
and units and  agencies  of state and local  governments  as well as  tax-exempt
organizations  described in Section  501(c)(3) of the Code to defer a portion of
their compensation  without paying current taxes.  Distributions  received by an
employee from a 457 Plan will be taxed as ordinary income.                      

QUALIFIED PLAN FEDERAL TAXATION SUMMARY 

     The  above  description  of the  Federal  income  tax  consequences  of the
different types of Qualified  Plans which may be funded by the Contract  offered
by this  Prospectus  is only a brief  summary and is not intended as tax advice.
The rules governing the provisions of Qualified Plans are extremely  complex and
often  difficult to  comprehend.  Anything  less than full  compliance  with the
applicable  rules,  all of which are  subject to change,  may have  adverse  tax
consequences.  A prospective  Contract Owner considering adoption of a Qualified
Plan and purchase of a Contract in connection  therewith  should first consult a
qualified  and  competent  tax  adviser  with regard to the  suitability  of the
Contract as an investment vehicle for the Qualified Plan.                       

     Periodic  distributions (e.g.,  annuities and installment  payments) from a
Qualified  Plan that will last for a period of ten or more  years are  generally
subject  to  voluntary  income tax  withholding.  The  amount  withheld  on such
periodic  distributions  is  determined  at the rate  applicable  to wages.  The
recipient of a periodic distribution may generally elect not to have withholding
apply.                                                                          

     Nonperiodic  distributions  (e.g.,  lump-sums and annuities or  installment
payments  of less than 10 years)  from a  Qualified  Plan  (other than IRAs) are
generally  subject  to  mandatory  20%  income  tax  withholding.   However,  no
withholding is imposed if the  distribution  is transferred  directly to another
eligible  Qualified  Plan  or  IRA.  Nonperiodic  distributions  from an IRA are
subject to income tax  withholding  at a flat 10% rate.  The recipient of such a
distribution may elect not to have withholding apply.                           

403(b) PROGRAMS - CONSTRAINTS ON WITHDRAWALS 

     Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code permits public school employees
and employees of  organizations  specified in Section  501(c)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code, such as certain types of charitable,  educational,  and scientific
organizations,   to  purchase   annuity   contracts,   and  subject  to  certain
limitations,  to exclude the amount of purchase  payments  from gross income for
federal  tax  purposes.   Section   403(b)  imposes   restrictions   on  certain
distributions from  tax-sheltered  annuity contracts meeting the requirements of
Section 403(b) that apply to tax years beginning on or after January 1, 1989.   

     Section   403(b)   requires   that   distributions   from  Section   403(b)
tax-sheltered  annuities that are  attributable to employee  contributions  made
after December 31, 1988 under a salary reduction  agreement not begin before the
employee reaches age 59 1/2, separates from service,  dies, becomes disabled, or
incurs a hardship. Furthermore, distributions of income or gains attributable to
such contributions accrued after December 31, 1988 may not be made on account of
hardship.  Hardship,  for this purpose, is generally defined as an immediate and
heavy  financial need,  such as paying for medical  expenses,  the purchase of a
principal residence, or paying certain tuition expenses.                        

    An Owner of a Contract purchased as a tax-deferred  Section 403(b) annuity
contract will not, therefore,  be entitled to exercise the right of surrender or
withdrawal,  as  described  in this  Prospectus,  in order to receive his or her
Contract Value attributable to premiums paid under a salary reduction  agreement
or any income or gains credited to such Contract Owner under the Contract unless
one  of the  above-described  conditions  has  been  satisfied,  or  unless  the
withdrawal is otherwise  permitted under applicable federal tax law. In the case
of transfers of amounts  accumulated in a different  Section 403(b)  contract to
this  Contract  under a  Section  403(b)  Program,  the  withdrawal  constraints
described  above  would  not apply to the  amount  transferred  to the  Contract

30

P-->485BPOS34th�Page�of�65TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�34th
attributable to a Contract  Owner's  December 31, 1988 account balance under the
old contract,  provided that the amounts  transferred  between  contracts  meets
certain conditions. An Owner's Contract may be able to be transferred to certain
other  investment or funding  alternatives  meeting the  requirements of Section
403(b) that are available under an employer's Section 403(b) arrangement.       

 OTHER INFORMATION

VOTING OF SHARES OF THE FUNDS 

     AUL is the legal owner of the shares of the Portfolios of the Funds held by
the Investment  Accounts of the Variable Account. In accordance with its view of
present  applicable  law, AUL will exercise  voting rights  attributable  to the
shares of the Funds held in the  Investment  Accounts at any regular and special
meetings  of the  shareholders  of the Funds on  matters  requiring  shareholder
voting  under the 1940 Act.  AUL will  exercise  these  voting  rights  based on
instructions  received from persons having the voting interest in  corresponding
Investment Accounts of the Variable Account and consistent with any requirements
imposed on AUL under contracts with any of the Funds,  or under  applicable law.
However, if the 1940 Act or any regulations  thereunder should be amended, or if
the present interpretation thereof should change, and as a result AUL determines
that it is  permitted  to vote the shares of the Funds in its own right,  it may
elect to do so.                                                                 

     The person  having the voting  interest  under a Contract  is the  Contract
Owner.  AUL or the  pertinent  Fund shall send to each  Contract  Owner a Fund's
proxy materials and forms of instruction by means of which  instructions  may be
given to AUL on how to exercise voting rights attributable to the Fund's shares.

     Unless otherwise required by applicable law or under a contract with any of
the Funds,  with  respect to each of the Funds,  the number of Fund shares as to
which  voting  instructions  may be given to AUL is  determined  by dividing the
value of all of the Accumulation  Units of the corresponding  Investment Account
attributable to a Contract on a particular date by the net asset value per share
of that Fund as of the same date.  Fractional votes will be counted.  The number
of votes as to which voting  instructions  may be given will be determined as of
the  date  coincident  with  the  date  established  by a Fund  for  determining
shareholders eligible to vote at the meeting of the Fund. If required by the SEC
or under a contract  with any of the Funds,  AUL reserves the right to determine
in a different fashion the voting rights attributable to the shares of the Fund.
Voting instructions may be cast in person or by proxy.                          

     Voting  rights  attributable  to the  Contracts  for which no timely voting
instructions  are received  will be voted by AUL in the same  proportion  as the
voting  instructions  which are  received in a timely  manner for all  Contracts
participating in that Investment Account. AUL will vote shares of any Investment
Account, if any, that it owns beneficially in its own discretion, except that if
a Fund offers it shares to any  insurance  company  separate  account that funds
variable life insurance  contracts or if otherwise required by applicable law or
contract,  AUL will vote its own  shares in the same  proportion  as the  voting
instructions that are received in a timely manner for Contracts participating in
the Investment Account.                                                         

     Neither the Variable Account nor AUL is under any duty to inquire as to the
instructions  received  or the  authority  of Owners or others to  instruct  the
voting of shares of any of the Funds.                                           

SUBSTITUTION OF INVESTMENTS 

     AUL  reserves  the  right,  subject to  compliance  with the law as then in
effect, to make additions to, deletions from, substitutions for, or combinations
of the  securities  that  are held by the  Variable  Account  or any  Investment
Account or that the Variable Account or any Investment Account may purchase.  If
shares of any or all of the Funds should no longer be available for  investment,
or if, in the judgment of AUL's management,  further investment in shares of any
or all of the Funds should become  inappropriate  in view of the purposes of the
Contracts,  AUL may  substitute  shares  of  another  fund  for  shares  already
purchased,  or to be purchased in the future under the  Contracts.  AUL may also
purchase,  through the Variable  Account,  other securities for other classes of
contracts,  or permit a conversion  between classes of contracts on the basis of
requests made by Contract Owners or as permitted by Federal law.                

     Where  required  under  applicable  law, AUL will not substitute any shares
attributable  to a Contract  Owner's  interest in an  Investment  Account or the
Variable Account without notice,  Contract Owner approval,  or prior approval of
the SEC or a state insurance  commissioner,  and without following the filing or
other procedures established by applicable state insurance regulators.          

     AUL also reserves the right to establish additional  Investment Accounts of
the Variable Account that would invest in another  investment  company, a series
thereof, or other suitable  investment  vehicle.  New Investment Accounts may be
established in the sole  discretion of AUL, and any new Investment  Account will
be made  available to existing  Contract  Owners on a basis to be  determined by
AUL. AUL may also eliminate or combine one or more Investment  Accounts or cease
permitting new allocations to an Investment  Account if, in its sole discretion,
marketing, tax, or investment conditions so warrant.                            

     Subject to any  required  regulatory  approvals,  AUL reserves the right to
transfer  assets of any  Investment  Account of the Variable  Account to another
separate account or Investment Account.                                         

     In the event of any such  substitution  or change,  AUL may, by appropriate
endorsement,  make such changes in these and other Contracts as may be necessary
or appropriate to reflect such substitution or change. AUL reserves the right to

31

P-->485BPOS35th�Page�of�65TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�35th
operate the Variable Account as a management  investment  company under the 1940
Act  or  any  other  form  permitted  by  law,  an  Investment  Account  may  be
deregistered  under  that  Act in  the  event  such  registration  is no  longer
required,  or it may be  combined  with  other  separate  accounts  of AUL or an
affiliate  thereof.  Subject to  compliance  with  applicable  law, AUL also may
combine one or more Investment Accounts and may establish a committee, board, or
other  group to manage one or more  aspects  of the  operation  of the  Variable
Account.                                                                        

CHANGES TO COMPLY WITH LAW AND AMENDMENTS 

     AUL reserves the right, without the consent of Contract Owners, to make any
change to the  provisions  of the  Contracts to comply with, or to give Contract
Owners the  benefit  of, any  Federal or state  statute,  rule,  or  regulation,
including, but not limited to, requirements for annuity contracts and retirement
plans under the Internal  Revenue Code and  regulations  thereunder or any state
statute or regulation.                                                          

RESERVATION OF RIGHTS 

     AUL reserves  the right to refuse to accept new  premiums  under a Contract
and to refuse to accept any application for a Contract.                         

PERIODIC REPORTS 

     AUL will send quarterly  statements showing the number,  type, and value of
Accumulation  Units  credited  to the  Contract.  AUL will also send  statements
reflecting  transactions in a Contract Owner's Account as required by applicable
law. In addition, every person having voting rights will receive such reports or
Prospectuses concerning the Variable Account and the Funds as may be required by
the 1940 Act and the 1933 Act.                                                  

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

     There are no legal  proceedings  pending to which the Variable Account is a
party, or which would materially affect the Variable Account.                   

LEGAL MATTERS 

     Legal  matters  in  connection  with the  issue  and sale of the  Contracts
described in this Prospectus and the organization of AUL, its authority to issue
the Contracts  under Indiana law, and the validity of the forms of the Contracts
under Indiana law have been passed upon by the Associate General Counsel of AUL.

     Legal matters  relating to the Federal  securities  and Federal  income tax
laws have been passed upon by Dechert, Washington, D.C., (formerly Dechert Price
& Rhoads).                                                                      

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

     Financial  statements  of AUL as of December 31, 2000,  are included in the
Statement of Additional Information.                                            

 PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

     Performance   information  for  the  Investment  Accounts  is  shown  under
"Performance  of the  Investment  Accounts."  Performance  information  for  the
Investment  Accounts may also appear in promotional reports and sales literature
to current  or  prospective  Contract  Owners in the  manner  described  in this
section.  Performance  information  in  promotional  reports and  literature may
include the yield and effective yield of the Investment Account investing in the
Money Market Investment Account, the yield of the remaining Investment Accounts,
the average annual total return and the total return of all Investment Accounts.
For information on the calculation of current yield and effective yield, see the
Statement of Additional Information.                                            

     Quotations of average annual total return for any  Investment  Account will
be  expressed  in terms of the  average  annual  compounded  rate of return on a
hypothetical  investment  in a Contract over a period of one, five and ten years
(or, if less, up to the life of the  Investment  Account),  and will reflect the
deduction of the applicable  withdrawal  charge,  the mortality and expense risk
charge, and if applicable, the administrative charge. Hypothetical quotations of
average  annual  total  return may also be shown for an  Investment  Account for
periods prior to the time that the Investment Account commenced operations based
upon the  performance  of the mutual  fund  portfolio  in which that  Investment
Account  invests,  and will reflect the deduction of the  applicable  withdrawal
charge, the administrative  charge, and the mortality and expense risk charge as
if, and to the extent,  that such  charges had been  applicable.  Quotations  of
total return,  actual and hypothetical,  may simultaneously be shown that do not
take into account certain  contractual charges such as the withdrawal charge and
the administrative charge and may be shown for different periods.               

     Performance  information  for any  Investment  Account  reflects  only  the
performance of a  hypothetical  Contract under which Contract Value is allocated
to  an  Investment  Account  during  a  particular  time  period  on  which  the
calculations are based. Performance information should be considered in light of
the investment objectives and policies, characteristics, and quality of the Fund
in which the Investment  Account invests,  and the market  conditions during the
given time period, and should not be considered as representation of what may be
achieved in the future. For a description of the methods used to determine yield
and total  return in  promotional  reports  and  literature  for the  Investment
Accounts,  information on possible uses for performance,  and other information,
see the Statement of Additional Information.

 GENERAL INFORMATION AND HISTORY

     For a general  description  of AUL and AUL American  Individual  Unit Trust
(the "Variable Account"),  see the section entitled  "Information about AUL, The
Variable Account,  and The Funds" in the Prospectus.  Defined terms used in this
Statement of  Additional  Information  have the same meaning as terms defined in
the Prospectus.                                                                 
 DISTRIBUTION OF CONTRACTS

     AUL is the Principal  Underwriter for the variable  annuity  contracts (the
"Contracts")  described in the  Prospectus  and in this  Statement of Additional
Information.  AUL is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC")  as  a  broker-dealer.  The  Contracts  are  currently  being  sold  in a
continuous offering. While AUL does not anticipate discontinuing the offering of
the  Contracts,  it  reserves  the  right to do so.  The  Contracts  are sold by
registered representatives of AUL who are also licensed insurance agents.       

     AUL also has sales agreements with various  broker-dealers  under which the
Contracts will be sold by registered representatives of the broker-dealers.  The
registered  representatives are required to be authorized under applicable state
regulations to sell variable annuity contracts.  The broker-dealers are required
to be  registered  with  the SEC and  members  of the  National  Association  of
Securities Dealers, Inc.                                                        

     AUL  serves as the  Principal  Underwriter  without  compensation  from the
Variable Account.                                                               

 CUSTODY OF ASSETS

     The  assets  of the  Variable  Account  are  held by AUL.  The  assets  are
maintained  separate and apart from the assets of other separate accounts of AUL
and from AUL's General  Account assets.  AUL maintains  records of all purchases
and redemptions of shares of the Funds.                                         

TAX STATUS OF AUL AND THE VARIABLE ACCOUNT

     The  operations of the Variable  Account form a part of AUL, so AUL will be
responsible  for any Federal  income and other taxes that  become  payable  with
respect to the income of the Variable Account. Each Investment Account will bear
its  allocable  share of such  liabilities,  but under current law, no dividend,
interest  income,  or  realized  capital  gain  attributable,  at a minimum,  to
appreciation of the Investment Accounts will be taxed to AUL to the extent it is
applied to increase reserves under the Contracts.                               

     Each of the Funds in which the  Variable  Account  invests  has advised AUL
that it intends to qualify as a "regulated  investment  company" under the Code.
AUL does not guarantee that any Fund will so qualify. If the requirements of the
Code are met, a Fund will not be taxed on amounts  distributed on a timely basis
to the Variable Account.  Were such a Fund not to so qualify,  the tax status of
the  Contracts  as  annuities  might be lost,  which could  result in  immediate
taxation of amounts  earned under the  Contracts  (except those held in Employee
Benefit Plans and 408 Programs).                                                

     Under regulations  promulgated  under Code Section 817(h),  each Investment
Account must meet certain diversification standards.  Generally, compliance with
these  standards is determined  by taking into account an  Investment  Account's
share of assets of the  appropriate  underlying  Fund. To meet this test, on the
last day of each  calendar  quarter,  no more than 55% of the total  assets of a
Fund  may be  represented  by any  one  investment,  no  more  than  70%  may be
represented by any two  investments,  no more than 80% may be represented by any
three  investments,  and no  more  than  90%  may  be  represented  by any  four
investments.  For the purposes of Section 817(h),  securities of a single issuer
generally are treated as one investment,  but  obligations of the U.S.  Treasury
and each U.S.  Governmental  agency or instrumentality  generally are treated as
securities of separate issuers.                                                 

 TAX TREATMENT OF AND LIMITS ON PREMIUMS UNDER RETIREMENT PROGRAMS

     The  Contracts  may be offered for use with  several  types of qualified or
non-qualified retirement programs as described in the Prospectus.  The tax rules
applicable to Owners of Contracts used in connection  with qualified  retirement
programs  vary  according  to the  type of  retirement  plan and its  terms  and
conditions.  Therefore,  no attempt is made herein to provide  more than general
information  about the use of the Contracts  with the various types of qualified
retirement programs.                                                            

     Owners,  Annuitants,  Beneficiaries and other payees are cautioned that the
rights of any person to any benefits  under these programs may be subject to the
terms and conditions of the Qualified Plans themselves,  regardless of the terms
and conditions of the Contracts issued in connection therewith.                 

     Generally, no taxes are imposed on the increases in the value of a Contract
by  reason  of  investment   experience  or  employer   contributions   until  a
distribution  occurs,  either as a lump-sum payment or annuity payments under an
elected Annuity Option or in the form of cash withdrawals,  surrenders, or other
distributions prior to the Annuity Date.                                        

The amount of premiums that may be paid under a Contract

P-->485BPOS41st�Page�of�65TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�41st
issued in connection  with a Qualified Plan are subject to limitations  that may
vary depending on the type of Qualified Plan. In addition,  early  distributions
from most  Qualified  Plans may be subject to penalty  taxes,  or in the case of
distributions of amounts  contributed under salary reduction  agreements,  could
cause the Qualified Plan to be  disqualified.  Furthermore,  distributions  from
most Qualified Plans are subject to certain minimum  distribution rules. Failure
to comply with these rules could  result in  disqualification  of the  Qualified
Plan or  subject  the  Annuitant  to penalty  taxes.  As a result,  the  minimum
distribution  rules could limit the  availability  of certain Annuity Options to
Contract Owners and their Beneficiaries.                                        

     Below are brief  descriptions  of  various  types of  qualified  retirement
programs and the use of the Contracts in connection therewith.  Unless otherwise
indicated  in the context of the  description,  these  descriptions  reflect the
assumption  that the Contract Owner is a participant in the retirement  program.
For Employee Benefit Plans that are defined benefit plans, a Contract  generally
would be purchased by a Participant, but owned by the plan itself.              

403(b) PROGRAMS 

     Premiums paid pursuant to a 403(b) Program are  excludible  from a Contract
Owner's gross income if they do not exceed the smallest of the limits calculated
under Sections 402(g),  403(b)(2), and 415 of the Internal Revenue Code. Section
402(g) generally limits a Contract Owner's salary reduction premiums to a 403(b)
Program to $10,000 a year. The $10,000 limit may be reduced by salary  reduction
premiums to another type of retirement  plan. A Contract  Owner with at least 15
years of service for a "qualified employer" (i.e., an educational  organization,
hospital,  home health service agency, health and welfare service agency, church
or convention or association of churches) generally may exceed the $10,000 limit
by $3,000 per year, subject to an aggregate limit of $15,000 for all years.     

     Section 403(b)(2)  provides an overall limit on employer and Contract Owner
salary  reduction  premiums  that  may be  made  to a  403(b)  Program.  Section
403(b)(2)  generally  provides  that the  maximum  amount of premiums a Contract
Owner may  exclude  from his gross  income in any  taxable  year is equal to the
excess, if any, of:                                                             

     (a) the amount determined by multiplying 20% of his includable compensation
by the number of his years of service with his employer, over                   

     (b) the total  amount  contributed  to  retirement  plans  sponsored by his
employer,  including the Section 403(b)  Program,  that were excludible from his
gross income in prior years.                                                    

Contract  Owners  employed by  "qualified  employers"  may elect to have certain
alternative limitations apply.                                                  

     Section 415(c) also provides an overall limit on the amount of employer and
Contract Owner's salary reduction premiums to a Section 403(b) Program that will
be  excludible  from an  employee's  gross  income in a given year.  The Section
415(c)  limit is the lesser of (a) $30,000,  or (b) 25% of the Contract  Owner's
annual  compensation  (reduced  by his salary  reduction  premiums to the 403(b)
Program  and  certain  other  employee  plans).  This limit will be reduced if a
Contract Owner also  participates  in an Employee  Benefit Plan  maintained by a
business that he or she controls.                                               

     The  limits  described  above do not apply to  amounts  "rolled  over" from
another  Section  403(b)  Program.  A Contract  Owner who  receives an "eligible
rollover  distribution"  will be  permitted  either to roll over such  amount to
another  Section 403(b) Program or an IRA within 60 days of receipt or to make a
direct rollover to another Section 403(b) Program or an IRA without  recognition
of income.  An "eligible  rollover  distribution"  means any  distribution  to a
Contract Owner of all or any taxable  portion of the balance of his credit under
a Section  403(b)  Program,  other than a  required  minimum  distribution  to a
Contract Owner who has reached age 70 1/2 and excluding any  distribution  which
is one of a  series  of  substantially  equal  payments  made  (1) over the life
expectancy  of the Contract  Owner or the joint life  expectancy of the Contract
Owner and his  beneficiary  or (2) over a specified  period of 10 years or more.
Provisions  of the Internal  Revenue  Code  require  that 20% of every  eligible
rollover  distribution that is not directly rolled over be withheld by the payor
for federal income taxes.                                                       

408 AND 408A PROGRAMS 

     Code Sections 219, 408 and 408A permit  eligible  individuals to contribute
to an individual  retirement  program,  including a Simplified  Employee Pension
Plan, an Employer Association  Established  Individual Retirement Account Trust,
known as an Individual  Retirement  Account  ("IRA"),  and a Roth IRA. These IRA
accounts are subject to limitations on the amount that may be  contributed,  the
persons who may be eligible, and on the time when distributions may commence. In
addition, certain distributions from some other types of retirement plans may be
placed on a  tax-deferred  basis in an IRA.  Sale of the  Contracts for use with
IRAs may be subject  to special  requirements  imposed by the  Internal  Revenue
Service.  Purchasers  of the  Contracts  for such purposes will be provided with
such  supplementary  information  as may be  required  by the  Internal  Revenue
Service  or other  appropriate  agency,  and will have the  right to revoke  the
Contract under certain circumstances.                                           

     If an  Owner  of a  Contract  issued  in  connection  with  a  408  Program
surrenders the Contract or makes a partial  withdrawal,  the Contract Owner will
realize  income  taxable at  ordinary  tax rates on the amount  received  to the
extent that amount  exceeds the 408 premiums that were not  excludible  from the
taxable income of the employee when paid.                                       

     Premiums  paid to the  individual  retirement  account of a Contract  Owner
under a 408 Program that is described in Section 408(c) of the Internal  Revenue
Code are  subject  to the  limits  on  premiums  paid to  individual  retirement
accounts under Section 219(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under Section 219(b)
of the Code,  premiums paid to an individual  retirement  account are limited to
the lesser of $2,000 per year or the Contract Owner's annual  compensation.  For
tax years beginning  after 1996, if a married couple files a joint return,  each
spouse may, in the great majority of cases, make contributions to his or her IRA
up to the $2,000 limit. The extent to which a Contract Owner may deduct premiums
paid in connection with this type of 408 Program depends on his and his         

4 

P-->485BPOS42nd�Page�of�65TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�42nd
spouse's  gross income for the year and whether  either  participate  in another
employer-sponsored retirement plan.                                             

     Premiums  paid  in  connection  with a 408  Program  that  is a  simplified
employee pension plan are subject to limits under Section 402(h) of the Internal
Revenue Code. Section 402(h) currently limits premiums paid in connection with a
simplified  employee  pension  plan to the  lesser  of (a)  15% of the  Contract
Owner's compensation, or (b) $30,000. Premiums paid through salary reduction are
subject to additional annual limits.                                            

     Withdrawals   from  Roth   IRAs  may  be  made   tax-free   under   certain
circumstances. Please consult your tax adviser for more details.                

457 PROGRAMS                                                                    

     Deferrals by an eligible  individual to a 457 Program generally are limited
under Section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code to the lesser of (a) $8,000 or
(b) 33 1/3% of the Contract  Owner's  includable  compensation.  If the Contract
Owner  participates  in more than one 457 Program,  the $8,000 limit  applies to
contributions to all such programs. The $8,000 limit is reduced by the amount of
any salary reduction  contribution the Contract Owner makes to a 403(b) Program,
a 408  Program,  or an Employee  Benefit  Program.  The Section  457(b) limit is
increased  during the last three years ending before the Contract  Owner reaches
his normal retirement age under the 457 Program.  Effective January 1, 1997, the
limit on deferrals is indexed in $500 increments.                               

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 

     Code Section 401 permits  business  employers and certain  associations  to
establish various types of retirement plans for employees. Such retirement plans
may permit the purchase of Contracts to provide benefits thereunder.            

     If an Owner of a Contract  issued in  connection  with an Employee  Benefit
Plan who is a  participant  in the Plan  receives a lump-sum  distribution,  the
portion  of the  distribution  equal to any  premiums  that were  taxable to the
Contract Owner in the year when paid is generally received tax free. The balance
of the  distribution  will  generally  be treated as  ordinary  income.  Special
ten-year  averaging and a capital-gains  election may be available to a Contract
Owner who reached age 50 before 1986.                                           

     Under an Employee  Benefit Plan under Section 401 of the Code, when annuity
payments commence (as opposed to a lump-sum  distribution),  under Section 72 of
the Code, the portion of each payment attributable to premiums that were taxable
to the  participant in the year made, if any, is excluded from gross income as a
return of the participant's investment. The portion so excluded is determined at
the time the payments commence by dividing the  participant's  investment in the
Contract by the expected return.  The periodic payments in excess of this amount
are taxable as  ordinary  income.  Once the  participant's  investment  has been
recovered,  the full annuity payment will be taxable. If the annuity should stop
before the investment has been received,  the unrecovered  portion is deductible
on the  Annuitant's  final return.  If the Contract  Owner paid no premiums that
were taxable to the Contract  Owner in the year made,  there would be no portion
excludible.                                                                     

     The  applicable  annual  limits  on  premiums  paid in  connection  with an
Employee  Benefit  Plan depend  upon the type of plan.  Total  premiums  paid on
behalf of a Contract  Owner who is a  participant  to all  defined  contribution
plans maintained by an Employer are limited under Section 415(c) of the Internal
Revenue Code to the lesser of (a) $30,000, or (b) 25% of a participant's  annual
compensation.  Premiums  paid through  salary  reduction  to a  cash-or-deferred
arrangement under a profit sharing plan are subject to additional annual limits.
Premiums paid to a defined benefit pension plan are actuarially determined based
upon the amount of benefits the participant will receive under the plan formula.
The maximum  annual  benefit any  participant  may receive  under an  Employer's
defined  benefit plan is limited  under Section  415(b) of the Internal  Revenue
Code. The limits determined under Section 415(b) and (c) of the Internal Revenue
Code are  further  reduced  for a  participant  who  participates  in a  defined
contribution plan and a defined benefit plan maintained by the same employer.   

TAX PENALTY FOR ALL ANNUITY CONTRACTS 

     Any  distribution  made to a Contract  Owner who is a  participant  from an
Employee  Benefit Plan or a 408 Program  other than on account of one or more of
the  following  events  will  be  subject  to a 10%  penalty  tax on the  amount
distributed:                                                                    

(a) the Contract Owner has attained age 59 1/2;                           
(b) the Contract Owner has died; or                                       
(c) the Contract Owner is disabled.                                       

     In  addition,  a  distribution  from an Employee  Benefit  Plan will not be
subject to a 10% excise tax on the amount  distributed  if the Contract Owner is
55 and has separated from service.  Distributions  received at least annually as
part of a series of substantially  equal periodic  payments made for the life of
the Participant  will not be subject to an excise tax.  Certain amounts paid for
medical care also may not be subject to an excise tax.                          

WITHHOLDING FOR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS AND                                      
TAX-DEFERRED ANNUITIES 

     Distributions  from an  Employee  Benefit  Plan to an  employee,  surviving
spouse,  or former spouse who is an alternate  payee under a qualified  domestic
relations order, in the form a lump-sum  settlement or periodic annuity payments
for a fixed  period of fewer  than 10 years are  subject  to  mandatory  federal
income tax withholding of 20% of the taxable amount of the distribution,  unless
the distributee directs the transfer of such amounts to another Employee Benefit
Plan or to an Individual  Retirement Account under Code Section 408. The taxable
amount is the amount of the distribution, less the amount allocable to after-tax
premiums.                                                                       

     All  other  types of  distributions  from  Employee  Benefit  Plans and all
distributions from Individual Retirement Accounts, are subject to federal income
tax withholding on the taxable amount unless the distributee  elects not to have
the withholding apply. The amount withheld is based on the type of distribution.
Federal tax will be withheld from annuity  payments (other than those subject to
mandatory 20% withholding) pursuant to the recipient's withholding  certificate.
If no  withholding  certificate  is filed with AUL,  tax will be withheld on the
basis that the payee is married with three  withholding  exemptions.  Tax on all
surrenders and lump-sum  distributions from Individual  Retirement Accounts will
be withheld at a flat 10% rate.                                                 

     Withholding on annuity payments and other  distributions  from the Contract
will be made in accordance with regulations of the Internal Revenue Service.

 INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

     PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP,  independent  accountants,   performs  certain
accounting and auditing  services for AUL and performs  similar services for the
Variable  Account.  The AUL financial  statements  included in this Statement of
Additional  Information  have been  audited to the  extent  and for the  periods
indicated in their report thereon.                                              

 PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

     Performance  information  for  the  Investment  Accounts  is  shown  in the
prospectus  under   "Performance  of  the  Investment   Accounts."   Performance
information for the Investment  Accounts may also appear in promotional  reports
and literature to current or prospective Contract Owners in the manner described
in this section.  Performance  information in promotional reports and literature
may include the yield and effective yield of the Investment Account investing in
the AUL American Money Market Portfolio ("Money Market Investment Account"), the
yield of the remaining Investment Accounts,  the average annual total return and
the total return of all Investment Accounts.                                    

     Current yield for the Money Market Investment  Account will be based on the
change in the value of a hypothetical  investment (exclusive of capital changes)
over  a  particular  7-day  period,  less a pro  rata  share  of the  Investment
Account's expenses accrued over that period (the "base period"), and stated as a
percentage  of the  investment at the start of the base period (the "base period
return").  The base period return is then  annualized by  multiplying  by 365/7,
with the resulting  yield figures  carried to at least the nearest  hundredth of
one percent.                                                                    

     Calculation of "effective  yield" begins with the same "base period return"
used in the  calculation  of yield,  which is then  annualized to reflect weekly
compounding pursuant to the following formula:                                  

Effective Yield  =  [(Base Period Return + 1)**365/7] - 1                       

Quotations of yield for the remaining  Investment  Accounts will be based on all
investment  income per  Accumulation  Unit  earned  during a  particular  30-day
period, less expenses accrued during the period ("net investment  income"),  and
will  be  computed  by  dividing  net  investment  income  by the  value  of the
Accumulation  Unit on the last day of the  period,  according  to the  following
formula:                                                                        

YIELD =  2[(a-b/cd + 1)**6 - 1]                                                 

where a = net  investment  income  earned  during  the  period by the  Portfolio
attributable to shares owned by the Investment Account      

b = expenses accrued for the period (net of reimbursements),        

   c = the average daily number of Accumulation  Units outstanding  during
the period that were entitled to receive dividends, and     

  d = the value (maximum  offering period) per Accumulation  Unit on the
last day of the period.                                     

     Quotations of average annual total return for any  Investment  Account will
be  expressed  in terms of the  average  annual  compounded  rate of return of a
hypothetical  investment in a Contract over a period of one, five, and ten years
(or, if less, up to the life of the Investment Account),  calculated pursuant to
the  following  formula:  P(1 + T)**n = ERV  (where P = a  hypothetical  initial
payment of $1,000, T = the average annual total return, n = the number of years,
and ERV = the ending  redeemable value of a hypothetical  $1,000 payment made at
the  beginning of the period).  Hypothetical  quotations of average total return
may also be shown for an  Investment  Account for periods prior to the time that
the Investment  Account  commenced  operations based upon the performance of the
mutual fund portfolio in which that Investment Account invests,  as adjusted for
applicable charges.  All standardized total return figures reflect the deduction
of  the  applicable  withdrawal  charge,  the  administrative  charge,  and  the
mortality  and expense  risk  charge.  Quotations  of total  return,  actual and
hypothetical,  may simultaneously be shown that do not take into account certain
contractual charges such as the withdrawal charge and the administrative  charge
and quotations of total return may reflect other periods of time.               

     The average annual return that the Investment Accounts achieved for the one
year,  three year, five year, and the lesser of ten years or since inception for
the periods ended December 31, 2000 under a Flexible  Premium Contract and a One
Year Flexible  Premium  Contract  (assuming the withdrawal  charge is taken into
account in computing the ending  redeemable  value) and all Contracts  (assuming
the  withdrawal  charge  is not taken  into  account  in  computing  the  ending
redeemable value) may be found in the Prospectus.                               

     Performance  information  for an  Investment  Account may be  compared,  in
promotional reports and literature,  to: (1) the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite
Index ("S&P 500"), Dow Jones Industrial Average ("DJIA"),  Donoghue Money Market
Institutional Averages, or other indices that measure performance of a pertinent
group of  securities  so that  investors  may  compare an  Investment  Account's
results  with those of a group of  securities  widely  regarded by  investors as
representative  of the  securities  markets  in  general;  (2)  other  groups of
variable  annuity  separate  accounts or other  investment  products  tracked by
Lipper Analytical  Services, a widely used independent research firm which ranks
mutual funds and other investment companies by overall  performance,  investment
objectives, and assets, or tracked by other services,  companies,  publications,
or persons who rank such  investment  companies on overall  performance or other
criteria; and (3) the Consumer Price Index (measure for inflation) to assess the
real rate of return from an investment in the  Contract.  Unmanaged  indices may
assume the reinvestment of dividends but generally do not reflect deductions for
administrative and management costs and expenses.

     Performance  information  for any  Investment  Account  reflects  only  the
performance of a hypothetical  Contract under which an Owner's Contract Value is
allocated to an Investment  Account during a particular time period on which the
calculations are based. Performance information should be considered in light of
the investment objectives and policies, characteristics and quality of the Funds
in which the Investment  Account invests,  and the market  conditions during the

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

Report of Independent                                                           
To the Board of Directors                                                       
American United Life Insurance Company(R)                                       

In our opinion, the accompanying combined balance sheet and the related combined
statements of operations and  comprehensive  income,  changes in equity and cash
flows  present  fairly,  in all material  respects,  the  financial  position of
American United Life Insurance Company(R),  its subsidiaries and affiliates (the
"Company")  at December 31, 2000 and 1999,  and the results of their  operations
and their cash flows for the years then ended,  in  conformity  with  accounting
principles  generally accepted in the United States of America.  These financial
statements   are  the   responsibility   of  the   Company's   management;   our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial  statements in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about
whether the financial  statements  are free of material  misstatement.  An audit
includes  examining,  on a test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and
disclosures in the financial  statements,  assessing the  accounting  principles
used and  significant  estimates made by management,  and evaluating the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                              

Reorganization                                                                  
--------------                                                                  

American  United Life Insurance  Company(r) (AUL or the Company) on December 17,
2000, reorganized and formed a mutual insurance holding company, American United
Mutual Insurance  Holding Company  (AUMIHC),  and an intermediate  stock holding
company,  OneAmerica  Financial  Partners,  Inc.  (OneAmerica).  As  part of the
reorganization, AUL converted from a mutual to a stock insurance company through
a non-cash transaction.                                                         

The conversion was approved by the policyholders  and by the Indiana  Department
of Insurance.  Upon conversion to a stock company,  all 1,000 shares of AUL were
issued to AUMIHC  through  OneAmerica.  AUMIHC will at all times,  in accordance
with the Indiana Mutual Holding Company Law,  control at least a majority of the
voting shares of the capital stock of AUL. Policyholder  membership rights exist
at AUMIHC while the policyholder contract rights remain with AUL.               

Nature of Operations and Business Presentation                                  
----------------------------------------------                                  
AUL is an  Indiana-domiciled  stock life insurance  company with headquarters in
Indianapolis.  AUL is licensed  to do business in 49 states and the  District of
Columbia and is an authorized reinsurer in all states. In addition,  AUL markets
reinsurance  products  and  services in several  foreign  countries.  AUL offers
individual  life and annuity  products  through  its general and career  agents.
AUL's  qualified  group  retirement  plans,  tax-deferred  annuities  and  other
non-medical group products are marketed through regional representatives, agents
and brokers.  Life,  long-term care,  accident and other reinsurance is marketed
directly to other  insurance  companies and through  intermediaries  in both the
domestic and international  markets.  The combined company financial  statements
include the accounts of AUL, The State Life Insurance  Company (State Life), AUL
Equity Sales  Corporation,  AUL Reinsurance  Management  Services,  LLC, and CNL
Financial  Corporation (CNL).  Significant  intercompany  transactions have been
eliminated.                                                                     

The  accompanying  financial  statements  have been prepared in accordance  with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).
AUL,  State  Life and CNL file  separate  financial  statements  with  insurance
regulatory authorities,  which are prepared on the basis of statutory accounting
practices that are significantly different from financial statements prepared in
accordance  with GAAP.  These  differences  are described in detail in Note 11 -
Statutory Information.                                                          

The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with GAAP  requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses  during the reporting  period.  Actual  results
could differ from those estimates.                                              

Investments                                                                     
-----------                                                                     
Fixed maturity securities which may be sold to meet liquidity and other needs of
the Company are  categorized as available for sale and are stated at fair value.
Unrealized  gains  and  losses,   resulting  from  carrying   available-for-sale
securities at fair value, are reported in equity,  net of deferred taxes.  Fixed
maturity securities for which the Company has the positive intent and ability to
hold to maturity are categorized as held-to-maturity and are stated at amortized
cost. Equity securities are stated at fair value.  Mortgage loans on real estate
are  carried  at  amortized  cost less an  impairment  allowance  for  estimated
uncollectible  amounts.  Real estate is reported at cost,  less  allowances  for
depreciation. Depreciation is provided (straight line) over the estimated useful
lives of the  related  assets.  Investment  real  estate  is net of  accumulated
depreciation  of $33.2  million and $30.9 million at December 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.  Depreciation  expense for investment real estate amounted to $2.3
million for 2000 and 1999.  Policy  loans are carried at their  unpaid  balance.
Other  invested  assets  are  reported  at cost,  plus the  Company's  equity in
undistributed  net equity  since  acquisition.  Short-term  investments  include
investments  with maturities of one year or less and are carried at cost,  which
approximates  market  value.  Short-term  certificates  of deposit  and  savings
certificates are considered to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount for cash
and cash equivalents approximates market value.                                 

Realized  gains and losses on sale or  maturity  of  investments  are based upon
specific  identification  of the  investments  sold and do not  include  amounts
allocable to separate accounts.  At the time a decline in value of an investment
is  determined  to be other than  temporary,  a provision  for loss is recorded,
which is included in realized investment gains and losses.                      

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs                                               
---------------------------------                                               
Those costs of acquiring new business, which vary with and are primarily related
to the  production of new  business,  have been deferred to the extent that such
costs are deemed recoverable.  Such costs include commissions,  certain costs of
policy underwriting and issue, and certain variable agency expenses. These costs
are amortized with interest as follows:                                         

     For  participating  whole life  insurance  products,  over the lesser of 30
     years or the  lifetime of the policy in  relation  to the present  value of
     estimated   gross  margins  from  expenses,   investments   and  mortality,
discounted using the expected investment yield.                       

     For universal life-type policies and investment contracts,  over the lesser
     of the lifetime of the policy or 30 years for life policies or 20 years for
     other policies in relation to the present value of estimated  gross profits
     from  surrender  charges and  investment,  mortality  and expense  margins,
discounted using the interest rate credited to the policy.            

     For term life insurance  products and life reinsurance  policies,  over the
lesser of the benefit period or 30 years for term life or             

12

P-->485BPOS50th�Page�of�65TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�50th
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 

     20  years  for  life  reinsurance  policies  in  relation  to the  ratio of
     anticipated  annual  premium  revenue  to  the  anticipated  total  premium
  revenue, using the same assumptions used in calculating policy benefits.

     For  miscellaneous  group life and  individual  and group health  policies,
straight line over the expected life of the policy.                   

     For credit  insurance  policies,  the deferred  acquisition cost balance is
     primarily equal to the unearned premium reserve  multiplied by the ratio of
deferrable commissions to premiums written.                           

Recoverability of the unamortized  balance of deferred policy  acquisition costs
is evaluated regularly. For universal life-type contracts,  investment contracts
and participating whole life policies, the accumulated  amortization is adjusted
(increased or decreased)  whenever  there is a material  change in the estimated
gross profits or gross margins  expected over the life of a block of business to
maintain a constant relationship between cumulative amortization and the present
value  of gross  profits  or  gross  margins.  For  most  other  contracts,  the
unamortized asset balance is reduced by a charge to income only when the present
value of future cash flows, net of the policy liabilities,  is not sufficient to
cover such asset balance.                                                       

Assets Held in Separate Accounts                                                
--------------------------------                                                
Separate  accounts  are  funds on which  investment  income  and gains or losses
accrue  directly to certain  policies,  primarily  variable  annuity  contracts,
equity-based  pension  and profit  sharing  plans and  variable  universal  life
policies.  The assets of these accounts are legally segregated and are valued at
fair  value.  The  related  liabilities  are  recorded  at amounts  equal to the
underlying  assets;  the  fair  value  of  these  liabilities  is equal to their
carrying amount.                                                                

Property and Equipment                                                          
----------------------                                                          
Property and  equipment  includes real estate owned and occupied by the Company.
Property and equipment is carried at cost,  net of accumulated  depreciation  of
$60.4 million and $54.2 million as of December 31, 2000 and 1999,  respectively.
The Company  provides  for  depreciation  of property  and  equipment  using the
straight-line  method over its estimated useful life.  Depreciation  expense for
2000 and 1999 was $11.3 million and $9.6 million, respectively.                 

Premium Revenue and Benefits to Policyholders                                   
---------------------------------------------                                   
The premiums and benefits for whole life and term insurance products and certain
annuities  with  life   contingencies   (immediate   annuities)  are  fixed  and
guaranteed.  Such  premiums are  recognized as premium  revenue when due.  Group
insurance  premiums are  recognized  as premium  revenue over the time period to
which the premiums  relate.  Benefits and  expenses are  associated  with earned
premiums  so as to  result  in  recognition  of  profits  over  the  life of the
contracts.  This  association  is  accomplished  by means of the  provision  for
liabilities for future policy  benefits and the  amortization of deferred policy
acquisition costs.                                                              

Universal  life policies and  investment  contracts are policies with terms that
are not fixed and guaranteed. The terms that may be changed could include one or
more of the amounts assessed the policyholder, premiums paid by the policyholder
or  interest  accrued to  policyholder  balances.  The  amounts  collected  from
policyholders  for  these  policies  are  considered  deposits,   and  only  the
deductions during the period for cost of insurance,  policy  administration  and
surrenders are included in revenue.  Policy benefits and claims that are charged
to expense include interest credited to contracts and benefit claims incurred in
the period in excess of related policy account balances.                        

Reserves for Future Policy and Contract Benefits                                
------------------------------------------------                                
Liabilities for future policy benefits for participating whole life policies are
calculated using the net level premium method and assumptions as to interest and
mortality.  The  interest  rate is the  dividend  fund  interest  rate,  and the
mortality rates are those guaranteed in the calculation of cash surrender values
described in the contract.  Liabilities for future policy benefits for term life
insurance  and life  reinsurance  policies  are  calculated  using the net level
premium  method  and  assumptions  as  to  investment   yields,   mortality  and
withdrawals.  The  assumptions  are based on projections of past  experience and
include  provisions for possible  unfavorable  deviation.  These assumptions are
made at the time the contract is issued.  Liabilities for future policy benefits
on universal life and investment contracts consist principally of policy account
values plus certain  deferred  policy fees,  which are amortized  using the same
assumptions and factors used to amortize the deferred policy  acquisition costs.
If the  future  benefits  on  investment  contracts  are  guaranteed  (immediate
annuities  with  benefits paid for a period  certain),  the liability for future
benefits is the present value of such  guaranteed  benefits.  Claim  liabilities
include  provisions  for  reported  claims  and  estimates  based on  historical
experience for claims incurred but not reported.                                

Income Taxes                                                                    
------------                                                                    
The provision for income taxes includes amounts  currently  payable and deferred
income  taxes  resulting  from  the  temporary  differences  in the  assets  and
liabilities determined on a tax and financial reporting basis.                  

Comprehensive Income                                                            
--------------------                                                            
Comprehensive  income is the change in equity of the Company  that  results from
recognized  transactions  and other  economic  events of the  period  other than
transactions with the  policyholders.  Comprehensive  income includes net income
and net unrealized gains (losses) on securities.

Reclassification

Certain  1999   balances  have  been   reclassified   to  conform  to  the  2000

In 2001, AUL will adopt SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging  Activities,"  as amended,  which  establishes  accounting and reporting
standards  for  derivative  instruments  and hedging  activities,  and  requires
recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities  measured at fair
value.  Adoption of the  standard is not  expected to have a material  effect on
AUL.

There are no  specific  plan  assets  for this  postretirement  liability  as of
December 31, 2000 and 1999.  Claims incurred for benefits were funded by Company
contributions.                                                                  

The assumed  discount rate used in determining  the  accumulated  postretirement
benefit  was 8.0  percent  and the  assumed  health care cost trend rate was 7.5
percent  graded to 5.0 percent  until 2005.  Compensation  rates were assumed to
increase 4.3 percent at each year end.  The health  coverage for retirees 65 and
over is capped in the year 2000 and for all future  years.  An  increase  in the
health  care  cost  trend  rates by one  percentage  point  would  increase  the
postretirement  benefit  obligation by $.8 million as of December 31, 2000,  and
would  increase  the  benefit  cost for 2000 by $.1  million.  A decrease in the
health  care  cost  trend  rate  by one  percentage  point  would  decrease  the
postretirement  benefit  obligation by $.5 million as of December 31, 2000,  and
would decrease the benefit cost for 2000 by $.1 million.

7. REINSURANCE:                                                                 
---------------                                                                 
The Company is a party to various reinsurance  contracts under which it receives
premiums as a reinsurer and reimburses the ceding  companies for portions of the
claims  incurred.  At December 31, 2000 and 1999, life  reinsurance  assumed was
approximately  80 percent and 78 percent,  respectively,  of life  insurance  in
force.                                                                          

For individual life policies, the Company cedes the portion of the total risk in
excess of $1,500,000.  For other policies,  the Company has established  various
limits  of  coverage  it will  retain  on any one  policyholder  and  cedes  the
remainder of such coverage.                                                     

Certain statistical data with respect to reinsurance follows:                   

for years ended December 31                             2000(in millions) 1999

________________________________________________________________________________

The  Company  reviews  all  reinsurance  agreements  for  transfer  of risk  and
evaluates the proper accounting methods based upon the terms of the contract. If
companies  to which  reinsurance  has been ceded are unable to meet  obligations
under  the  reinsurance  agreements,   the  Company  would  remain  liable.  Six
reinsurers  account for  approximately 65 percent of the Company's  December 31,
2000, ceded reserves for life and accident and health  insurance.  The remainder
of such ceded reserves is spread among numerous reinsurers.                     

8. SURPLUS NOTES AND LINES OF CREDIT:                                           
--------------------------------------                                          
On February 16, 1996, the Company issued $75 million of surplus notes, due March
30, 2026.  Interest is payable  semi-annually  on March 30 and September 30 at a
7.75 percent  annual rate.  Any payment of interest on or principal of the notes
may be made only with the prior  approval  of the  Commissioner  of the  Indiana
Department of Insurance.  The surplus notes may not be redeemed at the option of
AUL or any holder of the surplus  notes.  Interest paid during 2000 and 1999 was
$5.8 million in each year.                                                      

The Company has available a $125 million credit  facility.  No amounts have been
drawn as of December 31, 2000.                                                  

9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:                                               
-----------------------------------                                             
Various  lawsuits have arisen in the ordinary course of the Company's  business.
In each of the matters,  the Company  believes the ultimate  resolution  of such
litigation  will not result in any  material  adverse  impact to  operations  or
financial condition of the Company.                                             

10. ACQUISITIONS:                                                               
-----------------                                                               
During  2000,  AUL  acquired the stock of CNL  Financial  Corporation  of Macon,
Georgia,  for  approximately  $21.5 million.  The assets  purchased  include the
operations  of  Cherokee  National  Life  Insurance  Company  and  CNL/Insurance
America.   CNL's  operations  are  primarily  related  to  the  Group  Financial
Institutions  market.  The  acquisition  was  accounted  for as a  purchase  and
resulted in present value of future profits of  approximately  $17 million.  The
proforma effects on AUL in 2000 are not significant.                            

During  1999,  AUL entered  into an  agreement  to purchase  certain  assets and
business   operations  of  the  North  American   accident  and  long-term  care
reinsurance  divisions  of  UnumProvident   Corporation  for  approximately  $39
million.  AUL  Reinsurance  Management  Services,  LLC (AUL RMS), a newly formed
subsidiary of AUL as a result of this transaction, will continue the reinsurance
management  activities  of  this  business.  AUL RMS has  intangible  assets  of
approximately  $18 million at December 31, 2000, and  amortization of intangible
assets amounted to approximately $1.9 million in 2000.                          

In  a  separate   transaction  during  1999,  AUL  assumed  certain  reinsurance
liabilities related to the participation in reinsurance pools from UnumProvident
Corporation amounting to approximately $117 million.                            

11. STATUTORY INFORMATION:

Life insurance  companies are required to maintain  certain amounts of assets on
deposit with state regulatory authorities. Such assets had an aggregate carrying
value of $10.1 million at December 31, 2000.                                    

In 1998, the NAIC adopted the  Codification of Statutory  Accounting  Principles
guidance  ("Codification"),  which will replace the current Accounting Practices
and Procedures  manual as the NAIC's primary  guidance for areas where statutory
accounting has been silent,  and changes  current  statutory  accounting in some
areas. The Indiana  Department of Insurance has adopted  Codification  effective
January  1,  2001.  The  Company  has  determined   that  the  adoption  of  the
Codification   guidance  will  not  have  a  material   effect  on  its  surplus
(unaudited).                                                                    

Distributions  from AUL to  OneAmerica  are  limited  by state  statute  and the
Indiana mutual insurance  holding company law. No  distributions  may be paid in
2001 without special approval from the Indiana Department of Insurance.         

12. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:                                        
----------------------------------------                                        
The fair values for financial  instruments were based on various assumptions and
estimates as of a specific point in time,  represent  liquidation values and may
vary  significantly  from amounts that will be realized in actual  transactions.
Therefore, the fair values presented in the table should not be construed as the
underlying value of the Company.                                                

The disclosure of fair value information about certain financial  instruments is
based  primarily  on  quoted  market  prices.  The  fair  values  of  short-term
investments and policy loans  approximate the carrying  amounts  reported in the
balance  sheets.  Fair  values for fixed  maturity  and equity  securities,  and
surplus  notes are based on quoted  market  prices  where  available.  For fixed
maturity  securities not actively traded, fair values are estimated using values
obtained  from  independent  pricing  services,   or  in  the  case  of  private
placements,  are  estimated by  discounting  expected  future cash flows using a
current market rate applicable to the yield,  credit quality and maturity of the
investments.                                                                    

The fair  value of the  aggregate  mortgage  loan  portfolio  was  estimated  by
discounting  the future cash flows using  current  rates at which  similar loans
would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for similar maturities.  

The estimated fair values of the liabilities for  interest-bearing  policyholder
funds  approximate  the statement  values  because  interest  rates  credited to
account  balances  approximate  current  rates paid on similar funds and are not
generally  guaranteed beyond one year. Fair values for other insurance  reserves
are not required to be disclosed.  However,  the  estimated  fair values for all
insurance  liabilities  are taken into  consideration  in the Company's  overall
management of interest rate risk, which minimizes  exposure to changing interest
rates  through the  matching of  investment  maturities  with  amounts due under
insurance  contracts.  The fair values of certain financial  instruments,  along
with their corresponding carrying values at December 31, 2000 and 1999, follow.

laws of the State of Indiana.

AUL EQUITY SALES CORP (Broker Dealer No. 801-56819) is a wholly owned subsidiary
of  AUL,  organized  under  the  laws  of the  State  of  Indiana  in  1969 as a

insurance company without voting securities whose principal business is the sale

mutual holding  company  referred to in this Item also serve as the directors of
State  Life,  this has been held by the Indiana  Commissioner  of  Insurance  to
constitute  an  acquisition  of control of State Life by American  United Mutual
Insurance Holding Company.

organized  under the laws of Indiana on November 3, 1999.  RMS is a  reinsurance

Services,  Canada, Ltd.; AUL Reinsurance Management Services (Bermuda) Ltd.; and
AUL Long Term Care Solutions, Inc.).

Item 27. Number of Contractholders                                              

     As of December 31, 2000, AUL has issued 10,143 Individual  variable annuity
contracts associated with Registrant.                                           

Item 28. Indemnification                                                        

Article IX, Section 1 of the by-laws of AUL provides as follows:                

The  corporation  shall  indemnify any director or officer or former director or
officer of the corporation against expenses actually and reasonably incurred  by
him (and for which he is  not  covered  by insurance) in connection with the de-
fense of any action, suit or proceeding  (unless such action, suit or proceeding
is settled) in which he is made a party by  reason of being or having  been such
director or officer, except in relation to  matters  as to which he shall be ad-
judged in such action, suit or proceeding, to be liable  for  negligence or mis-
conduct in the performance of his duties.  The corporation  may  also  reimburse
any director or officer or former director or officer of the corporation for the
reasonable costs of settlement of any such action,  suit  or  proceeding,  if it
shall be found by a majority of the directors not  involved  in  the  matter  in
controversy (whether or not a quorum) that it was to the interest of the corpor-
ation that such settlement be made and that such director  or  officer  was  not
guilty of negligence or misconduct.  Such rights of  indemnification  and  reim-
bursement shall not be exclusive of any other rights to which such  director  or
officer may be entitled under any By-law, agreement, vote  of  members or other-
wise.                                                                           

Insofar as  indemnification  for liability  arising under the  Securities Act of
1933 may be permitted to  directors,  officers  and  controlling  persons of the
registrant pursuant to the foregoing  provisions,  or otherwise,  the registrant
has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities  and Exchange  Commission
such  indemnification  is against  public policy as expressed in the Act and is,
therefore,  unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against
such liabilities  (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred
or paid by a director,  officer or  controlling  person of the registrant in the
successful  defense of any  action,  suit or  proceeding)  is  asserted  by such
director,  officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being
registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter
has been  settled by  controlling  precedent,  submit to a court of  appropriate
jurisdiction the question whether such  indemnification  by it is against public
policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of
such issue.                                                                     

Item 29. Principal Underwriters                                                 

(a) AUL acts as Investment Adviser to American United Life Pooled Equity Fund B 
    (File No. 2-27832) and to AUL American Series Fund, Inc. (File No. 33-30156)
(b) For information regarding AUL's Officers and Directors, see Item 25 above.  
(c) Not applicable                                                              

Item 30. Location of Accounts and Records                                       

The accounts,  books and other documents required to be maintained by Registrant
pursuant to Section  31(a) of the  Investment  Company Act of 1940 and the rules
under that section will be maintained at One American Square,  Indianapolis,  IN
46282.                                                                          

Item 31. Management Services                                                    

There are no  management-related  service  contracts  not discussed in Part A or
Part B.

AUL AMERICAN UNIT TRUST



Supplement Dated July 13, 1995

To The Prospectus Dated July 13, 1995


Page 9 of the Prospectus of AUL American Unit Trust is revised by
the insertion of the following information in the Expense Table
for the Tactical Asset Allocation Portfolio:






Management/ Advisory Fee           0.80%(1)

Other Expenses                     0.20%

Total Portfolio Annual Expenses    1.00%








(1) AUL has currently agreed to waive its advisory fee if the
ordinary expenses of a Portfolio exceed 1% and, to the extent
necessary, assume any expenses in excess of its advisory fee so
that the expenses of each Portfolio, including the advisory fee
but excluding extraordinary expenses, will not exceed 1% of the
Portfolio's average daily net asset value per year.  The Adviser
may terminate the policy of reducing its fee and/or assuming Fund
expenses upon 30 days written notice to the Fund and such policy
will be terminated automatically by the termination of the
Investment Advisory Agreement.


The following examples show expenses that a Contract Owner would
pay at the end of one or three years if at the end of those time
periods, the Contract is (1) surrendered or (2) not surrendered
or annuitized.








(1)  If Your Contract is Surrendered
     Recurring Contribution Contracts
          1 year                              99.46

Annuity Service Office Mailing Address:

P.O. Box 6148, Indianapolis, Indiana 46206-6148
The date of this Prospectus is July 12, 1995.
This Prospectus describes group annuity contracts (the
"Contracts") offered by American United

Life Insurance Company<U4> ("AUL" or the "Company"). The
Contracts are designed for use in

connection with employer, association, and other group retirement
plans (each a "Plan") that

qualify for favorable tax-deferred treatment as retirement
programs under Sections 401, 403(b),

408, or 457 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The
Contracts may be entered

into by any employer, association, or other group.

This Prospectus describes several types of Contracts, including
Contracts for which contributions

may vary in amount and frequency, subject to certain limitations
("Recurring Contribution

Contracts") and Contracts for which only a single contribution
may be made ("Single Contribution

Contracts"). As of the date of this Prospectus, Single
Contribution Contracts are available only
for use in connection with retirement plans that meet the
requirements of Sections 403(b) and 408

of the Internal Revenue Code. All of the Contracts provide for
the accumulation of values on

either a variable basis, a fixed basis, or both. The Contracts
also provide several options for fixed

annuity payments to begin on a future date.

Contributions designated to accumulate on a variable basis may be
allocated to one or more of the

Investment Accounts that comprise a separate account of AUL
called AUL American Unit Trust

(the "Variable Account"). Each Investment Account of the Variable
Account invests in shares of

one of the following mutual funds:

Contributions may be allocated to one or more Investment Accounts
available under a Contract.

Not all Investment Accounts may be available under a particular
Contract and some of the

Investment Accounts are not available for certain types of
Contracts. Contributions allocated to

an Investment Account of the Variable Account will increase or
decrease in dollar value

depending on the investment performance of the corresponding
mutual fund portfolio in which the

Investment Account invests. These amounts are not guaranteed.
Contributions designated to accumulate on a fixed basis may be
allocated to AUL's Fixed Account

and will earn interest at rates that are paid by AUL as described
in "The Fixed Account."


This Prospectus concisely sets forth information about the
Contracts and the Variable Account

that a prospective investor should know before investing. Certain
additional information is

contained in a "Statement of Additional Information," dated July
12, 1995, which has been filed

with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). The
Statement of Additional

Information is incorporated by reference into this Prospectus. A
copy may be obtained without

charge by calling or writing to AUL at the telephone number or
address indicated above. The

table of contents of the Statement of Additional Information is
located at the end of this

Prospectus.


THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR HAS THE COMMISSION PASSED
UPON THE ACCURACY OR ADEQUACY OF THIS PROSPECTUS. ANY
REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.
THIS PROSPECTUS IS ACCOMPANIED BY THE CURRENT PROSPECTUSES FOR

SUMMARY


This summary is intended to provide a brief overview of the more
significant aspects of the

Contracts. Further detail is provided in this Prospectus, the
Statement of Additional Information,

and the Contracts. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the
discussion in this summary and the

remainder of the Prospectus relates to the portion of the
Contracts involving the Variable

Account. The Fixed Account is briefly described under "The Fixed
Account" and in the pertinent

Contract.

Purpose of the Contracts

The group variable annuity contracts ("Contracts") described in
this Prospectus are offered for

use in connection with

retirement plans that meet the requirements of Sections 401,

403(b), 408, or 457 of the Internal
Revenue Code (collectively, "Plans"). A Contract presents a
dynamic concept in retirement
planning designed to give employers and employees and other
Participants in Plans flexibility in
attaining investment goals. A Contract provides for the
accumulation of values on a variable basis,
a fixed basis, or both, and provides several options for fixed
annuity payments. During the
Accumulation Period, a Participant can pursue various investment
options by allocating
contributions to the Investment Accounts of the Variable Account
or to the Fixed Account. See
"The Contracts."
Types of Contracts
AUL offers several types of contracts that are described in this
Prospectus. These include
Recurring Contribution Contracts under which contributions may
vary in amount and frequency,
subject to the limitations described below. Recurring
Contribution Contracts are available for use
in connection with retirement plans that meet the requirements of
Sections 401, 403(b), 408, or
457 of the Internal Revenue Code. AUL also offers Single
Contribution Contracts which require a
minimum contribution of at least $100,000. As of the date of this
Prospectus, Single Contribution
Contracts are available only for use in connection with
retirement plans that meet the
requirements of Sections 403(b) and 408 of the Internal Revenue
Code.

The Variable Account and the Funds


Contributions designated to accumulate on a variable basis are
allocated to the Variable Account.

See "Variable Account." The Variable Account is currently divided
into twenty-three Investment

Accounts. Each Investment Account invests exclusively in shares
of a specific mutual fund or in

shares of a specific Portfolio of one of the following mutual
funds: AUL American Series Fund,

Inc., Acacia Capital Corporation, Alger American Fund, Invesco
Dynamics Fund, Inc., PBHG

Funds, Inc., TCI Portfolios, Inc., T. Rowe Price Equity Series,
Inc., Twentieth Century Investors,

Inc., Twentieth Century World Investors, Inc., Vanguard Explorer
Fund, Inc., Vanguard Fixed

Income Securities Fund, Inc., Variable Insurance Products Fund,
and Variable Insurance Products

Fund II (the "Funds"). Each of the mutual funds or Portfolios of
the Funds has a different

investment objective or objectives. AUL American Series Fund,
Inc. offers an Equity, Bond,

Money Market, Managed, and Tactical Asset Allocation Portfolio.
The Alger American Fund

offers the Alger American Growth Portfolio. Acacia Capital
Corporation offers the Calvert

Capital Accumulation Portfolio. Invesco Dynamics Fund, Inc.
offers the Invesco Dynamics Fund.

PBHG Funds, Inc. offers the PBHG Growth Fund. TCI Portfolios,
Inc. offers the TCI Growth

Portfolio. T. Rowe Price Equity Series, Inc. offers the Equity
Income Portfolio. Twentieth

Century Investors, Inc. offers the Select Investors and Ultra
Investors Portfolios. Twentieth

Century World Investors, Inc. offers the Twentieth Century
International <?FB>Equity Portfolio.
Vanguard Explorers Fund, Inc. offers the Vanguard Explorer Fund.
Vanguard Fixed Income

Securities Fund, Inc. offers the Vanguard Short Term Federal Bond
Portfolio. Variable Insurance

Products Fund offers the Equity-Income, Growth, High Income, and
Overseas Portfolios.

Variable Insurance Products Fund II offers the Asset Manager,
Contrafund, and Index 500

Portfolios. Contributions may be allocated to one or more
Investment Accounts available under a

Contract. Not all Investment Accounts may be available under a
particular Contract and some of

the Investment Accounts are not available for certain types of
Contracts. The value of the

Accumulation Units held in an Investment Account will increase or
decrease in dollar value

depending on the investment performance of the corresponding
Portfolio of a Fund in which the

Investment Account invests. A Participant bears the investment
risk for amounts allocated to an

Investment Account of the Variable Account.


Fixed Account

Contributions designated to accumulate on a fixed basis may be
allocated to the Fixed Account,

which is part of AUL's General Account. Amounts allocated to the
Fixed Account earn interest at

rates periodically determined by AUL that are guaranteed to be at
least an effective annual rate of

4%. See "The Fixed Account."

Contributions

For Recurring Contribution Contracts, contributions may vary in
amount and frequency, but

contributions for each Participant under a Contract used for a

403(b) Program must total at least
$200 each Contract Year. Contributions for each Participant under
a Recurring Contribution
Contract used for any other Plan must total at least $300 each
Contract Year. In addition, the
maximum and minimum amounts that may be contributed under a Plan
may be subject to
limitations depending on the type of Plan. In a Single
Contribution Contract, contributions for
each Participant must be at least $100,000. Contributions of less
than $100,000 will initially be
allocated to a Recurring Contribution Contract. To allow the
consolidation of assets from
different sources, Participants will be allowed a twelve month
period, measured from the date of
first deposit, to reach the $100,000 minimum required
contribution for Single Contribution
Contracts. If less than $100,000 is received and allocated to a
Recurring Contribution Contract,
but the $100,000 required minimum contribution for Single
Contribution Contracts is received
within the twelve month period, measured from the date of the
first deposit, then the Participant's
Account Value will be immediately transferred from the Recurring
Contribution Contract to a
Single Contribution Contract pursuant to the terms of a Transfer
Agreement between AUL and
the Participant. However, after this twelve month period, no
further contributions will be accepted
under Single Contribution Contracts and any subsequent
contributions will be allocated to a
Recurring Contribution Contract, unless the $100,000 mini-
mum contribution for establishing an additional Participant's
Account under a Single Contribution
Contract is made. See "Contributions under the Contracts."
Transfers
A Participant's Variable Account Value may be transferred among
the Investment Accounts of the
Variable Account that are available under the Contract or to the
Fixed Account at any time during
the Accumulation Period. Part of a Participant's Fixed Account
Value may be transferred to one
or more available Investment Accounts of the Variable Account
during the Accumulation Period,
subject to certain restrictions. The minimum transfer from any
Investment Account or from the
Fixed Account is the lesser of $500 or a Participant's entire
Account Value in that Investment
Account or in the Fixed Account, provided however, that amounts
transferred from the Fixed
Account to an Investment Account during any given Contract Year
cannot exceed 20% of the
Participant's Fixed Account Value as of the beginning of that
Contract Year. However, if a
Participant's Fixed Account Value at the beginning of the
Contract Year is less than $2,500, the
amount that will be transferred for that Contract Year from the
Fixed Account is the lesser of
$500 or the entire Fixed Account Value. If, after any transfer,
the Participant's remaining Account
Value in an Investment Account or in the Fixed Account would be
less than $500, then such
request will be treated as a request for a transfer of the entire
Account Value. See "Transfers of
Account Value."
Withdrawals
At any time before the Annuity Commencement Date, a Participant's
Account may be surrendered
or a partial withdrawal may be taken from a Contract or a
Participant's Account subject to the
provisions of the Contract. The minimum amount that may be
withdrawn from a Participant's
Account Value in any one Investment Account or the Fixed Account
is the lesser of $500 or the
Participant's entire Account Value in the Investment Account or
Fixed Account. If a partial
withdrawal is requested that would leave a Participant's Account
Value in the Fixed Account or
any Investment Account, from whichever the withdrawal is
requested, less than $500, then such
request will be treated as a request for a full surrender from
the Fixed Account or Investment
Account. See "Cash Withdrawals."
Certain retirement programs, such as 403(b) Programs, are subject
to constraints on withdrawals
and full surrenders. See "Constraints on Withdrawals." In
addition, distributions under certain
retirement programs may result in a tax penalty. See "Tax
Penalty." A withdrawal or surrender
may also be subject to a withdrawal charge. See "Withdrawal
Charge."
The Death Benefit
If a Participant dies during the Accumulation Period, AUL will
pay a death benefit to the
Beneficiary. The amount of the death benefit is equal to the
vested portion of the Participant's
Account Value minus any outstanding loan balances and any due and
unpaid charges on those
loans. If the death of the Participant occurs on or after the
Annuity Commencement Date, no
death benefit will be payable, except as may be provided under
the Annuity Option elected. See
"The Death Benefit" and "Annuity Options."
Annuity Options
The Contracts provide for several optional fixed Annuity Options,
any one of which may be
elected if permitted by the applicable Plan and applicable law.
Payments under the Annuity

Options will be fixed and guaranteed by AUL. See "Annuity
Period."

Charges

Certain charges will be deducted in connection with the operation
of the Contracts and the

Variable Account:


Withdrawal Charge--AUL does not impose a sales charge at the time
a contribution is made to a

Participant's Account under a Contract. If a cash withdrawal is
made or a Participant's Account is

surrendered, a withdrawal charge (which may also be referred to
as a contingent deferred sales

charge) may be assessed by AUL where the Participant's Account
has not been in existence for a

certain period of time (see chart below). No withdrawal charge
will be taken on or after the

Annuity Commencement Date or upon payment of a death benefit
under a Contract. Under

certain Contracts known as "benefit responsive" Contracts,
withdrawal charges are not imposed

for payment of retirement, death, disability, termination of
employment, hardship, loan, age 701/2

required minimum distribution benefits, or benefits upon
attainment of age 591/2 (provided that

the age 591/2 benefit is a taxable distribution paid to the
Participant and not to any other person

or entity, including any alternative or substitute funding
medium. For certain other Contracts

known as "modified benefit responsive" Contracts, withdrawal
charges are not imposed for cash

lump-sum payments of death benefits. Withdrawal charges are also
not imposed for cash

lump-sum payments provided the Participant has (1) attained age
55 and has 10 years of service

with the employer identified in the Plan, or (2) attained age 62,
and is receiving benefits for

retirement, disability, termination of employment, hardships,
loans, or required minimum

distribution benefits pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section
401(a)(9) and Regulations issued

thereunder, or for benefits upon attainment of age 591/2
(provided that such benefit upon

attainment of age 591/2 is a taxable distribution paid to the
Participant and not to any other

person or entity, including any substitute funding medium).


For the first two Contract Years that a Participant's Account
exists, the amount withdrawn during

a Contract Year that will not be subject to an otherwise
applicable withdrawal charge is 10% of

(i) the total of all contributions made during the year that the
withdrawal is being made, plus (ii)
the Participant Account Value at the beginning of the Contract
Year. After the first two Contract
Years, and until the withdrawal charge has decreased to 0% (the
eleventh year for
Charge on Withdrawal Exceeding 10% Allowable Amount
AccountYear  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11 or more
Recurring Contribution Contracts 8% 8% 8% 8%   8%   4%   4%   4%

Single Contribution Contracts 6%   5%   4%   3%   2%   1%   0%
0%   0%   0%   0%

Recurring Contribution Contracts and the seventh year for Single
Contribution Contracts), the

amount withdrawn during a Contract Year that will not be subject
to a withdrawal charge is 10%

of the Participant's Account Value at the beginning of the
Contract Year in which the withdrawal

is being made.

If a Participant's contributions were initially allocated to a
Recurring Contribution Contract and

then transferred to a Single Contribution Contract pursuant to
the terms of a Transfer Agreement

between AUL and the Participant when the required minimum of
$100,000 was reached, then for

purposes of establishing the number of Account Years that an
account has been in existence,

credit will be given for the time that the contributions were in
the Recurring Contribution

Contract.


If a surrender or a withdrawal in excess of this 10% allowable
amount is made to pay a

non-benefit responsive benefit, a withdrawal charge will be
assessed on the amount withdrawn in

excess of the 10% allowable amount. The chart on the next page
illustrates the amount of the

withdrawal charge that applies to the different types of
contracts based on the number of years

that the Account has been in existence. However, the total
withdrawal charge will never exceed

9% of total contributions made by or on behalf of a Participant.
See "Withdrawal Charge" on

page 25.


Premium Tax Charge--Various states and municipalities impose a
tax on premiums received by

insurance companies. AUL assesses a premium tax charge to
reimburse itself for premium taxes

that it incurs, which usually will be deducted at the time
annuity payments commence. Premium

taxes currently range from 0% to 3.5%, but are subject to change
by such governmental entities.

See "Premium Tax Charge" on page 25.

Mortality and Expense Risk Charge--AUL deducts a daily charge in
an amount equal to an annual

rate of 1.25% of the average daily net assets of each Investment
Account of the Variable Account

for mortality and expense risks that AUL assumes in connection
with the Contracts. See

"Mortality and Expense Risk Charge" on page 26.

Administrative Charge--Under Recurring Contribution Contracts,
AUL deducts from a

Participant's Account an administrative charge equal to the
lesser of 0.5% of the Participant's

Account Value or $7.50 a quarter. The charge is assessed every
quarter on a Participant Account

if it is in effect on the quarterly Contract Anniversary, and is
assessed only during the Accumula-

<FB>tion Period. Such charge may be billed to the Owner in a
"benefit responsive" Employer

Sponsored 403(b) Contract or in a combined contract which
contains both Employee Benefit Plan

contributions and 403(b) contributions. There is no
Administrative Charge imposed on Single

Contribution Contracts. See "Administrative Charge" on page 26.


Expenses of the Funds-- Each Investment Account of the Variable
Account purchases shares of

the corresponding Portfolio of one of the Funds at the net asset
value of such shares. The net

asset value reflects investment advisory fees and other expenses
paid by each Portfolio. See the

Funds' Prospectuses for a description of these fees and expenses.


Ten-Day Free Look

Under 403(b) and 408 Contracts, the Owner has the right to return
the Contract for any reason

within ten days of receipt. If this right is exercised, the
Contract will be considered void from its
inception and any contributions will be fully refunded.
Termination by the Owner

An Owner of a Contract acquired in connection with an Employee
Benefit Plan, a 457 Program,

or an Employer Sponsored 403(b) Program may terminate the
Contract by sending proper written

notice of termination to AUL at its Home Office. Upon termination
of such a Contract, the Owner

may elect from two payment options. Under one option, AUL will
assess an Investment

Liquidation Charge on Participants' Fixed Account Values from
Contracts acquired in connection

with Employee Benefit Plans and 457 Programs (but not Employer
Sponsored 403(b) Programs).

Under the second payment option, AUL will not assess an
Investment Liquidation Charge;

however, amounts attributable to the aggregate Withdrawal Values
derived from the Fixed

Account of all Participants under the Contract shall be paid in
six or seven (depending on the

Contract) equal annual installments, starting with the first
Contract Anniversary immediately

succeeding the effective date of termination. For more
information on termination by an Owner,

including information on the payment options and the Investment
Liquidation Charge, see

"Termination by the Owner" on page 23.

Contacting AUL

All written requests, notices, and forms required by the
Contracts, and any questions or inquiries
should be directed to AUL at the address of the Annuity Service
Office provided in the front of

this Prospectus.

(1) For the first two Contract Years that a Participant's Account
exists, the amount withdrawn
during a Contract Year that will not be subject to an otherwise
applicable withdrawal charge is
10% of (i) the total of all contributions made during the year
that the withdrawal is being made,
plus (ii) the Participant's Account Value at the beginning of the
Contract Year. After the first two
Contract Years, and until the withdrawal charge has decreased to
0%, the amount withdrawn
during a Contract Year that will not be subject to a withdrawal
charge is 10% of the Participant's
Account Value at the beginning of the Contract Year in which the
withdrawal is being made. The
withdrawal charge, which is applied to amounts withdrawn in
excess of the 10% allowable
amount, decreases from 8% to 4% for Account years 6 through 10,
and to 0% thereafter. See
"Withdrawal Charge."

(2) For the first two Contract Years that a Participant's Account
exists, the amount withdrawn
during a Contract Year that will not be subject to an otherwise
applicable withdrawal charge is
10% of (i) the total of all contributions made during the year
that the withdrawal withdrawal is
being made, plus (ii) the Participant's Account Value at the
beginning of the Contract Year. After
the first two Contract Years, and until the withdrawal charge has
decreased to 0%, the amount
withdrawn during a Contract Year that will not be subject to a
withdrawal charge is 10% of the
Participant's Account Value at the beginning of the Contract Year
in which the withdrawal is
being made. The withdrawal charge, which is applied to amounts
withdrawn in excess of the
10<U7> allowable amount, decreases by 1% in each account Year
until it is 0% in Account Year

7 and thereafter. If a Participant's contributions were initially
allocated to a Recurring

Contribution Contract and then transferred to a Single
Contribution Contract when the required

minimum of $100,000 was reached, then for purposes of
establishing the number of Account

Years that an account has be in existence, credit will be given
for the time that the contributions

were in the Recurring Contribution Contract. See "Withdrawal
Charge."

(3) The Administrative Charge may be less than $30.00 per year,
based on the size of the
Participant's Account. The maximum charge imposed will be the
lesser of 0.5% of the
Participant's Account Value or $30.00 per year. There are no
Administrative Charges applied to
Single Contribution Contracts.

(4) AUL has currently agreed to waive its advisory fee if the
ordinary expenses of a Portfolio
exceed 1% and, to the extent necessary, assume any expenses in
excess of its advisory fee so that
the expenses of each Portfolio, including the advisory fee but
excluding extraordinary expenses,
will not exceed 1% of the Portfolio's average daily net asset
value per year. The Adviser may
terminate the policy of reducing its fee and/or assuming Fund
expenses upon 30 days written
notice to the Fund and such policy will be terminated
automatically by the termination of the
Investment Advisory Agreement. During 1994, expenses did not
exceed 1% of the average daily
net asset value.

(5) These figures are based on expenses for the fiscal year 1994
and have been restated to reflect
anticipated expenses for 1995. Management and advisory expenses
include an administrative
service fee of 0.10% paid to Adviser's affiliate.

(6) The Other Expenses number of 0.57% contains 0.25% for
12b-1fees. In addition, if necessary,
certain Fund expenses incurred on or after September 1, 1994 will
be absorbed voluntarily by the
Fund's investment adviser and subadviser in order to ensure that
the Fund's total operating
expenses will not exceed 1.21% of the Fund's net assets.

(7)Based upon fees paid by the fund for the 1994 fiscal year. The
fund pays an annual
management fee equal to 1.90% of its first $1 billion of average
net assets, 1.25% of the next $1
billion, and 1.00% of average net assets over $2 billion.

(8)Management fees and expenses estimated for 1995. The
Contrafund commenced operations on
January 3, 1995 and first became available under AUL Contracts on
April 28, 1995.

(9)The fund's expenses were voluntarily reduced by the fund's
investment adviser. Absent such
reimbursement, management fee, other expenses, and total expenses
would have been 0.28%,
0.53%, and 0.81%, respectively.
Examples (for any Investment Account)


The following examples show expenses (for the Portfolios that had
commenced operations prior

to June 1, 1995) that a Participant would pay at the end of one,
three, five, or ten years if at the

end of those time periods, the Account is (1) surrendered, or (2)
not surrendered. Example (2)

will also apply to a Participant Account that is annuitized at
the end of the applicable time period.

The information below represents expenses on a $1,000
contribution and assumes a 5% return per
year. For an account that is surrendered, the example shows
expenses for Recurring Contribution

Contracts, and Single Contribution Contracts. Expenses will be
the same for all Contracts if not

surrendered. These examples should not be considered a
representation of past or future

expenses. Actual expenses may be greater or less than those
shown. The assumed 5% return is

hypothetical and should not be considered a representation of
past or future returns, which may be

greater or less than the assumed amount. For Recurring
Contribution Contracts, the

Administrative charge used in these examples is based on an
estimated average Participant

Account of $10,000. A pro-rata portion of the annual
Administrative Charge has, therefore, been
used in the calculations for Recurring Contribution Contracts.

PERFORMANCE OF THE INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS


The following tables present the return on investment for the
Investment Accounts. For all of the

figures shown below, return on investment represents a change in
the Account Value allocated to

an Investment Account and takes into account Variable Account
annual expenses such as the

mortality and expense risk charge. For the Investment Accounts
that have not been in existence

for the time periods indicated, the reported performance
represents hypothetical returns that the
Investment Accounts that invest in the corresponding Mutual Fund
Portfolios would have

achieved had they invested in such Portfolios for the periods
indicated. For the periods that a

particular Investment Account has been in existence (see
"Inception Date of Investment

Account"), then the performance is actual performance and not
hypothetical in nature. The AUL

American Tactical Asset Allocation Portfolio had not commenced
operations as of December 31,

1994.

INFORMATION ABOUT AUL, THE VARIABLE ACCOUNT, AND THE FUNDS


American United Life Insurance Company

AUL is a legal reserve mutual life insurance company existing
under the laws of the State of

Indiana. It was originally incorporated as a fraternal society on
November 7, 1877, under the laws

of the Federal government, and reincorporated under the laws of
the State of Indiana in 1933. It is

qualified to do business in 46 states and the District of
Columbia. As a mutual company, it is

owned by and operated exclusively for the benefit of its
policyowners. AUL has its principal

business office located at One American Square, Indianapolis,
Indiana 46204.

AUL conducts a conventional life insurance, health insurance,
reinsurance, and annuity business.

At December 31, 1994, AUL had admitted assets of $5,955,710,705
and a policyowners' surplus

of $250,294,754.

The principal underwriter for the Contracts is AUL, which is
registered with the SEC as a

broker-dealer.

Variable Account

AUL American Unit Trust was established by AUL on August 17,
1989, under procedures

established under Indiana law. The income, gains, or losses of
the Variable Account are credited

to or charged against the assets of the Variable Account without
regard to other income, gains, or

losses of AUL. AUL owns the assets in the Variable Account and is
required to maintain

sufficient assets in the Variable Account to meet all Variable
Account obligations under the

Contracts. AUL may transfer to its General Account assets that
exceed anticipated obligations of

the Variable Account. All obligations arising under the Contracts
are general corporate

obligations of AUL. AUL may invest its own assets in the Variable
Account, and may accumulate

in the Variable Account proceeds from Contract charges and
investment results applicable to

those assets.


The Variable Account is currently divided into twenty-three
Investment Accounts. Each

Investment Account invests exclusively in shares of a specific
mutual fund or in a specific

Portfolio of one of the Funds. Contributions may be allocated to
one or more Investment

Accounts available under a Contract. Not all Investment Accounts
may be available under a

particular Contract and some of the Investment Accounts are
unavailable for certain types of

Contracts. AUL may in the future

establish additional Investment Accounts of the Variable Account,
which may invest in other

Portfolios of the Funds or in other securities, mutual funds, or
investment vehicles.


The Variable Account is registered with the SEC as a unit
investment trust under the Investment

Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"). Registration with the SEC
does not involve supervision

by the SEC of the administration or investment practices of the
Variable Account or of AUL.

THE CONTRACTS

General

The Contracts are offered for use in connection with retirement
plans that meet the requirements

of Sections 401, 403(b), 408, or 457 of the Internal Revenue
Code. Certain Federal tax

advantages are currently available to retirement plans that
qualify as (1) self-employed individuals'
retirement plans under Section 401, such as HR-10 Plans, (2)
pension or profit-sharing plans

established by an Employer for the benefit of its employees under

Section 401, (3) annuity

purchase plans sponsored by certain tax-exempt organizations or
public school organizations

under Section 403(b), (4) individual retirement accounts or
annuities, including those established

by an employer as a simplified employee pension plan, under

Section 408, or (5) deferred

compensation plans for employees established by a unit of a state
or local government or by a

tax-exempt organization under Section 457.

A Contract is issued to the Owner. Generally, persons eligible to
participate in the Owner's Plan

are eligible to become Participants under the Contract. The Owner
shall be responsible for

determining persons who are eligible tobecome Participants and
for designating such persons to

AUL. AUL will issue to the Owner for delivery to each Participant
(or may deliver directly to

each Participant) a Certificate that evidences the Participant's
participation in the Contract. For

purposes of determining benefits under a Contract, an account
called a Participant's Account is

established for each Participant during the Accumulation Period.
The Owner of the Contract is generally responsible for providing
all communications and

instructions concerning Participant Accounts to AUL. However, in
some instances

a Participant may communicate directly with AUL. For example, a
Participant in a 403(b)

Program may request a partial withdrawal directly from AUL. While
the Owner generally is

responsible for transmitting contributions and instructions for
Par-

ticipants, the Participant may be permitted or required to make
certain decisions and elections

under the Contract, as specified by the Owner in the Plan, trust,
or other appropriate document.

The pertinent Plan document and, if applicable, the Employer's
plan administrator should be

consulted with any questions on benefits under the Contract.

CONTRIBUTIONS AND CONTRACT VALUES DURING THE ACCUMULATION PERIOD

Contributions under the Contracts

Contributions under Recurring Contribution Contracts may be made
by or on behalf of a

Participant at any time during the Participant's life and before
the Participant's Annuity

Commencement Date. Contributions must be at least equal to the
minimum required contribution

and the amount of contributions made by or on behalf of a
Participant is subject to certain

limitations. Contributions for each Participant under a Recurring
Contribution Contract used for a

403(b) Program must total at least $200 each Contract Year.
Contributions for each Participant
under a Recurring Contribution Contract used for any other Plan
must total at least $300 each
Contract Year. In Single Contribution Contracts, the minimum
contributions for each Participant
must be at least $100,000. Contributions of less than $100,000
will initially be allocated to a
Recurring Contribution Contract. To allow the consolidation of
assets from different sources,
Participants will be allowed a twelve month period, measured from
the date of first deposit, to
reach the $100,000 minimum required contribution for Single
Contribution Contracts. If the
$100,000 required minimum contribution for Single Contribution
Contracts is received within the
twelve month period, measured from the date of the first deposit,
then the Participant's Account
Value will be immediately transferred to a Single Contribution
Contract


pursuant to a Transfer Agreement between AUL and the Participant.
However, after this twelve

month period, no further contributions will be accepted to that
specific Account under a Single

Contribution Contract and any subsequent contributions will be
allocated to a Recurring

Contribution Contract, unless the $100,000 minimum contribution
for an additional Single

Contribution Contract is met. AUL may change the minimum
contributions permitted under a

Contract, but any such change shall apply only to Participant
Accounts established on or after the

effective date of the change. AUL may, at its discretion, waive
any minimum required

contribution.

Annual contributions under any of the Plans are subject to
maximum limits imposed by the

Internal Revenue Code. See the Statement of Additional
Information for a discussion of these

limits or consult the pertinent Plan document.
Ten-Day Free Look

Under 403(b) and 408 Contracts, the Owner has the right to return
the Contract for any reason

within ten days of receipt. If a particular state requires a
longer free-look period, Owners in that

state will be allowed the longer statutory period in which to
return the Contract. If this right is

exercised, the Contract will be considered void from its
inception and any contributions will be

fully refunded.

Initial and Single Contributions


Initial contributions received for a Participant will be credited
to the Participant's Account no later

than the end of the second Business Day after it is received by
AUL at its Home Office if it is

preceded or accompanied by a completed application for the
Participant that contains all the

information necessary for opening the Participant's Account. The
application form will be

provided by AUL. If AUL does not receive a complete application
for a Participant, AUL will

notify the applicant that AUL does not have the necessary
information to open the account. If the

necessary information is not provided to AUL within five Business
Days after AUL first receives

the initial contribution, AUL will return the initial
contribution to the contributing party.

However, if the Contract so allows, AUL may retain the
contribution, if consent is received, until
the application for the Participant is made complete.


Allocation of Contributions

Initial and subsequent contributions under the Contracts will be
allocated among the Investment

Accounts of the Variable Account and the Fixed Account as
instructed by the Owner or

Participant and as provided by the terms of the Contract. The
investment allocation of the initial

contribution is to be designated on an investment allocation form
at the time the enrollment

application is completed and the completed allocation form should
accompany the enrollment

application to open an account for a Participant. The enrollment
application specifies that in the

absence of an investment allocation form or other instructions,
initial and subsequent

contributions shall be allocated to the AUL American Money Market
Investment Account. A

Participant's Account Value that has been initially allocated to
the Money Market Investment

Account may be transferred to other available investment options
upon receipt by AUL at its

Home Office of an investment allocation form or other proper
request. Under some Contracts,

allocation to any Investment Account or the Fixed Account must be
made in increments of 10%,

25%, or 331/3% of any contribution. Not all Investment Accounts
may be available under a

particular Contract, and some of the Investment Accounts are
unavailable for certain types of

Contracts.

Any change in allocation instructions will be effective upon
receipt by AUL at its Home Office

and will continue in effect until subsequently changed. Changes
in the allocation of future

contributions have no effect on amounts already contributed on
behalf of a Participant. Such

amounts, however, may be transferred among the Investment
Accounts of the Variable Account

or the Fixed Account in the manner described in "Transfers of
Account Value."

Subsequent Contributions Under Recurring Contribution Contracts


When forwarding contributions to AUL, the amount being
contributed on behalf of each

Participant must be specified. The contributions shall be
allocated among the Investment

Accounts of the Variable Account that are available under a
Contract and the Fixed Account as

described above in "Allocation of Contributions." Contributions
(other than the initial contribution

for each Participant) are credited as of the end of the Valuation
Period in which they are received

by AUL at its Home Office. A contribution shall be received by
AUL at its Home Office at such

time as AUL has received full payment for the contribution, the
information needed to establish

the Participant's account, and proper instructions regarding the
application and allocation of the

contributions among Participants.


Transfers of Account Value

All or part of a Participant's Variable Account Value may be
transferred among the Investment

Accounts of the Variable Account that are available under a
Contract or to the Fixed Account at

any time during the Accumulation Period upon receipt of a proper
written request by AUL at its

Home Office. Transfers may be made by telephone if a Telephone
Authorization Form has been

properly completed and received by AUL at its Home Office. The
minimum transfer from any

Investment Account or from the Fixed Account is the lesser of
$500 or a Participant's entire

Account Value in that Investment Account or in the Fixed Account,
provided however, that

amounts transferred from the Fixed Account to an Investment
Account during any given Contract

Year cannot exceed 20% of the Participant's Fixed Account Value
as of the beginning of that

Contract Year. However, if a Participant's Fixed Account Value at
the beginning of the Contract

Year is less than $2,500, the amount that will be transferred for
that Contract Year from the Fixed

Account is the lesser of $500

or the entire Fixed Account Value. If, after any transfer, the
Participant's remaining Account

Value in an Investment Account or in the Fixed Account would be
less than $500, then such

request will be treated as a request for a transfer of the entire
Account Value. Transfers may also

be subject to other limitations provided in a Plan document and
in the Contract. Currently, there

are no limitations on the number of transfers between Investment
Accounts available under a

Contract or the Fixed Account. In addition, no charges are
currently imposed upon transfers.

AUL reserves the right, however, at a future date, to change the
limitation on the minimum

transfer, to assess transfer charges, to change the limit on
remaining balances, to limit the number

and frequency of transfers, and to suspend the transfer privilege
or the telephone transfer

authorization. Any transfer from an Investment Account of the
Variable Account shall be effected

as of the end of the Valuation Date in which AUL receives the
request in proper form.

Participant's Variable Account Value

Accumulation Units

Contributions to be allocated to the Investment Accounts
available under a Contract will be

credited to the Participant's Account in the form of Accumulation
Units. Except for allocation of a

Participant's initial contribution, the number of Accumulation
Units to be credited is determined

by dividing the dollar amount allocated to the particular
Investment Account by the Accumulation

Unit value for the particular Investment Account at the end of
the Valuation Period in which the

contribution is received by AUL at its Home Office. The number of
Accumulation Units so

credited to the account shall not be changed by a subsequent
change in the value of an

Accumulation Unit, but the dollar value of an Accumulation Unit
may vary from Valuation Date

to Valuation Date depending upon the investment experience of the
Investment Account and

charges against the Investment Account.

Accumulation Unit Value

AUL determines the Accumulation Unit value for each Investment
Account of the Variable

Account on each Valuation Date. The Accumulation Unit value for
each Investment Account was

initially set at one dollar ($1) when operations commenced.
Subsequently, the Accumulation Unit

value for each Investment Account is determined by multiplying
the Net Investment Factor for the

particular Investment Account by the Accumulation Unit value for
the Investment Account as of

the immediately preceding Valuation Period. The Accumulation Unit
value for each Investment

Account may increase, decrease, or remain the same from Valuation
Period to Valuation Period in

accordance with the Net Investment Factor.
Net Investment Factor

The Net Investment Factor is used to measure the investment
performance of an Investment

Account from one Valuation Period to the next. For any Investment
Account for a Valuation

Period, the Net Investment Factor is determined by dividing (a)
by (b) and then subtracting (c)

from the result where

(a) is equal to:

(1) the net asset value per share of the Portfolio of the Fund in
which the Investment Account
invests, determined as of the end of the Valuation Period, plus

(2) the per share amount of any dividend or other distribution,
if any, paid by the Portfolio during
the Valuation Period, plus or minus

(3) a credit or charge with respect to taxes paid, if any, or
reserved for by AUL during the
Valuation Period that are determined by AUL to be attributable to
the operation of the Investment
Account (although no Federal income taxes are applicable under
present law and no such charge
is currently assessed).

(b) is the net asset value per share of the Portfolio, determined
as of the end of the preceding
Valuation Period; and

(c) is a daily charge factor determined by AUL to reflect the fee
assessed against the assets of the
Investment Account for the mortality and expense risk charge.


CASH WITHDRAWALS AND THE DEATH BENEFIT


Cash Withdrawals

During the lifetime of the Participant, at any time before the
Annuity Commencement Date and

subject to the limitations under the applicable Plan and
applicable law, a Participant's Account

may be surrendered or a partial withdrawal may be taken from a
Participant's Account Value. A

surrender or withdrawal request will be effective as of the end
of the Valuation Date that a proper

written request in a form acceptable to AUL is received by AUL at
its Home Office.

A full surrender of a Participant's Variable Account Value will
result in a withdrawal payment

equal to the value of the Participant's Variable Account Value as
of the end of the Valuation

Period during which a proper withdrawal request is received by
AUL at its Home Office, minus

any applicable withdrawal charge. A partial withdrawal may be
requested for a specified

percentage or dollar amount of a Participant's Variable Account
Value. A request for a partial

withdrawal will result in a payment by AUL equal to the amount
specified in the partial

withdrawal request. Upon payment, the Participant's Variable
Account Value will be reduced by

an amount equal to the payment and any applicable withdrawal
charge. If a partial withdrawal is

requested that would leave a Participant's Variable Account Value
in any Investment Account less

than $500, then such partial withdrawal request
will be treated as a request for a full withdrawal from the
Investment Account.

The minimum amount that may be withdrawn from a Participant's
Variable Account Value in an

Investment Account is the lesser of $500 or the Participant's
entire Account Value in the

Investment Account. However, if after the withdrawal, the amount
or value of the Investment

Account would be less than $500, then the request will be treated
as a request for a withdrawal of

the entire Account Value.

The amount of a partial withdrawal will be taken from the
Investment Accounts and the Fixed

Account as instructed. A partial withdrawal will not be effected
until proper instructions are

received by AUL at its Home Office.

A surrender or a partial withdrawal may result in the deduction
of a withdrawal charge. See

"Withdrawal Charge."

In addition, distributions under certain retirement programs may
result in a tax penalty. See "Tax

Penalty."

Systematic Withdrawal Service for 403(b) and 408 Programs
A Participant in a Contract used in connection with a 403(b) plan
(other than an Employer

Sponsored 403(b) plan) or 408 Program who is at least age 591/2
can arrange to have systematic

cash withdrawals from his or her Account Value paid on a regular
monthly, quarterly, or annual

basis. Each withdrawal payment must be at least equal to $100. An
application form containing

details of the service is available upon request from AUL. The
service is voluntary and can be

terminated at any time by the Participant or Owner. AUL does not
currently deduct a service

charge for withdrawal payments, but reserves the right to do so
in the future and similarly,

reserves the right to increase the minimum required amount for
each withdrawal payment.


Participants will pay a withdrawal charge in connection with the
systmatic cash withdrawals to the

extent the withdrawal charge is applicable (e.g., for a Recurring
Contribution Contract, during the

first ten Account Years and excluding the 10% allowable amount
each Contract Year. Systematic

withdrawals of up to 10% of (i) the total of all contributions
made during the year that the

withdrawal is being made, plus (ii) the Participant's Account
Value at the beginning of the

Contract Year may begin in the year the Participant's Account is
established. After the first two

Contract Years, and until the withdrawal charge has decreased to
0%, the amount withdrawn

during a Contract Year that will not be subject to a withdrawal
charge is 10% of the Participant's

Account Value at the beginning of the Contract Year in which the
withdrawal is being made. See

"Withdrawal Charge." In addition, receipt of the cash withdrawals
may result in the receipt of

taxable income to the Participant. See "Federal Tax Matters." No
withdrawal charges are applied

to "benefit responsive" Contracts for payment of retirement,
death, disability, termination of

employment, hardship, loan, age 701/2 required minimum
distribution benefits or benefits upon

attainment of age 591/2 (provided that the age 591/2 benefit is a
taxable distribution paid to the

Participant and not to any other person or entity, including any
alternative or substitute funding

medium). For certain other Contracts known as "modified benefit
responsive" Contracts,

withdrawal charges are not imposed for cash lump-sum payments of
death benefits. Withdrawal

charges are not imposed for cash lump-sum payments provided the
Participant has (1) attained

age 55 and has 10 years of service with the employer identified
in the Plan, or (2) attained age 62,

and is receiving benefits for retirement, disability, termination
of employment, hardships, loans, or

required minimum distribution benefits pursuant to Internal
Revenue Code Section 401 (a)(9) and

Regulations issued thereunder, or for benefits upon attainment of
age 591/2 (provided that such

benefit upon attainment of age 591/2 is a taxable distribution
paid to the Participant and not to

any other person or entity, including any substitute funding
medium).


Constraints on Withdrawals

General

Since the Contracts offered by this Prospectus will be issued in
connection with retirement plans

that meet the requirements of Section 401, Section 403(b),

Section 408, or Section 457 of the

Internal Revenue Code, reference should be made to the terms of
the particular Plan or Contract

for any limitations or restrictions on cash withdrawals. A
surrender or withdrawal that results in

receipt of proceeds by a Participant may result in receipt of
taxable income to the Participant and,

in some instances, in a tax penalty. The tax consequences of a
surrender or withdrawal under the

Contracts should be carefully considered. See "Federal Tax
Matters."

403(b) Programs

Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code permits public school
employees and employees of
certain types of charitable, educational, and scientific
organizations specified in Section 501(c)(3)
of the Internal Revenue Code to purchase annuity contracts, and,
subject to certain limitations, to
exclude the amount of purchase payments from gross income for
federal tax purposes. Section
403(b) imposes restrictions on certain distributions from
tax-sheltered annuity contracts meeting
the requirements of Section 403(b) that apply to tax years
beginning on or after January 1, 1989.

Section 403(b) requires that distributions from Section 403(b)
tax-sheltered annuities that are
attributable to employee contributions made after December 31,
1988 under a salary reduction
agreement not begin before the employee reaches age 591/2,
separates from service, dies,
becomes disabled, or incurs a hardship. Furthermore,
distributions of income or gains attributable
to such contributions accrued after December 31, 1988 may not be
made on account of hardship.
Hardship, for this purpose, is generally defined as an immediate
and heavy financial need, such as
paying for medical expenses, the purchase of a principal
residence, or paying certain tuition
expenses.
A Participant in a Contract purchased as a tax-sheltered Section
403(b) annuity contract will not,
therefore, be entitled to exercise the right of surrender or
withdrawal, as described in this
Prospectus, in order to receive his or her Account Value
attributable to contributions made under
a salary reduction agreement or any income or gains credited to
such Participant after December
31, 1988 under the Contract unless one of the above-described
conditions has been satisfied, or
unless the withdrawal is otherwise permitted under applicable
federal tax law. In the case of
transfers of amounts accumulated in a different Section 403(b)
contract to this Contract under a

Section 403(b) Program, the withdrawal constraints described
above would not apply to the
amount transferred to the Contract attributable to a
Participant's December 31, 1988 account
balance under the old contract, provided that the amounts
transferred between contracts qualifies
as a tax-free exchange under the Internal Revenue Code. A
Participant's Account Value in a
Contract may be able to be transferred to certain other
investment alternatives meeting the
requirements of Section 403(b) that are available under an
Employer's Section 403(b)
arrangement.

Texas Optional Retirement Program

AUL intends to offer the Contract within the Texas Optional
Retirement Program. Under the

terms of the Texas Optional Retirement Program, if a Participant
makes the required contribution,

the State of Texas will contribute a specified amount to the
Participant's Account. If a Participant

does not commence the second year of participation in the plan as
a "faculty member," as defined

in Title 110B of the State of Texas Statutes, AUL will return the
State's contribution. If a

Participant does begin a second year of participation, the
Employer's first-year contributions will
then be applied as a contribution under the Contract, as will the
Employer's subsequent

contributions.

The Attorney General of the State of Texas has ruled that under
Title 110B of the State of Texas

Statutes, withdrawal benefits of contracts issued under the
Optional Retirement Program are

available only in the event of a participant's death, retirement,
termination of employment due to

total disability, or other termination of employment in a Texas
public institution of higher

education. A Participant under a Contract issued in connection
with the Texas Optional

Retirement Program will not, therefore, be entitled to exer-
cise the right of surrender or withdrawal to receive the Account
Value credited to such

Participant unless one of the foregoing conditions has been
satisfied. The Withdrawal Value of

such Participant may, however, be transferred to other contracts
or other carriers during the

period of participation in the program.

The Death Benefit

If a Participant dies during the Accumulation Period, AUL will
pay a death benefit to the

Beneficiary upon receipt of due proof of the Participant's death
and instructions regarding

payment to the Beneficiary. If there is no designated Beneficiary
living on the date of death of the

Participant, AUL will pay the death benefit in one sum to the
estate of the Participant upon

receipt of due proof of death of both the Participant and the
designated Beneficiary and

instructions regarding payment. If the death of the Participant
occurs on or after the Annuity

Commencement Date, no death benefit will be payable under the
Contract except as may be

provided under the Annuity Option elected.

The amount of the death benefit equals the vested portion of the
Participant's Account Value

minus any outstanding loan balances and any due and unpaid
charges on those loans. Under

Contracts acquired in connection with 408 Programs,
457 Programs, and 403(b) Programs other than Employer Sponsored

403(b) Programs, the vested
portion of a Participant's Account Value shall be the
Participant's entire Account Value. Under
Employee Benefit Plans and Employer Sponsored 403(b) Programs,
the vested portion of a
Participant's Account Value is the amount to which the
Participant is entitled upon death or
separation from service under a vesting schedule contained in the
pertinent Plan. If the death
benefit is less than a Participant's Account Value, the death
benefit shall be paid pro rata from the
Investment Accounts and the Fixed Account, and the remainder of
the Account Value shall be
distributed to the Owner or as directed by the Owner. Prior to
such distribution, any remaining
Account Value in the Investment Accounts shall be transferred to
AUL's General Account. In the
case of a 457 Program, the Owner of the Contract shall be the
Beneficiary.
The death benefit will be paid to the Beneficiary in a single sum
or under one of the Annuity
Options, as directed by the Participant or as elected by the
Beneficiary. If the Beneficiary is to
receive annuity payments under an Annuity Option, there may be
limits under applicable law on
the amount and duration of payments that the Beneficiary may
receive, and requirements
respecting timing of payments. A tax adviser should be consulted
in considering payout options.
Termination by the Owner

An Owner of a Contract acquired in connection with an Employee
Benefit Plan, a 457 Program,

or an Employer Sponsored 403(b) Program may terminate the
Contract by sending proper written

notice of termination to AUL at its Home Office. Termination
shall be effective as of the end of

the Valuation Date that the notice is received by AUL at its Home
Office. Proper notice of

termination must include an election of the method of payment or
payments from AUL, an

indication of the person or persons to whom payment is to be
made, and the Owner's agreement

(and the Plan Sponsor's agreement, if the Contract is issued in
connection with an Employee

Benefit Plan or an Employer Sponsored 403(b) Program) that AUL
shall not be held responsible

for any losses or claims that may arise against AUL in connection
with making a payment or

payments upon termination.

Upon termination of such a Contract used in connection with an
Employee Benefit Plan, a 457

Program, or Employee Benefit Plan contributions in a combined
Contract for an Employee

Benefit Plan and Employer Sponsored 403(b)
Plan, the Owner (and the Plan Sponsor, if the Contract is issued
in connection with an Employee

Benefit Plan) may elect from two payment options. Under one
option, AUL will pay an amount

equal to the aggregate Withdrawal Values of all of the
Participant Accounts under the Contract

determined as of the end of the Valuation Date that the
termination is effective, minus any

applicable Investment Liquidation Charge. The Investment
Liquidation Charge applies only to

Participants' Fixed Account Values under these Contracts. The
charge is equal to a certain

percentage, as described below, multiplied by the Withdrawal
Value derived from the Fixed

Account of each Participant under a Contract. The percentage is
determined by the following

formula: 6(x - y), where "x" is the Current Rate of interest, as
described under "Interest," being

credited by AUL to new Contributions allocated to the Fixed
Account as of the effective date of

termination, and "y" is the average rate of interest being
credited by AUL to various portions of a
Participant's Fixed Account Value as of the effective date of
termination. Payment under this

option shall be made as described under "Payments from the
Variable Account," except that

payment of amounts attributable to the Fixed Account may be
delayed for up to six months after

the effective date of termination.

Under the second payment option for a 457 Program Contract, AUL
will pay an amount equal to

the aggregate Withdrawal Values derived from the Variable Account
of all Participants under the

Contract determined as of the end of the Valuation Date on which
termination is effective.

Payment of this amount shall be made as described under "Payments
from the Variable Account."

AUL will also pay an amount equal to the aggregate Withdrawal
Values derived from the Fixed

Account of all Participants under the Contract as of the Contract
Anniversary immediately

succeeding the effective date of termination. This amount shall
be payable in six equal annual

installments, the first of which shall be paid on the Contract
Anniversary immediately succeeding

the effective date of termination. As of this date, AUL shall
have the right to refuse to accept

further contributions and shall cease to maintain individual
Participant Accounts, and amounts

remaining under the Contract after each annual installment shall
be paid interest by AUL at an

annual effective rate that shall be equal to the lesser of (a)
the weighted average of each of the

various Current Rates of interest being credited to amounts held
in the Fixed Account under the

Contract determined as of the Contract Anniversary immediately
succeeding the effective date of

termination, or (b) the interest rate for U.S. Government
Security Treasury Constant Maturity for

three years (as set forth in the Federal Reserve Statistical
Releases), as determined on the

Business Day coincident with or next following the Contract
Anniversary immediately succeeding

the effective date of termination. Interest earned during the
Contract Year following payment of

any annual installment shall be paid by AUL on the next
succeeding Contract Anniversary.

Under the second payment option for an Employee Benefit Plan
Contract, or for the Employee

Benefit Plan contributions in a combined Contract for an Employee
Benefit Plan and Employer

Sponsored 403(b) Plan, AUL will pay an amount equal to the
aggregate Withdrawal Values

derived from the Variable Account of all Participants under the
Contract determined as of the end

of the Valuation Date on which termination is effective. Payment
shall be made as described under

"Payments from the Variable Account." AUL will also pay amounts
derived from the Fixed

Account in seven annual installments as follows: As of the first
Contract Anniversary immediately

succeeding the effective date of termination, one-seventh of that
portion of the Withdrawal Value

of each Participant's Account consisting of  the net dollar
balance in the Fixed Account credited to
each such Participant's Account will be calculated and paid. On
the next succeeding six Contract

Anniversaries thereafter, a fraction of the remaining Withdrawal
Values will be paid. The fraction

paid in each succeeding year shall have the number "1" as the
numerator and the denominator

shall be a number which is, numerically, "1" less than the
denominator of the fraction paid on the

prior Contract Anniversary. Therefore, the payment on the second
Contract Anniversary would be

one-sixth, on the third Contract Anniversary, the payment would
be one-fifth, and so forth until

the final payment is the remaining balance in the Fixed Account
credited to each

such Participant. Until all funds have been paid by AUL, the
Current Rates of interest credited to

other Contracts of the same type will be credited to the
remaining Withdrawal Values.

Upon termination of a Contract used in connection with an
Employer Sponsored 403(b) Program

or a combined Contract for an Employee Benefit Plan and Employer
Sponsored 403(b) Plan,

AUL shall have the right to refuse to accept further
contributions. Upon such a termination,

amounts attributable to Employer Sponsored 403(b) contributions
will be paid by AUL as

described in the prior paragraph.

Termination by AUL

AUL has the right, subject to applicable state law, to terminate
any Participant's Account

established under a Contract acquired in connection with an
Employee Benefit Plan, a 457

Program, or an Employer Sponsored 403(b) Program at any time
during the Contract Year if the

Participant's Account Value falls below $300 ($200 for an
Employer Sponsored 403(b) Program

or for a Contract with both 403(b) and 401(a) funds) during the
first Contract Year, or $500

($400 for an Employer Sponsored 403(b) Program or for a Contract
with both 403(b) and 401(a)

funds) during any subsequent Contract Year, provided that at
least six months have elapsed since

the Owner's last contribution to the Contract. AUL will give
notice to the Owner and the

Participant that the Participant's Account is to be terminated.
Termination shall be effective six

months from the date that AUL gives such notice, provided that
any contributions made during

the six month notice period are insufficient to bring the
Participant's Account Value up to the

applicable minimum. Single Contribution Contracts have a minimum
required contribution of

$100,000. After the twelve month contribution period, as measured
from the date of first deposit,

no further contri-

butions to that specific Account will be accepted or required
under Single Contribution Contracts

and AUL will not terminate such a Contract or Account for failure
to make further contributions.

Upon termination of a Participant's Account by AUL, AUL will pay
an amount equal to the

Participant's Account Value as of the close of business on the
effective date of termination.

Payment of this amount will be made within seven days from such
effective date of termination.

AUL may, at its option, terminate any Contract if there are no
Participant Accounts in existence

under the Contract.

Payments from the Variable Account

Payment of an amount from the Variable Account resulting from a
surrender, cash withdrawal,

transfer from a Participant's Variable Account Value, payment of
the death benefit, or payment

upon termination by the Owner will be made within seven days from
the date a proper request is

received at AUL's Home Office. However, AUL can postpone the
calculation or payment of such

an amount to the extent permitted under applicable law, which is
currently permissible only for

any period (a) during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed
other than customary

week-end and holiday closings, (b) during which trading on the
New York Stock Exchange is

restricted as determined by the SEC, (c) during which an
emergency, as determined by the SEC,

exists as a result of which (i) disposal of securities held by
the Variable Account is not reasonably

practicable, or (ii) it is not reasonably practicable to
determine the value of the assets of the
Variable Account, or (d) for such other periods as the SEC may by
order permit for the

protection of investors. For information concerning payment of an
amount from the Fixed

Account, see "The Fixed Account" and "Termination by the Owner."


CHARGES AND DEDUCTIONS


Premium Tax Charge

Various states and municipalities impose a tax on premiums
received by insurance companies.

Whether or not a premium tax is imposed will depend upon, among
other things, the Owner's

state of residence, the Annuitant's state of residence, and the
insurance tax laws and AUL's status

in a particular state. AUL assesses a premium tax charge to
reimburse itself for premium taxes

that it incurs. This charge will be deducted as premium taxes are
incurred by AUL, which is

usually when an annuity is effected. Premium tax rates currently
range from 0% to 3.5%, but are

subject to change by such governmental entities.
Withdrawal Charge

No deduction for sales charges is made from contributions for a
Contract. However, if a cash

withdrawal is made, a Participant's Account is surrendered, or
the Contract is terminated by the

Owner, then, depending on the type of Contract, a withdrawal
charge (which may also be referred

to as a contingent deferred sales charge) may be assessed by AUL
if the Participant's Account has

not been in existence for a certain period of time. For the first
two Contract Years that a

Participant's Account exists, the amount withdrawn during a
Contract Year that will not be

subject to a withdrawal charge is 10% of (1) the total of all
contributions made during the year

that the withdrawal is being made, plus (2) the Participant's
Account Value at the beginning of the

Contract Year. After the first two Contract Years, and until the
withdrawal charge has decreased

to 0%, the amount withdrawn during a Contract Year that will not
be subject to an otherwise

applicable withdrawal charge is 10% of the Participant's Account
Value at the beginning of the

Contract Year in which the withdrawal is being made. If a
Participant's contributions were initially
allocated to a Recurring Contribution Contract and then
transferred to a Single Contribution

Contract pursuant to a Transfer Agreement between AUL and the
Participant when the required

minimum of $100,000 was reached, then, for purposes of
establishing the number of Account

Years that an account has been in existence, credit will be given
for the time that the contributions

were in the Recurring Contribution Contract. The chart below
illustrates the amount of the

withdrawal charge that applies to the different types of
Contracts based on the number of years

that the Account has been in existence.


Charge on Withdrawal Exceeding 10% Allowable Amount
Account  Year 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 or more
Recurring Contribution Contracts 8% 8% 8% 8% 8% 4% 4% 4% 4% 4% 0%
Single Contribution Contracts 6% 5% 4% 3% 2% 1% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0%
Withdrawal charges are not imposed for many benefits provided
under "benefit responsive"

Contracts. A "benefit responsive" Contract can be distinguished
from a Contract that is not

"benefit responsive" by the contractual condition that under a
"benefit responsive" Contract,

withdrawal charges are not imposed for payment of retirement,
death, disability, termination of

employment, hardship, loan, age 701/2 required minimum
distribution benefits, or benefits upon

attainment of age 591/2 (provided that the age 591/2 benefit is a
taxable distribution paid to the

Participant and not to any other person or entity, including any
alternative or substitute fund medium).

Under certain circumstances,

withdrawal charges are not imposed under "modified benefit
responsive" Contracts. A "modified

benefit responsive" Contract can be distinguished from a Contract
that is not "modified benefit

responsive" by the contractual condition that under a "modified
benefit responsive" Contract,

withdrawal charges are not imposed for cash lump-sum payments of
death benefits, or, provided

the Participant has (1) attained age 55 and has 10 years of
service with the employer identified in

the Plan, or (2) attained age 62 for Plan benefits due to
retirement, disability, termination of

employment, hardships, loans, or required minimum distribution
benefits pursuant to Internal

Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9) and Regulations issued thereunder,
or for benefits upon

attainment of age 591/2 (provided that such benefit upon
attainment of age 591/2 is a taxable

distribution paid to the Participant and not to any other person
or entity, including any substitute

funding medium).


In no event will the amount of any withdrawal charge, when added
to any withdrawal charges

previously assessed against any amount withdrawn from a
Participant's Account, exceed 9% of

the contributions made by or on behalf of a Participant under a
Contract. In addition, no

withdrawal charge will be imposed on or after the Annuity
Commencement Date or upon payment

of a death benefit under the Contract.

The withdrawal charge will be used to recover certain expenses
relating to sales of the Contracts,

including commissions paid to sales personnel and other
promotional costs. AUL reserves the

right to increase the withdrawal charge for any Participant
Accounts established on or after the

effective date of the change, but the withdrawal charge will not
exceed 9% of the contributions

made by or on behalf of a Participant.

Mortality and Expense Risk Charge

AUL deducts a daily charge from the assets of each Investment
Account for mortality and

expense risks assumed by AUL. The charge is equal to an annual
rate of 1.25% of the average

daily net assets of each Investment Account. This amount is
intended to compensate AUL for

certain mortality and expense risks AUL assumes in offering and
administering the Contracts and

in operating the Variable Account. The 1.25% charge was
originally based on estimates of .40%

for expense risk and .85% for mortality risk.

The expense risk is the risk that AUL's actual expenses in
issuing and administering the Contracts

and operating the Variable Account will be more than the charges
assessed for such expenses. The

mortality risk borne by AUL is the risk that Annuitants, as a
group, will live longer than the

Company's actuarial tables predict. AUL may ultimately realize a
profit from this charge to the

extent it is not needed to address mortality and administrative
expenses, but AUL may realize a

loss to the extent the charge is not sufficient. AUL may use any
profit derived from this charge for

any lawful purpose, including any distribution expenses not
covered by the withdrawal charge.

Administrative Charge

Under Recurring Contribution Contracts, AUL deducts an
administrative charge from each

Participant's Account equal to the lesser of 0.5% of the
Participant's Account Value or $7.50 a

quarter. The charge is assessed every quarter on a Participant
Account if it is in effect on the

quarterly Contract Anniversary, and is assessed only during the
Accumulation Period. When a

Participant annuitizes or surrenders on any day other than a
quarterly Contract Anniversary, a pro

rata portion of the charge for that portion of the quarter will
not be assessed. The charge is

deducted proportionately from the Participant's Account Value
allocated among the Investment

Accounts and the Fixed Account. The purpose of this charge is to
reimburse AUL for the

expenses associated with administration of the Contracts and
operation of the Variable Account.

The Administrative charge may, at the Employer's option, be
billed directly to and paid directly

by, the Employer in lieu of being deducted from a Participant's
Account under Employer

Sponsored 403(b) Contracts or under combined Contracts containing
an Employee Benefit Plan

and Employer Sponsored 403(b) contributions, or the charge may be
paid on any other basis

mutually agreed upon by the Employer and AUL. AUL does not expect
to profit from this charge.

There is no Administrative Charge deducted from Participant's
accounts that are allocated to

Single Contribution Contracts.

Other Charges

AUL may charge the Investment Accounts of the Variable Account
for the federal, state, or local

income taxes incurred by AUL that are attributable to the
Variable Account and its Investment

Accounts. No such charge is currently assessed. An Investment
Liquidation Charge, which applies

only to Participants' Fixed Account Values under a Contract, may
be imposed upon termination

by an Owner of a Contract acquired in connection with an Employee
Benefit Plan or 457

Program. See "Termination by the Owner."
Variations in Charges

AUL may reduce or waive the amount of the withdrawal charge and
administrative charge for a

Contract where the expenses associated with the sale of the
Contract or the administrative costs

associated with the Contract are reduced.

For example, the withdrawal and/or administrative charge may be
reduced in connection with

acquisition of the Contract in exchange for another annuity
contract issued by AUL. AUL may

also reduce or waive the withdrawal charge and administrative
charge on Contracts sold to the

directors or employees of AUL or any of its affiliates or to
directors or any employees of any of

the Funds.

Guarantee of Certain Charges

AUL guarantees that the mortality and expense risk charge shall
not increase. AUL also

guarantees that through the year 2000, the administrative charge
may not increase to more<EL>
than $15.00 per quarter. After the year 2000, AUL may increase
the fee but only to the extent

necessary to recover the expenses associated with administration
of the Contracts and operation

of the Variable Account.

Expenses of the Funds

Each Investment Account of the Variable Account purchases shares
at the net asset value of the

corresponding Portfolio of one of the Funds. The net asset value
reflects the investment advisory

fee and other expenses that are deducted from the assets of the
Portfolio. The advisory fees and

other expenses are more fully described in the Funds'
Prospectuses.


ANNUITY PERIOD


General

On the Annuity Commencement Date, the adjusted value of the
Participant's Account may be

applied to provide an annuity under one of the options described
below. The adjusted value will

be equal to the value of the Participant's Account as of the
Annuity Commencement Date,

reduced by any applicable premium or similar taxes and any
outstanding loan balances and unpaid

expense charges on those loans.

The Contracts provide for five optional annuity forms, any one of
which may be elected if

permitted by the particular Plan or applicable law. A lump sum
distribution may also be elected

under most Plans. Other Annuity Options may be available upon
request at the discretion of AUL.

All Annuity Options are fixed and the annuity payments remain
constant throughout the Annuity

Period. Annuity payments are based upon annuity rates that vary
with the Annuity Option selected

and the age of the Annuitant (except that in the case of Option
5, the Fixed Period Option, age is

not a consideration). The annuity rates are based upon an assumed
interest rate of 4%,

compounded annually. If no Annuity Option has been selected for a
Participant, annuity payments

will be made to the Annuitant under an automatic option. For

403(b) (other than Employer
Sponsored 403(b) Programs) and 457 Programs, the automatic option
shall be an annuity payable
during the lifetime of the Annuitant with payments certain for
120 months. For an Employee
Benefit Plan or Employer Sponsored 403(b) Program, the automatic
option shall be an annuity
payable during the lifetime of the Annuitant with payments
certain for 120 months or, for a
married Annuitant, a Survivorship Annuity as described in Option
3 below. For 408 Programs, the
automatic option for unmarried Participants shall be a 10 Year
Certain and Life Annuity; for
married Participants, the automatic option shall be a 50%
Survivorship Annuity. For "benefit
responsive" Employer Sponsored 403(b) Contracts, and for an
Employee Benefit Plan combined
with an Employer Sponsored 403(b) Contract, there is no automatic
annuity option.
Once annuity payments have commenced, a Participant cannot
surrender his or her annuity and
receive a lump sum settlement in lieu thereof and cannot change
the Annuity Option. If, under any
option, monthly payments are less than $25 each, AUL has the
right to make either a lump sum
settlement or to make larger payments at quarterly, semi-annual,
or annual intervals. AUL also
reserves the right to change the minimum payment amount. AUL will
not allow annuitization of a
Participant's Account if the total Account Value is less than
$2000. Should this occur, a
Participant will receive the Account Value in a lump sum
settlement.
Annuity payments will begin on the Annuity Commencement Date. No
withdrawal charge will be
applied on this Date.
A Participant or, depending on the Contract, an Owner on behalf
of a Participant, may designate
an Annuity Commencement Date, Annuity Option, contingent
Annuitant, and Beneficiary on an
Annuity Election Form that must be received by AUL at its Home
Office at least 30 days prior to
the Annuity Commencement Date. AUL may also require additional
information before annuity
payments commence. During the lifetime of the Participant and up
to 30 days prior to the Annuity
Commencement Date, the Annuity Option, the Annuity Commencement
Date, or the designation
of a contingent Annuitant or Beneficiary, if any, under an
Annuity Option may be changed. To
help ensure timely receipt of the first annuity payment, a
transfer of a Participant's Variable
Account Value should be made to the Fixed Account at least two
weeks prior to the Annuity
Commencement Date.
Annuity Options

Option 1 -- Life Annuity

An annuity payable monthly during the lifetime of the Annuitant
that ends with the last monthly

payment before the death of the Annuitant.
Option 2 -- Certain and Life Annuity

An annuity payable monthly during the lifetime of the Annuitant
with the promise that if, at the

death of the Annuitant, payments have been made for less that a
stated period, which may be five,

ten, fifteen, or twenty years, as elected, annuity payments will
be continued during the remainder

of such period to the Beneficiary.

Option 3 -- Survivorship Annuity

An annuity payable monthly during the lifetime of the Annuitant,
and, after the death of the

Annuitant, an amount equal to 50%, 662/3%, or 100% (as specified
in the election) of such

annuity will be paid to the contingent Annuitant named in the
election if and so long as such

contingent Annuitant lives.

An election of this option is automatically cancelled if either
the Participant or the contingent

Annuitant dies before the Annuity Commencement Date.
Option 4 -- Unit Refund Life Annuity

An annuity payable monthly during the lifetime of the Annuitant
that ends with the last payment

due prior to the death of the Annuitant, except, that at the
death of the Annuitant, the Beneficiary

will receive additional annuity payments until the amount paid to
purchase the annuity has been

distributed.

Option 5 -- Fixed Periods

An annuity payable monthly for a fixed period (not less than 5
years or more than 30 years) as

elected, with the guarantee that if, at the death of the
Annuitant, payments have been made for

less than the selected fixed period, annuity payments will be
continued during the remainder of

said period to the Beneficiary.

Selection of an Option

Participants should carefully review the Annuity Options
with their financial or tax advisers, and reference should be
made to the terms of a particular Plan

for pertinent limitations respecting annuity payments and other
matters. For instance, under

requirements for retirement plans that qualify for treatment
under Sections 401, 403(b), 408, or

457 of the Internal Revenue Code, annuity payments generally must
begin no later than April 1 of

the calendar year following the calendar year in which the
Participant reaches age 701/2. For

Options 2 and 5, the period elected for receipt of annuity
payments under the terms of the Annuity

Option generally may be no longer than the joint life expectancy
of the Annuitant and Beneficiary

in the year that the Annuitant reaches age 701/2 and must be
shorter than such joint life

expectancy if the Beneficiary is not the Annuitant's spouse and
is more than 10 years younger than

the Annuitant. Under Option 3, if the contingent Annuitant is not
the Annuitant's spouse and is

more than 10 years younger than the Annuitant, the 662/3% and
100% elections specified above

may not be available.


THE FIXED ACCOUNT


Contributions or transfers to the Fixed Account become part of
AUL's General Account. The

General Account is subject to regulation and supervision by the
Indiana Insurance Department as

well as the insurance laws and regulations of other jurisdictions
in which the Contracts are

distributed. In reliance on certain exemptive and exclusionary
provisions, interests in the Fixed

Account have not been registered as securities under the
Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act")

and the Fixed Account has not been registered as an investment
company under the 1940 Act.

Accordingly, neither the Fixed Account nor any interests therein
are generally subject to the

provisions of the 1933 Act or the 1940 Act. AUL has been advised
that the staff of the SEC has

not reviewed the disclosure in this Prospectus relating to the
Fixed Account. This disclosure,

however, may be subject to certain generally applicable
provisions of the federal securities laws
relating to the accuracy and completeness of statements made in
the Prospectus. This Prospectus

is generally intended to serve as a disclosure document only for
aspects of a Contract involving

the Variable Account and contains only selected information
regarding the Fixed Account. For

more information regarding the Fixed Account, see the Contract
itself or a Participant's

Certificate.

Interest

A Participant's Fixed Account Value earns interest at fixed rates
that are paid by AUL. The

Account Value in the Fixed Account earns interest at one or more
interest rates determined by

AUL at its discretion ("Current Rate"), which are guaranteed to
be at least an annual effective rate

of 4% per year ("Guaranteed Rate"). AUL will determine a Current
Rate from time to time, and

any Current Rate that exceeds the Guaranteed Rate will be in
effect for a period of at least one

year. If AUL determines a Current Rate in excess of the
Guaranteed Rate, contributions or

transfers to a Participant's Account during the time the Current
Rate is in effect are guaranteed to

earn interest at that particular Current Rate for at least one
year. AUL may declare a different

Current Rate for a particular contract based on costs of
acquisition to AUL or the level of service
provided by AUL. Transfers from other AUL annuity contracts may
be transferred at a rate of

interest different than the Current Rate.

Except for transfers from other AUL annuity contracts, and
automatic transfers to Single

Contribution Contracts from Recurring Contribution Contracts when
the minimum required

contribution of $100,000 is reached, amounts contributed or
transferred to the Fixed Account

earn interest at the Current Rate then in effect. Amounts
transferred from other AUL annuity

contracts may not earn the Current Rate, but may, at AUL's
discretion, continue to earn the rate

of interest which was paid under the former Contract. Automatic
transfers to Single Contribution

Contracts will, as of the date of such transfer, be credited with
the Single Contribution Contract

interest rate which was in effect on the date the transferred
contribution was originally deposited

into the Recurring Contribution Contract. If AUL changes the
Current Rate, such amounts

contributed or transferred on or after the effective date of the
change earn interest at the new

Current Rate; however, amounts contributed or transferred prior
to the effective date of the

change may earn interest at the prior Current Rate or other
Current Rate determined by AUL.

Therefore, at any given time, various portions of a Participant's
Fixed Account Value may be

earning interest at different Current Rates for different periods
of time, depending upon when

such portions were originally contributed or transferred to the
Fixed Account. AUL bears the

investment risk for Participant's Fixed Account Values and for
paying interest at the Current Rate

on amounts allocated to the Fixed Account.


AUL reserves the right at any time to change the Guaranteed Rate
of interest for any Participant

Accounts established on or after the effective date of the
change, although once a Participant

Account is established, the Guaranteed Rate may not be changed
for the duration of that Account.

Withdrawals and Transfers

A Participant may make a full surrender or a partial withdrawal
from his or her Fixed Account

Value subject to the provisions of the Contract. A full surrender
of a Participant's Fixed Account

Value will result in a withdrawal payment equal to the value of
the Participant's Fixed Account

Value as of the day the surrender is effected, minus any
applicable withdrawal charge and minus

the Participant's outstanding loan balance(s), if any, and any
expense charges due thereon. A

partial withdrawal may be requested for a specified percentage or
dollar amount of the

Participant's Fixed Account Value, except, where a Participant
has outstanding loans under a

Contract, a partial withdrawal will be permitted only to the
extent that the Participant's remaining

Withdrawal Value in the Fixed Account equals twice the total of
the outstanding loans under the

Participant's account. The minimum amount that may be withdrawn
from a Participant's share of

the Fixed Account is the lesser of $500 or the Participant's
entire Fixed Account Value. If a partial
withdrawal is requested that would leave the Participant's Fixed
Account Value less than $500,

then such partial withdrawal request will be treated as a request
for a full withdrawal from the

Fixed Account. If a Participant has more than one Account, then
the Account from which the

partial withdrawal is to be taken must be specified and any
withdrawal restrictions shall be

effective at an Account level. For a further discussion of
surrenders and partial withdrawals as

generally applicable to a Participant's Variable Account Value
and Fixed Account Value, see

"Cash Withdrawals."

A Participant's Fixed Account Value may be transferred from the
Fixed Account to the Variable

Account subject to certain limitations. Where a Participant has
outstanding loans under a

Contract, a transfer will be permitted only to the extent that
the Participant's remaining

Withdrawal Value in the Fixed Account equals twice the total of
the outstanding loans under the

Participant's Account. The minimum transfer from any Investment
Account or from the Fixed

Account is the lesser of $500 or a Participant's entire Account
Value in that Investment Account

or in the Fixed Account, provided however, that amounts
transferred from the Fixed Account to

an Investment Account during any given Contract Year cannot
exceed 20% of the Participant's

Fixed Account Value as of the beginning of that Contract Year.
However, if a Participant's Fixed

Account Value at the beginning of the Contract Year is less than
$2,500, the amount that will be

transferred for that Contract Year from the Fixed Account is the
lesser of $500 or the entire Fixed

Account Value.        If, after any transfer, the Participant's
remaining Account Value in an Investment
Account or in the Fixed Account would be less than $500, then
such request will be treated as a

request for a transfer of the entire Account Value. Transfers and
withdrawals of a Participant's

Fixed Account Values will be effected on a first-in first-out
basis. If a Participant has more than

one Account, then the Account from which the transfer is to be
taken must be specified and any

transfer restrictions shall be effective at an Account level. For
a discussion of transfers as

generally applicable to a Participant's Variable Account Value
and Fixed Account Value, see

"Transfers of Account Value."

Contract Charges

The withdrawal charge will be the same for amounts surrendered or
withdrawn from a

Participant's Fixed Account Value as for amounts surrendered or
withdrawn from a Participant's

Variable Account Value. In addition, the administrative charge
will be the same whether or not a

Participant's Account Value is allocated to the Variable Account
or the Fixed Account. The

charge for mortality and expense risks will not be assessed
against the Fixed Account, and any

amounts that AUL pays for income taxes allocable to the Variable
Account will not be charged

against the Fixed Account. In addition, the investment advisory
fees and operating expenses paid

by the Funds will not be paid directly or indirectly by
Participants to the extent the Account Value
is allocated to the Fixed Account; however, such Participants
will not participate in the investment

experience of the Variable Account. See "Charge and Deductions."
An Investment Liquidation Charge may be imposed upon termination
by an Owner of a Contract

acquired in connection with an Employee Benefit Plan or 457
Program. See "Termination by the

Owner."

Payments from the Fixed Account

Surrenders, withdrawals, and transfers from the Fixed Account and
payment of a death benefit

based upon a Participant's Fixed Account Value may be delayed for
up to six months after a

written request in proper form is received by AUL at its Home
Office. During the period of

deferral, interest at the applicable interest rate or rates will
continue to be credited to the

Participant's Fixed Account Value. For information on payment
upon termination by the Owner of

a Contract acquired in connection with an Employee Benefit Plan,
an Employer Sponsored 403(b)

Program, or a 457 Program, see "Termination by the Owner."
Loans from the Fixed Account

A Participant under a 403(b) Program, other than an Employer
Sponsored 403(b) Program, who

has a Participant Account Value in the Fixed Account may borrow
money from AUL using his or

her Fixed Account Value as the only security for the loan by
submitting a proper written request

to AUL's Home Office. A loan may be taken any time prior to the
Annuity Commencement Date.

The minimum loan that can be taken at any time is $2000, unless a
lower minimum loan amount is

specified by state law. The maximum amount that can be borrowed
at any time is an amount

which, when combined with the largest loan balance during the
prior 12 months, does not exceed

the lesser of (1) 50% of the Participant's Withdrawal Value in
the Fixed Account, or (2) $50,000. The Participant's
Withdrawal Value in the Fixed Account, which must be at least
twice the amount of the

outstanding loan balance, shall serve as security for the loan,
and shall continue to earn interest as

described under "Interest." Payment by AUL of the loan amount may
be delayed for up to six

months. If a Participant has more than one Participant Account
invested in the Fixed Account,

then the account in which funds are to be held as security for
the loan must be specified and any

loan restrictions shall be effective at an Account level.
Interest will be charged for the loan, and will accrue on the
loan balance from the effective date of

any loan. The interest rate will be declared by AUL at the
beginning of each calendar quarter, or,

with respect to Contracts or Participants in some states,
annually. The interest charged will be

determined under a procedure specified in the loan provision of
the Contract; the interest rate

generally follows the Moody's Corporate Bond Yield
Average--Monthly Average Corporates as

published by Moody's Investors Service. However, no change from a
previously established rate

will be made in an amount less than .50% in any periodic
adjustment. The Contract should be

consulted for more information. The loan balance shall also be
subject to a loan expense charge

equal to 2% of each loan repayment unless such a charge is
prohibited by state law.

Loans to Participants must be repaid within a term of five years,
unless the Participant certifies to

AUL that the loan is to be used to acquire a principal residence
for the Participant, in which case

the term may be longer. Loan repayments must be made at least
quarterly. Upon receipt of a

repayment, AUL will deduct the 2% expense charge from the
repayment and will apply the

balance first to any accrued interest and then to the outstanding
loan principal.

If a loan either remains unpaid at the end of its term, or if at
any time during the Accumulation

Period, 102% of the total of all the Participant's loan balances
equals the Participant's Withdrawal

Value allocated to the Fixed Account, then AUL will deduct these
loan balances, as well as an

expense charge equal to 2% of the outstanding loan balances, from
the Participant's Fixed

Account Value. If a Participant has outstanding loans, then
withdrawals or transfers to the

Variable Account will be permitted only to the extent that the
remaining Participant's Withdrawal

Value in the Fixed Account equals or exceeds twice the total of
any outstanding loans under the

Contract. All loan balances plus the 2% expense charge must be
paid or satisfied in full before any

amount based upon a Participant's Fixed Account Value is paid
upon surrender, as a death benefit,

upon annuitization, or other permitted distribution.  The
restrictions or limitations stated above
may be modified, or new restrictions and limitations added, to
the extent necessary to comply

with Section 72(p) of the Internal Revenue Code, under which a
loan will not be treated as a

distribution under a 403(b) Program, or other applicable law as
determined by AUL.


MORE ABOUT THE CONTRACTS


Designation and Change of Beneficiary

The Beneficiary designation contained in an application to open a
Participant's Account will

remain in effect until changed. Payment of benefits to any
Beneficiary are subject to the specified
Beneficiary surviving the Participant. Unless otherwise provided,
if no designated Beneficiary is

living upon the death of the Participant prior to the Annuity
Commencement Date, the

Participant's estate is the Beneficiary. Unless otherwise
provided, if no designated Beneficiary

under an Annuity Option is living after the Annuity Commencement
Date, upon the death of the

Annuitant, the Annuitant's estate is the Beneficiary. In the case
of a 457 Program, the Owner of

the Contract shall be the Beneficiary prior to the Participant's
Annuity Commencement Date.

Subject to the rights of an irrevocably designated Beneficiary,
the designation of a Beneficiary

may be changed or revoked at any time while the Participant is
living by filing with AUL a written

beneficiary designation or revocation in such form as AUL may
require. The change or revocation

will not be binding upon AUL until it is received by AUL at its
Home Office. When it is so

received, the change or revocation will be effective as of the
date on which the beneficiary

designation or revocation was signed, but the change or
revocation will be without prejudice to

AUL if any payment has been made or any action has been taken by
AUL prior to receiving the

change or revocation.

Reference should be made to the terms of the particular Plan and
any applicable law for any

restrictions on the beneficiary designation. For instance, under
an Employee Benefit Plan or

Employer Sponsored 403(b) Program, the Beneficiary (or contingent
Annuitant) must be the

Participant's spouse if the Participant is married, unless the
spouse properly consents to the

designation of a Beneficiary (or contingent Annuitant) other than
the spouse.

Assignability

No benefit or privilege under a Contract may be sold, assigned,
discounted, or pledged as

collateral for a loan or as security for the performance of an
obligation or for any other purpose to

any person or entity other than AUL.

Proof of Age and Survival

AUL may require proof of age or survival of any person on whose
life annuity payments depend.

Misstatements

If the age of an Annuitant or contingent Annuitant has been
misstated, the correct amount paid or

payable by AUL shall be such as the Participant's Account Value
would have provided for the

correct age.

Acceptance of New Participants or Contributions
AUL reserves the right to refuse to accept new Participants or
new Contributions to a Contract at

any time.

Introduction

The Contracts described in this Prospectus are designed for use
by Employer, association, and

other group retirement plans under the provisions of Sections
401, 403, 408, and 457 of the

Internal Revenue Code ("Code"). The ultimate effect of Federal
income taxes on values under a

Contract, the Participant's Account, on annuity payments, and on
the economic benefits to the

Owner, the Participant, the Annuitant, and the Beneficiary or
other payee may depend upon the

type of Plan for which the Contract is purchased and a number of
different factors. The discussion

contained herein and in the Statement of Additional Information
is general in nature. It is based

upon AUL's understanding of the present Federal income tax laws
as currently interpreted by the

Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), and is not intended as tax
advice. No representation is made

regarding the likelihood of continuation of the present Federal
income tax laws or of the current

interpretations by the IRS. Moreover, no attempt is made to
consider any applicable state or other

laws. Because of the inherent complexity of such laws and the
fact that tax results will vary

according to the particular circumstances of the Plan or
individual involved, any person

contemplating the purchase of a Contract, or becoming a
Participant under a Contract, or

receiving annuity payments under a Contract should consult a
qualified tax adviser.

AUL DOES NOT MAKE ANY GUARANTEE REGARDING THE TAX STATUS,
FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL, OF ANY CONTRACT OR PARTICIPANT'S
ACCOUNT

OR ANY TRANSACTION INVOLVING THE CONTRACTS.

Tax Status of the Company and the Variable Account
AUL is taxed as a life insurance company under Part I, Subchapter
L of the Code. Because the

Variable Account is not taxed as a separate entity and its
operations form a part of AUL, AUL

will be responsible for any Federal income taxes that become
payable with respect to the income

of the Variable Account. However, each Investment Account will
bear its allocable share of such

liabilities. Under current law, no item of dividend income,
interest income, or realized capital gain
attributable, at a minimum, to appreciation of the Investment
Accounts will be taxed to AUL to

the extent it is applied to increase reserves under the
Contracts.

The Funds in which the Variable Account will invest its assets
are each intended to qualify as a

regulated investment company under Part I, Subchapter M of the
Code. If the requirements of the

Code are met, the Funds will not be taxed on amounts distributed
on a timely basis to the Variable

Account.

Tax Treatment of Retirement Programs

The Contracts described in this Prospectus are offered for use
with several types of retirement

programs as described in "The Contracts." The tax rules
applicable to Participants in such

retirement programs vary according to the type of retirement plan
and its terms and conditions.

Therefore, no attempt is made herein to provide more than general
information about the use of

the Contracts with the various types of retirement programs.
Participants under such programs, as

well as Owners, Annuitants, Beneficiaries and other payees are
cautioned that the rights of any

person to any benefits under these programs may be subject to the
terms and conditions of the

Plans themselves, regardless of the terms and conditions of the
Contracts issued in connection

therewith.

Generally, no taxes are imposed on the increases in the value of
a Contract by reason of

investment experience or Employer contributions until a
distribution occurs, either as a lump-sum
payment or annuity payments under an elected Annuity Option or in
the form of cash withdrawals,

surrenders, or other distributions prior to the Annuity
Commencement Date.

The amounts that may be contributed to the Plans are subject to
limitations that may vary

depending on the type of Plan. In addition, early distributions
from most Plans may be subject to

penalty taxes, or in the case of distributions of amounts
contributed under salary reduction

agreements, could cause the Plan to be disqualified. Furthermore,
distributions from most Plans

are subject to certain minimum distribution rules. Failure to
comply with these rules could result

in disqualification of the Plan or subject the Annuitant to
penalty taxes. As a result, the minimum

distribution rules could limit the availability of certain
Annuity Options to Participants and their
Beneficiaries.

Below are brief descriptions of various types of retirement
programs and the use of the Contracts

in connection therewith.

Employee Benefit Plans

Code Section 401 permits business employers and certain
associations to establish various types

of retirement plans for employees. Such retirement plans may
permit the purchase of Contracts to

provide benefits thereunder.

If a Participant under an Employee Benefit Plan receives a
lump-sum distribution, the portion of

the distribution equal to any contribution that was taxable to
the Participant in the year when paid

is generally received tax free. The balance of the distribution
will generally be treated as ordinary

income. Special five-year forward averaging provisions under Code

Section 402 may be utilized

on any amount subject to ordinary income tax treatment, provided
that the Participant has reached

age 591/2, has not previously elected forward averaging for a
distribution from any Employee

Benefit Plan after reaching age 591/2, and has not rolled over a
partial distribution from a similar

plan into an individual retirement account or annuity. Special
ten-year averaging and a

capital-gains election may be available to a Participant who
reached age 50 before 1986.

Under an Employee Benefit Plan under Section 401 of the Code,
when annuity payments

commence (as opposed


to a lump-sum distribution), under Section 72 of the Code, the
portion of each payment

attributable to contributions that were taxable to the
Participant in the year made, if any, is
excluded from gross income as a return of the Participant's
investment. The portion so excluded is

determined at the time the payments commence by dividing the
Participant's investment in the

Contract by the expected return. The periodic payments in excess
of this amount are taxable as

ordinary income. Once the Participant's investment has been
recovered, the full annuity payment

will be taxable. If the annuity should stop before the investment
has been received, the

unrecovered portion is deductible on the Annuitant's final
return. If the Participant made no

contributions that were taxable to the Participant in the year
made, there would be no portion

excludable.

403(b) Programs
Code Section 403(b) permits public school systems and certain
types of charitable, educational,
and scientific organizations specified in Code Section 501(c)(3)
to purchase annuity contracts on
behalf of their employees, and, subject to certain limitations,
allows employees of those
organizations to exclude the amount of contributions from gross
income for Federal income tax
purposes.
If a Participant under a 403(b) Program makes a surrender or
partial withdrawal from the
Participant's Account, the Participant generally will realize
income taxable at ordinary tax rates on
the full amount received. See "Constraints on Withdrawal --

403(b) Programs." Since, under a

403(b) Program, contributions generally are excludable from the
taxable income of the employee,
the full amount received will usually be taxable as ordinary
income when annuity payments com-
mence.
408 Programs

Code Sections 219 and 408 permit eligible individuals to
contribute to an individual retirement

program, including Simplified Employee Pension Plans and
Employer/Association Established

Individual Retirement Account Trusts, known as an Individual
Retirement Account ("IRA").

These IRA accounts are subject to limitations on the amount that
may be contributed, the persons

who may be eligible, and on the time when distributions may
commence. In addition, certain

distributions from some other types of retirement plans may be
placed on a tax-deferred basis in

an IRA. Sale of the Contracts for use with IRA's may be subject
to special requirements imposed

by the Internal Revenue Service. Purchasers of the Contracts for
such purposes will be provided

with such supplementary information as may be required by the
Internal Revenue Service or other

appropriate agency, and will have the right to revoke the
Contract under certain circumstances.

If a Participant under a 408 Program makes a surrender or partial
withdrawal from the

Participant's Account, the Participant generally will realize
income taxable at ordinary tax rates on

the full amount received. Since under a 408 Program,
contributions generally are excludable from
the taxable income of the employee, the full amount received will
usually be taxable as ordinary

income when annuity payments commence.

457 Programs

Section 457 of the Code permits employees of state and local
governments and units and agencies

of state and local governments as well as tax-exempt
organizations described in Section 501(c)(3)
of the Code to defer a portion of their compensation without
paying current taxes. The employees

must be Participants in an eligible deferred compensation plan.
Although a Participant under a 457 Program may direct or choose
methods of investment, all

amounts deferred under the Program, and any income thereon,
remain solely the property of the

Employer and subject to the claims of its general creditors,
until paid or made available to the

Participant or Beneficiary under the Program.

If the Employer sponsoring a 457 Program requests and receives a
withdrawal for an eligible

employee in connection with a 457 Program, then the amount
received by the employee will be

taxed as ordinary income. Since under a 457 Program,
contributions are excludable from the

taxable income of the employee, the full amount received will
usually be taxable as ordinary

income when annuity payments commence or other distribution is
made.

Tax Penalty

Any distribution made to a Participant from an Employee Benefit
Plan or a 408 Program other

than on account of one or more of the following events will be
subject to a 10% penalty tax on

the amount distributed:

(a) the Participant has attained age 591/2;

(b) the Participant has died; or

(c) the Participant is disabled.
In addition, a distribution from an Employee Benefit Plan will
not be subject to a 10% excise tax
on the amount distributed if the Participant is 55 and has
separated from service. Distributions
that are received as a life annuity where payment is made at
least annually will not be subject to an
excise tax. Certain amounts paid for medical care also may not be
subject to an excise tax.
Any permitted distribution from a Participant Account under a

403(b) Program will be subject to
a 10% excise tax unless the Participant satisfies one of the
exemptions listed above for Employee
Benefit Plans. See "Constraints on Withdrawals--403(b) Programs."
Withholding
Distributions from an Employee Benefit Plan under Code Section
401(a) or a 403(b) Program to
an employee, surviving spouse, or former spouse who is an
alternate payee under


a qualified domestic relations order, in the form of a lump-sum
settlement or periodic annuity

payments for a fixed period of fewer than 10 years are subject to
mandatory federal income tax

withholding of 20% of the taxable amount of the distribution,
unless the distributee directs the

transfer of such amounts to another Employee Benefit Plan or

403(b) Program or to an Individual
Retirement Account under Code Section 408. The taxable amount is
the amount of the
distribution, less the amount allocable to after-tax
contributions.
All other types of distributions from Employee Benefit Plans and

403(b) Programs, and all
distributions from Individual Retirement Accounts, are subject to
federal income tax withholding
on the taxable amount unless the distributee elects not to have
the withholding apply. The amount
withheld is based on the type of distribution. Federal tax will
be withheld from annuity payments
(other than those subject to mandatory 20% withholding) pursuant
to the recipient's withholding
certificate. If no withholding certificate is filed with AUL, tax
will be withheld on the basis that
the payee is married with three withholding exemptions. Tax on
all surrenders and lump-sum
distributions from Individual Retirement Accounts will be
withheld at a flat 10% rate.
Withholding on annuity payments and other distributions from the
Contract will be made in
accordance with regulations of the Internal Revenue Service.
In general, participants in retirement plans that own annuity
contracts are not taxed on increases
in the value of their accounts until some form of distribution is
made to the participant. Due to
this tax deferral during the accumulation period, participation
in a retirement plan funded by an
annuity contract generally results in more rapid growth than a
comparable investment under which
contributions and increases in value are taxed on a current
basis. The chart illustrates this benefit
by comparing a retirement plan that invests in a variable annuity
contract to accumulation from an
investment whose contributions and gains are taxed on a current
basis. The chart illustrates
accumulation of $250 of monthly before-tax contributions going
into an annuity contract for a
retirement plan and $172.50 of monthly after-tax contributions
going into a conventional savings
plan ($250 minus $77.50 of income taxes based on an assumed
combined rate of 31%, for state
and federal income tax equals $172.50 of after-tax
contributions). Each contribution is made at
the end of each month. This chart also assumes a 6% before-tax
earnings rate. Values for Tax
Deferred Accumulation After Tax and Pre Tax Accumulation Value
reflect the deduction for
mortality and expense risk charges under a variable annuity
contract, and values shown for Tax
Deferred Accumulation After Tax reflect appropriate withdrawal
charges at the end of the periods
shown.
The hypothetical rate of return used in the chart is an
assumption only, and no implication is
intended that the return is guaranteed in any way or that it
represents an average or expected rate
of return over the period depicted.
The portion of a participant's account value that exceeds the
variable annuity contract owner's or
participant's investment in the participant's account is taxed at
ordinary income tax rates upon
distribution, and a 10% tax penalty may apply to withdrawals
taken before the taxpayer reaches
the age of 591/2.
After state and federal income tax at 31% has been paid on the
amount distributed, with a variable
annuity, after 5 years


return is guaranteed in any way or that it represents an average
or expected rate of return over the

period depicted.

The portion of a participant's account value that exceeds the
variable annuity contract owner's or

participant's investment in the participant's account is taxed at
ordinary income tax rates upon

distribution, and a 10% tax penalty may apply to withdrawals
taken before the taxpayer reaches

the age of 591/2.

After state and federal income tax at 31% has been paid on the
amount distributed, with a variable

annuity, after 5 years there would be $686 less; after 10 years
there would be an additional $804

available; after 20 years, there would be an additional $4,383
available; after 30 years, there

would be an additional $8,012 available; and after 40 years,
there would be an additional $33,243

available. Tax rates may vary for different taxpayers from the
31% used in this chart, which would

result in different values from those shown in the chart.


OTHER INFORMATION


Voting of Shares of the Funds

AUL is the legal owner of the shares of the Funds held by the
Investment Accounts of the

Variable Account. In accordance with its view of present
applicable law, AUL will exercise voting
rights attributable to the shares of each Portfolio of the Funds
held in the Investment Accounts at

any regular and special meetings of the shareholders of the Funds
on matters requiring

shareholder voting under the 1940 Act.

AUL will exercise these voting rights based on instructions
received from persons having the

voting interest in corresponding Investment Accounts of the
Variable Account and consistent with

any requirements imposed on AUL under contracts with any of the
Funds, or under applicable

law. However, if the 1940 Act or any regulations thereunder
should be amended, or if the present

interpretation thereof should change, and as a result AUL
determines that it is permitted to vote

the shares of the Funds in its own right, it may elect to do so.
The person having the voting interest under a Contract is the
Owner or the Participant, depending

on the type of Plan. Generally, a Participant will have a voting
interest under a Contract to the

extent of the vested portion of his or her Account Value. AUL
shall send to each Owner or

Participant a Fund's proxy materials and forms of instruction by
means of which instructions may

be given to AUL on how to exercise voting rights attributable to
the Funds' shares. In the case of

a Contract acquired in connection with an Employee Benefit Plan
or an Employer Sponsored

403(b) Program, AUL may furnish the Owner with sufficient Fund
proxy materials and voting
instruction forms for all Participants under a Contract with any
voting interest.
Unless otherwise required by applicable law or under a contract
with any of the Funds, with
respect to each of the Funds, the number of Fund shares of a
particular Portfolio as to which
voting instructions may be given to AUL is determined by dividing
the value of all of the
Accumulation Units of the corresponding Investment Account
attributable to a Contract or a
Participant's Account on a particular date by the net asset value
per share of that Portfolio as of
the same date. Fractional votes will be counted. The number of
votes as to which voting
instructions may be given will be determined as of the date
coincident with the date established by
a Fund for determining shareholders eligible to vote at the
meeting <?FB>of the Fund. If required
by the SEC or under a contract with any of the Funds, AUL
reserves the right to determine in a

different fashion the voting rights attributable to the shares of
the Fund. Voting instructions may

be cast in person or by proxy.

Voting rights attributable to the Contracts or Participant
Accounts for which no timely voting

instructions are received will be voted by AUL in the same
proportion as the voting instructions

which are received in a timely manner for all Contracts and
Participant Accounts participating in

that Investment Account. AUL will vote shares of any Investment
Account, if any, that it owns

beneficially in its own discretion, except that if a Fund offers
its shares to any insurance company

separate account that funds variable life insurance contracts or
if otherwise required by applicable

law, AUL will vote its own shares in the same proportion as the
voting instructions that are

received in a timely manner for Contracts and Participant
Accounts participating in the Investment
Account.

Neither the Variable Account nor AUL is under any duty to inquire
as to the instructions received

or the authority of Owners or others to instruct the voting of
shares of any of the Funds.

Substitution of Investments

AUL reserves the right, subject to compliance with the law as
then in effect, to make additions to,

deletions from, substitutions for, or combinations of the
securities that are held by the Variable
Account or any Investment Account or that the Variable Account or
any Investment Account may

purchase. If shares of any or all of the Portfolios of a Fund
should no longer be available for

investment, or if, in the judgment of AUL's management, further
investment in shares of any or all

Portfolios of a Fund should become inappropriate in view of the
purposes of the Contracts, AUL

may substitute shares of another Portfolio of a Fund or of a
different fund for shares already

purchased, or to be purchased in the future under the Contracts.
AUL may also purchase, through

the Variable Account, other securities for other classes of
contracts, or permit a conversion

between classes of contracts on the basis of requests made by
Owners or as permitted by Federal

law.

Where required under applicable law, AUL will not substitute any
shares attributable to an

Owner's interest in an Investment Account or the Variable Account
without notice, Owner or

Participant approval, or prior approval of the SEC


or a state insurance commissioner, and without following the
filing or other procedures

established by applicable state insurance regulators.
AUL also reserves the right to establish additional Investment
Accounts of the Variable Account

that would invest in a new Portfolio of a Fund or in shares of
another investment company, a

series thereof, or other suitable investment vehicle. New
Investment Accounts may be established

in the sole discretion of AUL, and any new Investment Account
will be made available to existing

Owners on a basis to be determined by AUL. Not all Investment
Accounts may be available under

a particular Contract. AUL may also eliminate or combine one or
more Investment Accounts or

cease permitting new allocations to an Investment Account if, in
its sole discretion, marketing,

tax, or investment conditions so warrant.

Subject to any required regulatory approvals, AUL reserves the
right to transfer assets of any

Investment Account of the Variable Account to another separate
account or Investment Account.

In the event of any such substitution or change, AUL may, by
appropriate endorsement, make

such changes in these and other Contracts as may be necessary or
appropriate to reflect such

substitution or change. If deemed by AUL to be in the best
interests of persons having voting

rights under the Contracts, the Variable Account may be operated
as a management investment

company under the 1940 Act or any other form permitted by law, it
may be deregistered under

that Act in the event such registration is no longer required, or
it may be combined with other

separate accounts of AUL or an affiliate thereof. Subject to
compliance with applicable law, AUL

also may combine one or more Investment Accounts and may
establish a committee, board, or

other group to manage one or more aspects of the operation of the
Variable Account.

Changes to Comply with Law and Amendments
AUL reserves the right, without the consent of Owners or
Participants, to make any change to the

provisions of the Contracts to comply with, or to give Owners or
Participants the benefit of, any

Federal or state statute, rule, or regulation, including, but not
limited to, requirements for annuity

contracts and retirement plans under the Internal Revenue Code
and regulations thereunder or any

state statute or regulation.

AUL reserves the right to make certain changes in the Contracts.
AUL has the right at any time to

change the Guaranteed Rate of interest credited to amounts
allocated to the Fixed Account for

any Participant Accounts established on or after the effective
date of the change, although once a

Participant's Account is established, the Guaranteed Rate may not
be changed for the duration of

the Account.

After the fifth anniversary of a Contract, AUL has the right to
change any annuity tables included

in the Contract, but any such change shall apply only to
Participant Accounts established on or

after the effective date of such a change. AUL also has the right
to change the withdrawal charge

and, within the limits described under "Guarantee of Certain
Charges," the administrative charge.

Reservation of Rights

AUL reserves the right to refuse to accept new contributions
under a Contract and to refuse to

accept new Participants under a Contract.
Periodic Reports

AUL will send quarterly statements showing the number, type, and
value of Accumulation Units

credited to the Contract or to the Participant's Account, as the
case may be. AUL will also send

statements reflecting transactions in a Participant's Account as
required by applicable law. In

addition, every person having voting rights will receive such
reports or Prospectuses concerning

the Variable Account and the Funds as may be required by the 1940
Act and the 1933 Act.


Legal Proceedings

There are no legal proceedings pending to which the Variable
Account is a party, or which would

materially affect the Variable Account.

Legal Matters

Legal matters in connection with the issue and sale of the
Contracts described in this Prospectus

and the organization of AUL, its authority to issue the Contracts
under Indiana law, and the

validity of the forms of the Contracts under Indiana law have
been passed upon by the Associate

General Counsel of AUL.

Legal matters relating to the Federal securities and Federal
income tax laws have been passed

upon by Dechert Price & Rhoads, Washington, D.C.






PERFORMANCE INFORMATION


Performance information for the Investment Accounts is shown
under "Performance of the

Investment Accounts." Performance information for the Investment
Accounts may also appear in

promotional reports and literature to current or prospective
Owners or Participants in the manner

described in this section. Performance information in promotional
reports and literature may

include the yield and effective yield of the Investment Account
investing in the AUL American

Money Market Portfolio ("Money Market Investment Account"), the
yield of the remaining

Investment Accounts, the average annual total return and the
total return of all Investment

Accounts.

Current yield for the Money Market Investment Account will be
based on income received by a

hypothetical investment over a given 7-day period (less expenses
accrued during the period), and

then "annualized" (i.e., assuming that the 7-day yield would be
received for 52 weeks, stated in

terms of an annual percentage return on the investment).
"Effective


yield" for the Money Market Investment Account is calculated in a
manner similar to that used to

calculate yield, but reflects the compounding effect of earnings.
For the remaining Investment Accounts, quotations of yield will
be based on all investment

income per Accumulation Unit earned during a given 30-day period,
less expenses accrued during

the period ("net investment income"), and will be computed by
dividing net investment income by

the value of an Accumulation Unit on the last day of the period.
Quotations of average annual

total return for any Investment Account will be expressed in
terms of the average annual

compounded rate of return on a hypothetical investment in a
Contract over a period of one, five,

and ten years (or, if less, up to the life of the Investment
Account), and

will reflect the deduction of the applicable withdrawal charge,
the mortality and expense risk

charge, and if applicable, the administrative charge.
Hypothetical quotations of average annual
total return may also be shown for an Investment Account for
periods prior to the time that the

Investment Account commenced operations, based upon the
performance of the mutual fund

portfolio in which that Investment Account invests, and will
reflect the deduction of the applicable

withdrawal charge, the administrative charge, and the mortality
and expense risk charge as if, and

to the extent that, such charges had been applicable. Quotations
of total return, actual and

hypothetical, may simultaneously be shown that do not take into
account certain contractual

charges such as the withdrawal charge and the administrative
charge.

Performance information for an Investment Account may be
compared, in promotional reports

and literature, to: (i) the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Index
("S & P 500"), Dow Jones

Industrial Average ("DJIA"), Donoghue Money Market Institutional
Averages, or other indices

measuring performance of a pertinent group of securities so that
investors may compare an

Investment Account's results with those of a group of securities
widely regarded by investors as

representative of the securities markets in general; (ii) other
variable annuity separate accounts or

other investment products tracked by Lipper Analytical Services,
a widely used independent

research firm which ranks mutual funds and other investment
companies <?FB>by overall
performance, investment objectives, and assets, or tracked by
other ratings services, companies,

publications, or persons who rank separate accounts or other
investment products on overall

performance or other criteria; and (iii) the Consumer Price Index
(measure for inflation) to assess

the real rate of return from an investment in the Contract.
Unmanaged indices may assume the

reinvestment of dividends but generally do not reflect deductions
for administrative and

management costs and expenses.

Performance information for any Investment Account reflects only
the performance of a

hypothetical Contract under which Account Value is allocated to
an Investment Account during a

particular time period on which the calculations are based.
Performance information should be

considered in light of the investment objectives and policies,
characteristics, and quality of the

Portfolio of a Fund in which the Investment Account invests, and
the market conditions during

the given time period, and should not be considered as a
representation of what may be achieved

in the future. For a description of the methods used to determine
yield and total return in

promotional reports and literature for the Investment Accounts,
see the Statement of Additional

Information.

Promotional reports and literature may also contain other
information including (i) the ranking of
any Investment Account derived from rankings of variable annuity
separate accounts or other

investment products tracked by Lipper Analytical Services or by
other rating services, companies,

publications, or other persons who rank separate accounts or
other investment products on

overall performance or other criteria, (ii) the effect of
tax-deferred compounding on an

Investment Account's investment returns, or returns in general,
which may be illustrated by

graphs, charts, or otherwise, and which may include a comparison,
at various points in time, of

the return from an investment in a Contract (or returns in
general) on a tax-deferred basis

(assuming one or more tax rates) with the return on a taxable
basis, and (iii) AUL's rating or a

rating of AUL's claim-paying ability by firms that analyze and
rate insurance companies and by

nationally recognized statistical rating organizations.

LIMITS ON CONTRIBUTIONS TO RETIREMENT PLANS


403(b) Programs
Contributions to a 403(b) Program are excludable from a
Participant's gross income if they do not
exceed the smallest of the limits calculated under Sections

402(g), 403(b)(2), and 415 of the
Internal Revenue Code. Section 402(g) generally limits a
Participant's salary reduction
contributions to a 403(b) Program to $9,500 a year. The $9,500
limit may be reduced by salary
reduction contributions to another type of retirement plan. A
Participant with at least 15 years of
service for a "qualified employer" (i.e., an educational
organization, hospital, home health service
agency, health and welfare service agency, church or convention
or association of churches)
generally may exceed the $9,500 limit by $3,000 per year, subject
to an aggregate limit of
$15,000 for all years.

Section 403(b)(2) provides an overall limit on Employer and
Participant salary reduction
contributions that may be made to a 403(b) Program. Section
403(b)(2) generally provides that
the maximum amount of contributions a Participant may exclude
from his gross income in any
taxable year is equal to the excess, if any, of:

(a) the amount determined by multiplying 20% of his includable
compensation by the number of
his years of service with his Employer, over

(b) the total amount contributed to retirement plans sponsored by
his Employer, including the

Section 403(b) Program, that were excludable from his gross
income in prior years.
Participants employed by "qualified employers" may elect to have
certain alternative limitations
apply.

Section 415(c) also provides an overall limit on the amount of
Employer and Participant's salary
reduction contributions to a Section 403(b) Program that will be
excludable from an employee's
gross income in a given year. The Section 415(c) limit is the
lesser of (a) $30,000, or (b) 25% of
the Participant's annual compensation. This limit will be reduced
if a Participant also participates
in an Employee Benefit Plan maintained by a business that he or
she controls.
The limits described above do not apply to amounts "rolled over"
from another Section 403(b)
Program. With respect to distributions made prior to 1993,

Section 403(b)(8) of the Internal
Revenue Code permits a Participant who receives a "total
distribution" and certain partial
distributions from a Section 403(b) Program to transfer the
proceeds (excluding amounts
previously included in his gross income) to another Section

403(b) Program within 60 days of
receipt without recognizing income on the distribution. A "total
distribution" is a distribution of
the balance to the credit of a Participant under a Section 403(b)
Program (and all other Section

403(b) Programs in which he has participated in connection with
his employment with his
Employer) (a) on account of his death, disability, or termination
of employment, or (b) after he
reaches age 591/2. Beginning in 1993, a Participant who receives
an "eligible rollover
distribution" will be permitted either to roll over such amount
to another Section 403(b) Program
or an IRA within 60 days of receipt or to make a direct rollover
to another Section 403(b)
Program or an IRA without recognition of income. An "eligible
rollover distribution" means any
distribution to a Participant of all or any taxable portion of
the balance to his credit under a

Section 403(b) Program, other than a required minimum
distribution to a Participant who has
reached age 701/2


and excluding any distribution which is one of a series of
substantially equal payments made (1)

over the life expectancy of the Participant or his beneficiary or

(2) over a specified period of 10
years or more. Provisions of the Internal Revenue Code require
that 20<U7> of every eligible
rollover distribution that is not directly rolled over be
withheld by the payor for federal income
taxes.

408 Programs

Contributions to the individual retirement account of a
Participant under a 408 Program that is

described in Section 408(c) of the Internal Revenue Code are
subject to the limits on

contributions to individual retirement accounts under Section
219(b) of the Internal Revenue

Code. Under Section 219(b) of the Code, contributions to an
individual retirement account are

limited to the lesser of $2,000 per year or the Participant's
annual compensation. An additional

$250 may be contributed if the Participant has a spouse with
little or no compensation for the

year, provided separate accounts are maintained for the
Participant and his spouse, and no more

than $2,000 is contributed to either account in any one year. The
extent to which a Participant

may deduct contributions to this type of 408 Program depends on
his and his spouse's gross

income for the year and whether either participate in another
employer-sponsored retirement plan.

Contributions to a 408 Program that is a simplified employee
pension plan are subject to limits

under Section 402(h) of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 402(h)
currently limits Employer

contributions and Participant salary reduction contributions (if
permitted) to a simplified employee

pension plan to the lesser of (a) 15% of the Participant's
compensation, or (b) $22,500. Salary

reduction contributions, if any, are subject to additional annual
limits.

457 Programs

Contributions on behalf of a Participant to a 457 Program
generally are limited under Section

457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code to the lesser of (a) $7,500
or (b) 331/3% of the Participant's

includable compensation. If the Participant participates in more
than one 457 Program, the $7,500

limit applies to contributions to all such programs. The $7,500
limit is reduced by the amount of

any salary reduction contribution the Participant makes to a

403(b) Program, a 408 Pro-
gram, or an Employee Benefit Program. The Section 457(b) limit is
increased during the last three
years ending before the Participant reaches his normal retirement
age under the 457 Program.
Employee Benefit Plans

The applicable annual limits on contributions to an Employee
Benefit Plan depend upon the type

of plan. Total contributions on behalf of a Participant to all
defined contribution plans maintained

by an Employer are limited under Section 415(c) of the Internal
Revenue Code to the lesser of (a)

$30,000, or (b) 25% of a Participant's annual compensation.
Salary reduction contributions to a

cash-or-deferred arrangement under a profit sharing plan are
subject to additional annual limits.

Contributions to a defined benefit pension plan are actuarially
determined based upon the amount

of benefits the Participants will receive under the plan formula.
The maximum annual benefit any

Participant may receive under an Employer's defined benefit plan
is limited under Section 415(b)

of the Internal Revenue Code. The limits determined under Section
415(b) and (c) of the Internal

Revenue Code are further reduced for a Participant who
participates in a defined contribution plan
and a defined benefit plan maintained by the same employer.

PERFORMANCE INFORMATION


Performance information for the Investment Accounts is shown in
the prospectus under

"Performance of the Investment Accounts." Performance information
for the Investment

Accounts may also appear in promotional reports and literature to
current or prospective Owners

or Participants in the manner described in this section.
Performance information in promotional

reports and literature may include the yield and effective yield
of the Investment Account

investing in the AUL American Money Market Portfolio ("Money
Market Investment Account"),

the yield of the remaining Investment Accounts, the average
annual total return and the total

return of all Investment Accounts.

Current yield for the Money Market Investment Account will be
based on the change in the value

of a hypothetical investment (exclusive of capital charges) over
a particular 7-day period, less a

pro-rata share of the Investment Account's expenses accrued over
that period (the "base period"),

and stated as a percentage of the investment at the start of the
base period (the "base period

return"). The base period return is then annualized by
multiplying by 365/7, with the resulting
yield figures carried to at least the nearest hundredth of one
percent.

Calculation of "effective yield" begins with the same "base
period return" used in the calculation

of yield, which is then

annualized to reflect weekly compounding pursuant to the
following formula:

Effective Yield = [(Base Period Return + 1)**365/7] - 1
For the seven day period ending December 31, 1994, the current
yield for the AUL Money

Market Investment Account was 4.30% and the effective yield was
4.39%.

Quotations of yield for the remaining Investment Accounts will be
based on all investment income

per Accumulation Unit earned during a particular 30-day period,
less expenses accrued during the

period ("net investment income"), and will be computed by
dividing net investment income by the

value of the Accumulation Unit on the last day of the period,
according to the following formula:

YIELD = 2[((a - b / cd) + 1)**6 - 1]

where a = net investment income earned during the period by the
Portfolio attributable to shares

owned by the Investment Account,

b = expenses accrued for the period (net of reimbursements),
c = the average daily number of Accumulation Units outstanding
during the period that were

entitled to receive dividends, and

d = the value (maximum offering period) per Accumulation Unit on
the last day of the period.

For the one year period ending December 31, 1994, the yield for
the Investment Accounts

corresponding to the Portfolios of the AUL American Series Fund,
Inc. was 0.78% for the Equity

Investment Account, 5.28% for the Bond Investment Account, and
2.62% for the Managed

Investment Account.

Quotations of average annual total return for any Investment
Account will be expressed in terms

of the average annual compounded rate of return of a hypothetical
investment in a Contract over a

period of one, five, and ten years (or, if less, up to the life
of the Investment Account), calculated

pursuant to the following formula: P(1 + T) **n = ERV (where P =
a hypothetical initial payment

of $1,000, T = the average annual total return, n = the number of
years, and ERV = the

ending redeemable value of a hypothetical $1,000 payment made at
the beginning of the period).

Hypothetical quotations of average annual total return may also
be shown for an Investment

Account for periods prior to the time that the Investment Account
commenced operations based

upon the performance of the mutual fund portfolio in which that
Investment Account invests, as

adjusted for applicable charges. All total return figures reflect
the deduction of the applicable

withdrawal charge, the administrative charge, and the mortality
and expense risk charge.

Quotations of total return, actual and hypothetical, may
simultaneously be shown that do not take
into account certain contractual charges such as the withdrawal
charge and the administrative

charge and quotations of total return may reflect other periods
of time.


The average annual total return is calculated from the actual
inception date of the AUL American

Investment Accounts and from the inception date of the
corresponding mutual funds for all of the
other Investment Accounts. The reported performance is,
therefore, hypothetical to the extent and
for the periods that the Investment Accounts have not been in
existence and reflects the

performance that such Investment Accounts would have achieved had
they invested in the

corresponding Mutual Funds for those periods. For the periods
that an Investment Account has

actually been in existence, however, the performance represents
actual and not hypothetical

performance. The AUL American Equity, Bond, Money Market, and
Managed Investment

Accounts commenced operations on April 10, 1990. The AUL American
Tactical Asset

Performance information for an Investment Account may be
compared, in promotional reports
and literature, to: (i) the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Index
("S&P 500"), Dow Jones
Industrial Average ("DJIA"), Donoghue Money Market Institutional
Averages, or other indices
that measure performance of a pertinent group of securities so
that investors may compare an
Investment Account's results with those of a group of securities
widely regarded by investors as
representative of the securities markets in general; (ii) other
groups of variable annuity separate
accounts or other investment products tracked by Lipper
Analytical Services, a widely used
independent research firm which ranks mutual funds and other
investment companies by overall
performance, investment objectives, and assets, or tracked by
other services, companies,
publications, or persons who rank such investment companies on
overall performance or other
criteria; and (iii) the Consumer Price Index (measure for
inflation) to assess the real rate of return
from an investment in the Contract. Unmanaged indices may assume
the reinvestment of dividends
but generally do not reflect deductions for administrative and
management costs and expenses.
Performance information for any Investment Account reflects only
the performance of a
hypothetical Contract under which a Participant's Account Value
is allocated to an Investment
Account during a particular time period on which the calculations
are based. Performance
information


should be considered in light of the investment objectives and
policies, characteristics and quality

of the Portfolio of the Funds in which the Investment Account
invests, and the market conditions

during the given time period, and should not be considered as a
representation of what may be

achieved in the future.

Promotional reports and literature may also contain other
information including (i) the ranking of
any Investment Account derived from rankings of variable annuity
separate accounts or other

investment products tracked by Lipper Analytical Services or by
other rating services, companies,

publications, or other persons who rank separate accounts or
other

investment products on

overall performance or other criteria, (ii) the effect of
tax-deferred compounding on an

Investment Account's investment returns, or returns in general,
which may be illustrated by

graphs, charts, or otherwise, and which may include a comparison,
at various points in time, of

the return from an investment in a Contract (or returns in
general)

on a tax-deferred basis

(assuming one or more tax rates) with the return on a taxable
basis, and (iii) AUL's rating or a

rating of AUL's claim-paying ability by firms that analyze and
rate

insurance companies and by

nationally recognized statistical rating organizations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS







Board of Directors

American United Life Insurance Company

Indianapolis, Indiana

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of American United
Life Insurance Company as

of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related statements of
operations, policyowners' surplus,

and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements

based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those

standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about

whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. An

audit includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by

management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that

our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of American United Life Insurance Company
as of December 31, 1994 and

1993, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
the years then ended in conformity

with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 1, in accordance with prescribed accounting
requirements, the Company

changed its method of accounting for postretirement benefits
other than pensions in 1993.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AMERICAN UNITED LIFE INSURANCE
COMPANY

ACCOUNTING POLICIES:


a. Basis of Presentation: The financial statements have been
prepared on the basis of accounting
practices prescribed or permitted by the Insurance Department of
the State of Indiana, which
practices are regarded as generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP) for mutual life
insurance companies.
In January 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 120, Accounting and Reporting by
Mutual Life Insurance
Enterprises and by Insurance Enterprises for Certain
Long-Duration Participating Contracts. This
Statement, effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 1995, extends the requirements
of SFAS Nos. 60, 97, and 113 to mutual life insurance companies.
It also defers the effective date
of Interpretation 40, previously issued by the FASB in 1993, for
fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1995. Interpretation 40 indicated that financial
statements of mutual life insurance
companies prepared on a statutory basis will no longer be
considered in conformity with GAAP.


InNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued):


a. addition, the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants has issued Statement of
Position (SOP) 95-1, Accounting for Certain Insurance Activities
of Mutual Life Insurance
Enterprises, which is also effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 1995. This SOP
establishes accounting for certain participating life insurance
contracts.
The effect of initially applying, SFAS No. 120, Interpretation
40, and SOP 95-1, is to be reported
retroactively through restatement of all previously issued annual
financial statements presented for
comparative purposes for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 1992. Management has
determined it will initiate the accounting changes; the effect of
which has not yet been determined.

b. Accounting Change: In 1993, the Company began accruing for
certain postretirement benefits
other than pensions as prescribed by statutory accounting
practices. The projected future cost of
postretirement benefits, such as health care and life insurance,
is to be recognized as an expense
during the active service period of the employee. Prior to 1993,
the Company recognized expense
in the period postretirement benefits were paid. This change
resulted in a net charge to surplus of
$7,521,000 in 1993. (See Note 5.) The expense charged to the
statement of operations for 1993
was not significantly affected by the change in accounting.

c. Investments: Bonds and mortgage loans are reported principally
at amortized cost; preferred
stocks are reported at cost (market value was $3,251,000 and
$3,318,000 at December 31, 1994
and 1993, respectively); common stocks are reported at market
(cost was $25,269,000 and
$27,816,000 at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively);
short-term investments include
investments with maturities of one year or less and are reported
at cost, which approximates
market; policy loans are reported at unpaid balances and real
estate is reported at cost less
allowances for depreciation. Depreciation is provided over the
estimated useful lives of the related
assets using the straight-line method.
Market values of bonds, common stocks, and preferred stocks, that
are publicly traded, are
determined based on published market values. For bonds not
publicly traded, the market value is
based on discounted cash flows using current yields of comparable
publicly traded securities.
Realized gains and losses on sale or maturity of investments are
determined on the basis of
specific identification. Unrealized gains and losses are reported
as a component of surplus without
recognizing the effect of related income taxes. Realized gains,
including those deferred in the
interest maintenance reserve, were reduced by federal taxes of
$4,551,265 and $15,431,717 in
1994 and 1993, respectively.

d. Asset Valuation and Interest Maintenance Reserve: The asset
valuation reserve is provided
from policyowners' surplus in accordance with statutory
accounting requirements. The interest
maintenance reserve, reduced by federal income taxes of
$4,488,055 and $12,658,650 in 1994
and 1993, respectively, defers the recognition of net gains
realized on the sale of fixed maturity
investments, resulting from changes in interest rates. Such gains
will be amortized to income over
the remaining lives of the assets sold.

e. Separate Accounts:  The assets of the Separate Accounts shown
in the balance sheet are based
on market value and represent funds which are segregated for
variable annuity contracts and
equity-based pension and profit sharing plans.
The statement of operations includes the operations of the
Separate Accounts. Realized and
unrealized gains or losses on investments held by the Separate
Accounts are accounted for as
prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
(NAIC) as an addition to or
reduction in net investment income. Separate Account income is
offset by payments and
provisions for benefits and services, thus having no effect on
net income or policyowners' surplus.

f. Policy Reserves:  Policy reserves are based on mortality,
morbidity and interest assumptions
prescribed by regulatory authorities.
An additional reserve for mortality and morbidity fluctuations is
maintained for certain policies to
provide for the risk that actual mortality and morbidity
experience may be less favorable than that
assumed in the calculation of the statutory policy reserves. This
reserve is adjusted annually and
the adjustment primarily reflects a portion of the difference
between the current year's mortality
and morbidity experience and similar average experience for
preceding years. Changes in this
reserve are reflected in operations.
Claim liabilities include provisions for reported claims and
estimates based on historical
experience, for claims incurred but not reported. Such claim
liabilities have been reduced at
December 31, 1994 and 1993 by $32,054,748 and $25,902,451,
respectively, for reinsurance
ceded.
The Company received written approval from the Insurance
Department of the State of Indiana to
record a "Separate Account Transfer Credit" for the difference
between reserves maintained in the
General Account and reserves maintained in the Separate Account
after the transfer of funds. As
of December 31, 1994 and 1993, that permitted transaction
increased statutory surplus by
approximately $14,000,000 and $2,200,000, respectively.


NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued): Federal Income Taxes:

Generally, no provision is made

for deferred income taxes due to timing differences that may
exist between financial reporting and

taxable income.

h. Revenues and Expenses: Premium income is recognized over the
premium paying period. Costs
of acquiring new business are expensed when incurred and credit
is not taken, other than by
statutory reserve modification methods applicable to some
policies, for the expectation that such
costs will be recovered from future premium income.
Policyowner dividends are determined by crediting each
participating policy with its share of the
divisible surplus as apportioned by the Company.

i. Retirement Plans:  Annual provisions for employees' and
agents' retirement plans are computed
actuarially and include amortization of past service cost over
approximately 20 years.

j. Litigation: Various lawsuits have arisen in the ordinary
course of the Company's business. In
each of the matters, the Company believes its defenses are
meritorious and that the eventual
outcome will not have a material effect on the Company's
financial position.

2. INVESTMENTS:

The admitted values (principally amortized cost) and estimated
market values of investments in

Proceeds from sales, maturities, or calls of investments in bonds
during 1994 were approximately

$525,799,000. Gross gains of $10,353,000 and gross losses of
$3,025,000 were realized. Net

capital gains of approximately $7,538,000 were transferred to


IMR.


Proceeds from sales, maturities, or calls of investments in bonds
during 1993 were approximately

$664,901,000. Gross gains of $26,947,000 and gross losses of
$79,000 were realized. Net capital

gains of approximately $26,771,000 were transferred to the
Interest Maintenance Reserve (IMR).

Net investment income consists of the following:

1994    1993

Interest $437,070,589 $442,857,948

Dividends 6,089,743 3,473,269

Rents 13,431,856 13,279,286

Gains on separate account investments:

Realized 11,064,625 4,944,639

Less investment expenses 19,510,181 19,863,871
Net investment income $436,007,437 $453,906,805
At December 31, 1994, the preferred stock unrealized depreciation
of approximately $139,000

has not been reflected in the financial statements. The change in
the unrealized depreciation of

preferred stocks amounted to approximately $24,000 of
depreciation and $28,000 of appreciation
in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

At December 31, 1994, the common stock unrealized appreciation of
approximately $1,493,000

is comprised of $1,525,000 of unrealized gains and $32,000 of
unrealized losses and has been

reflected directly in policyowners' surplus. The change in the
unrealized appreciation of common

stocks amounted to approximately $1,512,000 and $34,000 of
depreciation in 1994 and 1993,

respectively.

The Company maintains a diversified mortgage loan portfolio and
exercises internal limits on

concentrations of loans by geographic area, industry, use and
individual mortgagor. Mortgage

loans on various properties in eight states (California, Florida,
North Carolina, Indiana, Texas,

Illinois, Georgia and Ohio) account for approximately 59<U7> of
the total amortized cost of the

Company's mortgage loans. The remaining mortgage loans relate to
properties located throughout

the United States. A total of approximately $83,000,000 of
mortgage loans have been issued on

40 geographically diversified properties of four large retailers,
K-Mart, Wal-Mart, Publix, and

Fleming Companies. The fair value of the aggregate mortgage loan
portfolio approximates

$1,075,000,000 and was estimated by discounting the future cash
flows using current rates at

which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar
credit ratings for similar maturities.


NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


2. INVESTMENTS (Continued):

The Company has outstanding mortgage loan commitments at December
31, 1994 of

approximately $54,000,000. The Company has made no financial
guarantees other than those

described in Note 8.

3. REAL ESTATE:

The Company owns its home office and occupies approximately
35<U7> of the complex; the
remaining space is available for lease to third parties. Real
estate is recorded net of accumulated

depreciation of $24,474,746 and $23,078,697 for investment
properties and $10,633,240 and

$9,340,266 for home office at December 31, 1994 and 1993,
respectively. Depreciation expense

on real estate amounted to $4,488,377 and $3,544,565 in 1994 and
1993, respectively.

4. POLICY RESERVES
Reserves for life policies are computed principally by the net
level and modified preliminary term
methods on the basis of interest rates (2 1/2% to 6%) and
mortality assumptions (1941, 1958 and
1980 CSO Tables) prescribed by state regulatory authorities.
Reserves for annuities and deposit
administration contacts are computed on the basis of interest
rates ranging from 2 1/2% to 10%.
At December 31, 1994 and 1993 these reserves consisted of the
following:

1994     1993

Individual, group and credit life policies $719,787,943
$641,849,881

Annuities and deposit administration funds 4,199,320,853
4,013,656,702

Accident and health and other reserves 166,873,578 151,660,576
Less reinsurance ceded (91,100,070) (91,870,179)
$4,994,882,304 $4,715,296,980
The statement values of the reserves for annuities and deposit
administration funds approximate

the estimated fair values at December 31, 1994. The estimated
fair values of the reserves

approximate the statement values because interest rates credited
to account balances approximate

current rates paid on similar investments and are not generally
guaranteed beyond one year. Fair

values for other insurance reserves are not required to be
disclosed. However, the estimated fair

values of liabilities for all insurance liabilities are taken
into consideration in the Company's overall
management of interest rate risk.

Included in the reserves for individual, group, and credit life
policies are approximately $38

million of reserves assumed from Educators Mutual Life Insurance
Company during 1994.

5. EMPLOYEES' AND AGENTS' BENEFIT PLANS:

The Company has a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan
covering substantially all

employees. Company contributions to the employee plan are made
annually in an amount between

the minimum ERISA required contribution and the maximum
tax-deductible contribution. Such

amounts are expensed as contributed. Contributions made to the
plan were $2,215,000 in 1994

and $2,105,000 in 1993. The following benefit information for the
employees' defined benefit plan

was determined by outside actuaries as of January 1, 1994 and
1993, respectively, the most recent

actuarial valuation dates:

1994      1993

Actuarial present value of accumulated benefits for the
employees' defined benefit plan:

Vested $17,138,000 $14,897,000

Nonvested 291,000 906,000

$17,429,000 $15,803,000


Related net assets available for plan benefits $23,595,000
$22,272,000

The Company has a defined contribution plan covering employees
who have completed one full

calendar year of service. Annual contributions are made by the
Company in amounts based upon

the Company's financial results. Company contributions to the
plan during 1994 and 1993 were

$1,265,000 and $1,009,000, respectively.

The Company has entered into deferred compensation agreements
with several directors, key

management employees, agents and general agents. These deferred
amounts are payable

according to the terms and subject to the conditions of said
agreements.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
EMPLOYEES` AND AGENTS` BENEFIT PLANS (Continued):

The Company also has a defined contribution pension plan and a
401(k) plan covering

substantially all of the agents, except general agents.
Contributions of 3% of defined commissions
(plus 3% for commissions over the Social Security wage base) are
made to the pension plan. An

additional contribution of 3% of defined commissions are made to
a 401(k) plan. Company

contributions expensed for these plans for 1994 and 1993 are as
follows:

1994     1993

Agents' pension plan $349,000 $174,000

Agents' 401(k) plan 262,000 200,000

$ 611,000 $ 374,000
The funds for all plans are held by the Company under deposit
administration and group annuity

contracts.

In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company provides
certain health care and life

insurance benefits (postretirement benefits) for retired
employees and certain agents (retirees).

Substantially all employees and agents may become eligible for
such benefits if they reach

retirement age while working for the Company.

Net periodic postretirement benefit costs for the year ended
December 31, 1994 and 1993 were as

follows:

1994     1993

Service cost $252,000 $181,000

Interest cost 594,000 570,000

Amortization of unrecognized loss 42,000 --
Net postretirement benefit cost $888,000 $751,000
Company-paid premiums in 1994 were $797,000. Claims incurred in
1993 for benefits was not

significantly different than the above provision. Accrued
postretirement benefits as of December

31, 1994 were as follows:

1994      1993

Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO):  Retirees
and their dependents

$5,620,000 $4,713,000

Active employees fully eligible to retire and
receive benefits 2,523,000 2,196,000

Active employees not fully eligible 843,000 612,000
Unrecognized loss (1,374,000)  --

Total APBO $7,612,000 $7,521,000

The assumed discount rate used in determining the accumulated
postretirement benefit was 8.0%

and the assumed health care cost trend rate was 10% graded to 6%
over 50 years. Compensation

rates were assumed to increase 6% at each year end. The health
coverage for retirees age 65 and

over is capped in the year 2000.

The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant
effect on the amounts reported. An

increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates by one
percentage point would increase the

accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31,
1994 by $582,000 and increase

the net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 1994 by $49,000.

6. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES:

Following is a reconciliation between the amount of tax computed
at the federal statutory rate of

35% in 1994 and 1993, respectively, and the federal income tax
provision reflected in the

statement of operations:

1994     1993

Income tax computed at statutory rate $19,436,453 $17,689,627
Increases (decreases) in taxes resulting from:

Bond discount accrual (917,099) (1,096,322)
Reserve adjustments 476,495 3,410,101

Tax-exempt income (1,990,012) (2,048,109)
Accelerated depreciation (822,622) (1,014,963)
Policyowner dividends 1,006,132 (83,240<FO>)
Deferred acquisition costs 4,160,043 2,782,043
Change in mortality and morbidity fluctuation reserve 518,468
239,090

Change in discounting of accident and health reserves (131,267)
570,701

Change in interest maintenance reserve (897,837) (726,911)
Mutual company differential earnings amount,
Current year 10,295,733 1,990,460

Changes in prior period estimates (4,263,100) (2,720,882)
Other 187,501 (404,609)

Federal income taxes $27,058,888 $18,586,986

7. REINSURANCE:

The Company is a party to various reinsurance contracts under
which it receives premiums as a

reinsurer and reimburses the ceding companies for portions of the
claims incurred. At December

31, 1994 and 1993, life reinsurance assumed was approximately 62%
and 59%, respectively, of

life insurance in force. Premiums on life reinsurance assumed
were approximately 43% and 42%

of life insurance premium income in 1994 and 1993, respectively.
Premiums on accident and

health reinsurance assumed were approximately 53% and 45% of
accident and health premium

income in 1994 and 1993, respectively.

The Company cedes that portion of the total risk on an individual
life in excess of $1,000,000. For

accident and health and disability policies, the Company has
established various limits of coverage

it will retain on any one policyowner and cedes the remainder of
such coverage. Certain statistical

data with respect to reinsurance ceded follows:

1994     1993

Reinsurance ceded on ordinary life in force $6,248,499,000
$5,048,902,000

Reinsurance ceded on group and credit life in force 1,631,068,000
1,699,287,000

Life reinsurance premiums ceded 26,562,000 20,621,000
Accident and health reinsurance premiums ceded 71,318,000
57,336,000

The Company accounts for all reinsurance agreements as transfers
of risk. Premiums for policies

reinsured with other companies have been reported as a reduction
of premium income and

amounts applicable to reinsurance ceded for policy reserves and
claim liabilities have been

reported as reductions of these items.

Six reinsurers account for approximately 60<U7> of the Company's
December 31, 1994 ceded

reserves for life and accident and health insurance. The
remainder of such ceded reserves is spread
among numerous reinsurers. If companies to which reinsurance has
been ceded are unable to meet

obligations under the reinsurance agreements, the Company would
remain liable. Changes in such

contingent liabilities are reflected directly to policyowners'
surplus.

8. STRATEGIC ALLIANCE:

In September 1994, the Company and State Life Insurance Company
(State Life) entered into a

strategic alliance (the alliance). The Company and State Life
will remain separate entities, in that

each will retain its own assets, liabilities, surplus, policies,
and policyowners. There will also be

separate but common boards of directors.

In accordance with the alliance, the Company has guaranteed the
insurance liabilities of State Life

to its policyholders, including present policyholders and those
acquired during the period of the

alliance (initially ten years), in the event State Life becomes
unable to honor such insurance

liabilities. As of December 31, 1994, the Company has not
recorded any liabilities relating to this
guarantee.

Item 26.   Persons Controlled by or Under Common Control with
Registrar



American United Life Insurance Company ("AUL") is a mutual life
insurance company organized under the laws of the State of
Indiana.  As a mutual company, AUL has no shareholders and
therefore no one individual controls as much as 10% of AUL.  In
accordance with current law, it is anticipated that AUL will
request voting instructions from owners or participants of any
Contracts that are funded by separate accounts that are
registered investment companies under the Investment Company Act
of 1940 and will vote shares in any such separate account
attributable to the Contracts in proportion to the voting
instructions received.  AUL may vote shares of any Portfolio, if
any, that it owns beneficially in its own discretion.


AUL may also be deemed to control State Life Insurance Company
("State Life") since a majority of AUL's Directors also serve as
Directors of State Life.  By virtue of an agreement between AUL
and State Life, AUL provides investment and other support
services for State Life on a contractual basis.


AUL Equity Sales Corporation ("ESC") is a wholly-owned subsidiary
of AUL organized under the laws of the State of Indiana in 1969
for the purpose of the sale of mutual funds on an application-way
basis only.


Registrant and AUL American Individual Unit Trust are separate
accounts of AUL, organized for the purpose of the sale of group
and individual variable annuity contract, respectively.


AUL American Series Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") was incorporated
under the laws of Maryland on July 26, 1989 and is registered as
an open-end, diversified management investment company under the
Investment Company Act of 1940.  As a "series" type of mutual
fund, the "Fund" issues shares of common stock relating to
separate investment portfolios.  Substantially all of the
"Fund's" shares were originally purchased by AUL in connection
with the initial capitalization of the "Fund."  As a result of
providing the initial capital for the Portfolios, on December 31,
1994, AUL owned 18.5% of the outstanding shares of the Fund's
Equity Portfolio, 51.6% of the Fund's Bond Portfolio, 23.5% of
the Fund's Managed Portfolio, and 34.4% of the Fund's Money
Market Portfolio.  Therefore, AUL may be able to control the
outcome of any issue submitted generally to the vote of Fund
shareholders and would be able to control the outcome of any
issue submitted to the vote of shareholders of the Bond and the
Money Market Portfolios.


American United Life Pooled Equity Fund B is a separate account
of AUL organized for the purpose of the sale of group variable
annuity contracts.



Item 27.   Number of Contractholders



As of December 31, 1994, AUL has issued 490 qualified contracts
with Participants who have invested funds in the Contracts.



Item 28.   Indemnification



Article IX, Section 1 of the by-laws of AUL provides as follows:


The corporation shall indemnify any director or officer or
former director or officer of the corporation against
expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him (and for
which he is not covered by insurance) in connection with
the defense of any action, suit or proceeding (unless such
action, suit or proceeding is settled) in which he is made
a party by reason of being or having been such director or
officer, except in relation to matters as to which he shall
be adjudged in such action, suit or proceeding, to be
liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of
his duties.  The corporation may also reimburse any
director or officer or former director or officer of the
corporation for the reasonable costs of settlement of any
such action, suit or proceeding, if it shall be found by a
majority of the directors not involved in the matter in
controversy (whether or not a quorum) that it was to the
interest of the corporation that such settlements be made
and that such director or officer was not guilty of
negligence or misconduct.  Such rights of indemnification
and reimbursement shall not be exclusive of any other
rights to which such director or officer may be entitled
under any By-law, agreement, vote of members or otherwise.






Item 29.   Principal Underwriters



(a)   AUL acts as Investment Adviser to American United Life
Pooled Equity Fund B (2-27832) and to AUL American Series
Fund, Inc. (33-30156).

(b)   For information regarding AUL's Officers and Directors, see
Item 25 above.

(c)   Not applicable






Item 30.   Location of Accounts and Records



The accounts, books and other documents required to be maintained
by Registrant pursuant to Section 31(a) of the Investment Company
Act of 1940 and the rules under that section will be maintained
at One American Square, Indianapolis, IN  46204.






Item 31.   Management Services



There are no management-related service contracts not discussed
in part A or Part B.






Item 32.   Undertakings



The registrant hereby undertakes:


(a)   to file a post-effective amendment to this registration
statement as frequently as is necessary to ensure that the
audited financial statements in this registration statement
are never more than 16 months old for so long as payments
under the variable annuity contracts may be accepted,
unless otherwise permitted.

(b)   to include either (1) as part of any application to
purchase a contract offered by the prospectus, a space that
an applicant can check to request a Statement of Additional
Information, or (2) a post card or similar written
communication affixed to or included in the prospectus that
the applicant can remove to send for a Statement of
Additional Information.

(c)   to deliver any Statement of Additional Information and any
financial statements required to be made available under
this Form promptly upon written or oral request.

Contracts to Participants in the Texas Optional Retirement

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application; the complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or for an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/​search/​search.htm, or obtained for a fee from the Public Reference Branch of the Commission, 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549, or by calling: (202) 551-8090.

Applicants' Representations:

1. AUL is an Indiana stock insurance company. AUL is the depositor and sponsor of the AUL Account, a separate investment account established under Indiana law.
2. The AUL Account is used to fund variable annuity contracts issued by AUL (each, a “Contract”).[1] 

           The income, gains or losses of the AUL Account are credited to or charged against the assets of the AUL Account without regard to other income, gains or losses of AUL. AUL owns the assets in the AUL Account and is required to maintain sufficient assets in the AUL Account to meet all AUL Account obligations under the Contracts. AUL may transfer to its general account assets that exceed anticipated obligations of the AUL Account. All obligations arising under the Contracts are general corporate Start Printed Page 75709obligations of AUL. AUL serves as sponsor and depositor of the AUL Account.
3. The AUL Account is currently divided into 419 sub-accounts referred to as Investment Accounts. Each Investment Account invests exclusively in shares of one of the mutual fund portfolios offered by the fund companies with whom AUL has executed agreements so that the portfolios of those fund companies are eligible to be selected by a Contract Owner as an investment option under a Contract issued by AUL. Contributions may be allocated to one or more Investment Accounts available under a Contract. Not all of the Investment Accounts may be available under a particular Contract and some of the Investment Accounts are not available for certain types of Contracts. Each Contract permits allocations of value to available fixed and variable subaccounts; each variable subaccount invests in a specific investment portfolio of an underlying mutual fund. The group variable annuity Contracts may allow ongoing contributions that can vary in amount and frequency. All of the Contracts provide for the accumulation of values on a variable basis, a fixed basis or both. The Contracts also provide several options for fixed annuity payments to begin on a future date.
4. The AUL Account does not impose any limitations on the number of transfers between Investment Accounts available under a Contract or between Investment Accounts and the Fixed Interest Account (an investment option under the Contracts to which contributions may be allocated for accumulation at rates guaranteed by AUL) or impose charges on transfers. Under certain circumstances, amounts transferred from the Fixed Interest Account to an Investment Account during any given year may not exceed 20% of the Fixed Interest Account's value as of the beginning of that year. AUL reserves the right, however, at a future date, to impose a different minimum or maximum transfer amount, to assess transfer charges, to change the limit on remaining balances, to limit the number and frequency of transfers, and to suspend the transfer privilege or the telephone authorization, interactive voice response, or Internet based transfers.
5. Each Contract reserves the right, upon notice to Contract Owners and in compliance with applicable law, to add, combine or remove subaccounts, or to withdraw assets from one subaccount and put them into another subaccount. Each Contract's prospectus provides that Applicants may add, remove or combine subaccounts or withdraw assets relating to a Contract from one subaccount and put them into another.
6. Applicants propose to substitute units of the VEF with units of the VVIF (the proposed “Substitution”). Applicants state that no material differences exist between VEF and VVIF from the perspective of the Contract Owners. As represented in the application, and as the table below indicates, the investment objectives and primary risks of the two portfolios are the same, and the investment strategies are substantially similar. Further, the expense ratio of the VVIF is lower than the expense ratio of VEF and the one, five and ten year performance of the VVIF for the period ended December 31, 2009 is better than that of the VEF over the same period. While VEF has seven investment advisers and VVIF has two, VVIF's advisers are both advisers of VEF.
7. Applicants submit that the foregoing demonstrates that no material difference exists between the Removed Portfolio and the Substituted Portfolio; both invest in small company stocks using a growth strategy and share the same primary risks. Accordingly, Applicants believe that the Contract Owners have a reasonable continuity in their investment expectation.
8. As of July 31, 2010, VEF had assets of approximately $6,231,000,000. As of July 31, 2010, VVIF had assets of approximately $601,000,000. Applicants believe that both VEF and VVIF hold sufficient assets such that the Substitution should be immaterial to portfolio management.

9. Among the reasons for the proposed Substitution, Applicants state that the proposed Substitution will strengthen the fund offerings within the Contracts' fund lineup. Applicants expect the proposed Substitution to provide benefits to the Contract Owners including a better performing, lower cost portfolio. The application states that Vanguard has been consulted about the proposed Substitution and has no objection to it.
10. Moreover, Applicants state that after the proposed Substitution, Contract Owners will continue to be able to select among portfolios with a full range of investment objectives, investments strategies and risks.
11. In sum, the Applicants also have concluded that the Substituted Portfolio is better suited than the Removed Portfolio to serve as the underlying portfolio for the AUL Account as an operational and procedural matter; the Substituted Portfolio is designed to serve as an investment vehicle for insurance company separate accounts.
12. In comparing expense ratios, the application states that as set forth in the Prospectuses of the Substituted Portfolio and Removed Portfolio, the Substituted Portfolio has a lower total expense ratio (0.40%) than the Removed Portfolio (0.54%). Neither the Substituted Portfolio nor the Removed Portfolio pays fees pursuant to Rule 12b-1 of the Act.
13. The chart below, as included in the application, provides a comparison of expenses:
 Management  expenses

               (in percent)Removed Portfolio, Investor Shares0.50None0.040.54Substituted Portfolio0.35None0.050.40
14. In addition to expenses, Applicants state in the application that relative performance is a reason for the substitution. According to Vanguard, the Substituted Portfolio has outperformed the Removed Portfolio over the last one, five and ten year periods for the period ended December 31, 2009. In these time periods, respectively, the Substituted Portfolio has returned 39.38%, 0.50% and 4.47%, while the Removed Portfolio has returned 36.21%, 0.44% and 3.35%, each before taxes.
15. The proposed Substitution will take place at each Portfolio's relative net asset values determined on the date of the Substitution in accordance with Section 22 of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder with no change in the amount of any Contract Owner's cash value of his or her investment in any of the subaccounts. Accordingly, there will be no financial impact on any Contract Owner. The Substitution will be effected by having the subaccount that invests in the Removed Portfolio redeem its shares at the net asset value calculated on the date of the Substitution and purchase shares of the Substituted Portfolio at the net asset value calculated on the same date.
16. The application notes that the Substitution will be described in detail in a written notice mailed to Contract Owners. The notice will inform Contract Owners of Applicants' intent to implement the Substitution and describe the Substitution, the reasons for engaging in the proposed Substitution and how the Substitution will be implemented. The notice will be mailed to all Contract Owners at least 30 days prior to the Substitution and will inform affected Contract Owners that they may transfer assets from the subaccount investing in the Removed Portfolio at any time after receipt of the notice, and from the subaccount investing in the Substituted Portfolio for 30 days after the Substitution, to any subaccounts investing in other portfolios available under their respective Contracts without the imposition of any transfer charge or limitation and without diminishing the number of free transfers that may be made in a given contract year. A supplement will be filed with the Commission for the current prospectus containing the information to be included in the notice.
17. Applicants state further that each Contract Owner will be provided a prospectus for the Substituted Portfolio. Within five business days after the Substitution, Applicants will send each affected Contract Owner written confirmation that the Substitution has occurred.
18. The application also indicates that:
(a) Applicants will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the Substitution, including all legal, accounting and allocated brokerage expenses relating to the Substitution;
(b) that no costs will be borne by the Contract Owners;
(c) that affected Contract Owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the Substitution, nor will their rights or the obligations of Applicants under the Contracts be altered in any way.
19. Applicants state that the proposed Substitution will not cause the fees and charges under the Contracts currently being paid by Contract Owners to be greater after the Substitution than before the Substitution. The Substitution will Start Printed Page 75711have no adverse tax consequences to Contract Owners and will in no way alter the tax benefits to Contract Owners.
Applicants' Legal Analysis:
1. Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act provides that it shall be unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer to substitute another security for such security unless the Commission shall have approved such substitution; and the Commission shall issue an order approving such substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policies and provisions of the 1940 Act. Section 26(c) protects the expectation of investors that the unit investment trust will accumulate shares of a particular issuer and is intended to insure that unnecessary or burdensome sales loads, additional reinvestment costs or other charges will not be incurred due to unapproved substitutions of securities. 
2. The proposed Substitution of shares held by the AUL Account, as described above, may be deemed to involve a substitution of securities within the meaning of Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act. The Applicants therefore request an order from the Commission pursuant to Section 26(c) approving the proposed Substitution.
3. The investment objective and primary risks of the Substituted Portfolio are the same as that of the Removed Portfolio and the investment strategies of the two are nearly identical; thus, Contract Owners will have reasonable continuity in investment expectations. Accordingly, the Substituted Portfolio is an appropriate investment vehicle for those Contract Owners who have Contract values allocated to the Removed Portfolio. Further, the Substituted Portfolio has lower expenses and better historical performance than that of the Removed Portfolio.
4. In connection with assets held under the Contracts affected by the Substitution, Applicants will not receive for three (3) years from the date of substitution any direct or indirect benefits from the Substituted Portfolio, its advisors or underwriters (or their affiliates) at a rate higher than that which they had received from the Removed Portfolio, its advisors or underwriters (or their affiliates) including but without limitation, 12b-1, shareholder service, administration or other service fees, revenue sharing or other arrangements.
5. Applicants represent and warrant that the Substitution and the selection of the Substituted Portfolio were not motivated by any financial consideration paid or to be paid to AUL or its affiliates by the Substituted Portfolio, its advisors or underwriters or their respective affiliates.
6. The Substitution will not result in the type of costly forced redemption that Section 26(c) was intended to guard against because the Contract Owner will continue to have the same type of investment choice, with better potential returns and lower expenses and will not otherwise have any incentive to redeem their shares or terminate their Contracts.
7. The purposes, terms and conditions of the proposed Substitution are consistent with the protection of investors, and the principles and purposes of Section 26(c), and do not entail any of the abuses that Section 26(c) is designed to prevent.
(a) The Substituted Portfolio has better historical performance than the Removed Portfolio.
(b) The current total annual operating expenses and management fee of the Substituted Portfolio are lower than those of the Removed Portfolio.
(c) The Substituted Portfolio is an appropriate portfolio to move Contract Owners' values currently allocated to the Removed Portfolio because the portfolios have the same objectives and risks and very similar strategies.
(d) All costs of the Substitution, including any allocated brokerage costs, will be borne by Applicants and will not be borne by Contract Owners. No charges will be assessed to effect the Substitution.
(e) The Substitution will be at the net asset value of the respective portfolio shares without the imposition of any transfer or similar charge and with no change in the amount of any Contract Owners' Contract values.
(f) The Substitution will not cause the fees and charges under the Contracts currently being paid by the Contract Owners to be greater after the Substitution than before the Substitution and will result in Contract Owners Contract values being moved to a portfolio with lower current total annual operating expenses.
(g) Notice of the proposed Substitution will be mailed to all Contract Owners at least 30 days prior to the Substitution, All Contract Owners will have an opportunity at any time after receipt of the notice of the Substitution and for 30 days after the Substitution to transfer Contract account value affected by the Substitution to other available subaccounts without the imposition of any transfer charge or limitation and without being counted as one of the Contract Owner's free transfers in a contract year.
(h) Within five business days after the Substitution, Applicants will send to their affected Contract Owners a written confirmation that the Substitution has occurred.
(i) The Substitution will, in no way, alter the terms of the Contracts or the obligations of Applicants under them.
(j) The Substitution will have no adverse tax consequences to Contract Owners and will, in no way, alter the tax benefits to Contract Owners.
Conclusion
Applicants assert that, for the reasons summarized above, the Commission should grant the requested order approving the Proposed Substitution.
