Company Overview


Aethlon Medical develops immunotherapeutic technologies to combat infectious disease and cancer. To augment the body's natural immune defenses, the Aethlon Hemopurifier® reduces the presence of circulating viruses in infected individuals. The technology provides a first-line candidate defense against viruses that are not addressed with proven drug therapies, including natural occurring pandemic threats and agents of bioterrorism. The Hemopurifier® can also be deployed as a strategy to improve the benefit of approved antiviral drug regimens. At present, the Hemopurifier® is being advanced in the United States under an FDA approved clinical study. Aethlon Medical is also investigating the potential use of the Hemopurifier® to reduce the presence of tumor-derived exosomes, which contribute to immune-suppression and the spread of metastasis in cancer patients. Aethlon Medical is also the majority owner of Exosome Sciences, Inc. (ESI), which is focused on the discovery of exosomal biomarkers to diagnose and monitor cancer and neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). ESI's TauSome™ biomarker is being clinically evaluated as the basis for a blood-based test to identify CTE in living individuals.

The Hemopurifier® in Cancer :: Aethlon Medical, Inc. (AEMD)

















 
























	The Hemopurifier®









The Hemopurifier® in Cancer









 



Capture Tumor-Derived Exosomes Underlying Several Forms of Cancer
Upwards of 90% of all cancer-related deaths are attributed to metastasis. The spread of cancer from a primary site of origin to other organs or areas of the body. The mechanism of how tumors metastasize to distant sites in the body has long been one of cancer's greatest mysteries. That mystery was recently solved when circulating particles known as tumor-derived exosomes were discovered to be the seeds that promote the spread and growth of cancer metastasis. 
 Aethlon initiated its tumor-derived exosome research at a time when the medical community believed exosomes were merely cellular debris with no biological function. Today, a therapeutic to address tumor-derived exosomes represents a significant unmet need in cancer care. Aethlon has demonstrated that the affinity mechanism of the Hemopurifier® can capture tumor-derived exosomes underlying several forms of cancer, including breast, ovarian and metastatic melanoma.
Our extended tumor-derived exosome research
Beyond their role in metastasis, researchers have also published mounting evidence that tumor-derived exosomes contribute to tumorigenesis (the formation of cancer), cancer progression, angiogenesis (creation of blood vessels to fuel tumor growth), immune evasion, and resistance to radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs. Recent discoveries also reveal that exosomes may contribute to bacterial and viral pathogenesis, the progression of Alzheimer and Parkinson’s diseases, the spread of prion proteins, and numerous inflammatory conditions.
