Advent International said Tuesday that its eighth flagship fund closed at $13 billion, above its $12 billion target. Advent International GPE VIII LP will invest in buyouts, recapitalizations and growth equity transactions, primarily in Europe and North America and selectively in other regions such as Asia and Latin America. Advent’s prior fund closed on $10.8 billion in 2012.
PRESS RELEASE
BOSTON and LONDON, March 22, 2016 – Advent International, one of the largest and
most experienced global private equity investors, today announced that it has completed
fundraising for Advent International GPE VIII Limited Partnership (“GPE VIII” or the “Fund”),
reaching its hard cap of $13 billion (€12 billion) after six months in the market. Advent’s
previous global fund, GPE VII, closed on $10.8 billion (€8.5 billion) in 2012.
 
GPE (Global Private Equity) VIII will pursue the same strategy as its predecessor funds,
investing in buyouts, recapitalizations and growth equity transactions, primarily in Europe
and North America and selectively in other regions such as Asia and Latin America. The
Fund will focus on five industry sectors in which Advent has significant experience and
knowledge: (1) business and financial services; (2) healthcare; (3) industrial; (4) retail,
consumer and leisure; and (5) technology, media and telecom.
 
Across its target sectors and regions, Advent will seek to invest in well-positioned companies 





with the potential for further operational improvement and partner with management teams
to create value through revenue and earnings growth.
 
“We are pleased with the strong support we received from both existing and new investors,” said
David Mussafer, a Managing Partner at Advent International in Boston. Mr. Mussafer is one of 14
Managing Partners at Advent. “We believe that our success is a result of our long-established
sector focus, global footprint and network, private partnership model, and the significant
operational resources and expertise we apply to our investments. This solid foundation positions
us well to continue to find and build successful businesses around the world.”
 
GPE VIII will be invested by a team of more than 130 investment professionals across
Europe, North America and Asia. These individuals can leverage the expertise and networks
of additional professionals from Advent’s Latin American Private Equity Fund (LAPEF)
program, which focuses on investments throughout Latin America.
 
“Our global team is one of the largest and most experienced in the private equity industry,”
said Ralf Huep, a Managing Partner at Advent International in Frankfurt. “This platform
allows us to generate a broad set of opportunities, invest selectively in the most compelling
businesses and drive operational improvement and growth to create value.”
 
“GPE VIII received commitments from a diverse base of institutional investors across the 





globe,” said Johanna Barr, a Managing Director and Global Co-Head of Limited Partner
Services at Advent International in London. “Approximately 90% of the committed capital
came from limited partners in Advent’s prior funds, with the remaining commitments provided
by a select number of new investors.”
 
“We are fortunate to have a large, loyal group of investors and greatly appreciate their
support in making this a successful fundraising,” said Robert Weaver, a Managing Director
and Global Co-Head of Limited Partner Services at Advent International in New York. “We
will work to earn their continued commitment by maintaining our focus on value creation.”
 
STRONG 25-YEAR TRACK RECORD
 
Advent’s GPE program has established a strong track record of investments and exits over
seven generations of funds and several economic and private equity cycles. Since 1990, the
program has invested in 228 private equity transactions in 29 countries and fully or
substantially realized 190 of those investments.
 
Recent investments by the GPE program include Ammeraal Beltech, Corialis, Hypo Group
Alpe Adria and Istituto Centrale delle Banche Popolari Italiane (ICBPI) in Europe; Distribution
International, Genoa and Noosa in North America; and Crompton Greaves Consumer
Electricals, The Learning Lab and QuEST Global Services in Asia.
 
Recent IPOs and sales of companies in the GPE program include Casa Reha, Douglas, 





Equiniti, GFKL Financial Services, Priory Group and Worldpay in Europe; Bojangles’, Party
City and TransUnion in North America; and CARE Hospitals in Asia.
 
KEY COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES
 
Over its long history of international investing, Advent has developed a number of core
capabilities which it believes provide significant competitive advantages throughout the
investment life cycle:
 

Long-established sector focus – Advent has been investing in each of its five target

sectors for 25 years and has made an average of over 60 investments per sector
worldwide. This expertise enables the firm to identify attractive investment opportunities in
higher-growth sub-sectors, develop and implement effective value creation plans and
position companies favorably for exit.

Global footprint and network – With over 170 investment professionals in 10 countries

on four continents, Advent brings to its investments both a broad global perspective and
deep knowledge of local markets. This platform allows the firm to help businesses grow
through international expansion, cross-border acquisitions and other initiatives.

Private partnership model – Advent remains a traditional private partnership owned and

operated by 45 partners and governed by a group of 14 Managing Partners. The firm
believes its ownership structure and economic incentives ensure that it is closely aligned 





with the interests of its investors.

Significant operational resources and expertise – To complement its deal team’s

capabilities, Advent draws on additional operational and sub-sector expertise, including an
in-house Portfolio Support Group and over 70 highly experienced external Operating
Partners. These Operating Partners, typically former CEOs, work alongside Advent’s
sector teams and management to support the development of companies through their
industry knowledge, operational know-how, leadership experience and contact networks.
 
In addition to the GPE program, Advent is currently investing its sixth Latin American private
equity fund, LAPEF VI. Capitalized at $2.1 billion, the 2015-vintage fund focuses on buyouts
and growth equity investments in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Chile and other countries
in the region.
 
This press release is not an offer or solicitation of an offer, or an invitation or inducement, to
invest in any Advent International fund. No person may invest in any Advent International
fund except in accordance with and subject to the terms of the applicable fund
documentation and applicable law.

 Advent International raises $13 billion (€12 billion) global private equity fund

Firm’s eighth global fund exceeds $12 billion target and reaches $13 billion hard cap in six months
Fund will pursue Advent’s sector-focused strategy and operational approach to create value in companies through revenue and earnings growth

 


BOSTON and LONDON, March 22, 2016 – Advent International, one of the largest and most experienced global private equity investors, today announced that it has completed fundraising for Advent International GPE VIII Limited Partnership (“GPE VIII” or the “Fund”), reaching its hard cap of $13 billion (€12 billion) after six months in the market. Advent’s previous global fund, GPE VII, closed on $10.8 billion (€8.5 billion) in 2012.
GPE (Global Private Equity) VIII will pursue the same strategy as its predecessor funds, investing in buyouts, recapitalizations and growth equity transactions, primarily in Europe and North America and selectively in other regions such as Asia and Latin America. The Fund will focus on five industry sectors in which Advent has significant experience and knowledge: (1) business and financial services; (2) healthcare; (3) industrial; (4) retail, consumer and leisure; and (5) technology, media and telecom.
Across its target sectors and regions, Advent will seek to invest in well-positioned companies with the potential for further operational improvement and partner with management teams to create value through revenue and earnings growth.
“We are pleased with the strong support we received from both existing and new investors,” said David Mussafer, a Managing Partner at Advent International in Boston. Mr. Mussafer is one of 14 Managing Partners at Advent. “We believe that our success is a result of our long-established sector focus, global footprint and network, private partnership model, and the significant operational resources and expertise we apply to our investments. This solid foundation positions us well to continue to find and build successful businesses around the world.”
GPE VIII will be invested by a team of more than 130 investment professionals across Europe, North America and Asia. These individuals can leverage the expertise and networks of additional professionals from Advent’s Latin American Private Equity Fund (LAPEF) program, which focuses on investments throughout Latin America.
“Our global team is one of the largest and most experienced in the private equity industry,” said Ralf Huep, a Managing Partner at Advent International in Frankfurt. “This platform allows us to generate a broad set of opportunities, invest selectively in the most compelling businesses and drive operational improvement and growth to create value.”
“GPE VIII received commitments from a diverse base of institutional investors across the globe,” said Johanna Barr, a Managing Director and Global Co-Head of Limited Partner Services at Advent International in London. “Approximately 90% of the committed capital came from limited partners in Advent’s prior funds, with the remaining commitments provided by a select number of new investors.”
“We are fortunate to have a large, loyal group of investors and greatly appreciate their support in making this a successful fundraising,” said Robert Weaver, a Managing Director and Global Co-Head of Limited Partner Services at Advent International in New York. “We will work to earn their continued commitment by maintaining our focus on value creation.”
STRONG 25-YEAR TRACK RECORD
Advent’s GPE program has established a strong track record of investments and exits over seven generations of funds and several economic and private equity cycles. Since 1990, the program has invested in 228 private equity transactions in 29 countries and fully or substantially realized 190 of those investments.
Recent investments by the GPE program include Ammeraal Beltech, Corialis, Hypo Group Alpe Adria and Istituto Centrale delle Banche Popolari Italiane (ICBPI) in Europe; Distribution International, Genoa and Noosa in North America; and Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals, The Learning Lab and QuEST Global Services in Asia.
Recent IPOs and sales of companies in the GPE program include Casa Reha, Douglas, Equiniti, GFKL Financial Services, Priory Group and Worldpay in Europe; Bojangles’, Party City and TransUnion in North America; and CARE Hospitals in Asia.
KEY COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES
Over its long history of international investing, Advent has developed a number of core capabilities which it believes provide significant competitive advantages throughout the investment life cycle:

Long-established sector focus – Advent has been investing in each of its five target sectors for 25 years and has made an average of over 60 investments per sector worldwide. This expertise enables the firm to identify attractive investment opportunities in higher-growth sub-sectors, develop and implement effective value creation plans and position companies favorably for exit.
Global footprint and network – With over 170 investment professionals in 10 countries on four continents, Advent brings to its investments both a broad global perspective and deep knowledge of local markets. This platform allows the firm to help businesses grow through international expansion, cross-border acquisitions and other initiatives.
Private partnership model – Advent remains a traditional private partnership owned and operated by 45 partners and governed by a group of 14 Managing Partners. The firm believes its ownership structure and economic incentives ensure that it is closely aligned with the interests of its investors.
Significant operational resources and expertise – To complement its deal team’s capabilities, Advent draws on additional operational and sub-sector expertise, including an in-house Portfolio Support Group and over 70 highly experienced external Operating Partners. These Operating Partners, typically former CEOs, work alongside Advent’s sector teams and management to support the development of companies through their industry knowledge, operational know-how, leadership experience and contact networks.

In addition to the GPE program, Advent is currently investing its sixth Latin American private equity fund, LAPEF VI. Capitalized at $2.1 billion, the 2015-vintage fund focuses on buyouts and growth equity investments in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Chile and other countries in the region.
This press release is not an offer or solicitation of an offer, or an invitation or inducement, to invest in any Advent International fund. No person may invest in any Advent International fund except in accordance with and subject to the terms of the applicable fund documentation and applicable law.

Advent was founded in Boston, Massachusetts as a spin-out from TA Associates by Peter Brooke. Brooke had founded TA Associates in 1968 after having expanded the venture capital operations of TA's parent Tucker Anthony & R.L. Day. In 1985, Advent raised its first fund – a $14 million corporate venture capital program for Nabisco. In 1987, the firm raised the $225 million International Network Fund, its first institutional private equity fund. The firm raised its first European fund in 1989, when the $231 million European Special Situations Fund and opened its London office.

In 1996, Advent expanded into Latin America raising a dedicated Advent Latin American Private Equity Fund and opening offices in Buenos Aires, Mexico City, and Sao Paulo.
Advent crossed the billion dollar mark in 1997, with the raising of the $1.2 billion Advent Global Private Equity (GPE) III, and in the last few years of the 1990s, Advent raised additional sector funds focused on media and communications as well as healthcare and life sciences. Advent's founder, Peter Brooke, stepped down as the firm's CEO in 1996, but remained active as the company's chairman.[2]
Through the 2000s, Advent's expansion accelerated as the firm raised additional funds for its various fund families and opening new offices in Europe and Asia. Advent's sixth global private equity fund, raised in 2008 closed with €6.6 billion of investor commitments and the firm raised an additional €1 billion for investments in central Europe.[3][4]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
