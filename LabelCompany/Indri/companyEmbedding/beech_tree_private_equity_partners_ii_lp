Investment Criteria


At its simplest, we are seeking ambitious management teams who see an opportunity to grow their businesses rapidly. We provide the capital and expertise to capture the opportunity.




We invest in profitable businesses with a value between £10 million and £100 million, typically investing £10 million to £40 million of equity capital per transaction.
Every transaction and deal situation is different and we are flexible with our investment approach.




The businesses that we invest in are likely to have some, if not all of the following characteristics:

The potential to become a market leading business in a growing sub-sector.
A disruptive business model for its industry.
The ability to develop internationally.
The ability to consolidate a market through acquisitions (or a “buy and build” opportunity as we call it).

Hunger, determination and a strong growth opportunity are the key ingredients we need to make it enjoyable and successful.
