  "Maria will ensure a smooth transition given her in-depth knowledge of        the company’s financial operations" 



MCLEAN, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Science Applications International Corp. (NYSE: SAIC) announced today 
      the appointment of Corporate Controller Maria M. Bishop as interim Chief 
      Financial Officer, effective July 1. Bishop will serve as interim CFO

      since 1998, and has been a member of the corporate finance team for the 
      past decade. As controller, she manages the company’s finance and 
      accounting activities including financial reporting, internal controls, 
      government compliance, corporate tax, and financial planning and 
      analysis.
    

      “Maria will ensure a smooth transition given her in-depth knowledge of 
      the company’s financial operations,” said CEO Tony Moraco. “She has 
      broad and deep experience across our strong finance organization, and is 
      a member of the senior leadership team.”
