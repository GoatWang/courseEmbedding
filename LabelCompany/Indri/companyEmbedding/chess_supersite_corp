About Chess Stars

What is Chess Stars?

Chess Stars is a new type of chess site, a sociable chess site.
Chess Stars is designed to bring people together by centering around the members - you.
When a game begins you can immediately chat with your opponent, and when the game ends you may continue to do so - in fact, you can review the game with both players sharing the chessboard.
Furthermore, Chess Stars puts a wealth of information at your fingertips - openings, ECO codes, book moves and even computer analysis you can see in every game you look at.
If you know someone in real life, or on Facebook, once you know their username you can easily find them on Chess Stars and play chess, review games, or just chat with them.
Add them to your Friend list and you will always know when they are on line with you here.
We hope you enjoy Chess Stars and use it to develop and expand your friendships, have fun and improve your play at chess!

The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the Selling
Shareholder Shares.


The Company faces significant competition in its business. The Company competes
for the time, attention and discretionary spending of users and players with
other game developers and chess websites based on the quality of user
experience, brand awareness and reputation. Other developers of online games may
develop more compelling content that competes with the Company’s games and
adversely affects the Company’s ability to attract and retain players and their
entertainment time.

Nevertheless, the Company believes that it distinguishes itself from the
competition on the above factors. Furthermore, the Company believes its
management’s knowledge of the game of chess and the relevant markets related to
chess will allow the Company to succeed. Likewise, the Company believes that
certain features of the website, such as chess-skilled contests, are unique.


Company Description
The Company is a development-stage company planning to develop and operate an
online platform for viewing and playing chess. The Company was incorporated in
the State of Delaware in July 2013, and was formerly known as River Run
Acquisition Corporation (“River Run” or “River Run


 Acquisition”).
---

The Company intends to become a leading online chess site featuring a
sophisticated playing zone, game broadcasts with software analyses and top
analysts' commentaries, education and other chess oriented resources.

The Company plans to capitalize on global high speed Internet access to deliver
a high quality website for an optimal playing experience. The Company
anticipates that it will be able to deliver a premier online chess playing
experience.

The Company’s website will feature broadcasts of top worldwide competitions and
chess matches, interactive educational materials, online play and interactive
tournaments, as well as other services.

The Company believes that chess players have two major needs: (1) to play
against each other and (2) to watch games of top players including Grandmasters.
The Company considers the viewing of chess games as particularly adaptable to
the Internet. Moreover, the Internet will allow for real time or archived
viewing while enjoying the comments, announcements and analyses of top experts.

The Company anticipates that the playing zone will utilize two-level
architecture allowing thousands of users to watch and play as individuals and/or
as teams. Web-based services designed for browsers and table computers will
initially be the project's centerpiece and main point of focus. The Company
anticipates that such an Internet site will have a great appeal to the vast
worldwide chess playing population.
