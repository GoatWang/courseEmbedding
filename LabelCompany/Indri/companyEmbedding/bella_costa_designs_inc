Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten basis: no minimum number of
shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The offering price per
share is $0.02. The following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the
sale of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the securities offered for sale
by the Company. There is no assurance that we will raise the full $80,000 as
anticipated.

Gross offering                $20,000      $40,000      $60,000      $80,000

Clothing import               $ 10,000     $ 25,000     $ 42,000     $ 60,000

We will allocate our proceeds as described in each of the scenarios described in
the Use of Proceeds table and the following disclosures.

Regardless of the amount of funds raised we will initially seek to use the
proceeds of the offering to cover our legal and professional fees of $10,000 for
all of our scenarios. Legal and professional fees are: audit fees, legal fees,
transfer agent fees and etc. that will incur every month or every quarter when
the company needs to file new Financial Reports.

As recorded on our balance sheet, to this date our paid offering expenses were
$6,620 consisting of professional fees, general administrative expenses and
incorporation expenses. This resulted in $2,216 outstanding related party loan
to our director. Those advances are unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on
demand. We have no other outstanding unpaid amounts at this time.

The Company is attempting to commence operations and generate sufficient
revenue; however, the Company's cash position may not be sufficient to support
the Company's daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by
way of a private or public offering.

$20,000

BC DESIGNS INC.'s legal and professional fees are estimated to be $10,000 for
the year, regardless of the amount of funds raised in this offering.

Clothing import will consist of us ordering products such as wedding and evening
dresses and accessories from our manufacturers in Asia. This cost will include
the import duties of 0%-15% depending on the weight, price and material of the
product. The initial import cost will be $ 10,000.

If we raise more than $20,000 in this offering we will use our proceeds as
follows under each offering scenario:

$40,000

BC DESIGNS INC's legal and professional fees are estimated to be $10,000 for the
year, regardless of the amount of funds raised in this offering.

Establishing an office will include all the costs of establishing and 
maintaining an office/storage space, furniture, technology (computers, printer,
scanner etc), office supplies, communication (telephone, internet). To start
establishing an office will cost us $800 for 1 laptop for Mr. Perez, $500 for
office furniture such as 1 office table with 2 chairs, and $200 for printers,
scanners, Home Office software and other office supplies, and $500 for high
speed internet and telephone services. We are currently using our director's
home office for business purposes; we do not pay rent to Mr. Perez and have no
arrangements to pay the rent in the future.

Advertising column includes putting links of advertisement of our website on
other websites, printing of flyers for our potential clients and browsers. All
of which will cost us $1,000. This will be the same for all of our scenarios.

Web development column will consist of costs of developing and hosting our
website, potential upgrades and additions, Photoshop software to make the photos
we take and post on our website seem more attractive, hiring professional help
to make our website look inviting and easy to navigate. The cost of initial web
development will be $1,500. Twelve months hosting with registration of our
domain will cost the Company $500.

Clothing import cost will increase to $25,000 as we will order more products.

Initially we will be using public transportation and/or taxi to go to meetings,
to deliver flyers , to drop of packages at the post office or to travel to/from
trade fairs. We are not including this expense in the use of proceeds table
because these costs will be paid out of the revenue that we will generate. We
will not use the proceeds from this offering to pay Mr. Perez for this expense.

$60,000

BC DESIGNS INC's legal and professional fees are estimated to be $10,000 for the
year, regardless of the amount of funds raised in this offering.

Establishing an office: will increase to $4,000 as we intend to buy a
professional camera to take quality pictures of the dresses in our inventory.

Advertising: will stay at $1,000.

Web development expenses: will increase to $3,000 as we will hire an additional
help to make changes/ upgrades to our website.

Clothing import cost will increase to $42,000 as we will order more products.

$80,000

BC DESIGNS INC's legal and professional fees are estimated to be $10,000 for the
year, regardless of the amount of funds raised in this offering.

Establishing an office expenses: will increase to $6,000 as intend to rent an
office space with storage (approximately 1,000 sq. feet) in the center of Aldea
Las Canoas in Guatemala.

Advertising: will stay at $1,000.

Web development expenses: will stay at $3,000.

Clothing import: will increase to $60,000 as we will purchase more product.

We depend on funds from this public offering. If we raise less than 25% of the
offering, we will not have enough money to cover our offering expenses and
professional fees necessary to remain current with our reporting obligations. If
necessary, Mr. Perez, our president has verbally agreed to loan the company
funds to complete the registration process and to implement our complete
business plan. Mr. Perez is not legally obligated to provide the funding. We
will also to raise additional funds through the sale of our common stock or
obtain additional loans from our director. We do not have any arrangements to
raise additional funds or obtain loans as of today.

We intend to hire two to three employees as soon as our operations grow
estimated to be at the end of December 2015. Our employees will be compensated
solely by commission payments based on their performance. The payment to our
employees will come from our product sales. Proceeds of this offering will not
be used to pay our employees.


Our competition will include other stores and websites with similar wedding
dresses and evening attire. However, since Internet became a huge part of our
lives, most customers start looking online for clothing and we intend to have
unique hard to find styles that will give us an advantage over our competitors.
Moreover, having an option to order a custom made dress will broaden our
clientele and give our clients a more unique experience.

There can be no assurance that we can maintain a competitive position against
current or future competitors, particularly those with greater financial,
marketing, service, and support, technical and other resources. Our failure to
maintain a competitive position within the market could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can
be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and
future competitors, and competitive pressures faced by us may have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


Company Description
Bella Costa Designs Inc. is an import company of wedding and evening dresses. As
of July 31, 201 5 our balance is $ 96 . At this stage the only steps we have
taken to develop our company are: writing and preparing our business plan,
making contacts with potential manufacturers of dresses in Asia


 and interviewing
potential website developers. We intend to import wedding and evening dresses
from Asia to Guatemala to be sold online to anyone in Latin America. We expect
to import dresses of the latest style and fashion and price all dresses at 
competitive prices. Moreover, we intend to provide an option to order a custom
made dress of the design we carry with customized measurements for our clients.
We expect our website to have different sections such as: Home, Wedding dresses,
Evening dresses, Accessories, Order Custom Dress, Common Questions, Contact Us.
We intend to make our website easy to navigate with many different styles of 
dresses and different photos of each dress to give our clients the best idea of
the dress they will be receiving. For the custom made dresses ordered online 
each client can choose the type of color of the dress, put in their own
measurements and leave comment as to any other minor changes they would like us 
to make. For example, our client can request to have the back of the dress more 
open or pearl-like decorations to be added to the material etc. Every dress
ordered through our website we intend to order from our manufacturers with those
specific details as asked by the client. We expect our manufacturers to make the
custom made dress within 2-3 weeks and ship it to us by fast service. Our 
customer shopping on our website can expect to receive their custom made dress
within 4 weeks from the date ordered. Once we find the qualified web designer to
start on our page we estimate the website to be fully functional within 2 months
after the starting date. During those months we intend to advertise and promote
our website on social networks such as facebook, twitter and instagram, through
trade shoes and flyers, and through word of mouth.
---

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 15, 2014. Our principal
executive office is located at Sector Central. Lote 31, Aldea alas Canoas, 
Guatemala. And our phone number is 347-708-0067.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
