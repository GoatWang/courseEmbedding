Aptevo Therapeutics Inc. and Alligator Bioscience Announce Plans to Co-Develop Novel Bispecific Antibody for Tumor-Directed Immunotherapy
Jul 20 17
Aptevo Therapeutics Inc. and Alligator Bioscience announced that they have entered into an agreement to co-develop a novel immunotherapy bispecific antibody candidate, ALG.APV-527, based on Alligator’s first generation bispecific antibody, ATOR-1016. The new bispecific candidate was developed using Aptevo’s bispecific technology platform and includes proprietary binding elements generated by Alligator’s ALLIGATOR-GOLD® antibody library. Initiation of cell line development for the manufacturing of clinical material is expected to begin shortly. Working under a previously executed material transfer agreement, the companies have engineered and selected ALG.APV-527 as a lead bispecific antibody candidate, featuring a novel mechanism of action targeting 4-1BB, a member of the TNFR superfamily of co-stimulatory receptors found on activated T cells, and an undisclosed tumor antigen widely overexpressed in a number of different types of cancer. Under the terms of the agreement, the parties will jointly own and share equally in the development costs associated with advancing this candidate through to the end of Phase 2 clinical development. At that time, the parties may opt to out-license the candidate or continue further development separately or in partnership. In addition, the agreement provides an option for the companies to develop a second bispecific antibody candidate based on this novel mechanism of action, which would also be jointly owned and funded by Aptevo and Alligator. The co-stimulatory receptor 4-1BB is known to play an important role in modulating and augmenting the immune response to cancer by promoting the activation, expansion and enhanced effector function of tumor-specific T cells. It is, therefore, an especially promising target for new immunotherapeutic approaches for cancer treatment. If successfully developed, this new bispecific antibody candidate could have utility in the potential treatment of a broad spectrum of cancers including breast, cervical, non-small-cell-lung, prostate, renal, gastric, colorectal and bladder cancers. While this tumor antigen is widely expressed in multiple types of solid tumors, it shows limited expression on normal tissues, suggesting the potential for tumor-directed immunotherapy with improved efficacy and fewer side effects.

Strategic Partnership Will Advance Development of a Novel Bispecific
Immuno-Oncology Antibody Targeting Compelling Biological Pathway
Implicated in Multiple Solid Tumor Indications


Focuses on New Mechanism of Action of Tumor Targeting Demonstrating 

the Versatility of Alligator's Antibody Discovery Platform ALLIGATOR-GOLD®

and Aptevo's ADAPTIR™ Protein Therapeutic Platform

SEATTLE and LUND, Sweden, July  20, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Aptevo Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq:APVO), a biotechnology company focused on developing novel immuno-oncology and hematology therapeutics, and Alligator Bioscience (Nasdaq Stockholm: ATORX), a biotechnology company developing antibody-based pharmaceuticals for tumor-directed immunotherapy, today announced that they have entered into an agreement to co-develop a novel immunotherapy bispecific antibody candidate, ALG.APV-527, based on Alligator's first generation bispecific antibody, ATOR-1016.  The new bispecific candidate was developed using Aptevo's bispecific technology platform and includes proprietary binding elements generated by Alligator's ALLIGATOR-GOLD® antibody library.  Initiation of cell line development for the manufacturing of clinical material is expected to begin shortly.
Working under a previously executed material transfer agreement, the companies have engineered and selected ALG.APV-527 as a lead bispecific antibody candidate, featuring a novel mechanism of action targeting 4-1BB, a member of the TNFR superfamily of co-stimulatory receptors found on activated T cells, and an undisclosed tumor antigen widely overexpressed in a number of different types of cancer.
Under the terms of the agreement, the parties will jointly own and share equally in the development costs associated with advancing this candidate through to the end of Phase 2 clinical development.  At that time, the parties may opt to out-license the candidate or continue further development separately or in partnership.  In addition, the agreement provides an option for the companies to develop a second bispecific antibody candidate based on this novel mechanism of action, which would also be jointly owned and funded by Aptevo and Alligator.
The co-stimulatory receptor 4-1BB is known to play an important role in modulating and augmenting the immune response to cancer by promoting the activation, expansion and enhanced effector function of tumor-specific T cells. It is, therefore, an especially promising target for new immunotherapeutic approaches for cancer treatment.  If successfully developed, this new bispecific antibody candidate could have utility in the potential treatment of a broad spectrum of cancers including breast, cervical, non-small-cell-lung, prostate, renal, gastric, colorectal and bladder cancers.  While this tumor antigen is widely expressed in multiple types of solid tumors, it shows limited expression on normal tissues, suggesting the potential for tumor-directed immunotherapy with improved efficacy and fewer side effects.
"Our collaboration with Alligator Bioscience has unlocked tremendous synergies, enabling us to capitalize on our companies' respective expertise in therapeutic antibody engineering," said Marvin L. White, President and Chief Executive Officer of Aptevo.  "The addition of a 4-1BB bispecific candidate expands and diversifies Aptevo's portfolio while demonstrating the flexibility of our ADAPTIR platform in addressing novel mechanisms of action, in addition to redirected T-cell cytotoxicity.  Also, importantly, it allows us to pursue an exciting new therapeutic opportunity with broad potential application in the treatment of non-hematological cancers.  If proven successful, this new approach would be a significant advance in cancer immunotherapy.  We're extremely pleased to collaborate with Alligator Bioscience in the development of novel tumor-targeting bispecific antibody therapies."
"With five immuno-oncology programs currently in development, each with first- or best-in-class potential, this partnership with Aptevo allows us to further build on the promise of bispecific therapeutics for tumor-directed immunotherapy," said Per Norlén, Chief Executive Officer of Alligator Bioscience.  "Our technology platform enables the generation of highly functional antibodies with optimal stability and manufacturing properties, merged into an exceptional bispecific antibody using Aptevo´s ADAPTIR platform.  We look forward to advancing our collaboration with Aptevo on this promising new therapeutic approach."

Company Description (as filed with the SEC)
We are a biotechnology company focused on novel oncology (cancer) and hematology
(blood disease) therapeutics to meaningfully improve patients' lives. Our core
technology is the ADAPTIR(TM) (modular protein technology) platform. We have four
revenue-generating products in the areas of hematology and infectious diseases,
as well as various investigational stage product candidates in immuno-oncology.

On August 6, 2015, Emergent BioSolutions Inc., (Emergent or Former Parent),
announced a plan to separate into two independent publicly traded companies. To
accomplish this separation, Emergent created Aptevo Therapeutics Inc. or Aptevo,
to be the parent company for the development-based biotechnology business
focused on novel oncology and hematology therapeutics. Aptevo was incorporated
in Delaware in February 2016 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Emergent.  ... More ...

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
