John Edward Michael Moore, Baron Moore of Lower Marsh PC (born 26 November 1937) is a British politician who was Member of Parliament for Croydon Central from February 1974 until 1992. During the Premiership of Margaret Thatcher he enjoyed a meteoric rise through the ranks of government which culminated in him serving as Secretary of State for Social Services from 1987 to 1989. For a time, he was considered a rising star of the Conservative Party and a potential leadership contender.
He was particularly noted for his "filmstar good looks" and an American background. Moore's wife was American and he had lived for several years in the USA. He brought aspects of American corporate culture to government and was reported to speak with a slight American accent. His first political experience was as a Democratic Party organiser in Illinois during the early 1960s.
However, his fortunes in government waned after 1987 when he was made responsible for the highly sensitive portfolios of health and social security. His earlier success had been as a facilitator of the Thatcher government's privatisation programme. In this capacity he became known as "Mr Privatisation". When Moore attempted to extend this concept into the management of the National Health Service and the wider provision of social services, he encountered opposition from all sides. After losing credibility he was effectively demoted in 1988 (through loss of the health portfolio) and then sacked from his cabinet post in 1989.
The Times diary (13 January 1988) described him as follows;

His face it is blank, his blue tie is neat; A slight flush can be seen on his cheek; But though his jaw juts and his gestures are tough; His impression of strength comes out weak.

He left the House of Commons in 1992, and subsequently held a number of corporate directorships and chairmanships.

Early life[edit]
Moore was born in Kentish Town, London. His father was a factory worker who later became a publican. He attended the Licensed Victuallers' School in Slough, an independent school supported by his father's trade body.[1] After leaving school, Moore undertook two years of National Service from 1955 to 1957. He served with the Royal Sussex Regiment and spent some time in Korea.
He enrolled at the London School of Economics in 1958, and followed a three-year degree course. He was active in student politics, and held the position of President of the LSE Students' Union. During this time he met fellow student Sheila Tillotson. Moore accompanied Tillotson back to her native Chicago after the two had both completed their studies. Here the couple married, and Moore found work initially as a financial analyst with a Chicago investment bank. He became a stockbroker, and achieved a senior position at the Chicago office of the Dean Witter brokerage. Dean Witter catered to a mainly middle-class clientele, with the typical client holding only a modest portfolio of stock.
While in Chicago, Moore became a Democratic Party activist and served as a "precinct captain". In this capacity he gained experience of American political campaigning which he later applied in the UK. He was reportedly much impressed by President John F. Kennedy, and adopted him as a role model.
Moore returned to the UK in 1968, and took up an appointment in London as Chairman of Dean Witter (International). The Moores set up residence in the suburb of Wimbledon where their three children (one daughter and two sons) were born. Moore became active in local Conservative politics and was elected to serve as a Councillor in the London Borough of Merton in 1971. He initially gave the impression of being a liberal conservative. For example, he opposed the withdrawal of free school milk from the Borough's children which was happening as the result of the policy of Margaret Thatcher, then Secretary of State for Education.
In October 1973, he was adopted as the prospective Conservative parliamentary candidate for the Croydon Central constituency. At this time he was described as being "an investment banker and stockbroker, age 36".[2]
Early political career[edit]
Croydon Central was a new constituency, and was initially very marginally Conservative. Moore won the seat in the February 1974 general election by a majority of 1,300 votes over Labour. His majority was reduced to 150 in the October 1974 general election. However, he was able to strengthen his position in the constituency; the last time he contested the seat (in the 1987 general election) he achieved a majority of over 10,000.[3] His wife, Sheila, acted as his constituency secretary, speech writer and political adviser. She combined her duties in this regard with studying for a law degree and acting as a local magistrate. Observers commented that Sheila was very much the driving force behind his rise in politics.[4]
Moore projected the image of a young, vigorous politician. He would usually rise at 5.30 am and be at his desk by 7 am. He was a member of the House of Commons football team and the House skiing team. It is reported that his wife "... kept him on a strict regime of camomile tea, decaffeinated coffee and health food...."[5] He was frequently seen jogging in the early morning in the Westminster area, and was reported to spend 30 minutes each day on an exercise bicycle. Conservative MP Julian Critchley described him as being;

Handsome, with the sort of looks that would have appealed to J. Arthur Rank, personable and polite, he looks ten years younger than his 49 years.[6]

Margaret Thatcher appointed Moore as one of five Conservative Party vice-chairmen in March 1975, shortly after she became Conservative leader. Moore's remit was "youth". He held this position until the Conservatives were returned to office in 1979, at which time he was appointed as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Energy. In this capacity, one of his main duties was responsibility for the nationalised British coal industry.
After the 1983 general election, Moore was appointed Economic Secretary to the Treasury under Chancellor Nigel Lawson. At the Treasury, Moore was charged with fronting government policy on privatisation. Most notably, he oversaw the privatisation of British Telecom in 1984 and that of several other major concerns. The privatisation of state-owned industries was a major feature of the Thatcher governments. These privatisations were popularised by small parcels of shares in the privatised entities being made available to members of the public at deeply discounted prices. This promoted a form of popular capitalism along the lines of the Dean Witter business model. Moore gained an extremely high profile and became known as "Mr Privatisation".
Cabinet career[edit]
He joined Mrs Thatcher's Cabinet in 1986 as Secretary of State for Transport. His tenure of office at Transport was brief but coincided with the completion of major developments such as the M25 London orbital motorway and the privatisation of British Airways. The capsizing of the Herald of Free Enterprise car ferry outside Zeebrugge harbour on 6 March 1987 gave Moore considerable media exposure. These events served to raise Moore's profile even further and he played a prominent campaign role in the 1987 general election.

... what probably clinched his promotion to the DHSS yesterday was his TV performance in the party political broadcast that attacked the loony left. It was Thatcher herself who suggested that Moore be used on it. The broadcast was, according to one observer, considered "sharp, nasty – and effective".[7]

By now, Moore was being widely spoken of as a future Prime Minister. The commentator Brian Walden wrote "... he has future Tory leader written all over him".[8] After the 1987 election he was appointed as Secretary of State for Social Services. In this capacity he was responsible for the National Health Service's £66 billion annual spend, and the payment of over £50 billion annually in the form of social security benefits. These were highly sensitive portfolios that were intended to be very much at the centre of policy initiatives in the 1987 government.
However, there were some early misgivings about the appointment. Julian Critchley described Moore's earlier career in government as "The script had been written for him, and he had only to learn his lines".[9] Other commentators noted that his previous experience had been in implementing policy rather than in creating policy.
Once established in his new job, Moore delivered a series of speeches on policy in the social services. These speeches appeared to indicate a move to a healthcare system based on private insurance, similar to the American model. Specific proposals included making private healthcare insurance contributions tax-deductible, and allowing nurses' wage rates to be established by local bargaining rather than by central negotiation. Moore quickly encountered opposition from various interest groups, including the Royal College of Physicians. Many Conservative backbench MPs had misgivings about what was being proposed. Furthermore, some of the speeches suggested that Moore was positioning himself to be leader of the Conservative Party. During a visit to the U.S. in October 1987, he delivered a speech to the Mont Pelerin Society in which he appeared to suggest that he had been the prime mover behind privatisation in the UK. This displeased his fellow Ministers and other senior Party figures.[10]
Moore did not seem to engage comfortably in the public estimate procedures by which departmental spending budgets were set. The then Chief Secretary to the Treasury, John Major, was reported to have found Moore to be "a soft touch". The then Health Minister, Edwina Currie, is reported to have described Moore as being "useless". An entry in her diary dated January 1988 reads "It became apparent during the first ten days ... that Moore just didn't know what to do".[11] Moore found difficulties in his relationships with senior civil servants. Not all the latter were comfortable with a working day that started at 7 am. Moore's wife (and political adviser) Sheila had clashes with civil servants, and Moore was privately warned that she did not understand the British way of doing things. It is believed that Sheila may have drafted some of Moore's more controversial speeches.[12]
In November 1987, Moore was struck down with bacterial pneumonia. He initially tried to ignore the illness and attended a cabinet meeting before he had recovered. During the meeting he became unconscious. He was subsequently admitted to the Parkside Hospital in Wimbledon. The fact that this was a private clinic owned by a German healthcare company (reportedly charging patients up to £2,000 per day) attracted bad publicity. Union leader Rodney Bickerstaffe stated "How can a social services secretary claim to care about the National Health Service when he does not even trust his own health care to an NHS hospital?".[12]
End of political career[edit]
After two months' absence due to illness, Moore returned to work. But by now his political prospects were much diminished. On 25 July 1988, he lost the health portfolio to Kenneth Clarke. Moore retained his social security portfolio and stayed in cabinet as Secretary of State for Social Security for a further year. However, his credibility was further damaged by speeches in which he appeared to suggest that poverty had been abolished in modern Britain. His attempt to target state assistance towards poorer families while freezing child benefits provoked a major rebellion by Conservative backbench MPs.
Moore was sacked from the cabinet in July 1989. Most commentators at the time considered him to have been a weak politician who had been promoted beyond his ability.[13]

He was written off by one Tory as 'like a frightened rabbit mesmerised by oncoming headlights'.[14]

He gave up his parliamentary seat at the time of the 1992 general election and subsequently held a number of directorships with large concerns, including Credit Suisse Asset Management and Rolls Royce plc. He has recently[when?] retired as Chairman of the Monitor Group, Europe.[15]
After leaving the Commons in 1992, Moore became a life peer as Baron Moore of Lower Marsh, of Lower Marsh in the London Borough of Lambeth.[16] A BBC feature in August 2011 reported that after 20 years in the House of Lords, Moore had still to make his maiden speech;

While he worked behind the scenes as a political operator he was very effective ... but he was suddenly thrust into the spotlight in the mammoth task of defending the government on the issues of health and social security ... and he just bombed[17]

Union leader Rodney Bickerstaffe stated "How can a social services secretary claim to care about the National Health Service when he does not even trust his own health care to an NHS hospital?".[12]
End of political career[edit]
After two months' absence due to illness, Moore returned to work. But by now his political prospects were much diminished. On 25 July 1988, he lost the health portfolio to Kenneth Clarke. Moore retained his social security portfolio and stayed in cabinet as Secretary of State for Social Security for a further year. However, his credibility was further damaged by speeches in which he appeared to suggest that poverty had been abolished in modern Britain. His attempt to target state assistance towards poorer families while freezing child benefits provoked a major rebellion by Conservative backbench MPs.
Moore was sacked from the cabinet in July 1989. Most commentators at the time considered him to have been a weak politician who had been promoted beyond his ability.[13]

He was written off by one Tory as 'like a frightened rabbit mesmerised by oncoming headlights'.[14]

He gave up his parliamentary seat at the time of the 1992 general election and subsequently held a number of directorships with large concerns, including Credit Suisse Asset Management and Rolls Royce plc. He has recently[when?] retired as Chairman of the Monitor Group, Europe.[15]
After leaving the Commons in 1992, Moore became a life peer as Baron Moore of Lower Marsh, of Lower Marsh in the London Borough of Lambeth.[16] A BBC feature in August 2011 reported that after 20 years in the House of Lords, Moore had still to make his maiden speech;

While he worked behind the scenes as a political operator he was very effective ... but he was suddenly thrust into the spotlight in the mammoth task of defending the government on the issues of health and social security ... and he just bombed[17]

John Edward Michael Moore, Baron Moore of Lower Marsh PC (born 26 November 1937) is a British politician who was Member of Parliament for Croydon Central from February 1974 until 1992. During the Premiership of Margaret Thatcher he enjoyed a meteoric rise through the ranks of government which culminated in him serving as Secretary of State for Social Services from 1987 to 1989. For a time, he was considered a rising star of the Conservative Party and a potential leadership contender.
He was particularly noted for his "filmstar good looks" and an American background. Moore's wife was American and he had lived for several years in the USA. He brought aspects of American corporate culture to government and was reported to speak with a slight American accent. His first political experience was as a Democratic Party organiser in Illinois during the early 1960s.
However, his fortunes in government waned after 1987 when he was made responsible for the highly sensitive portfolios of health and social security. His earlier success had been as a facilitator of the Thatcher government's privatisation programme. In this capacity he became known as "Mr Privatisation". When Moore attempted to extend this concept into the management of the National Health Service and the wider provision of social services, he encountered opposition from all sides. After losing credibility he was effectively demoted in 1988 (through loss of the health portfolio) and then sacked from his cabinet post in 1989.
The Times diary (13 January 1988) described him as follows;

His face it is blank, his blue tie is neat; A slight flush can be seen on his cheek; But though his jaw juts and his gestures are tough; His impression of strength comes out weak.

He left the House of Commons in 1992, and subsequently held a number of corporate directorships and chairmanships.

Early life[edit]
Moore was born in Kentish Town, London. His father was a factory worker who later became a publican. He attended the Licensed Victuallers' School in Slough, an independent school supported by his father's trade body.[1] After leaving school, Moore undertook two years of National Service from 1955 to 1957. He served with the Royal Sussex Regiment and spent some time in Korea.
He enrolled at the London School of Economics in 1958, and followed a three-year degree course. He was active in student politics, and held the position of President of the LSE Students' Union. During this time he met fellow student Sheila Tillotson. Moore accompanied Tillotson back to her native Chicago after the two had both completed their studies. Here the couple married, and Moore found work initially as a financial analyst with a Chicago investment bank. He became a stockbroker, and achieved a senior position at the Chicago office of the Dean Witter brokerage. Dean Witter catered to a mainly middle-class clientele, with the typical client holding only a modest portfolio of stock.
While in Chicago, Moore became a Democratic Party activist and served as a "precinct captain". In this capacity he gained experience of American political campaigning which he later applied in the UK. He was reportedly much impressed by President John F. Kennedy, and adopted him as a role model.
Moore returned to the UK in 1968, and took up an appointment in London as Chairman of Dean Witter (International). The Moores set up residence in the suburb of Wimbledon where their three children (one daughter and two sons) were born. Moore became active in local Conservative politics and was elected to serve as a Councillor in the London Borough of Merton in 1971. He initially gave the impression of being a liberal conservative. For example, he opposed the withdrawal of free school milk from the Borough's children which was happening as the result of the policy of Margaret Thatcher, then Secretary of State for Education.
In October 1973, he was adopted as the prospective Conservative parliamentary candidate for the Croydon Central constituency. At this time he was described as being "an investment banker and stockbroker, age 36".[2]
Early political career[edit]
Croydon Central was a new constituency, and was initially very marginally Conservative. Moore won the seat in the February 1974 general election by a majority of 1,300 votes over Labour. His majority was reduced to 150 in the October 1974 general election. However, he was able to strengthen his position in the constituency; the last time he contested the seat (in the 1987 general election) he achieved a majority of over 10,000.[3] His wife, Sheila, acted as his constituency secretary, speech writer and political adviser. She combined her duties in this regard with studying for a law degree and acting as a local magistrate. Observers commented that Sheila was very much the driving force behind his rise in politics.[4]
Moore projected the image of a young, vigorous politician. He would usually rise at 5.30 am and be at his desk by 7 am. He was a member of the House of Commons football team and the House skiing team. It is reported that his wife "... kept him on a strict regime of camomile tea, decaffeinated coffee and health food...."[5] He was frequently seen jogging in the early morning in the Westminster area, and was reported to spend 30 minutes each day on an exercise bicycle. Conservative MP Julian Critchley described him as being;

Handsome, with the sort of looks that would have appealed to J. Arthur Rank, personable and polite, he looks ten years younger than his 49 years.[6]

Margaret Thatcher appointed Moore as one of five Conservative Party vice-chairmen in March 1975, shortly after she became Conservative leader. Moore's remit was "youth". He held this position until the Conservatives were returned to office in 1979, at which time he was appointed as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Energy. In this capacity, one of his main duties was responsibility for the nationalised British coal industry.
After the 1983 general election, Moore was appointed Economic Secretary to the Treasury under Chancellor Nigel Lawson. At the Treasury, Moore was charged with fronting government policy on privatisation. Most notably, he oversaw the privatisation of British Telecom in 1984 and that of several other major concerns. The privatisation of state-owned industries was a major feature of the Thatcher governments. These privatisations were popularised by small parcels of shares in the privatised entities being made available to members of the public at deeply discounted prices. This promoted a form of popular capitalism along the lines of the Dean Witter business model. Moore gained an extremely high profile and became known as "Mr Privatisation".
Cabinet career[edit]
He joined Mrs Thatcher's Cabinet in 1986 as Secretary of State for Transport. His tenure of office at Transport was brief but coincided with the completion of major developments such as the M25 London orbital motorway and the privatisation of British Airways. The capsizing of the Herald of Free Enterprise car ferry outside Zeebrugge harbour on 6 March 1987 gave Moore considerable media exposure. These events served to raise Moore's profile even further and he played a prominent campaign role in the 1987 general election.

... what probably clinched his promotion to the DHSS yesterday was his TV performance in the party political broadcast that attacked the loony left. It was Thatcher herself who suggested that Moore be used on it. The broadcast was, according to one observer, considered "sharp, nasty – and effective".[7]

By now, Moore was being widely spoken of as a future Prime Minister. The commentator Brian Walden wrote "... he has future Tory leader written all over him".[8] After the 1987 election he was appointed as Secretary of State for Social Services. In this capacity he was responsible for the National Health Service's £66 billion annual spend, and the payment of over £50 billion annually in the form of social security benefits. These were highly sensitive portfolios that were intended to be very much at the centre of policy initiatives in the 1987 government.
However, there were some early misgivings about the appointment. Julian Critchley described Moore's earlier career in government as "The script had been written for him, and he had only to learn his lines".[9] Other commentators noted that his previous experience had been in implementing policy rather than in creating policy.
Once established in his new job, Moore delivered a series of speeches on policy in the social services. These speeches appeared to indicate a move to a healthcare system based on private insurance, similar to the American model. Specific proposals included making private healthcare insurance contributions tax-deductible, and allowing nurses' wage rates to be established by local bargaining rather than by central negotiation. Moore quickly encountered opposition from various interest groups, including the Royal College of Physicians. Many Conservative backbench MPs had misgivings about what was being proposed. Furthermore, some of the speeches suggested that Moore was positioning himself to be leader of the Conservative Party. During a visit to the U.S. in October 1987, he delivered a speech to the Mont Pelerin Society in which he appeared to suggest that he had been the prime mover behind privatisation in the UK. This displeased his fellow Ministers and other senior Party figures.[10]
Moore did not seem to engage comfortably in the public estimate procedures by which departmental spending budgets were set. The then Chief Secretary to the Treasury, John Major, was reported to have found Moore to be "a soft touch". The then Health Minister, Edwina Currie, is reported to have described Moore as being "useless". An entry in her diary dated January 1988 reads "It became apparent during the first ten days ... that Moore just didn't know what to do".[11] Moore found difficulties in his relationships with senior civil servants. Not all the latter were comfortable with a working day that started at 7 am. Moore's wife (and political adviser) Sheila had clashes with civil servants, and Moore was privately warned that she did not understand the British way of doing things. It is believed that Sheila may have drafted some of Moore's more controversial speeches.[12]
In November 1987, Moore was struck down with bacterial pneumonia. He initially tried to ignore the illness and attended a cabinet meeting before he had recovered. During the meeting he became unconscious. He was subsequently admitted to the Parkside Hospital in Wimbledon. The fact that this was a private clinic owned by a German healthcare company (reportedly charging patients up to £2,000 per day) attracted bad publicity. Union leader Rodney Bickerstaffe stated "How can a social services secretary claim to care about the National Health Service when he does not even trust his own health care to an NHS hospital?".[12]
End of political career[edit]
After two months' absence due to illness, Moore returned to work. But by now his political prospects were much diminished. On 25 July 1988, he lost the health portfolio to Kenneth Clarke. Moore retained his social security portfolio and stayed in cabinet as Secretary of State for Social Security for a further year. However, his credibility was further damaged by speeches in which he appeared to suggest that poverty had been abolished in modern Britain. His attempt to target state assistance towards poorer families while freezing child benefits provoked a major rebellion by Conservative backbench MPs.
Moore was sacked from the cabinet in July 1989. Most commentators at the time considered him to have been a weak politician who had been promoted beyond his ability.[13]

He was written off by one Tory as 'like a frightened rabbit mesmerised by oncoming headlights'.[14]

He gave up his parliamentary seat at the time of the 1992 general election and subsequently held a number of directorships with large concerns, including Credit Suisse Asset Management and Rolls Royce plc. He has recently[when?] retired as Chairman of the Monitor Group, Europe.[15]
After leaving the Commons in 1992, Moore became a life peer as Baron Moore of Lower Marsh, of Lower Marsh in the London Borough of Lambeth.[16] A BBC feature in August 2011 reported that after 20 years in the House of Lords, Moore had still to make his maiden speech;

He was particularly noted for his "filmstar good looks" and an American background. Moore's wife was American and he had lived for several years in the USA. He brought aspects of American corporate culture to government and was reported to speak with a slight American accent. His first political experience was as a Democratic Party organiser in Illinois during the early 1960s.
However, his fortunes in government waned after 1987 when he was made responsible for the highly sensitive portfolios of health and social security. His earlier success had been as a facilitator of the Thatcher government's privatisation programme. In this capacity he became known as "Mr Privatisation". When Moore attempted to extend this concept into the management of the National Health Service and the wider provision of social services, he encountered opposition from all sides. After losing credibility he was effectively demoted in 1988 (through loss of the health portfolio) and then sacked from his cabinet post in 1989.
The Times diary (13 January 1988) described him as follows;

His face it is blank, his blue tie is neat; A slight flush can be seen on his cheek; But though his jaw juts and his gestures are tough; His impression of strength comes out weak.

He left the House of Commons in 1992, and subsequently held a number of corporate directorships and chairmanships.

Early life[edit]
Moore was born in Kentish Town, London. His father was a factory worker who later became a publican. He attended the Licensed Victuallers' School in Slough, an independent school supported by his father's trade body.[1] After leaving school, Moore undertook two years of National Service from 1955 to 1957. He served with the Royal Sussex Regiment and spent some time in Korea.
He enrolled at the London School of Economics in 1958, and followed a three-year degree course. He was active in student politics, and held the position of President of the LSE Students' Union. During this time he met fellow student Sheila Tillotson. Moore accompanied Tillotson back to her native Chicago after the two had both completed their studies. Here the couple married, and Moore found work initially as a financial analyst with a Chicago investment bank. He became a stockbroker, and achieved a senior position at the Chicago office of the Dean Witter brokerage. Dean Witter catered to a mainly middle-class clientele, with the typical client holding only a modest portfolio of stock.
While in Chicago, Moore became a Democratic Party activist and served as a "precinct captain". In this capacity he gained experience of American political campaigning which he later applied in the UK. He was reportedly much impressed by President John F. Kennedy, and adopted him as a role model.
Moore returned to the UK in 1968, and took up an appointment in London as Chairman of Dean Witter (International). The Moores set up residence in the suburb of Wimbledon where their three children (one daughter and two sons) were born. Moore became active in local Conservative politics and was elected to serve as a Councillor in the London Borough of Merton in 1971. He initially gave the impression of being a liberal conservative. For example, he opposed the withdrawal of free school milk from the Borough's children which was happening as the result of the policy of Margaret Thatcher, then Secretary of State for Education.
In October 1973, he was adopted as the prospective Conservative parliamentary candidate for the Croydon Central constituency. At this time he was described as being "an investment banker and stockbroker, age 36".[2]
Early political career[edit]
Croydon Central was a new constituency, and was initially very marginally Conservative. Moore won the seat in the February 1974 general election by a majority of 1,300 votes over Labour. His majority was reduced to 150 in the October 1974 general election. However, he was able to strengthen his position in the constituency; the last time he contested the seat (in the 1987 general election) he achieved a majority of over 10,000.[3] His wife, Sheila, acted as his constituency secretary, speech writer and political adviser. She combined her duties in this regard with studying for a law degree and acting as a local magistrate. Observers commented that Sheila was very much the driving force behind his rise in politics.[4]
Moore projected the image of a young, vigorous politician. He would usually rise at 5.30 am and be at his desk by 7 am. He was a member of the House of Commons football team and the House skiing team. It is reported that his wife "... kept him on a strict regime of camomile tea, decaffeinated coffee and health food...."[5] He was frequently seen jogging in the early morning in the Westminster area, and was reported to spend 30 minutes each day on an exercise bicycle. Conservative MP Julian Critchley described him as being;

Handsome, with the sort of looks that would have appealed to J. Arthur Rank, personable and polite, he looks ten years younger than his 49 years.[6]

Margaret Thatcher appointed Moore as one of five Conservative Party vice-chairmen in March 1975, shortly after she became Conservative leader. Moore's remit was "youth". He held this position until the Conservatives were returned to office in 1979, at which time he was appointed as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Energy. In this capacity, one of his main duties was responsibility for the nationalised British coal industry.
After the 1983 general election, Moore was appointed Economic Secretary to the Treasury under Chancellor Nigel Lawson. At the Treasury, Moore was charged with fronting government policy on privatisation. Most notably, he oversaw the privatisation of British Telecom in 1984 and that of several other major concerns. The privatisation of state-owned industries was a major feature of the Thatcher governments. These privatisations were popularised by small parcels of shares in the privatised entities being made available to members of the public at deeply discounted prices. This promoted a form of popular capitalism along the lines of the Dean Witter business model. Moore gained an extremely high profile and became known as "Mr Privatisation".
Cabinet career[edit]
He joined Mrs Thatcher's Cabinet in 1986 as Secretary of State for Transport. His tenure of office at Transport was brief but coincided with the completion of major developments such as the M25 London orbital motorway and the privatisation of British Airways. The capsizing of the Herald of Free Enterprise car ferry outside Zeebrugge harbour on 6 March 1987 gave Moore considerable media exposure. These events served to raise Moore's profile even further and he played a prominent campaign role in the 1987 general election.

... what probably clinched his promotion to the DHSS yesterday was his TV performance in the party political broadcast that attacked the loony left. It was Thatcher herself who suggested that Moore be used on it. The broadcast was, according to one observer, considered "sharp, nasty – and effective".[7]

By now, Moore was being widely spoken of as a future Prime Minister. The commentator Brian Walden wrote "... he has future Tory leader written all over him".[8] After the 1987 election he was appointed as Secretary of State for Social Services. In this capacity he was responsible for the National Health Service's £66 billion annual spend, and the payment of over £50 billion annually in the form of social security benefits. These were highly sensitive portfolios that were intended to be very much at the centre of policy initiatives in the 1987 government.
However, there were some early misgivings about the appointment. Julian Critchley described Moore's earlier career in government as "The script had been written for him, and he had only to learn his lines".[9] Other commentators noted that his previous experience had been in implementing policy rather than in creating policy.
Once established in his new job, Moore delivered a series of speeches on policy in the social services. These speeches appeared to indicate a move to a healthcare system based on private insurance, similar to the American model. Specific proposals included making private healthcare insurance contributions tax-deductible, and allowing nurses' wage rates to be established by local bargaining rather than by central negotiation. Moore quickly encountered opposition from various interest groups, including the Royal College of Physicians. Many Conservative backbench MPs had misgivings about what was being proposed. Furthermore, some of the speeches suggested that Moore was positioning himself to be leader of the Conservative Party. During a visit to the U.S. in October 1987, he delivered a speech to the Mont Pelerin Society in which he appeared to suggest that he had been the prime mover behind privatisation in the UK. This displeased his fellow Ministers and other senior Party figures.[10]
Moore did not seem to engage comfortably in the public estimate procedures by which departmental spending budgets were set. The then Chief Secretary to the Treasury, John Major, was reported to have found Moore to be "a soft touch". The then Health Minister, Edwina Currie, is reported to have described Moore as being "useless". An entry in her diary dated January 1988 reads "It became apparent during the first ten days ... that Moore just didn't know what to do".[11] Moore found difficulties in his relationships with senior civil servants. Not all the latter were comfortable with a working day that started at 7 am. Moore's wife (and political adviser) Sheila had clashes with civil servants, and Moore was privately warned that she did not understand the British way of doing things. It is believed that Sheila may have drafted some of Moore's more controversial speeches.[12]
In November 1987, Moore was struck down with bacterial pneumonia. He initially tried to ignore the illness and attended a cabinet meeting before he had recovered. During the meeting he became unconscious. He was subsequently admitted to the Parkside Hospital in Wimbledon. The fact that this was a private clinic owned by a German healthcare company (reportedly charging patients up to £2,000 per day) attracted bad publicity. Union leader Rodney Bickerstaffe stated "How can a social services secretary claim to care about the National Health Service when he does not even trust his own health care to an NHS hospital?".[12]
End of political career[edit]
After two months' absence due to illness, Moore returned to work. But by now his political prospects were much diminished. On 25 July 1988, he lost the health portfolio to Kenneth Clarke. Moore retained his social security portfolio and stayed in cabinet as Secretary of State for Social Security for a further year. However, his credibility was further damaged by speeches in which he appeared to suggest that poverty had been abolished in modern Britain. His attempt to target state assistance towards poorer families while freezing child benefits provoked a major rebellion by Conservative backbench MPs.
Moore was sacked from the cabinet in July 1989. Most commentators at the time considered him to have been a weak politician who had been promoted beyond his ability.[13]

He was written off by one Tory as 'like a frightened rabbit mesmerised by oncoming headlights'.[14]

He gave up his parliamentary seat at the time of the 1992 general election and subsequently held a number of directorships with large concerns, including Credit Suisse Asset Management and Rolls Royce plc. He has recently[when?] retired as Chairman of the Monitor Group, Europe.[15]
After leaving the Commons in 1992, Moore became a life peer as Baron Moore of Lower Marsh, of Lower Marsh in the London Borough of Lambeth.[16] A BBC feature in August 2011 reported that after 20 years in the House of Lords, Moore had still to make his maiden speech;

While he worked behind the scenes as a political operator he was very effective ... but he was suddenly thrust into the spotlight in the mammoth task of defending the government on the issues of health and social security ... and he just bombed[17]

World Tree Pedigree some time ago had Isaac Fowler and it showed him married to Mary Moore but no further information. Email to write to was jame@ratsnest.org.  I tried to write for more information if available, but address no good.  Is the person who submitted this information still contributing to Ancestry.com?  Had very large data base shown. Am seeking parents of Isaac Fowler in North, then South Carolina.Jean in OK

Caroline - Isaac and Mary went from Laurens Co SC to  Knox Co KY in early 1800's and then went to Schuyler Co IL after 1830. Mary died in 1850 and Isaac went to Jefferson Co KS to live with his son Isaac H.  He died there in 1861.Their children as far as we can determine were1. Sallie (Sarah?) Fowler m. John McMurtry2. Jane Fowler m. William Campbell 25 Aug 1825 in Knox Co KY.3. Deborah Fowler m. Thomas Fowler4. Elizabeth Fowler m. James Pemberton 22 Mar 1827 Knox Co KY5. Rosannah Fowler m. Jesse Langdon6. Mary "Polly" Fowler m. John Weaver 30 Jan 1823 in Knox Co KY. She died in Schuyler Co IL7. Thomas R. Fowler (or may be Thomas "I" and I hope that is true for he was my ggg'father. His middle initial has always been mixed up and we are searching something now that will definitely tie him to Isaac.  Isaac was living with him in IL in 1850 after Mary died and Mary was the daughter of Jesse so it stands to reason that Thomas I. is Isaac's son but we can't prove it yet) As I said, his wife Mary Fowler Fowler was the daughter of Jesse and Deborah.  They went back to KY after Jesse (and maybe Deborah too) died shortly after 1860 and he died there Jan. 9 1865, murdered, they say.  I think I may have the last letter he wrote, which was to his son Jesse in Schuyler Co IL on Jan 1 1865.8. Isaac H. Fowler b. 4 Oct 1806 in KY. Married Margaret Campbell 10 May 1827 Knox Co KY. She was daughter of Jane and William Campbell. They stayed in KY until after 1850 when they left and went to IL and on to Jefferson Co KS where they died and were buried in the Fowler Cemetery.9. William Fowler b. about 1809 in KY. He was handicapped and lived with Isaac H. in KS. Old Isaac made provisions for his lifetime care before he died.10. Alice Fowler m. Jubal DeWees.         We had thought Isaac and Jesse were brothers but now know that Jesse was the son of John Fowler in Laurens Co SC and we are trying to find out the parents and siblings of Isaac, to no avail so far.          Will be glad to hear of anything you have to help me fill in the blanks.  You may write me back direct at stockham @telepath.com    Jean in OK

I have a Mary Moore who married Isaac Fowler, who was my 6th gr aunt. Her parents were Thomas Moore and Rosannah Fowler. My connection is via Mary's brother Ephraim Moore who married Elizabeth Lindsey. Would love to talk to you. I know that your posting is an old one, but just happen to find it- Mary Moore and my Ephraim did have a sister named Deborah who married Jesse Fowler and they did have a son named Isaac. Could  this be your Isaac. Don't have a wife for him. Strange it would be another Mary Moore as wife, but possible???Judiththejcoriginal@aol.com

So glad to hear from you.  I know very little about your Ephraim Moore except I have him married to Sarah (Sally) Fox about 1798 in Laurens Co. S. C.  I have two children for them.I do not have dates of death for either of them.The Isaac Fowler I am looking for married Mary Moore, born about 1775, married about 1794.  I have wondering if Mary's sister, Deborah Moore born 1767, who married Jesse Fowler, son of John Fowler of Laurens Co. S. C. was married to a brother of Mary's husband, Isaac?  I have not have much luck with the Fowler's.My line is thru Mary's brother, Jesse, born 10 August, 1781.  Would love to exchange information.Thanks,Caroline

Hi, I'm Becky Root. I was so glad to see your info. on the ch of Old Isaac. I am from Old Isaac's bro. Wm., both thought to be sons of Joseph. I have been gathering evidence on possible sons of Joseph for 20 years. I will be glad to send to you info. if you want, & can send me your current e-mail. I have some questions:Old Isaac b 1770 m Mary Moore. When you say Isaac was living w/ Thomas in IL in 1850 after Mary died. You mean Mary Moore died 1850?, not Thomas' wife, right? Then is this Thomas’s wife Mary you say was the dau. of Jesse & Deborah Fowler? Are you saying Thomas was in IL in 1850, then went back to Knox Co., KY in 1850? So did Jesse Fowler die in 1850 IL? Who were the ch of Thomas w/ dates & places please? Do you have any dates or places for the births of Old Isaac's ch? Do you have the names, dates & places for the ch. of Jesse?) Was Thomas in IL in 1828 to have a son John? Please write to me at byroot@yahoo.com

A probable bro. of Isaac Fowler b 1770 who m Mary Moore, is John Fowler b 1781 who m Eliz. Moore. I don't know if you are interested in these Moores or not, but they are from the Laurens Dist., SC.

Band of brothers: Soccer is a family affair for Hammond team

Hammond soccer is a family affair.
Don’t believe it? How many other high school programs in South Carolina can say they feature four sets of brothers? If that’s not  enough, take into consideration 11 current players have a mother or father who attended Hammond.
That’s a pretty fair number of players who  probably have heard the stories of what it means to be a Hammond student from their parents.
“The number of kids that have parents that are Hammond alumni is very cool,” Hammond coach Adrian Pinasco said. “The kids want to represent their school and parents. They work very hard representing themselves and the history of this school.”
Senior Ross Moore and freshman John Bailey Moore grew up hearing stories about the heyday of Hammond soccer. Their father, Martin Moore, played on four state championship teams at Hammond before  he graduated in 1988.




The brothers are glad to be carrying on the family legacy.
“It means a lot to carry on the tradition,” John Bailey Moore said as the Skyhawks prepared for Wednesday’s SCISA Class 3A semifinal contest against Porter-Gaud. “It’s amazing how many details he can remember. It makes me want to make the most of my time here.”
The fact that Hammond hasn’t won a state championship in boys soccer since 1990 doesn’t sit well with the current roster. Most people think of football when discussing Hammond athletics. The players understand for that to change, they have to win state championships instead of making deep runs in the playoffs.
Junior Isaac Mikell, whose dad Jenkins Mikell graduated in 1985 and played soccer for Hammond, believes the Skyhawks are on the brink of breaking through.
“Why can’t soccer win a state championship?” he asked. “My dad was on state championship teams, and he talks all the time about how special that was to experience. All of our teams at Hammond have the opportunity to be the best.”



There is a friendly rivalry  as well. The current players have heard the war stories. But they want to be able to equal, or top, what their parents accomplished.
Sophomore Sumpter Clarke hears the stories from his dad, Edward Clarke, a 1988 graduate. He said the biggest thing for him is to one-up his dad.
“From a personal standpoint, I want to top what he did,” Sumpter Clarke said. “We have a fun time going back and forth. He’s always telling me they were better than us, but you can tell he’s proud of whatever we do on the soccer field.”
Pinasco played professional soccer in Argentina. He has coached on the collegiate level and when he  came to Hammond 12 years ago, he  had  a win-at-all-costs mentality.
That has changed over the years.



“It’s about the culture and what it means to be a part of the Hammond family,” Pinasco said. “These kids are true Hammond products because their parents went here and they’ve been in the school since they started.”
