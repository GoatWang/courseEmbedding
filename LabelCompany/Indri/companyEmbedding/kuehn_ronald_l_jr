 Ronald L. Kuehn Jr. 1935— Biography



      Ronald L. Kuehn Jr.
      
      1935–
    











        Chairman, El Paso Corporation
      


      Nationality: American.
    

      Born: April 6, 1935, in New York City, New York.
    

      Education: Fordham University, BS, 1957; LLB, 1964.
    

      Family: Married Allison Spencer, 1986; children: seven.
    

      Career: Hughes, Hubbard & Reed, 1964–1968, associate

      president and general counsel; Southern Natural Resources,

      chairman of the board; 2003, interim CEO.
    

      Address: El Paso Corporation, 1001 Louisiana Street, Houston, Texas
      77002-5089; http://www.elpaso.com.
    

      ■ The well-credentialed Ronald L. Kuehn Jr. was a veteran of the
      natural gas energy business, having led the transformation of Southern
      Natural Resources to its new identity as Sonat and on through the merger
      of Sonat with El Paso Corporation. To his misfortune, he hit a snag at El
      Paso, a company embroiled in scandal with its shareholders and the
      Securities Exchange Commission. He willingly stepped in the line of fire
      to serve as interim chief executive officer of El Paso while the company
      repositioned itself to meet its debt and resolve its controversies.
    

      EARLY EXPOSURE TO CONFLICT AND NEGOTIATION
    

      The son of a New York police officer, Kuehn was born in Brooklyn in 1935
      and raised in Queens. Attending Fordham University on a basketball
      scholarship (where he played point guard), he began to develop negotiating
      skills as floor general for his teammates. By nature, Kuehn was
      soft-spoken—a skill not necessarily in demand on the basketball
      floor. He compensated by developing a persuasive manner to negotiate plays
      and positions for the team. Those skills were to become important in later
      life.
    

      After receiving his bachelor's degree from Fordham in 1957, he left
      the area to briefly serve as a first lieutenant with the U.S. Army from
      1958 to 1959. Upon discharge, he returned to Fordham and earned a law
      degree in 1964. For the next four years, he worked as an associate
      attorney with Hughes, Hubbard & Reed in New York City and then
      served as vice president and general counsel for Allied Artists Pictures,
      also in New York.
    

      A MOVE INTO THE ENERGY INDUSTRY
    

      In 1970 Kuehn landed a job in the legal department of Southern Natural
      Resources of Birmingham, Alabama, a natural gas energy provider. Organized
      and disciplined, he became a rising star, particularly remembered for his
      low-key personality and nonthreatening manner in various legal
      negotiations. In 1981 Southern Natural was renamed Sonat, and within
      months Kuehn was named vice president and general counsel. The next year
      he was elected president, a position he held until the 1999 merger of
      Sonat with El Paso. Along the way, Kuehn also held concurrent positions as
      chief operating officer, chief executive officer (starting in 1983), and
      chairman (from 1986).
    

      At Sonat, Kuehn handled the many ups and downs peculiar to the energy
      business with characteristic reserve. He weathered low natural gas prices
      by stepping up exploration and production (E&P), which added to the
      company's reserves and served the company well when gas prices
      again rose. The company struck out on a few E&P investments but
      also purchased Zilkha Energy in 1998 in an effort to boost its assets.
      Selim Zilkha would become both friend and foe to Kuehn in later years.
    

      In 1999 the El Paso Corporation, another energy provider, announced plans
      to acquire Sonat in a highly negotiated stock-swapping measure intended to
      benefit both entities. The combined assets would mean control of 25
      percent of all natural gas pipelines in the United States, making El Paso
      the largest natural gas pipeline company in the country. Although Kuehn
      officially retired at the time of the merger, the deal also established
      that he would serve as the nonexecutive chairman of El Paso until December
      2000. In 2001 Kuehn, then semiretired, stayed on as lead director for El
      Paso.
    

      TROUBLE BREWS
    

      With the purchase of Sonat, El Paso had entered the E&P area of the
      industry, and its E&P holdings were significantly enhanced when it
      acquired yet another company, Coastal Corporation, in 2001. When Enron
      crumbled in December 2001 (a company that El Paso had tried to emulate),
      the tides turned. In 2002 the California Public Utility Commission charged
      El Paso with intentionally holding back capacity on four pipelines from
      November 2000 to March 2001, contributing to an energy crisis and
      artificial rise in electricity prices that cost California residents an
      extra $3.3 billion. Soon the U.S. Attorney's office in Houston
      served subpoenas on El Paso and several other energy traders in an
      investigation of what is known as round-trip trades, swaps between two
      energy companies (e.g., electricity and natural gas) for the purpose of
      artificially manipulating price or inflating/deflating volume.
    

      By mid-2003 El Paso's stock had fallen from around $70 a share (in
      early 2001) to a shocking $9.64 per share. Significant shareholder Zilkha
      (whose company Kuehn had bought just months before the Sonat–El
      Paso merger) accused Kuehn and others of mismanagement and started a
      shareholder uprising in June 2003 to overthrow El Paso's entire
      board of directors. At that time El Paso's chief executive officer
      resigned amid controversy, and the company announced that Kuehn would act
      as its interim chief "to provide strong leadership and
      stability."
    

      With characteristic coolness and calm, Kuehn was able to diffuse the proxy
      contest with Zilkha by incorporating several of the recommendations voiced
      by the dissidents. The power struggle failed, but Kuehn began selling
      assets, cutting expenses, and paying off debt to maintain shareholder
      confidence. A permanent CEO, Douglas Foshee, took over in September 2003,
      but Kuehn remained as lead director on the board.
    

      In February 2004, based on the findings of an independent review, El Paso
      announced that it had overestimated by 41 percent its gas reserves and
      would have to revise corporate financial statements from 1999 to 2003.
      Company stock fell to $7 a share. Although neither Kuehn nor other
      then-current senior executives were implicated in any wrongdoing, others
      were. Nonetheless, in April 2004 a class action lawsuit against El Paso
      was filed in a Texas federal court, naming Kuehn and several others as
      defendants. On behalf of shareholders, the suit charged (among other
      things) that Kuehn and others knowingly or recklessly had participated in
      grossly overstating in the company's oil-and-gas reserves, costing
      shareholders millions of dollars in lost revenues from falling stock
      prices.
