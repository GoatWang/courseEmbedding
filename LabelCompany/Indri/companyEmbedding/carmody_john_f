Carmody Torrance Sandak & Hennessey LLP is a Connecticut-based law firm serving a wide range of businesses, utilities, governmental entities and individuals. With more than 75 attorneys and offices in New Haven, Stamford, Waterbury, Litchfield, and Southbury, we practice in nearly 30 specific areas of law, with each lawyer skilled in multiple related areas of practice.
We believe that great lawyering is the result of partnering with clients so that expectations are clear, client needs are anticipated and the legal process is efficient. We aim to become an extension of your team and a valuable asset of your business. This approach has resulted in longstanding relationships with major clients, and has created “institutional knowledge” that is a reality rather than a catch phrase.

Our Roots
For more than 100 years, Carmody & Torrance was a firm with a rich history of hard work, dedication and commitment to excellence in the service of its clients. The strength and reputation of our firm was built upon striving to meet two objectives: to provide legal services of the highest quality and to maintain a keen sensitivity to the needs of clients.  It is as true today as it was at our founding over 100 years ago that the pursuit of these goals leads to creative and practical legal solutions for our clients. These guiding principles have effectively shaped Carmody for over a century and have paved the way for continued growth and success in the next century.
Our Growth
To help clients meet the demands of an ever-changing business landscape, in late 2013, Fairfield County-based Sandak Hennessey & Greco joined Carmody & Torrance to create Carmody Torrance Sandak & Hennessey LLP. The combination of the firms was an important strategic expansion that allowed the combined firm to offer clients deeper legal know-how and a broader geographic reach. Carmody Torrance Sandak & Hennessey combines both firms’ traditional strengths in litigation and commercial real estate, and offers clients deeper capabilities in areas such as intellectual property, labor and employment, environmental, trust and estates, land use and zoning, business and transactional representation, energy and utility, healthcare, municipal law, white collar defense, alternative dispute resolution and personal injury.
