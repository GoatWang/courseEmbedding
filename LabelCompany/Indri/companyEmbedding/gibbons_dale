Gibbons P.C. was the highest ranking law firm among this year's "Best Places to Work in New Jersey," reaching #14 on this annual list published by NJBIZ.


In July 2017, Gibbons was chosen as one of the Best Small and Medium Workplaces in New York. The firm ranked 14th and was the only law firm chosen for this year's list. Published together with Fortune, The Best Workplaces in New York ranking is based entirely upon feedback from employees at Great Place to Work–Certified™ companies either headquartered or with major locations in New York who completed their Trust Index Employee Survey.


Gibbons was one of only 32 law firms nationwide to earn the WILEF Gold Standard Certification, which is aimed at identifying law firms that include women in top leadership positions.


Gibbons was named to the National Law Journal's inaugural "Midsize Hot List" for innovatively positioning the firm in a crowded market. 


Gibbons was named to the Philadelphia Business Journal’s Best Place to Work list, earning a 2nd place ranking in the “Headquartered Outside Philadelphia” category.


Gibbons P.C. has once again earned a place on the annual Working Mother and Flex-Time Lawyers list of the "50 Best Law Firms for Women." Gibbons is one of only six firms to be named to this list every year it has been published since 2007.

The Gibbons Family has been traveling and singing southern gospel music for about ten years.  We are proud to carry on this heritage deeply rooted in our family.  The Gibbons Family consists of Dale Gibbons, Gayle Gibbons, and Dennis Jolly doing the vocals, and Ellen Jolly managing the product table for The Gibbons Family. Dale Gibbons began his musical interests playing the piano and singing with his mother as a teenager.  In the late 70�s he began playing the piano for Coleman Looper and the Way Travelers from Rickman, Tennessee.  During those travels the group worked with Norm Livingston, a promoter from Dayton, Ohio.  One Saturday afternoon during a concert in Livingston, Tennessee he met Norm�s daughter Gayle.  By August of the next year, Dale and Gayle were married and in December of 1980 they moved to Dayton, Ohio.  Dale and Gayle worked with Pastor Norm at Greenview Calvary Tabernacle until 2001 when The Gibbons Family was formed.  Since 2001 they have been preaching, and singing southern gospel music in different venues and churches across the eastern United States.  Dale sings lead for the group and is known for his �let�s have church� style of singing. Gayle Gibbons has been involved in gospel music all of her life.  Gayle�s dad and mom, Norm and Velma Livingston have pastored a church and been involved in promoting gospel singings for over 50 years.  �I was six months old when my dad starting pastoring, I have been raised in church all my life�.  Gayle�s mom and dad, Norm and Velma�s Gospel Sing, hosted groups such as: The Happy Goodman Family, The Inspirations, The Primitive Quartet, The Wilburn�s, The Payne's, The McKamey�s, The McGruder�s, The Singing Cookes, The Crabb Family, The Spencer�s, Charles Johnson and The Revivers, and so many others too numerous to mention.  �We love the Lord�, and when we sing �So Much To Thank Him For� it is absolutely true, we are blessed.   �We have two daughters, their husbands and two of the most precious grandsons you have ever seen�.  Gayle sings the alto part for the group.  Dennis Jolly sings the baritone/tenor part for The Gibbons Family.  Dennis has sung with many groups prior to joining The Gibbons Family such as the original Glory Boys, The Gloryland Quartet, The Hampton Quartet (now The Nobleman Quartet), and The Deihls.  Dennis is also a preacher�s kid, his dad and mom pastored a church for over 60 years.  Dennis spent thirteen years as a DJ and gospel music director on WRAC.  Matter of fact, was nominated in the top five for DJ of the year for twelve years in a row and he won the DJ of the year award from the Singing News Fan Awards in 1994 and 1999.The Gibbons Family has recorded multiple CD�s, videos over the past ten years. Over the past several years they have released multiple songs to national radio like; �I Made It By Grace,� �God Told Me To Walk A Little Farther,� �Redeemed,� �What A Journey,� and  �Between Me And The Storm� written by Kyla Rowland.If you every have the opportunity to be in a church service, revival, or concert with The Gibbons Family �get ready you are about to have church�.  You will see a group that is full of energy and enthusiasm.
