W.K. Kellogg Child Welfare Foundation


The W.K. Kellogg Foundation was founded in June 1930 as the W.K. Kellogg Child Welfare Foundation by breakfast cereal pioneer Will Keith Kellogg. In 1934, Kellogg donated more than $66 million in Kellogg Company stock and other investments to the W.K. Kellogg Trust, worth more than $1.2 billion in 2017 USD[1]. As with other endowments, the yearly income from this trust funds the foundation.
In the early 21st century, the foundation is the seventh largest philanthropic foundation in the U.S. In 2005, the foundation reported that the total assets of the foundation and its trust were US$7.3 billion; about US$5.5 billion of this was in Kellogg Company stock. The foundation funded US$243 million in grants and programs in its 2005 fiscal year. 82% of this was spent in the United States; 9% in southern Africa; and 9% in Latin America and the Caribbean.
In 1996, it supplied a multi-year grant worth $750,000 ($1.39 million in 2015 dollars[2]) to start mass salt fluoridation programs which were then carried out by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), covering 350 million people in Bolivia, Dominican Republic, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, and Venezuela. The project was part of a multi-year plan launched by PAHO in 1994 to “fluoridate the entire Region of the Americas”. More recently, they have provided funding for HealthCorps to prevent childhood obesity by encouraging students to take personal responsibility for their health and wellness.[3]

Grants[edit]
The foundation provides a number of grants to organizations across the United States and other countries on a number of topics.
In 2016, the Kellogg Foundation was funding more than 40 projects in Indian country, with a total value of more than $30 million in open grants. According to the non-profit’s website, the foundation has funded 380 Native American projects since 2008. Many grants are for health, education and language programs for children and youths.[4] In 2009 it granted the third-highest amount of money to Native American projects, after the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Ford Foundation.[4]
Early childhood[edit]
One grantee is the Birth to Five Policy Alliance, whose mission is to increase public and private support so young children, particularly those facing the most challenges, get the high-quality services they need to be successful.[5]
Education[edit]
The foundation has made grants to prominent educational institutions, including:

Cal Poly Pomona in Pomona, California[6]
Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan[7][8]
Kellogg College, Oxford, a constituent college of the University of Oxford, United Kingdom

Programs[edit]
The foundation supports multiple programs for optimal child development.[9]
It supports oral hygiene. In 2010, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation started a dental therapy program in five states to educate children and their families about the importance of healthy teeth. Mobile dental vans travel to rural areas to give families access to dental care. Additionally, the foundation gives grants to help minorities attend school for dentistry. [10]
Perception[edit]
The philanthropy expert Waldemar A. Nielsen said that the Kellogg Foundation "is substantially better than it is generally seen to be".[11]

Real Change for Children
Creating Equitable Communities


	                    The field of philanthropy is evolving and external realities challenge all of us to work differently. Our 2016 annual report explores how when we join together and see one another more fully, we can heal divides, create more equitable communities and ultimately achieve real change for children. The foundation has also more deeply prioritized the areas in which we fund – shared in the “Our Priorities” section of this report.

Overview
Should We Partner?
How to Apply Online


Previous
Next










We’re pleased that you’re considering the W.K. Kellogg Foundation as a potential partner in your work. Achieving our mission – creating the conditions that propel vulnerable children to success – is complex work. Success will require not only resources, but the commitment, insight, creativity and hard work of multiple stakeholders, including grantseekers who share elements of our strategic focus. The information on this and related pages is designed to help you make an initial determination about whether you represent such an organization. If so, you’ll also find the materials you need to initiate a process that may result in a partnership that we hope will prove to be productive, effective and satisfying.












On these pages, we’ve assembled a variety of resources that should be useful in helping you decide whether your organization and WKKF could potentially make for good, effective, aligned partners.
For a broad overview of the organization, the pages describing Who We Are contain links to information on our mission, vision and values. There you’ll also find links to information on our founder, history, our people and current financials.


For a better understanding of our strategic focus – which should help you determine the alignment between your organization’s goals and ours – you may want to review our pages on What We Do and its links to our focus area pages:
Educated Kids
Community & Civic Engagement
Healthy Kids
Racial Equity
Secure Families





In addition, you’ll find information there on Where We Work and links to information on our priority places of:
Michigan
New Orleans
Mississippi
Haiti
New Mexico
Mexico


Racial Equity in Governance and Management
The W.K. Kellogg Foundation considers the governance and management of its grantee organizations to be determining factors for effectiveness and impact. We encourage grantee organizations to have, or be working toward, a composition of board and senior staff that is diverse and reflective of the racial and ethnic demographics of the children, families and communities they serve.



 







If you believe that your idea, project or proposal aligns with our strategic focus and fits within our guidelines, our online grant application is the way to apply. 
The Kellogg Foundation does not have any submission deadlines and reviews grant proposals throughout the year. We are not currently accepting new proposals for work in southern Africa and northeastern Brazil. 
Finally, as you might expect, we receive more requests each year than we are able to fund. As a result, we regret that we are not able to fund ideas that do not fit within our current programming framework and guidelines. 
Eligibility & Guidelines
The Kellogg Foundation makes grants to a variety of organizations that engage in charitable activities. The foundation does not make grants directly to individuals. Search our Grants Database for examples of current and past projects that have been funded. 





If you have additional questions not answered in these pages, you may contact our Concierge Desk via email, toll free (888) 606-5905 (US only) or +1 (269) 969-2329 (international cost may apply).
Thank you for your interest in partnering with the W.K. Kellogg Foundation.

The W.K. Kellogg Foundation (WKKF), founded in 1930 as an independent, private foundation by breakfast cereal pioneer, Will Keith Kellogg, is among the largest philanthropic foundations in the United States. Guided by the belief that all children should have an equal opportunity to thrive, WKKF works with communities to create conditions for vulnerable children so they can realize their full potential in school, work and life.
WKKF is an Equal Opportunity Employer and shall continue to adhere to the principles of Equal Employment Opportunity to ensure that all applicants and employees are considered for hire, promotion, position status and other employment actions without regard to race, religion, color, national origin, age, gender, handicap, genetic information or veteran status.

Commitment to Racial Equity, Diversity and Inclusion
The W.K. Kellogg Foundation has a long-standing and ongoing commitment to diversity, inclusion and equity – both internally through our work environment and externally through our programming. Under our strategic framework, we have identified the active pursuit of racial equity, by embracing healing efforts and eradicating structural racism, as an explicit approach of our programming. We value differences among individuals across multiple dimensions including, but not limited to, race, ethnicity, age, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, physical ability, religion and socioeconomic status. We believe that bringing together staff and other partners with differing backgrounds and life experiences will enhance our ability to increase opportunities for all families and children to succeed. Building an inclusionary organizational culture means that not only do we count people, but that people count. And building a culture of equitable relationships means not only do people count, people feel like they belong. This is the aspiration of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation.

Who We Are


                    The W.K. Kellogg Foundation (WKKF), founded in 1930 as an independent, private foundation by breakfast cereal pioneer Will Keith Kellogg, is among the largest philanthropic foundations in the United States. Guided by the belief that all children should have an equal opportunity to thrive, WKKF works with communities to create conditions for vulnerable children so they can realize their full potential in school, work and life.

Overview
The W.K. Kellogg Foundation was established in 1930 by breakfast cereal pioneer W.K. Kellogg, who defined its purpose as “…administering funds for the promotion of the welfare, comfort, health, education, feeding, clothing, sheltering and safeguarding of children and youth, directly or indirectly, without regard to sex, race, creed or nationality.…”  To guide current and future trustees and staff, he said, “Use the money as you please so long as it promotes the health, happiness and well-being of children.”
The foundation receives its income primarily from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation Trust, which was set up by Mr. Kellogg.  In addition to its diversified portfolio, the trust continues to own substantial equity in the Kellogg Company. While the company and the foundation have enjoyed a long-standing relationship, the foundation is governed by its own independent board of trustees. The foundation receives its income primarily from the trust’s investments.
Over the years, the Kellogg Foundation’s programming has continued to evolve, striving to remain innovative and responsive to the ever-changing needs of society. Today, the organization ranks among the world’s largest private foundations, awarding grants in the United States, Mexico and Haiti. 











Mission
The W.K. Kellogg Foundation supports children, families and communities as they strengthen and create conditions that propel vulnerable children to achieve success as individuals and as contributors to the larger community and society.

Vision
We envision a nation that marshals its resources to assure that all children have an equitable and promising future – a nation in which all children thrive.











Values

The work of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation is imbued with these values:

We believe in helping people help themselves through the practical application of knowledge and resources to improve their quality of life and that of future generations. 
We believe all people have the inherent capacity to effect change in their lives, in their organizations, and in their communities. We respect individuals and value their collective interests, strengths and cultures. 
We believe stewardship requires fidelity to the spirit and to the intent of the founder, and the wise use of resources. We believe in being responsible, prudent, selfless and exercising good judgment. 
We believe innovation of thought and action leads to enduring and positive change in both formal and informal systems. 
We value integrity of purpose and action, and believe it is essential to all of our affairs.












History & Legacy
The W.K. Kellogg Foundation’s mission, work and values are rooted in the experience and perspective of our founder, Will Keith Kellogg. To understand the former, it is helpful to know something of the latter.



The First Eleven Years
The First Twenty-Five Years
The First Half-Century

Early Life
W.K. Kellogg was born April 7, 1860, to Michigan pioneer parents, Seventh Day Adventists who valued modesty, healthy living and hard work. Those attributes also describe much of Mr. Kellogg's life and interests.
Mr. Kellogg went to work in the family broom business at age 14, quitting school after teachers mistook his then-undiagnosed vision problems (which ultimately left him nearly blind) for lack of intellect. At age 20, he joined his brother, Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, at the Battle Creek Sanitarium (the “San”), then a leading health spa. Often working as many as 120 hours a week, he filled positions from errand boy to business manager.
In one such role, working one night in the San's kitchen to find a digestible substitute for bread, Mr. Kellogg accidentally let stand a batch of boiled wheat. By morning, the wheat had turned to flakes, which became the basis for Corn Flakes and, in 1906, the Kellogg Company.
While Mr. Kellogg became one of the world's wealthiest men, he was never quite comfortable in that role (on being told he'd become a millionaire, he responded, "I am no such thing!") and felt obligated to use his fortune to benefit others. As early as 1909, he wrote, "If I am successful in getting out of debt, and become prosperous, I expect to make good use of any wealth that may come to me.”
With the foundation he established in 1930 – originally named the W.K. Kellogg Child Welfare Foundation – he proved true to his word, instructing the staff to, “Use the money as you please so long as it promotes the health, happiness and well-being of children.”

Financials
WKKF and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation Trust are committed to managing financial resources efficiently and effectively.
Annually, independent auditors are engaged to audit our financial statements and review the effectiveness of our internal controls. Results of our audits are typically released in December.
The foundation and trust also each complete Form 990-PFs, an informational return for U.S. private foundations filed with the IRS reporting assets, investments, expenses and grant activity. The 990-PF is due in January, but an extension maybe requested to provide time to gather investment portfolio documentation.

Stewardship
The Kellogg Foundation shares our founder’s commitment to stewardship. 
We are stewards of both W.K. Kellogg’s legacy and of the public’s trust. (Happily, the two are highly compatible.) To retain that trust, we are obligated to manage our assets efficiently and effectively. And we seek to be as transparent as possible about what we support and how we account for our expenditures.
The foundation’s vision, mission and values guide our strategic planning and our everyday decision-making. There are also clear directives to help our trustees, officers and staff members uphold the legal and ethical standards essential to our work. Please consult the topics and policies listed to learn more about how the Kellogg Foundation governs itself as it works with communities to create conditions for vulnerable children so they can realize their full potential in school, work and life. 




“It is my hope that the property that kind Providence has brought me may be helpful to many others and that I may be found a faithful steward.”

What We Support





WKKF wants all children to live a full life with high-quality, early childhood experiences, to grow up in homes with families that have stable, high-quality jobs, and to live in a community where they are nurtured.  Our grantmaking supports thriving children, working families and equitable communities. And we continuously learn from our investments and recognize innovation as a catalyst for success. 

Thriving Children: We support a healthy start and quality learning experiences for all children. 
Working Families: We invest in efforts to help families obtain stable, high-quality jobs. 
Equitable Communities: We want all communities to be vibrant, engaged and equitable. 

Embedded within all that we do is our commitment to racial equity, to developing leaders and to engaging communities in solving their own problems. This is all part of our DNA as the Kellogg Foundation.

Truth, Racial Healing & Transformation


                    As a next step to advancing racial equity in the United States, the foundation’s Truth, Racial Healing & Transformation (TRHT) engagements are helping communities embrace racial healing, uproot the unconscious and conscious beliefs in racial hierarchy, address the historic and contemporary effects of racism and bring about transformational and sustainable change.

Where We Work








		                                We have found that our social change efforts are most effective when they operate in a limited number of geographic locations, in full partnership with communities, over extended periods of time. Many of these places are also locations where WKKF has a deep history of grantmaking, existing relationships and, in some cases, infrastructure to leverage.

We continue to work nationally throughout the U.S. and with sovereign tribes. We also concentrate up to two-thirds of our grantmaking in what we call priority places: Michigan, Mississippi, New Mexico and New Orleans, Chiapas and the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, and in Central and South Haiti. We are committed to working in each of these priority places for at least a generation.

Who We Are


                    The W.K. Kellogg Foundation (WKKF), founded in 1930 as an independent, private foundation by breakfast cereal pioneer Will Keith Kellogg, is among the largest philanthropic foundations in the United States. Guided by the belief that all children should have an equal opportunity to thrive, WKKF works with communities to create conditions for vulnerable children so they can realize their full potential in school, work and life.

Overview
The W.K. Kellogg Foundation was established in 1930 by breakfast cereal pioneer W.K. Kellogg, who defined its purpose as “…administering funds for the promotion of the welfare, comfort, health, education, feeding, clothing, sheltering and safeguarding of children and youth, directly or indirectly, without regard to sex, race, creed or nationality.…”  To guide current and future trustees and staff, he said, “Use the money as you please so long as it promotes the health, happiness and well-being of children.”
The foundation receives its income primarily from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation Trust, which was set up by Mr. Kellogg.  In addition to its diversified portfolio, the trust continues to own substantial equity in the Kellogg Company. While the company and the foundation have enjoyed a long-standing relationship, the foundation is governed by its own independent board of trustees. The foundation receives its income primarily from the trust’s investments.
Over the years, the Kellogg Foundation’s programming has continued to evolve, striving to remain innovative and responsive to the ever-changing needs of society. Today, the organization ranks among the world’s largest private foundations, awarding grants in the United States, Mexico and Haiti. 











Mission
The W.K. Kellogg Foundation supports children, families and communities as they strengthen and create conditions that propel vulnerable children to achieve success as individuals and as contributors to the larger community and society.

Vision
We envision a nation that marshals its resources to assure that all children have an equitable and promising future – a nation in which all children thrive.











Values

The work of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation is imbued with these values:

We believe in helping people help themselves through the practical application of knowledge and resources to improve their quality of life and that of future generations. 
We believe all people have the inherent capacity to effect change in their lives, in their organizations, and in their communities. We respect individuals and value their collective interests, strengths and cultures. 
We believe stewardship requires fidelity to the spirit and to the intent of the founder, and the wise use of resources. We believe in being responsible, prudent, selfless and exercising good judgment. 
We believe innovation of thought and action leads to enduring and positive change in both formal and informal systems. 
We value integrity of purpose and action, and believe it is essential to all of our affairs.












History & Legacy
The W.K. Kellogg Foundation’s mission, work and values are rooted in the experience and perspective of our founder, Will Keith Kellogg. To understand the former, it is helpful to know something of the latter.



The First Eleven Years
The First Twenty-Five Years
The First Half-Century

Early Life
W.K. Kellogg was born April 7, 1860, to Michigan pioneer parents, Seventh Day Adventists who valued modesty, healthy living and hard work. Those attributes also describe much of Mr. Kellogg's life and interests.
Mr. Kellogg went to work in the family broom business at age 14, quitting school after teachers mistook his then-undiagnosed vision problems (which ultimately left him nearly blind) for lack of intellect. At age 20, he joined his brother, Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, at the Battle Creek Sanitarium (the “San”), then a leading health spa. Often working as many as 120 hours a week, he filled positions from errand boy to business manager.
In one such role, working one night in the San's kitchen to find a digestible substitute for bread, Mr. Kellogg accidentally let stand a batch of boiled wheat. By morning, the wheat had turned to flakes, which became the basis for Corn Flakes and, in 1906, the Kellogg Company.
While Mr. Kellogg became one of the world's wealthiest men, he was never quite comfortable in that role (on being told he'd become a millionaire, he responded, "I am no such thing!") and felt obligated to use his fortune to benefit others. As early as 1909, he wrote, "If I am successful in getting out of debt, and become prosperous, I expect to make good use of any wealth that may come to me.”
With the foundation he established in 1930 – originally named the W.K. Kellogg Child Welfare Foundation – he proved true to his word, instructing the staff to, “Use the money as you please so long as it promotes the health, happiness and well-being of children.”

Financials
WKKF and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation Trust are committed to managing financial resources efficiently and effectively.
Annually, independent auditors are engaged to audit our financial statements and review the effectiveness of our internal controls. Results of our audits are typically released in December.
The foundation and trust also each complete Form 990-PFs, an informational return for U.S. private foundations filed with the IRS reporting assets, investments, expenses and grant activity. The 990-PF is due in January, but an extension maybe requested to provide time to gather investment portfolio documentation.

Stewardship
The Kellogg Foundation shares our founder’s commitment to stewardship. 
We are stewards of both W.K. Kellogg’s legacy and of the public’s trust. (Happily, the two are highly compatible.) To retain that trust, we are obligated to manage our assets efficiently and effectively. And we seek to be as transparent as possible about what we support and how we account for our expenditures.
The foundation’s vision, mission and values guide our strategic planning and our everyday decision-making. There are also clear directives to help our trustees, officers and staff members uphold the legal and ethical standards essential to our work. Please consult the topics and policies listed to learn more about how the Kellogg Foundation governs itself as it works with communities to create conditions for vulnerable children so they can realize their full potential in school, work and life. 




“It is my hope that the property that kind Providence has brought me may be helpful to many others and that I may be found a faithful steward.”

Kellogg Foundation Gave Nearly $1 Million to Black Lives Matter

Kellogg Foundation Provided Nearly $1 Million to Support Black Lives Matter

1 Dec, 2016


The W.K. Kellogg Foundation, which maintains strong financial ties to the Kellogg Company, has provided at least $930,000 in support of the controversial work of the Black Lives Matter organization.
The financing is listed on the Foundation’s website. It includes a June 1, 2016 grant to the International Development Exchange, which is in a contractual relationship with Black Lives Matter to process donations for the group.advertisement
The Associated Press reported the International Development Exchange, also known as IDEX, “has been acting as a mostly unseen financial arm of Black Lives Matter, with the ability to receive grants and tax-deductible donations on the group’s behalf.”
“More recently, the relationship evolved into a contractual partnership that will run through at least mid-2017,” the AP reported.
According to the Foundation’s website, the purpose of the $900,000 grant was to:
Enhance local and place-specific interventions to address issues impacting the lives of Black community members, families and children by building the infrastructure and capacity of the national #BlackLivesMatter to support and strengthen their local chapters’ organizing capacity.

On June 1, 2015, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation provided $30,000 to the Praxis Project, Inc. to support, according to the charity’s website, “the inaugural BlackLivesMatter Chapter Retreat.”
On Tuesday, the Kellogg Company announced its decision to pull ads from Breitbart News, explaining its 45,000,000 monthly readers are not “aligned with our values as a company.” In response, the news agency launched a #DumpKelloggs petition and has called for a boycott of the famous food manufacturer.

 
Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alexander Marlow encouraged the boycott of Kellogg products:
Breitbart News is the largest platform for pro-family content anywhere on the Internet. We are fearless advocates for traditional American values, perhaps most important among them is freedom of speech, or our motto “more voices, not less.” For Kellogg’s, an American brand, to blacklist Breitbart News in order to placate left-wing totalitarians is a disgraceful act of cowardice. They insult our incredibly diverse staff and spit in the face of our 45,000,000 highly engaged, highly perceptive, highly loyal readers, many of whom are Kellogg’s customers. Boycotting Breitbart News for presenting mainstream American ideas is an act of discrimination and intense prejudice. If you serve Kellogg’s products to your family, you are serving up bigotry at your breakfast table.
The W.K. Kellogg Foundation, meanwhile, was founded in 1930 by breakfast cereal pioneer Will Keith Kellogg, and has gone on to become one of the largest philanthropic foundations in the U.S.
Kellogg himself set up an endowment for the foundation by donating Kellogg Company stock and other investments to fund the charity.

The stock continues to fuel the foundation.
The foundation’s website relates some of the strong ties between the charity and the company, both of which are based in Battle Creek, Michigan:
The foundation receives its income primarily from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation Trust, which was set up by Mr. Kellogg. In addition to its diversified portfolio, the trust continues to own substantial equity in the Kellogg Company. While the company and the foundation have enjoyed a long-standing relationship, the foundation is governed by its own independent board of trustees. The foundation receives its income primarily from the trust’s investments.

Kellogg W K Foundation Trust Insider Buy Transaction
 Kellogg W K Foundation Trust, an insider of the popular company Kellogg Company (NYSE:K)  67.22 +0.47 0.70% made a trade, which can’t stay unnoticed. Kellogg W K Foundation Trust sold 100,000 shares of the corporation with the deal having a value near $6,907,070 USD – which is based on a stock price of $69.1 for each one share. This sizable deal will probably draw attention, as Kellogg W K Foundation Trust now has rights to 19.74% of the market cap of the Company. This sale, which was filled on 14-08-2015 was unveiled in a report with the D.C. based-SEC. 
Kellogg Co Stock Rating, Sentiment and Fundamentals
 Due to the fact that the deal is considered a substantial one, we at Octafinance come to the conclusion that Kellogg W K Foundation Trust is either very pessimistic about the future of Kellogg Co or the prospect of the stock price rising, or just sells for not company related reasons. The EPS for 2015 are anticipated to be $3.52 according to the twenty stock analysts responsible for the corporation. This would mean a price-earnings ratio of 19.59. The expected earnings per share growth rate Year-Over-Year is not higher than 5.40%.

Real Change for Children
Creating Equitable Communities


	                    The field of philanthropy is evolving and external realities challenge all of us to work differently.

The foundation has also more deeply prioritized the areas in which we fund – shared in the “Our Priorities” section of this report.

Formerly called

W.K. Kellogg Child Welfare Foundation


The W.K. Kellogg Foundation was founded in June 1930 as the W.K. Kellogg Child Welfare Foundation by breakfast cereal pioneer Will Keith Kellogg. In 1934, Kellogg donated more than $66 million in Kellogg Company stock and other investments to the W.K. Kellogg Trust, worth more than $1.2 billion in 2017 USD[1]. As with other endowments, the yearly income from this trust funds the foundation.
In the early 21st century, the foundation is the seventh largest philanthropic foundation in the U.S. In 2005, the foundation reported that the total assets of the foundation and its trust were US$7.3 billion; about US$5.5 billion of this was in Kellogg Company stock. The foundation funded US$243 million in grants and programs in its 2005 fiscal year. 82% of this was spent in the United States; 9% in southern Africa; and 9% in Latin America and the Caribbean.
In 1996, it supplied a multi-year grant worth $750,000 ($1.39 million in 2015 dollars[2]) to start mass salt fluoridation programs which were then carried out by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), covering 350 million people in Bolivia, Dominican Republic, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, and Venezuela. The project was part of a multi-year plan launched by PAHO in 1994 to “fluoridate the entire Region of the Americas”. More recently, they have provided funding for HealthCorps to prevent childhood obesity by encouraging students to take personal responsibility for their health and wellness.[3]

Grants[edit]
The foundation provides a number of grants to organizations across the United States and other countries on a number of topics.
In 2016, the Kellogg Foundation was funding more than 40 projects in Indian country, with a total value of more than $30 million in open grants. According to the non-profit’s website, the foundation has funded 380 Native American projects since 2008. Many grants are for health, education and language programs for children and youths.[4] In 2009 it granted the third-highest amount of money to Native American projects, after the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Ford Foundation.[4]
Early childhood[edit]
One grantee is the Birth to Five Policy Alliance, whose mission is to increase public and private support so young children, particularly those facing the most challenges, get the high-quality services they need to be successful.[5]
Education[edit]
The foundation has made grants to prominent educational institutions, including:

Cal Poly Pomona in Pomona, California[6]
Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan[7][8]
Kellogg College, Oxford, a constituent college of the University of Oxford, United Kingdom

Programs[edit]
The foundation supports multiple programs for optimal child development.[9]
It supports oral hygiene. In 2010, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation started a dental therapy program in five states to educate children and their families about the importance of healthy teeth. Mobile dental vans travel to rural areas to give families access to dental care. Additionally, the foundation gives grants to help minorities attend school for dentistry. [10]
Perception[edit]
The philanthropy expert Waldemar A. Nielsen said that the Kellogg Foundation "is substantially better than it is generally seen to be".[11]

Real Change for Children
Creating Equitable Communities


	                    The field of philanthropy is evolving and external realities challenge all of us to work differently. Our 2016 annual report explores how when we join together and see one another more fully, we can heal divides, create more equitable communities and ultimately achieve real change for children. The foundation has also more deeply prioritized the areas in which we fund – shared in the “Our Priorities” section of this report.

Formerly called

W.K. Kellogg Child Welfare Foundation


The W.K. Kellogg Foundation was founded in June 1930 as the W.K. Kellogg Child Welfare Foundation by breakfast cereal pioneer Will Keith Kellogg. In 1934, Kellogg donated more than $66 million in Kellogg Company stock and other investments to the W.K. Kellogg Trust, worth more than $1.2 billion in 2017 USD[1]. As with other endowments, the yearly income from this trust funds the foundation.
In the early 21st century, the foundation is the seventh largest philanthropic foundation in the U.S. In 2005, the foundation reported that the total assets of the foundation and its trust were US$7.3 billion; about US$5.5 billion of this was in Kellogg Company stock. The foundation funded US$243 million in grants and programs in its 2005 fiscal year. 82% of this was spent in the United States; 9% in southern Africa; and 9% in Latin America and the Caribbean.
In 1996, it supplied a multi-year grant worth $750,000 ($1.39 million in 2015 dollars[2]) to start mass salt fluoridation programs which were then carried out by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), covering 350 million people in Bolivia, Dominican Republic, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, and Venezuela. The project was part of a multi-year plan launched by PAHO in 1994 to “fluoridate the entire Region of the Americas”. More recently, they have provided funding for HealthCorps to prevent childhood obesity by encouraging students to take personal responsibility for their health and wellness.[3]

Grants[edit]
The foundation provides a number of grants to organizations across the United States and other countries on a number of topics.
In 2016, the Kellogg Foundation was funding more than 40 projects in Indian country, with a total value of more than $30 million in open grants. According to the non-profit’s website, the foundation has funded 380 Native American projects since 2008. Many grants are for health, education and language programs for children and youths.[4] In 2009 it granted the third-highest amount of money to Native American projects, after the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Ford Foundation.[4]
Early childhood[edit]
One grantee is the Birth to Five Policy Alliance, whose mission is to increase public and private support so young children, particularly those facing the most challenges, get the high-quality services they need to be successful.[5]
Education[edit]
The foundation has made grants to prominent educational institutions, including:

Cal Poly Pomona in Pomona, California[6]
Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan[7][8]
Kellogg College, Oxford, a constituent college of the University of Oxford, United Kingdom

Programs[edit]
The foundation supports multiple programs for optimal child development.[9]
It supports oral hygiene. In 2010, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation started a dental therapy program in five states to educate children and their families about the importance of healthy teeth. Mobile dental vans travel to rural areas to give families access to dental care. Additionally, the foundation gives grants to help minorities attend school for dentistry. [10]
Perception[edit]
The philanthropy expert Waldemar A. Nielsen said that the Kellogg Foundation "is substantially better than it is generally seen to be".[11]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
