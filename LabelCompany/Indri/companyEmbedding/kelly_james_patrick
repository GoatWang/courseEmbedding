Quick Start Guide to Robert Graham Men's Shirts
Finding the right clothing for you is about more than just fit. You're clothes should be an expression of your personality. To that end, you'll want to take into consideration a number of different facts, including: fit and cut, fabric, pattern and color, and situation. Our collection of Robert Graham shirts encompasses all these elements— so much so that we are going to look at each in a little more detail.



Fit and Cut: The main consideration behind choosing the right fit or cut comes from knowing your body type. Even if slim fit shirts are the shirt du jour, when your body is not made for a slim fit shirt, wearing one will not offer you the same look someone with a different body type is getting from it. The same goes for Euro cut shirts. Knowing your body type is the first step in finding the right fit for you.
Fabric: Different fabrics feel different, wear different, require different care, and can be more or less suited to different environments. Wool is not linen. Cotton is not corduroy. If you know your fabrics, you can get one step closer to getting the right shirts for you.
Pattern and Color: Many factors go into picking the right pattern or color. For instance, certain skin tones are better complemented by certain colors. Certain body types are better complemented by certain patterns. As a simple example, if you are a bigger guy, picking a shirt with a bigger pattern on it will complement your body type. If you are a smaller guy, go with the smaller patterns to maintain proportion to your body type.



While these pointers are aimed at help you find the best Robert Graham men's shirt for you, it also holds true for more than just shirts. It can be tempting to buy something just because of the way it looks. Anticipating how it will look on you, however, is the secret to dressing well.

James Patrick Kelly (born April 11, 1951 in Mineola, New York) is an American science fiction author who began publishing in the 1970s and remains to this day an important figure in the science fiction field.
Kelly made his first fiction sale in 1975, and has since been a major force in the science fiction field. He graduated magna cum laude from the University of Notre Dame in 1972, with a B.A. in English Literature. After graduating from college, he worked as a full-time proposal writer until 1977. He attended the Clarion Workshop twice - once in 1974 and again in 1976.
Throughout the 1980s, he and friend John Kessel became involved in the humanist/cyberpunk debate. While Kessel and Kelly were both humanists, Kelly also wrote several cyberpunk-like stories, such as "The Prisoner of Chillon" (1985) and "Rat" (1986). His story "Solstice" (1985) was published in Bruce Sterling's anthology Mirrorshades: The Cyberpunk Anthology.
Kelly has been awarded several of science fiction's highest honors. He won the Hugo Award for his novelette "Think Like a Dinosaur" (1995) and again for his novelette "1016 to 1" (1999). Most recently, his 2005 novella, Burn, won the 2006 Nebula Award. Other stories have won the Asimov's Reader Poll and the SF Chronicle Award. He is frequently on the final ballot for the Nebula Award, the Locus Poll Award and the Theodore Sturgeon Memorial Award. He frequently teaches and participates in science fiction workshops, such as Clarion and the Sycamore Hill Writer's Workshop. He has served on the New Hampshire State Council on the Arts since 1998 and chaired the council in 2004.
He is currently on the Popular Fiction faculty for the Stonecoast MFA Program in Creative Writing at the University of Southern Maine.
He is a frequent contributor to Asimov's Science Fiction and for the past several years has contributed a non-fiction column to Asimov's, "On the Net." He has had a story in the June issue of Asimov's for the past twenty years. In addition to his writing, Kelly has recently turned his hand to editing (with John Kessel), with several reprint anthologies: Feeling Very Strange: The Slipstream Anthology, Rewired: The Post-Cyberpunk Anthology and The Secret History of Science Fiction. Through these anthologies, Kelly and Kessel have brought together a wide spectrum of both traditional genre authors and authors who are considered to be more mainstream, including Don DeLillo, George Saunders, Jonathan Lethem, Aimee Bender, Michael Chabon and Steven Millhauser.

For Patent AttorneysPatent-Pilot helps patent attorneys and patent law firms to analyze clients and competitors. Which foreign law firms are potential partner for cooperation on your filings? Which other law firms are serving your clients? Who is the law firm representing the opposing party in your case?For Patent Attorneys




For CompaniesPatent-Pilot helps companies to benchmark the patent attorneys and patent law firms representing their company and identify new partners. Are you working with law firms you are experts in your field of expertise? Are you aware of potential conflicts of interest with other clients of your representative?For Companies




How Patent-Pilot WorksPatent-Pilot analyzes more than 2.3 million patent applications. Based on those documents, we create profiles of patent attorneys and patent law firms and developed an algorithm which allocates patent attorneys to their most recent law firm and generates the statistics and visualizations.How It Works

Identify Patent Attorneys and Patent Law Firms
You can search through more than 2.3 million patent documents for intellectual property firms from more than 67 countries.
Searching for names includes patent attorneys, patent law firms and patent applicants.
Or you can search using a technical keyword. In this case, you will receive a result list containing all patent attorneys who have represented applications regarding those keywords.
Patent-Pilot is based on all PCT patent applications which were filed before the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). In our database you can find all patent attorneys and patent law firms who represented at least 5 PCT applications.




 




Analyze Patent Attorneys in Law Firms
Patent-Pilot allocates all patent attorneys to their most recent law firm.
Not only patent law firms can be analyzed. You can also see inside of law firms and on the level of patent attorneys who is responsible for certain technical fields and most experienced.
This is crucial if you want to know who the real experts are. Moreover, we make sure that the experience displayed is connetcted to the patent attorneys who actually work for a law firm. If an attorney leaves, she takes expertise and experience with her.

 

Check technical experience
The technical experience of your attorneys or your cooperating patent law firms is often very important in patent filing and prosecution for achieving comprehensive property rights that also stand in opposition or infringement cases.
Patent-Pilot delivers charts that illustrate the technical areas in an understandable categorization. This is much more practicable than the traditional IPC classification. It’s based on those classes but arrange them in a different way.
You can limit the charts to certain areas or display only applications tht were represented for a certain client.
Thereby, you can gain a fast and objective overview of technical experience of these patent law firms









Analyze client relationships of patent law firms
Patent-Pilot can show you which clients patent attorneys are working
This makes the relationship between clients and law firms transparent. Who are the most important clients of a law firm? Are the winning or loosing mandates? Which companies that are not on the client list might be interesting prospects and who are the representatives of those companies?
Very important is also the question of conflicts of interests and mandate collisions.

Excerpt



Burn
 by James Patrick Kelly 
ISBN: 1892391279
Published: 2005
Available Format(s): Hardcover
Simplicity ain’t what it used to be.
The tiny planet of Morobe’s Pea has been sold, and the new owner has a few ideas. He has renamed it Walden, and voluntary simplicity is now the rule. It will become a rural paradise for everyone who embraces Thoreau’s philosophy. But the previous tenants have their own ideas. And they are willing to set themselves on fire to defend them….


“A powerful cocktail of the strange and the hauntingly familiar”
—Cory Doctorow
“When the new owner of the planet Morobe’s Pea renames the world Walden and imposes Thoreau’s pattern of simplicity in living upon its citizens, a few rebel against the new regime, setting themselves on fire to burn down the forests introduced on Walden’s surface. Spur—a young firefighter recovering from severe burns suffered while interrupting his brother-in-law’s arson attempt—conducts his own research on his world and unleashes a series of unforeseen events by contacting a group of off-planet benevolent meddlers led by a wise child known as the High Gregory. Veteran SF author Kelly brings a unique vision to his story of a utopia gone awry. With an intriguing set of characters and a plot both chilling and charming, this remarkable tale belongs in most SF collections.”
—Library Journal
“Hugo-winner Kelly (‘Think like a Dinosaur’) mixes hard-edged extrapolation with messy human issues in this thought-provoking SF novel. The inhabitants of Transcendent State, a colony of ‘true humans,’ have rejected advanced technology for lives of voluntary simplicity on a world renamed Walden. They are threatened by the pukpuk, survivors of a previous settlement who seek to stop plans to cover the planet with healthy, dense forest by setting fires in the wilderness. Now even Walden’s citizens are beginning to question their charter’s tenets of simplicity, secretly trading produce and handmade goods for pukpuk tech through a thriving black market. The spark that will ignite Walden’s final conflict comes from one of its own, firefighter Prosper ‘Spur’ Leung, when he unwittingly contacts the High Gregory of Kenning, ruler of a distant world. ‘I make luck,’ the High Gregory says, turning Spur’s commitment to Walden’s (and Thoreau’s) philosophy of self-reliance and the primacy of nature upside down. Kelly’s many-layered story pivots on a set of paradoxes, asking questions about the difference between innocence and willful ignorance, responsibility and balance, and the true essence of nature.”
—Publishers Weekly
“Bored while recovering from burns received in the line of duty, fruit farmer turned fireman Spur decides to contact similarly named people throughout the Thousand Worlds. He reaches a boy on a throne, who says he makes luck and becomes very interested in Spur’s world, the small planet Walden, designated a simple-living utopia by the wealthy man who bought it from its mother planet. A few days later, homeward bound from the hospital, a hover stops the train to take Spur aboard. On the aircraft are the boy, a gaggle of other children from other worlds, and their superintendent. The kids are all extraordinary and, as it happens, intent on resolving the warfare on Walden, which consists of the pre-utopian inhabitants setting forest fires to resist the forestation of all the land the Waldenites don’t farm. Besides its fireman hero (a reversal of Montag in Fahrenheit 451) and its would-be-utopian setting, the warm humanity and rural sympathies of this affectionate, winsome short novel will make many recall Ray Bradbury at his best.”
—Booklist
“With his immaculate prose and perfect structural tricks, Kelly’s book offers a richly satisfying blend of adventure and philosophy.”
—SciFi.com (Grade: A)
“James Patrick Kelly is one of the masters of science fiction. He imagines futures both high-tech and human, both dizzyingly complicated and determinedly simple, and then sends us to Walden, where simplicity is anything but, and even Henry David Thoreau begins to look disturbingly different. Burn is inventive, moving, and involving. It’s James Patrick Kelly at his best, and there’s nothing better.”
—Connie Willis
“Kelly has written something fresh…some of the fundamental concepts of sf in an innovate way.”
—The New York Review of Science Fiction


James Patrick Kelly is the author of five novels and several collections of short stories for which he has won the Hugo, Nebula, Locus, and Italia awards.

Praise for James Patrick Kelly
“One of the finest short-fiction writers in science fiction.”
—Amazon.com
“A meticulous craftsman in the demanding short-story form, as well as a tactful scalpel-wielding veteran of many a writers’ workshop.”
—Publishers Weekly
“A brilliant evocation of future possibilities that establishes Kelly as leading shaper of the genre.”
—Booklist (on Wildlife)

One
For the hero is commonly the simplest and obscurest of men.
– Walden
 
Spur was in the nightmare again. It always began in the burn. The front of the burn took on a liquid quality and oozed like lava toward him. It licked at boulders and scorched the trees in the forest he had sworn to protect. There was nothing he could do to fight it; in the nightmare, he wasn’t wearing his splash pack. Or his fireproof field jacket. Fear pinned him against an oak until he could feel the skin on his face start to cook. Then he tore himself away and ran. But now the burn leapt after him, following like a fiery shadow. It chased him through a stand of pine; trees exploded like firecrackers. Sparks bit through his civvies and stung him. He could smell burning hair. His hair. In a panic he dodged into a stream choked with dead fish and poached frogs. But the water scalded his legs. He scrambled up the bank of the stream, weeping. He knew he shouldn’t be afraid; he was a veteran of the firefight. Still he felt as if something was squeezing him. A whimpering gosdog bolted across his path, its feathers singed, eyes wide. He could feel the burn dive under the forest and burrow ahead of him in every direction. The ground was hot beneath his feet and the dark humus smoked and stank. In the nightmare there was just one way out, but his brother-in-law Vic was blocking it. Only in the nightmare Vic was a pukpuk, one of the human torches who had started the burn. Vic had not yet set himself on fire, although his baseball jersey was smoking in the heat. He beckoned and for a moment Spur thought it might not be Vic after all as the anguished face shimmered in the heat of the burn. Vic wouldn’t betray them, would he? But by then Spur had to dance to keep his shoes from catching fire, and he had no escape, no choice, no time. The torch spread his arms wide and Spur stumbled into his embrace and with an angry whoosh they exploded together into flame. Spur felt his skin crackle. . . .
“That’s enough for now.” A sharp voice cut through the nightmare. Spur gasped with relief when he realized that there was no burn. Not here anyway. He felt a cold hand brush against his forehead like a blessing and knew that he was in the hospital. He had just been in the sim that  the upsiders were using to heal his soul.
“You’ve got to stop thrashing around like that,” said the docbot. “Unless you want me to nail the leads to your head.”
Spur opened his eyes but all he could see was mist and shimmer. He tried to answer the docbot but he could barely find his tongue in his own mouth. A brightness to his left gradually resolved into the sunny window of the hospital room. Spur could feel the firm and not unpleasant  pressure of the restraints, which bound him to the bed: broad straps across his ankles, thighs, wrists and torso. The docbot peeled the leads off his temples and then lifted Spur’s head to get the one at the base of his skull.
“So do you remember your name?” it said.
Spur stretched his head against the pillow, trying to loosen the stiffness in his neck.
“I’m over here, son. This way.”
He turned and stared into a glowing blue eye, which strobed briefly.
“Pupil dilatation normal,” the docbot muttered, probably not to Spur. It paused for a moment and then spoke again.
“So about that name?”
“Spur.”
The docbot stroked Spur’s palm with its med finger, collecting some of his sweat. It stuck the sample into its mouth.
“That may be what your friends call you,” it said, “but what I’m asking is the name on your id.”
The words chased each other across the ceiling for a moment before they sank in. Spur wouldn’t have had such a problem understanding if the docbot were a person, with lips and a real mouth instead of the oblong intake. The doctor controlling this bot was somewhere else. Dr. Niss was an upsider whom Spur had never actually met. “Prosper Gregory Leung,” he said.
“A fine Walden name,” said the docbot, and then muttered,
“Self id 27.4 seconds from initial request.”
“Is that good?”
It hummed to itself, ignoring his question. “The electrolytes in your sweat have settled down nicely,” it said at last.
“So tell me about the sim.”
“I was in the burn and the fire was after me. All around, Dr. Niss. There was a pukpuk, one of the torches, he grabbed me. I couldn’t get away.”
“You remembered my name, son.” The docbot’s top plate glowed with an approving amber light. “So did you die?”
Spur shook his head. “But I was on fire.”
“Experience fear vectors unrelated to the burn? Monsters, for instance? Your mom? Dad?”
“No.”
“Lost loves? Dead friends? Childhood pets?”
“No.” He had a fleeting image of the twisted grimace on Vic’s face at that last moment, but how could he tell this upsider that his wife’s brother had been a traitor to the Transcendent State? “Nothing.” Spur was getting used to lying to Dr. Niss, although he worried what it was doing to his soul.
“Check and double check. It’s almost as if I knew what I was doing, eh?” The docbot began   releasing the straps that held Spur down. “I’d say your soul is on the mend, Citizen Leung. You’ll have some psychic scarring, but if you steer clear of complex moral dilemmas and women, you should be fine.” It paused, then snapped its fingers. “Just for the record, son, that was a joke.”
“Yes, sir.” Spur forced a smile. “Sorry, sir.” Was getting the jokes part of the cure? The way this upsider talked at once baffled and fascinated Spur.
“So let’s have a look at those burns,” said the docbot.
Spur rolled onto his stomach and folded his arms under his chin. The docbot pulled the hospital gown up. Spur could feel its medfinger pricking the dermal grafts that covered most of his back and his buttocks. “Dr. Niss?” said Spur.
“Speak up,” said the docbot. “That doesn’t hurt does it?”
“No, sir.” Spur lifted his head and tried to look back over this shoulder. “But it’s really itchy.”
“Dermal regeneration 83 percent,” it muttered. “Itchy is alive, son. Itchy is growing.”
“Sir, I was just wondering, where are you exactly?”
“Right here.” The docbot began to flow warm dermslix to the grafts from its medfinger. “Where else would I be?”
Spur chuckled, hoping that was a joke. He could remember a time when he used to tell jokes. “No, I mean your body.”
“The shell? Why?” The docbot paused. “You don’t really want to be asking about QICS and the cognisphere, do you? The less you know about the upside, the better, son.”
Spur felt a prickle of resentment. What stories were upsiders telling each other about Walden? That the citizens of the Transcendent State were backward fanatics who had simplified themselves into savagery? “I wasn’t asking about the upside, exactly. I was asking about you. I mean . . . you saved me, Dr. Niss.” It wasn’t at all what Spur had expected to say, although it was certainly true. “If it wasn’t for you, it . . . I was burnt all over, probably going crazy. And I  thought. . . .” His throat was suddenly so tight that he could hardly speak. “I wanted to . . . you know, thank you.”
“Quite unnecessary,” said the docbot. “After all, the Chairman is paying me to take care of all of you, bless his pockets.”
It tugged at Spur’s hospital gown with its gripper arm. “I prefer the kind of thanks I can bank, son. Everything else is just used air.”
“Yes, but. . . .”
“Yes, but?” It finished pulling the gown back into place.
“ ‘Yes but’ are dangerous words. Don’t forget that you people lead a privileged life here — courtesy of Jack Winter’s bounty and your parents’ luck.”
Spur had never heard anyone call the Chairman Jack. “It was my grandparents who won the lottery, sir,” he said. “But yes, I know I’m lucky to live on Walden.”
“So why do you want to know what kind of creature would puree his mind into a smear of  quantum foam and entangle it with a bot brain a hundred and thirty-some light-years away? Sit up, son.”
Spur didn’t know what to say. He had imagined that Dr. Niss must be posted nearby, somewhere here at the upsiders’ compound at Concord, or perhaps in orbit.
“You do realize that the stars are very far away?”
“We’re not simple here, Dr. Niss.” He could feel the blood rushing in his cheeks. “We practice simplicity.”

Quick Start Guide to Robert Graham Men's Shirts
Finding the right clothing for you is about more than just fit. You're clothes should be an expression of your personality. To that end, you'll want to take into consideration a number of different facts, including: fit and cut, fabric, pattern and color, and situation. Our collection of Robert Graham shirts encompasses all these elements— so much so that we are going to look at each in a little more detail.



Fit and Cut: The main consideration behind choosing the right fit or cut comes from knowing your body type. Even if slim fit shirts are the shirt du jour, when your body is not made for a slim fit shirt, wearing one will not offer you the same look someone with a different body type is getting from it. The same goes for Euro cut shirts. Knowing your body type is the first step in finding the right fit for you.
Fabric: Different fabrics feel different, wear different, require different care, and can be more or less suited to different environments. Wool is not linen. Cotton is not corduroy. If you know your fabrics, you can get one step closer to getting the right shirts for you.
Pattern and Color: Many factors go into picking the right pattern or color. For instance, certain skin tones are better complemented by certain colors. Certain body types are better complemented by certain patterns. As a simple example, if you are a bigger guy, picking a shirt with a bigger pattern on it will complement your body type. If you are a smaller guy, go with the smaller patterns to maintain proportion to your body type.



While these pointers are aimed at help you find the best Robert Graham men's shirt for you, it also holds true for more than just shirts. It can be tempting to buy something just because of the way it looks. Anticipating how it will look on you, however, is the secret to dressing well.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
