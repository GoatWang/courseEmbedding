Publisher's Description▼▲
Together for the first time in a single volume, two of Dr. Michael L. Brown's groundbreaking works are ready to challenge a new generation of Christians to combat the status quo of a compromised church and a godless society.-----Have you ever wondered why you rarely-if ever-see the kinds of miracles today that were so common in the Bible? Whatever Happened to the Power of God? explores why so few of the seriously ill are healed, why apparent encounters with God's supernatural power so rarely change lives, and why spiritual warfare seems to have little effect on society. This book asks the questions you have always wanted to ask and confronts you with answers that will change your life. Find out what's holding back the power of God!----- In It's Time to Rock the Boat, Dr. Brown reveals the biblical pattern for changing society through preaching a confrontational gospel. The Old Testament prophets, New Testament apostles, John the Baptist, and Jesus the Messiah Himself were not content to let society be dragged down by its sinful and destructive elements-they took a stand against an onslaught of degradation and made waves that rocked the world! God is calling each of us to be part of that world-shaking movement. It's time!


Author Bio▼▲
