Anavex Life Sciences Appoints Distinguished Researcher in Neurology and Epilepsy to Scientific Advisory Board

NEW YORK, July  20, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Anavex Life Sciences Corp. (“Anavex” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq:AVXL), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing differentiated therapeutics for the treatment of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases including Alzheimer’s disease, other central nervous system (CNS) diseases, pain, and various types of cancer, today announced the appointment of Andrew J. Cole, M.D., F.R.C.P.(C.) to its Scientific Advisory Board.
Dr. Andrew J. Cole is Director of the MGH Epilepsy Service, Chief of the Division of Clinical Neurophysiology and Epilepsy and Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School. He graduated from Dartmouth College Magna Cum Laude and Dartmouth Medical School. He trained in Neurology and Clinical Neurophysiology at the Montreal Neurological Institute, and then moved to Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine where he was Assistant Professor of Neurology. He came to Massachusetts General Hospital in 1992 where he started and developed the MGH Epilepsy Service and founded the MGH Pediatric Epilepsy Service. He has published extensively in clinical neurology, epilepsy, clinical neurophysiology and basic neuroscience. In addition to research and clinical work, Dr. Cole lectures frequently throughout the United States and internationally, and has been a visiting professor at numerous institutions in the U.S.A. and abroad. "I am impressed with Anavex and its potential CNS platform drug, ANAVEX 2-73, which has shown encouraging clinical safety data combined with promising preclinical anti-seizure data," said Andrew J. Cole, M.D., F.R.C.P.(C.), Director of the Massachusetts General Hospital Epilepsy Service and Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School. “I look forward to advising the company as it’s about to initiate three clinical trials with significant unmet needs.” “We are pleased to welcome Dr. Andrew Cole to Anavex’s Scientific Advisory Board,” stated Christopher U. Missling, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of Anavex. “Dr. Cole brings extensive experience in neurological diseases to Anavex. I am confident he will make important contributions to our SAB and to the continued development of ANAVEX 2-73 for the treatment of both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, including Rett syndrome, Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease.” /EIN News/ -- About Anavex Life Sciences Corp. Anavex Life Sciences Corp. (Nasdaq:AVXL) is a publicly traded biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of differentiated therapeutics for the treatment of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases including Alzheimer’s disease, other central nervous system (CNS) diseases, pain, and various types of cancer. Anavex’s lead drug candidate, ANAVEX 2-73, recently completed successfully a Phase 2a clinical trial for Alzheimer’s disease. ANAVEX 2-73 is an orally available drug candidate that restores cellular homeostasis by targeting sigma-1 and muscarinic receptors. Preclinical studies demonstrated its potential to halt and/or reverse the course of Alzheimer’s disease. It has also exhibited anticonvulsant, anti-amnesic, neuroprotective and anti-depressant properties in animal models, indicating its potential to treat additional CNS disorders, including epilepsy and others. The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research has awarded Anavex a research grant to develop ANAVEX 2-73 for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease to fully fund a preclinical study, which could justify moving ANAVEX 2-73 into a Parkinson’s disease clinical trial. ANAVEX 3-71, also targeting sigma-1 and M1 muscarinic receptors, is a promising preclinical drug candidate demonstrating disease modifications against the major Alzheimer’s hallmarks in transgenic (3xTg-AD) mice, including cognitive deficits, amyloid and tau pathologies, and also with beneficial effects on neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunctions.

See this ALZ product and trials - co completed P1, double blind placebo controlled P2b for 399 patients with very good results and completed enrollment of 800 patients for P3 study for ALZ - it is a non-plaque approach. It seems way better than AVXL   http://vtvtherapeutics.com/pipeline/azeliragon   So why AVXL is so special and it has done that will force FDA to allow them to exclude P2b - dose optimization and large P3 study?   What you have is 32 patient - 7 dropped - non-conclusive study.

Forget Anavex Life Sciences Corp.: These 2 Biotech Stocks Are Better Buys
The tiny biotech's only clinical-stage candidate is a long way from the goal line, making these two biotech stocks far better picks.

Investors are right to focus on potential Alzheimer's disease drugs because of the huge market, but Anavex Life Sciences Corp. (NASDAQ:AVXL) is an awfully long way from from the finish line with its lead candidate. Clinical-stage biotech stocks are inherently risky, but I'd like to walk you through some figures that show why Geron Corporation (NASDAQ:GERN) and its cancer drugs might make a better addition to your portfolio. If you'd like to stay within the Alzheimer's disease space, ACADIA Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ACAD) also has a compelling opportunity to expand its lead drug into this underserved space and beyond.

Both Geron and Acadia present risks, but both stocks have a better chance of providing market-beating gains over the long term than Anavex. Here's why.
Geron Pharmaceuticals: Advancing a contender
Anavex and Geron don't have a product to sell yet, but it looks like the latter has a much better chance of bringing its first clinical-stage drug into the commercial arena. Geron's lead candidate, imetelstat, appears to have an important advantage over the leading treatment (Jakafi) for a rare form of blood cancer known as myelofibrosis, a disorder marked by overactive blood cell production in bone marrow.
In 2011, Jakafi from Incyte earned approval to treat myelofibrosis based on observed spleen size reductions. Enlarged spleens are a key myelofibrosis symptom, but the therapy's lackluster improvement in 3-year survival rates to 70% over 61% observed in a group receiving a placebo suggests a strong contender could quickly earn a significant share of the available patient population.
In a trial that enrolled 33 myelofibrosis patients, Geron's imetelstat generated a clinical response defined in part by an observed improvement on bone marrow damage among about 21% of patients. Furthermore, 12% experienced a complete remission defined by complete reversal of damage.





By contrast, Anavex's lead candidate's ability to slow progression of cognitive decline among Alzheimer's patients is questionable at best. So far the only clinical-efficacy data for the drug consists of a less-than-impressive change in cognitive ability test scores from baseline. Without a control group for comparison, observations to data are hardly worth getting excited about. Observed responses in patients treated with Geron's imetelstat, though, is the sort of data worth getting excited about.
Another advantage Geron has over Anavex is a deep-pocketed partner ready to fund a trial large enough to support an application. Anavex wrapped up a mid-stage study with its lead candidate, but hasn't begun a larger, more expensive late-stage trial yet. The company is open to collaboration to continue its development, but hasn't announced one yet. 
Geron, on the other hand, is far less likely to delay development due to a lack of resources. It's partner, Johnson & Johnson, is awaiting more data this year from imetelstat. If mid-stage trial results fall in line with previous observations, J&J will fund a late-stage study, and possibly commercialization activities, cutting Geron checks for milestones and royalties along the way. As Geron's market cap is just $335.8 million at recent prices, success for imetelstat could lead to market-crushing gains over the long run.
Acadia Pharmaceuticals: An important expansion
If you're looking for a biotech with potential upside and a commercial-stage product, you'll want to consider the purveyor of the first drug specifically approved to treat Parkinson's disease psychosis. An estimated 40% of an estimated 1 million U.S. Parkinson's disease patients suffer delusions and hallucinations, and treating these symptoms is a huge burden on families and healthcare budgets.





Acadia's Nuplazid generated $5.2 million in sales during its first full quarter on pharmacy shelves, and is expected to climb much higher with it having the Parkinson's disease indication essentially to itself. Acadia's recent market cap of around $3.85 billion suggests a great deal of success for the drug is already priced in, but a possible expansion to the much larger Alzheimer's disease (AD) indication could send the stock higher still.
So how is Acadia faring in its quest for expanding Nuplazid's label? Well, Acadia's shares slid recently after top-line data barely squeaked by with a statistically significant reduction in psychosis test scores among AD patients at six weeks. While the slim success is concerning, it's also important to note Nuplazid wasn't associated with impaired-cognition side effects. Sadly, anti-psychotics currently available for Alzheimer's patients often exacerbate the disease's main symptom, cognitive decline, which cold give Nuplazid an advantage..
If trials for AD psychosis don't clear a path for expansion to this enormous population, an ongoing mid-stage trial for AD agitation could do the job. AD agitation affects perhaps half of America's 5.4 million AD patients, and often leads to costly nursing-home placement. Given the lack of available treatment options for AD psychosis or agitation, Nuplazid's lack of adverse cognitive side effects could make it popular enough to generate more than $2 billion in annual sales with an expansion to such a large population.

Image source: Getty Images.

Beyond Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, Acadia also has a chance to expand Nuplazid to the large schizophrenia indication. Schizophrenia affects about 1% of the the adult population in the U.S., and perhaps 30% suffer an inadequate response to existing antipsychotics. The company is running a late-stage trial that could support an application for the medicine to become the first treatment for this group as well.





Further out, a mid-stage trial will shed more light on Nuplazid's potential as an additional treatment for a majority of America's 16 million adults with major depressive disorder inadequately managed by their existing therapies.
Of course, if Nuplazid remains locked into Parkinson's disease without a chance of expanding to any of these additional indications, investors would probably suffer losses. Unlike Anavex, though, Acadia has already proved it can advance a drug from clinical to commercial stage. Label-expansion approvals are far from certain, but several trials that could lead to key expansions under way give the stock a much better chance of beating the broad market in the long run.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
