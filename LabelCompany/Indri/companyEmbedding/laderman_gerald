Experienced Attorney Specializing in Personal Injury & Family Law Matters for Over 37 Years
Learn More






Experienced Personal Injury Attorney Serving Los Angeles, CA
Personal Injury Attorney, Gerald Laderman, incorporates all facets of civil litigation into his law practice, including personal injury matters, such as automobile accidents, truck accidents, bus accidents, motorcycle accidents, slip-and-fall incidents, wrongful death cases, insurance bad faith matters, as well as business litigation, and family law. Personal injury, civil litigation, and family law services are provided in the Los Angeles, CA area with offices in Santa Monica, CA. His services extend to other Southern California areas, such as Orange County and Ventura County.
Mr. Laderman takes each law case that he handles personally, just as if he were the client. It's not just "business" to him; it’s "personal." He has a "hands-on" approach with every case, being involved with all steps in the progression of the case from beginning to end. He does not "pass his clients off" to his employees. He truly enjoys interacting with his clients himself in his passion to see that justice prevails for each of them.
Personal injury cases are handled on a contingency fee basis, meaning that Mr. Laderman takes a percentage of what is recovered without any out-of-pocket fees or costs paid by the client until the case is finalized. On matters that Mr. Laderman charges an hourly rate, such as family law or business litigation, his rates are affordable, as he understands that the economy is difficult for the working person. His interest is seeing that no one is deprived of having his or her "day in court."
