San Diego, CA – September 2014 –
TDK Corporation announces the introduction of the DC input TDK-Lambda RDEN-048050 EMC filter to complement the existing R series of AC input EMC filters.  The RDEN-048050 filter can accept an input voltage of up to 76VDC, and is rated for currents up to 50A.
Enclosed in a metal case, connections are made via rugged M5 studs for easy termination and the filter will operate at 50A in an ambient of -30 to 55oC, derating to 20A at 85oC.  With frequencies between 0.2 to 10MHz, common mode attenuation is 30dB and with frequencies between 0.7 to 30MHz differential mode attenuation is 25dB.
Input to case (ground) isolation is 1,500VDC and isolation resistance is 500MΩ at 500VDC.  The filter is certified to UL60950-1 and EN60939.  The package size, excluding terminals, is just 90mm in depth, 60mm wide and 30mm high.
More information can be obtained at the following TDK-Lambda Americas website, http://www.us.tdk-lambda.com/lp/products/rden-series, or by calling 800-LAMBDA-4.  Product availability for the RDEN filter can be found via the link to TDK-Lambda’s distributor network (see “Check Distributor Stock to Buy”) at http://www.us.tdk-lambda.com/lp/.
