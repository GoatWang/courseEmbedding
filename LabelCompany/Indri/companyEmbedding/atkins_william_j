Lose Weight and Live a Heart-Healthy Life Without Hunger or Deprivation.
The South Beach Diet, created by world-renowned cardiologist Dr. Agatston, incorporates heart-healthy, unsaturated fats like olive oil, avocado, and nuts, in place of unhealthy fats. These “good fats” will help you lose weight fast without being hungry.








Enjoy Delicious Meals and More Variety with the South Beach Diet.
With a wide variety of fully prepared meals, the South Beach Diet offers hearty, delicious breakfasts, lunch and dinner entr�es, and savory or sweet snacks in a range of globally inspired flavors. Enjoy a different dish each meal without growing tired of eating the same old thing. You won't be limited to just bars, shakes, and a handful of prepared meals like you are on Atkins.










Lose weight and get in the best shape of your life with the South Beach Diet!

William J. Atkins
                Publisher info
                  

        William J. Atkins wrote his first full-length novel after thirty years as an international financial services executive. His life experiences in international sales and marketing exposed him to the cultural cross currents that feed the characters and places in his book. He is a graduate of Hobart College, where he received a bachelor’s degree in philosophy in 1975. He also studied Middle Eastern history at Franklin College in Lugano, Switzerland. In 1973, he was evacuated from Eilat, Israel, days before the beginning of the Yom Kippur War between Israel and Egypt. He fled to a kibbutz in Beersheba, where he was educated first hand about Israel's conflict with the Arab world. He is the father of three and grandfather of one (with two on the way). William and his wife Betsy split time between homes in Indiana, the Bahamas, and Canada. He is an avid fisherman and outdoorsman who kayaks, bikes, runs, and hikes as much as he can.

How do I choose a lawyer?Consider the following: 
Comfort Level - Are you comfortable telling the lawyer personal
information? Does the lawyer seem interested in solving your problem? 
Credentials - How long has the lawyer been in practice? Has
the lawyer worked on other cases similar to yours? 
Cost - How are the lawyer's fees structured - hourly or flat
fee? Can the lawyer estimate the cost of your case? 
City - Is the lawyer's office conveniently located?
Not sure what questions to ask a lawyer?Here are a few to get you started:

How long have you been in practice?

William knows litigation. William employs skills developed while working for federal judges to identify and assess each case’s critical strengths and weaknesses, leading to early strategic plans. The use of targeted investigative measures and aggressive/innovative deposition techniques are the touchstones of William’s approach. With superior knowledge in navigating the minefield of state and federal procedural requirements, he is adept at maintaining the edge in disputes. He also brings an appellate background to trial practice, having handled numerous appeals and oral arguments, including successfully arguing before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.
William knows clients. William partners with clients to establish litigation campaigns that are consistent with the clients’ overall business objectives.  Case results are unique, and often provide the chance to narrowly tailor results to suit clients’ ongoing business goals. Litigation also frequently provides opportunities for addressing risks and crafting and implementing plans to minimize future exposure.
William knows high-stakes. William successfully represented the world’s third-largest aircraft manufacturer in lawsuits concerning sales of multi-million dollar jet aircraft. He often represents international product manufacturers in wrongful death cases seeking hundreds of millions of dollars. An international manufacturer called on William to spear-head its trademark campaign against a network of illicit importers, resulting in agreed injunctions and settlements. One of the nation’s largest health insurers relied on William to argue its first Texas Prompt Pay Act arbitration, which affected numerous other similar matters with tens of millions in claimed damages. He also represents attorneys and other professionals in high-profile malpractice actions, including those reported in the Texas Lawyer, Law360, and Forbes. William rounds out his practice with an array of commercial disputes arising out of varied aspects of a business’s day-to-day activities, including employment, premises liability, and transportation issues.

STANDING ORDERS

All Bloomberg BNA treatises are available on standing order, which ensures you will always receive the most current edition of the book or supplement of the title you have ordered from Bloomberg BNA’s book division. As soon as a new supplement or edition is published (usually annually) for a title you’ve previously purchased and requested to be placed on standing order, we’ll ship it to you to review for 30 days without any obligation. During this period, you can either (a) honor the invoice and receive a 5% discount (in addition to any other discounts you may qualify for) off the then-current price of the update, plus shipping and handling or (b) return the book(s), in which case, your invoice will be cancelled upon receipt of the book(s). Call us for a prepaid UPS label for your return. It’s as simple and easy as that.

STANDING ORDERS

All Bloomberg BNA treatises are available on standing order, which ensures you will always receive the most current edition of the book or supplement of the title you have ordered from Bloomberg BNA’s book division. As soon as a new supplement or edition is published (usually annually) for a title you’ve previously purchased and requested to be placed on standing order, we’ll ship it to you to review for 30 days without any obligation. During this period, you can either (a) honor the invoice and receive a 5% discount (in addition to any other discounts you may qualify for) off the then-current price of the update, plus shipping and handling or (b) return the book(s), in which case, your invoice will be cancelled upon receipt of the book(s). Call us for a prepaid UPS label for your return. It’s as simple and easy as that. Most importantly, standing orders mean you will never have to worry about the timeliness of the information you’re relying on. And, you may discontinue standing orders at any time by contacting us at 1.800.960.1220 or by sending an email to books@bna.com.

Compare South Beach Diet to Atkins

On the South Beach Diet, you'll lose weight with plenty of lean protein and heart-healthy good fats that nourish and satisfy—an approach that literally turns off the switch for sugar and refined-carb cravings.
Atkins' approach heavily restricts carbs and their packaged foods are higher in sodium and saturated fat.
 View Plan 








South Beach Diet: Less Saturated Fat, Less Sodium, More Taste. You Decide.





South Beach Diet


Roasted Turkey with Herb Gravy (213g)
0.5g Saturated Fat 470mg Sodium


Roasted Chicken Pomodoro (261g)
1.5g Saturated Fat 590mg Sodium


Texas Style Chili (224g)
3g Saturated Fat 540mg Sodium


Sesame Glazed Beef & Veggie Bowl (221g)
2g Saturated Fat 400mg Sodium




Atkins

9g Saturated Fat 990mg Sodium


Chicken Margherita (255g)

ATKINS PACKAGED FOODS ARE EXTREMELY HIGH IN SODIUM— EXCEEDING AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION RECOMMENDATIONS!










Put the science to work and lose weight on the South Beach Diet!

 View Plan 









Lose Weight and Live a Heart-Healthy Life Without Hunger or Deprivation.
The South Beach Diet, created by world-renowned cardiologist Dr. Agatston, incorporates heart-healthy, unsaturated fats like olive oil, avocado, and nuts, in place of unhealthy fats. These “good fats” will help you lose weight fast without being hungry.








Enjoy Delicious Meals and More Variety with the South Beach Diet.
With a wide variety of fully prepared meals, the South Beach Diet offers hearty, delicious breakfasts, lunch and dinner entr�es, and savory or sweet snacks in a range of globally inspired flavors. Enjoy a different dish each meal without growing tired of eating the same old thing. You won't be limited to just bars, shakes, and a handful of prepared meals like you are on Atkins.










Lose weight and get in the best shape of your life with the South Beach Diet!
