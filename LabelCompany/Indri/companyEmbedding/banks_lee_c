            I was asked to be the God-Mother of two children this year (2014) and i thought it was a great idea to get each child a bible for their christening. I love this bible and their parents loved it too! I believe it is important for children to read books with characters that look like them in it, it helps build self confidence and acceptance. To be clear, the actual text of  the bible is short, all of the stories aren't accurate as another reviewer has stated but I believe that was done because it is meant to be the childs first bible. They're bible can be upgraded when they get a little older and have more understanding, but for now I think the text is appropriate.

            Loved the illustrations, but was disappointed with the text - it was not an accurate representation of the actual Bible stories.

				1. Please see your applicable Wells Fargo account agreement and card terms and conditions for information on liability for unauthorized transactions. 2. 10 or more purchases/payments with your Wells Fargo Debit Card each fee period required to avoid the $10 Everyday Checking account monthly service fee. - Included: Debit card purchases include PIN, signature, online and phone purchases that post during the fee period. Debit card payments include one-time and recurring payments of bills made with your debit card that post during the fee period. - Not Included: Any transaction at an ATM (Wells Fargo or non-Wells Fargo) and ACH (Automated Clearing House) transactions. Debit card purchases and debit card payments must post during the fee period to be counted toward the total of 10 or more. The dates of your fee period are located in the “Monthly service fee summary” section of your statement. Transactions received after the applicable cut-off time or on a non-business day (Saturday, Sunday and federal holidays) are posted on the next business day. 3. A qualifying direct deposit is a direct deposit of your salary, pension, Social Security, or other regular monthly income electronically deposited to this checking account by your employer or an outside agency. Transfers from one account to another, or deposits made at a banking location or ATM, do not qualify as a direct deposit. 4. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the bonus interest rate on all eligible savings accounts, and discounts or fee waivers on other products and services will discontinue and revert to the Bank's then- current applicable rate or fee.  For bonus interest rates on time accounts, this change will occur upon renewal. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the remaining unlinked Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking or Wells Fargo Prime Checking account will be converted to another checking product or closed. 5.  Subject to credit qualification. To qualify for a customer relationship discount, you may be required to maintain a qualifying Wells Fargo consumer checking account and make automatic payments from a Wells Fargo deposit account—if automatic payments are required but not selected, or are canceled for any reason at any time after account opening, the interest rate and the corresponding monthly payment may increase. To learn which accounts qualify for the discount, please consult a Wells Fargo banker. 6. The Portfolio by Wells Fargo program has a $30 monthly service fee, which can be avoided when you have one of the following Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances: $25,000 or more in qualifying linked bank deposits (checking, savings, time accounts (CDs), FDIC insured IRAs), OR $50,000 or more in qualifying linked bank, brokerage (available through our brokerage affiliate Wells Fargo Advisors®) and credit balances (including 10% of mortgage balances, certain mortgages not eligible). 7. Subject to applicable transfer or advance fees. 8. Benefits apply only to the primary Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking account within the Portfolio by Wells Fargo. 9. Surcharge fees imposed by non-Wells Fargo ATM owners or operators may apply. For the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program, Wells Fargo will waive its own ATM access fee (U.S. and international) when you withdraw cash from a non-Wells Fargo ATM from your primary checking account within the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program. Where Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances are $250,000 or more, you will be reimbursed for all surcharge fees on non-Wells Fargo ATM withdrawals located in the U.S., and receive reimbursement for up to 5 surcharge fees imposed by non-Wells Fargo ATM owners or operators per monthly fee period if you use a non-Wells Fargo ATM to make a cash withdrawal at an ATM located outside of the U.S. 10. No fee for Wells Fargo personal checks — except desk checks or home office style (3-on-a-page). Check discounts apply only to the primary Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking account.

Transactions received after the applicable cut-off time or on a non-business day (Saturday, Sunday and federal holidays) are posted on the next business day. 3. A qualifying direct deposit is a direct deposit of your salary, pension, Social Security, or other regular monthly income electronically deposited to this checking account by your employer or an outside agency. Transfers from one account to another, or deposits made at a banking location or ATM, do not qualify as a direct deposit. 4. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the bonus interest rate on all eligible savings accounts, and discounts or fee waivers on other products and services will discontinue and revert to the Bank's then- current applicable rate or fee.  For bonus interest rates on time accounts, this change will occur upon renewal. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the remaining unlinked Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking or Wells Fargo Prime Checking account will be converted to another checking product or closed. 5.  Subject to credit qualification. To qualify for a customer relationship discount, you may be required to maintain a qualifying Wells Fargo consumer checking account and make automatic payments from a Wells Fargo deposit account—if automatic payments are required but not selected, or are canceled for any reason at any time after account opening, the interest rate and the corresponding monthly payment may increase. To learn which accounts qualify for the discount, please consult a Wells Fargo banker. 6. The Portfolio by Wells Fargo program has a $30 monthly service fee, which can be avoided when you have one of the following Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances: $25,000 or more in qualifying linked bank deposits (checking, savings, time accounts (CDs), FDIC insured IRAs), OR $50,000 or more in qualifying linked bank, brokerage (available through our brokerage affiliate Wells Fargo Advisors®) and credit balances (including 10% of mortgage balances, certain mortgages not eligible). 7. Subject to applicable transfer or advance fees. 8. Benefits apply only to the primary Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking account within the Portfolio by Wells Fargo. 9. Surcharge fees imposed by non-Wells Fargo ATM owners or operators may apply. For the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program, Wells Fargo will waive its own ATM access fee (U.S. and international) when you withdraw cash from a non-Wells Fargo ATM from your primary checking account within the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program. Where Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances are $250,000 or more, you will be reimbursed for all surcharge fees on non-Wells Fargo ATM withdrawals located in the U.S., and receive reimbursement for up to 5 surcharge fees imposed by non-Wells Fargo ATM owners or operators per monthly fee period if you use a non-Wells Fargo ATM to make a cash withdrawal at an ATM located outside of the U.S. 10. No fee for Wells Fargo personal checks — except desk checks or home office style (3-on-a-page). Check discounts apply only to the primary Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking account.
