Susan Kropf to Retire From Avon



Published on 2006-03-10. Author :
SpecialChem












 NEW YORK -- Avon Products, Inc. (NYSE: AVP) announced
that Susan J. Kropf, president and chief operating officer, has decided
to retire following a 35-year career during which she advanced to become
the company's number two executive and one of the most prominent executives
in the beauty and direct-selling industries. 
Avon said that Ms. Kropf, age 57, will step down from her duties as president
and chief operating officer effective July 1st and will retire from the
company at the end of 2006. A successor to Ms. Kropf will not be named,
in line with the company's new global operating structure announced in
December 2005, and all business units and support functions will report
directly to Andrea Jung, Avon's chairman and chief executive officer.

Avon also noted that Ms. Kropf will not stand for reelection as a member
of Avon's Board of Directors at the company's annual meeting of shareholders
on May 4th. 
Reflecting on her decision to retire, Ms. Kropf said, "With a new
operating structure in place and progress being made on our business turnaround
plan, I am confident that Avon is now well-positioned to resume sustainable
growth, and that the time is now right for me to act on this personal
decision that I've been considering for some time. 
"Looking back, I am very proud of Avon's extraordinary business
growth over the years, as we have evolved from a smaller, more entrepreneurial
company to a true global business of scale. I am honored to have been
a part of the Avon success story for so many years, and I know I leave
the business in good hands with a talented new generation of leaders who
are committed to Avon's continuing success." 
Andrea Jung, Avon's chairman of the board and chief executive officer,
said, "Susan has made countless important contributions during her
remarkable 35-year career at Avon, which has spanned virtually every area
of the business. For me, Susan has been a trusted business partner and
valued friend, but all who have been privileged to work with her closely
have benefited equally from her strong leadership skills and broad business
perspective." 
Ms. Kropf has held her current position of president and chief operating
officer since January 2001, where she has had day-to-day oversight of
Avon's worldwide operations. Before that, she was executive vice president
and chief operating officer, Avon North America and Global Business Operations,
with responsibility for the company's North American operating business
unit as well as global marketing, R&D, supply chain operations and
information technology. 
In addition to serving on Avon's Board of Directors, Ms. Kropf also serves
on the Boards of MeadWestvaco Corp., Sherwin Williams Co., and the Wallace
Foundation. She is a member of Cosmetic Executive Women and this year
will be honored with CEW's lifetime achievement award. Ms. Kropf has also
been honored by many other organizations, including the March of Dimes,
the YWCA Academy of Women Achievers and the National Council for Research
on Women. 
Avon, the company for women, is a leading global beauty company, with
over $8 billion in annual revenue. As the world's largest direct seller,
Avon markets to women in well over 100 countries through over five million
independent Avon Sales Representatives. Avon's product line includes beauty
products, fashion jewelry and apparel, and features such well-recognized
brand names as Avon Color, Anew, Skin-So-Soft, Avon Solutions, Advance
Techniques, Avon Naturals, Mark, and Avon Wellness.
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR PURPOSES OF THE "SAFE HARBOR" STATEMENT
UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 
Statements in this release that are not historical facts or information
are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as "estimate," "project,"
"plan," "believe," "expect," "anticipate,"
"intend," "planned," "potential" and similar
expressions may identify forward-looking statements. Such forward- looking
statements are based on management's reasonable current assumptions and
expectations. Such forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties
and other factors, which may cause the actual results, levels of activity,
performance or achievement of Avon to be materially different from any
future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements,
and there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially
from management's expectations. Such factors include, among others, the
following: general economic and business conditions in our markets, including
social, economic, political and competitive uncertainties in Latin America,
Asia Pacific, Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East; our ability
to implement our business, cash management and tax strategies and our
multi-year restructuring initiatives and our ability to achieve anticipated
benefits from such initiatives; the possibility of business disruption
in connection with our multi-year restructuring initiatives; our ability
to achieve anticipated cost savings and our profitability and growth targets,
particularly in our largest markets; our ability to implement appropriate
product mix and pricing strategies; the impact of changes in consumer
spending patterns and preferences, particularly given the global nature
of our business; our ability to replace lost sales attributable to the
repositioning of the U.S. Beyond Beauty business; the impact of substantial
currency fluctuations on the results of our foreign operations and the
cost of sourcing foreign products and the success of our foreign currency
hedging and risk management strategies; our ability to implement our Sales
Leadership program globally, to increase Representative productivity and
recruit Representatives; our ability to implement our enterprise resource
planning project; the impact of possible pension funding obligations and
increased pension expense on our cash flow and results of operations;
the impact of stock option expense pursuant to Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123(R); our ability to successfully transition
our business in China in connection with the anticipated resumption of
direct selling in that market; the effect of legal, regulatory and tax
proceedings, as well as restrictions imposed on us, our operations or
our Representatives by foreign governments; the risk of an adverse outcome
in our material pending litigations; our ability to successfully identify
new business opportunities; our access to financing; and our ability to
attract and retain key personnel and executives. Additional information
identifying such factors is contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2004, filed with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to update any such forward-
looking statements.
