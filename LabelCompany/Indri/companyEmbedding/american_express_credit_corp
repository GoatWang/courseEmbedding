*5X on Travel:

               You will get one point for each dollar charged for an eligible purchase on your Platinum Card� or Business Platinum
               Card� from American Express. You will get 4 additional points (for a total of 5 points) for each dollar spent on
               eligible travel purchases. Eligible travel purchases include scheduled flights, prepaid hotels purchases (including The Hotel
               Collection travel packages (flight + hotel packages), minus returns and other credits. Eligible hotel reservations must be
               made on or after 3/30/2017 for additional points. Eligible travel purchases do NOT include FINE HOTELS & RESORTS bookings,
               car or cruise purchases, hotel group reservations or events, ticketing service, cancellation or other fees, interest charges,
               purchases of travelers checks, purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, or purchases of other cash equivalents.
               				
            

               				To be eligible for the 5x Membership Rewards� points, you must both reserve and charge the travel purchase
               with the same eligible Platinum Card� or Business Platinum Card�. To modify a reservation you must cancel
               and rebook your reservation. You can cancel and rebook your reservation on amextravel.com or by calling a representative of
               amextravel.com at 1-800-297-2977. Cancellations are subject to hotel cancellation penalty policies. If hotel reservations
               are made or modified directly with the hotel provider, the reservation will not be eligible for this 5X Membership Rewards�
               point benefit. For Business Platinum Card Members, extra points for air, prepaid hotel, and travel packages will be credited
               to the Membership Rewards account 10-12 weeks after final payment is made. Bonuses you may receive with your Card on other
               purchase categories or in connection with promotions or offers from American Express may not be combined with this benefit.
               Merchants are assigned codes based on what they primarily sell. A purchase will not qualify for additional points if the merchant's
               code is not eligible. The benefits associated with the Additional Card(s) you choose may be different than the benefits associated
               with your basic Card.
               				
            

               				See membershiprewards.com/terms for the Membership Rewards program terms and conditions or to learn the benefits associated
               with the Additional Card(s) you choose, please call the number on the back of your card. American Express Travel Related Services
               Company, Inc., when acting solely as a sales agent for travel suppliers, is not responsible for the actions or inactions or
               such suppliers.
               
            


2X Points:

               Membership Rewards-enrolled Card Members get at least 1 Membership Rewards� point for every eligible dollar spent
               on their Membership Rewards program-enrolled American Express� Card. Those same Card Members will also get at least
               1 additional point for each dollar of eligible travel purchases made on amextravel.com on their Membership Rewards program-enrolled
               American Express Card. Eligible travel purchases include all travel purchases made with your Membership Rewards program-enrolled
               American Express� Card on amextravel.com, including air, prepaid hotels, vacation packages (flight + hotel
               packages) or cruise reservations, minus returns and other credits. Platinum and Business Platinum Card Members are only eligible
               for 1 additional point on cruise reservations. Eligible travel purchases do NOT include car reservations, non-prepaid
               hotels, ticketing service or other fees, or interest charges. Bonuses you may receive with your Card on other purchase categories
               or in connection with promotions or offers from American Express may not be combined with this offer, such as 5X bonuses for
               Platinum and Business Platinum Card Members. Any portion of a charge that you elect to cover through redemption of Membership
               Rewards points is not eligible to receive points. If you have an Amex EveryDay Card product, additional points awarded under
               this offer will not be included in the extra points benefit. Additional points will be credited to the Membership Rewards
               account 10-12 weeks after final payment is made.
               
            


Pay with Points:

               To use Pay with Points, you must charge your eligible purchase through American Express Travel to a Membership Rewards�
               program-enrolled American Express� Card. Eligible purchases exclude car reservations, non-prepaid hotels, and Fine
               Hotels & Resorts
               bookings. Points will be debited from your Membership Rewards account, and credit for corresponding dollar amount will be
               issued to the American Express Card account used. If points redeemed do not cover entire amount, the balance of purchase
               price will remain on the American Express Card account. Minimum redemption 5,000 points.
               
            
See membershiprewards.com/terms for the Membership Rewards
               program terms and conditions.
            

               If a charge for a purchase is included in a Pay Over Time feature balance on your Linked Account (for example, the Extended
               Payment Option), the statement credit associated with that charge may not be applied to that Pay Over Time feature balance.
               Instead
               the statement credit may be applied to your Pay in Full balance. If you believe this has occurred, please contact us by calling
               the number on the back of your Card.
               
            


Lowest Hotel Rate Guaranteed:

               If you book a qualifying prepaid hotel rate on amextravel.com and then find the same room, in the same hotel, for the same dates, the same number of children and adults,
               at a lower price online, before taxes and fees, we'll refund you the difference. Your claim must be
               submitted prior to your stay, before the date of check-in. The "Lowest Rate Guaranteed" policy applies only to online rates
               available to the general public and excludes (1) rates or discounts that are not available to the general public, including,
               but not limited to,
               corporate, group, charter, meeting/convention, AAA, government/military, and senior citizen rates/discounts; or (2) hotel
               rooms booked through or in combination with frequent stay, loyalty, points, coupon promotions, rooms won through contests
               or
               sweepstakes or transferred, or rooms booked on opaque websites that do not allow you to see the name of the hotel until your
               reservation is complete; or (3) promotional packages, all-inclusive packages, or bundles that may include additional amenities
               such as parking, meals, or entertainment, and (4) rates booked through the Fine Hotels & Resorts program.

$200 per year Airline Fee Credit

               Benefit is available to Consumer and Business Platinum Card� and Centurion� Members only. To receive
               statement credits of up to $200 per calendar year toward incidental air travel fees, Card Member must select a qualifying
               airline at 
               www.americanexpress.com/airlinechoice. Only the
               Basic Card Member or Authorized Account Manager(s) on the Card Account can select the qualifying airline. Card Members who
               have not chosen a qualifying airline will be able to do so at any time. Card Members who have
               already selected a qualifying airline will be able to change their choice one time each year in January at www.americanexpress.com/airlinechoice or by calling the number on the back of the Card. Card Members
               who do not change their airline
               selection will remain with their current airline. Statement Credits: Incidental air travel fees must be charged to the Card
               Member on the eligible Card Account for the benefit to apply. Purchases made by both the Basic and Additional Card Members
               on the eligible Card
               Account are eligible for statement credits. However, each Card Account is eligible for up to a total of $200 per calendar
               year in statement credits across all Cards on the Account. Incidental air travel fees must be separate charges from airline
               ticket charges.
               Fees not charged by the Card Member's airline of choice (e.g. wireless internet and fees incurred with airline alliance partners)
               do not qualify for statement credits. Incidental air travel fees charged prior to selection of a qualifying airline are not
               eligible
               for statement credits Airline tickets, upgrades, mileage points purchases, mileage points transfer fees, gift cards, duty
               free purchases, and award tickets are not deemed to be incidental fees. The airline must submit the charge under the appropriate
               merchant
               code, industry code, or required service or product identifier for the charge to be recognized as an incidental air travel
               fee. Please allow 2-4 weeks after the qualifying incidental air travel fee is charged to your Card Account for statement credit(s)
               to be posted to
               the Account. We rely on airlines to submit the correct information on airline transactions, so please call the number on the
               back of the Card if statement credits have not posted after 4 weeks from the date of purchase. Card Members remain responsible
               for timely payment
               of all charges. To be eligible for this benefit, Card Account(s) must be active and not in default at the time of statement
               credit fulfillment. If a charge for any incidental air travel fee is included in a Pay Over Time feature balance on your Card
               Account
               (for example, Sign & Travel), the statement credit associated with that charge will not be applied to that Pay Over Time feature
               balance. Instead, the statement credit will be applied to your Pay In Full balance. For additional information about this
               benefit, call
               the number on the back of your Card.*
               
            

               *American Express relies on accurate airline transaction data to identify incidental fee purchases. If you do not see a credit
               for a qualifying
               incidental purchase on your eligible Card after 4 weeks, simply call the number on the back of your Card. See terms & conditions
               for more details.

                    talented employees taking big risks. What has stayed the same for
                    the last 160 years, is our dedication to outstanding customer

How long does it usually take to transfer funds online?


The best method for transferring funds – and having them available to you as soon as possible – is by initiating the transfer on the website of the bank where the funds are currently held. By doing this, you are pushing funds to the destination bank. The funds should appear in 1 to 3 business days‡ (not including the time it takes to link accounts). If you open a High Yield Savings Account with Personal Savings, the fastest way to transfer your funds out of your Personal Savings account and into a checking account would be by initiating the transfer on the Personal Savings site.
However, if you chose to initiate funds transfer with the bank where you want funds to arrive, you would then be pulling funds. Depending on the destination bank's hold policies, this transfer could take 3 or more business days.‡ If the destination bank is American Express Bank, FSB and you initiated the transfer on the Personal Savings website, then the funds will appear in your account on the 5th business day‡ due to a necessary hold period for due diligence.
