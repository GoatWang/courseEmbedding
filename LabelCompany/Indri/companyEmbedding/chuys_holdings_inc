Chuy’s is a fast-growing, value-driven, full-service restaurant concept offering a distinct menu of authentic, high-quality Mexican food. Founded in Austin, Texas in 1982 by Mike Young and John Zapp, we own and operate more than 80 Chuy’s restaurants across fourteen states. Chuy’s restaurants have a common décor, but each location is unique in format, offering an “unchained” look and feel, as expressed by our motto “If you’ve seen one Chuy’s, you’ve seen one Chuy’s!” Our restaurants have an upbeat, funky, eclectic, somewhat irreverent atmosphere while still maintaining a family-friendly environment. We are committed to providing value to our guests through offering large portions of made-from-scratch, flavorful Tex Mex inspired dishes using fresh, high-quality ingredients. Our employees are a key element of our culture and set the tone for a fun, family-friendly atmosphere with personalized service. We believe the inimitable Chuy’s culture is one of our most valuable assets, and we are committed to preserving and continually investing in our culture and our guests’ restaurant experience.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Rank is comprised of four factors: Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise.
Agreement is the extent to which all earnings estimates are being revised in the same direction. The greater the percentage of estimates moving higher, the better the score will be for this component.
For example: if there are 10 estimate revisions for a given period, and all were up, that would be a 100% positive agreement on the direction of estimate revisions. If 7 were up and 3 were down, that would be a 70% positive agreement. If 7 were down however, with only 3 being up, that would be a 70% negative agreement of the direction of estimate revisions.
The higher the percentage of upward revisions, the better.

The Zacks Rank is comprised of four factors: Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise.
Magnitude is the size of the recent change in the current consensus estimate for the fiscal year and next fiscal year over the last 60 days.
By taking the current earnings estimate and dividing it by the estimate from 60 days ago, you can see what percentage the estimates have changed. For example: if the current estimate is $1.10 and the estimate from 60 days ago was $1.00; that would mean positive 10% increase in the estimate revision.
The larger the percentage increase in estimate revisions, the better.

The Zacks Rank is comprised of four factors: Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise.
Upside is the percentage difference between the most accurate estimate and the consensus estimate.
By dividing the most accurate estimate (as calculated by Zacks) by the consensus estimate, you can see the difference between the two. A positive difference is obviously better than a negative one.
We've quantified the difference between the two estimates with our Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction). Simply put, stocks with a Zacks Rank of 1, 2, or 3, with a positive ESP were shown to positively surprise 70% of the time.

Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) is Zacks' proprietary methodology for determining which stocks have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement.
Read more about this innovative method in the Zacks Earnings ESP Guide See all the top Earnings ESP Stocks.



The Zacks Rank is comprised of four factors: Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise.
The Surprise factor looks at the last few quarters of earnings surprises.
Companies with a positive earnings surprise are more likely to positively surprise in the future (or miss again if they recently missed).
For this reason, looking at a company's recent surprise history can be a great aid in forecasting the surprise likelihood of their next outing.

Chuy's





The original Chuy's on Barton Springs Road in Austin, Texas



Traded as
NASDAQ: CHUY


Founded
1982


Founders
Mike Young / John Zapp


Headquarters
Austin, Texas, U.S.


Website
www.chuys.com


Chuy's is a Tex-Mex restaurant chain established in 1982, by Mike Young and John Zapp.[1] The company currently has 86 locations and 8 locations (Jacksonville, Tampa, Miami, Huntsville, Alphareta, Schaumburg, Belmar, and Pasadena, TX) currently under construction, as of July 2017. Chuy's currently has restaurants in 19 states: Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Texas, Tennessee, Oklahoma, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland, Virginia, Missouri, and Ohio.[2]
Chuy's strives in serving a distinct menu of authentic, made from scratch Tex-Mex inspired dishes. Chuy's highly flavorful and freshly prepared fare is served in a fun, eclectic and irreverent atmosphere. Each location offers a unique, "unchained" look and feel, as expressed by the concept's motto "If you've seen one Chuy's, you've seen one Chuy's!".
Every year on Elvis Presley's birthday, January 8, most locations host the Elvis' Birthday Bash, during which an Elvis impersonator visits the restaurant. Chuy's also annually hosts a Green Chile Festival at its locations, celebrating the harvest of the Hatch Green Chiles from Hatch, New Mexico. In addition, Chuy's is a sponsor of community events such as the Hot To Trot 5K and the Children Giving to Children Holiday Parade.[3]

The original Chuy's on Barton Springs Road in Austin, Texas



Traded as
NASDAQ: CHUY


Founded
1982


Founders
Mike Young / John Zapp


Headquarters
Austin, Texas, U.S.


Website
www.chuys.com


Chuy's is a Tex-Mex restaurant chain established in 1982, by Mike Young and John Zapp.[1] The company currently has 86 locations and 8 locations (Jacksonville, Tampa, Miami, Huntsville, Alphareta, Schaumburg, Belmar, and Pasadena, TX) currently under construction, as of July 2017. Chuy's currently has restaurants in 19 states: Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Texas, Tennessee, Oklahoma, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland, Virginia, Missouri, and Ohio.[2]
Chuy's strives in serving a distinct menu of authentic, made from scratch Tex-Mex inspired dishes. Chuy's highly flavorful and freshly prepared fare is served in a fun, eclectic and irreverent atmosphere. Each location offers a unique, "unchained" look and feel, as expressed by the concept's motto "If you've seen one Chuy's, you've seen one Chuy's!".
Every year on Elvis Presley's birthday, January 8, most locations host the Elvis' Birthday Bash, during which an Elvis impersonator visits the restaurant. Chuy's also annually hosts a Green Chile Festival at its locations, celebrating the harvest of the Hatch Green Chiles from Hatch, New Mexico. In addition, Chuy's is a sponsor of community events such as the Hot To Trot 5K and the Children Giving to Children Holiday Parade.[3]
