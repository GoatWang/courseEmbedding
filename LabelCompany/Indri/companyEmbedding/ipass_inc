Intelligent Connectivity
Global mobile connectivity technology that keeps people and things securely and invisibly connected to the best network available 






The World Runs on Connectivity
We all need to be connected. We depend on it. When we lose connectivity, things break down. iPass global mobile connectivity software helps enterprises, mobile operators, and brands keep employees, customers and the internet of things securely and invisibly connected to the best network for their needs, whether at work, on the move or in the air.







The Best Mobile Experience
It all starts with our iPass SmartConnect™ cloud-based platform, which uses intelligent network selection to choose the best network for the user’s needs, based on availability, performance, and cost. iPass SmartConnect technology creates smooth transitions between Wi-Fi hotspots and between Wi-Fi and cellular, keeping end users more productive, satisfied, and sticky.






The World’s Largest Wi-Fi Network
With more than 61 million hotspots in more than 120 countries and inflight Wi-Fi on more than 20 leading airlines, iPass delivers simple, secure, unlimited Wi-Fi access for people, devices and things. We’ve built our global network from partnerships with more than 160 of the world’s best networks, and iPass SmartConnect helps us grow faster and smarter, by identifying and curating open hotspots.






Mobile Device Analytics and Big Data
As iPass users connect to Wi-Fi, iPass SmartConnect identifies hotspot locations and scores them based on factors such as signal strength, speed, bandwidth and connection success rate. iPass SmartConnect continuously improves its knowledge of Wi-Fi and cellular, so we can offer the best hotspots in real time, blacklist those that don’t perform, and connect to cellular when Wi-Fi isn’t available, resulting in highly reliable connections. We make our data available with our Veri-Fi™ offering, allowing customers to gain insight into user behavior and enabling a range of applications.

History[edit]
iPass was founded in January 1996 by Chris Moore.[3][4] Moore was replaced by Michael H. Mansouri, who took the position of Chairman, President and CEO in 1999, serving until 2001.[5] Kenneth Denman succeeded Mansouri as President and CEO in 2001, later assuming the position of Chairman in 2003.[6]
In July 2003, the firm successfully issued its IPO, raising over $100 million.[7][8]
In 2004, the firm launched a policy orchestration initiative to integrate patch management, assessment and remediation of remote and mobile computers into its connectivity platform.[9] In pursuing this initiative, iPass acquired two companies in 2004: Safe3w, which developed patented dynamic device “fingerprinting” technology, and Mobile Automation, which specialized in mobile device management.[10]
Two years later, iPass acquired GoRemote Internet Communications, a former rival in the corporate remote access market.[11][12] In the midst of these acquisitions, iPass recorded year-end revenue growth, despite declining revenues from the company’s traditional dial-up business.[13] Overall, total revenues grew to $192 million by the end of 2007.[14][15]
In 2008, the company appointed Evan Kaplan as CEO and President to replace Denman.[16] During Kaplan's tenure, the firm began to build a service delivery platform for its new enterprise mobility services. By January 2010, the company delivered the first version of its cloud-based platform, iPass Open Mobile.[17]
2015 ushered in a change in the firm’ executive team, beginning with the appointment of Gary Griffiths to the position of CEO and President.[18] Griffiths and his newly appointed Chief Commercial Officer, Patricia Hume, pursued a new growth strategy for mobile services, launching iPass Unlimited, a per-user, per-month, fixed fee subscription for unlimited Wi-Fi usage.[19] The firm also expanded of its network of global hotspots by 2015 from 18 million to 50 million.[20] The company also undertook enhancements to its products and applications. In November 2015, the firm announced proprietary technology, iPass SmartConnect.[21]
Products and services[edit]
iPass is a cloud-based service manager that connects users and devices to the company’s global Wi-Fi footprint. In its simplest form, it is an application, downloaded by service users to laptops, tablets, or smartphones, to identify and connect to the system's hotspots. It is compatible with Automatic Credential Assignment.
Derived from the company’s connectivity intellectual property, the app is powered by iPass SmartConnect, iPass’ Wi-Fi service platform, which identifies and rates access points based on factors such as signal strength, speed, bandwidth availability, and connection success rate. The app also incorporates Last Mile VPN security, profile settings, Wi-Fi connectivity, and network curation to expand the network of available hotspots.
The platform also includes a proprietary scalable reporting and transaction clearing back-end.
Technology infrastructure[edit]
The company has a global authentication fabric of integrated servers and software, interconnected with over 160 distinct global Wi-Fi networks. This infrastructure gives the company’s aggregated hotspots the look and feel of iPass hotspots. With the addition of iPass SmartConnect, the architecture now opens avenues for improving connection success, real-time monitoring of network outages, and least-cost network routing .
Wi-Fi network[edit]
iPass has a Wi-Fi network footprint and supply chain that consists of approximately 50 million hotspots in over 100 countries, including major airports, convention centers, planes, trains, train stations, hotels, restaurants, retail, and small business locations.[22] This network footprint includes millions of community and free hotspots.

History[edit]
iPass was founded in January 1996 by Chris Moore.[3][4] Moore was replaced by Michael H. Mansouri, who took the position of Chairman, President and CEO in 1999, serving until 2001.[5] Kenneth Denman succeeded Mansouri as President and CEO in 2001, later assuming the position of Chairman in 2003.[6]
In July 2003, the firm successfully issued its IPO, raising over $100 million.[7][8]
In 2004, the firm launched a policy orchestration initiative to integrate patch management, assessment and remediation of remote and mobile computers into its connectivity platform.[9] In pursuing this initiative, iPass acquired two companies in 2004: Safe3w, which developed patented dynamic device “fingerprinting” technology, and Mobile Automation, which specialized in mobile device management.[10]
Two years later, iPass acquired GoRemote Internet Communications, a former rival in the corporate remote access market.[11][12] In the midst of these acquisitions, iPass recorded year-end revenue growth, despite declining revenues from the company’s traditional dial-up business.[13] Overall, total revenues grew to $192 million by the end of 2007.[14][15]
In 2008, the company appointed Evan Kaplan as CEO and President to replace Denman.[16] During Kaplan's tenure, the firm began to build a service delivery platform for its new enterprise mobility services. By January 2010, the company delivered the first version of its cloud-based platform, iPass Open Mobile.[17]
2015 ushered in a change in the firm’ executive team, beginning with the appointment of Gary Griffiths to the position of CEO and President.[18] Griffiths and his newly appointed Chief Commercial Officer, Patricia Hume, pursued a new growth strategy for mobile services, launching iPass Unlimited, a per-user, per-month, fixed fee subscription for unlimited Wi-Fi usage.[19] The firm also expanded of its network of global hotspots by 2015 from 18 million to 50 million.[20] The company also undertook enhancements to its products and applications. In November 2015, the firm announced proprietary technology, iPass SmartConnect.[21]
Products and services[edit]
iPass is a cloud-based service manager that connects users and devices to the company’s global Wi-Fi footprint. In its simplest form, it is an application, downloaded by service users to laptops, tablets, or smartphones, to identify and connect to the system's hotspots. It is compatible with Automatic Credential Assignment.
Derived from the company’s connectivity intellectual property, the app is powered by iPass SmartConnect, iPass’ Wi-Fi service platform, which identifies and rates access points based on factors such as signal strength, speed, bandwidth availability, and connection success rate. The app also incorporates Last Mile VPN security, profile settings, Wi-Fi connectivity, and network curation to expand the network of available hotspots.
The platform also includes a proprietary scalable reporting and transaction clearing back-end.
Technology infrastructure[edit]
The company has a global authentication fabric of integrated servers and software, interconnected with over 160 distinct global Wi-Fi networks. This infrastructure gives the company’s aggregated hotspots the look and feel of iPass hotspots. With the addition of iPass SmartConnect, the architecture now opens avenues for improving connection success, real-time monitoring of network outages, and least-cost network routing .
Wi-Fi network[edit]
iPass has a Wi-Fi network footprint and supply chain that consists of approximately 50 million hotspots in over 100 countries, including major airports, convention centers, planes, trains, train stations, hotels, restaurants, retail, and small business locations.[22] This network footprint includes millions of community and free hotspots.

Intelligent Connectivity
Global mobile connectivity technology that keeps people and things securely and invisibly connected to the best network available 






The World Runs on Connectivity
We all need to be connected. We depend on it. When we lose connectivity, things break down. iPass global mobile connectivity software helps enterprises, mobile operators, and brands keep employees, customers and the internet of things securely and invisibly connected to the best network for their needs, whether at work, on the move or in the air.







The Best Mobile Experience
It all starts with our iPass SmartConnect™ cloud-based platform, which uses intelligent network selection to choose the best network for the user’s needs, based on availability, performance, and cost. iPass SmartConnect technology creates smooth transitions between Wi-Fi hotspots and between Wi-Fi and cellular, keeping end users more productive, satisfied, and sticky.






The World’s Largest Wi-Fi Network
With more than 61 million hotspots in more than 120 countries and inflight Wi-Fi on more than 20 leading airlines, iPass delivers simple, secure, unlimited Wi-Fi access for people, devices and things. We’ve built our global network from partnerships with more than 160 of the world’s best networks, and iPass SmartConnect helps us grow faster and smarter, by identifying and curating open hotspots.






Mobile Device Analytics and Big Data
As iPass users connect to Wi-Fi, iPass SmartConnect identifies hotspot locations and scores them based on factors such as signal strength, speed, bandwidth and connection success rate. iPass SmartConnect continuously improves its knowledge of Wi-Fi and cellular, so we can offer the best hotspots in real time, blacklist those that don’t perform, and connect to cellular when Wi-Fi isn’t available, resulting in highly reliable connections. We make our data available with our Veri-Fi™ offering, allowing customers to gain insight into user behavior and enabling a range of applications.
