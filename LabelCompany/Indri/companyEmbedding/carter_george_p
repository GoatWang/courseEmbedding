			George P. Carter, age 80, is the former President of Connecticut Foods, Inc. Mr. Carter was first elected to the board in 1976. He serves as our non-executive chairman, and also currently serves as chairman of the Audit Committee and as a member of the Compensation, Nominating and Governance and the Enterprise Risk Committees, and the Bank's Loan Review Committee. Effective as of the April 20, 2017 committee meetings, Mr. Carter will no longer serve as chairman of the Audit Committee, but will remain a member of such committee. 

Mr. Carter has significant experience as a member of both the board of directors and the audit committee of a financial services company, having served as a member of the Bank's board of directors since 1976 and as a member of its audit committee since 1981. He became Chairman of the Bank's audit committee in 1987 and chairman of the Audit Committee of People's United at the time of its formation in 2007. Mr. Carter is a graduate of Michigan State University, with a BS in business and has been a business owner since 1969. He is active in community and philanthropic affairs and serves as a member of the board of directors of The People's United Community Foundation and of Bridgeport Hospital. 

In considering Mr. Carter's contributions to the board and his skills and qualifications for board service, the board noted that over his more than 35 years of board service Mr. Carter has developed a level of expertise in banking matters and an in-depth familiarity with People's United and our various businesses that enhance his contributions to the board. The board also cited the benefit to the board's deliberative process provided by Mr. Carter's long-term perspective, noting that Mr. Carter has been a member of the board throughout a number of business cycles. If re-elected as a director, it is anticipated that Mr. Carter will serve as a director until the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders pursuant to the waiver discussed above under the section Corporate Governance-Board Leadership Structure.

Top record matches for George P Carter






Surname meaning for "Carter"
English: occupational name for a transporter of goods, Middle
English cartere, from an agent derivative of Middle English
cart(e) or from Anglo-Norman French car(e)tier, a
derivative of Old French caret (see Cartier). The Old
French word coalesced with the earlier Middle English word
cart(e) ‘cart’, which is from either Old Norse kartr or
Old English cræt, both of which, like the Late Latin word,
were probably originally derived from Celtic.

The Boomer & George Carter Indoor Rabbit Hutch is great for any rabbit, and especially one whose owner has mid-century modern sensibilities.

A great place for any rabbit to call home!

Ranking the Presidents by G.D.P.


				By Floyd Norris			
July 29, 2011 5:09 pm
July 29, 2011 5:09 pm



The revised G.D.P. numbers damage the economic growth numbers for Obama and the George W. Bush administrations.  
There is an element of unfairness in attributing economic growth to a president, of course.  The government has limited influence on the economy, and the president can have limited influence on government policy, as anyone watching the current debate in Washington has surely noticed.  Normal economic cycles mean that growth is likely to be less impressive for a president who enters office at the end of a boom, as George W. Bush did, and better for one who enters when growth is weak, as Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan did. If normal cyclical factors return, and President Obama has a second term, his record should end up much better than it currently appears. If he loses, he could be like Gerald Ford, who also took office during a deep recession. 
With all those caveats, here are the annualized growth rates for real G.D.P. for every president who took office after the end of World War II.
Each president is given credit for growth through the quarter before he left office. For those who left at the end of their terms, that would be the fourth quarter of the election year. For Richard M. Nixon, who resigned during the third quarter of 1974, it is through the second quarter of that year.
Also shown are the figures for Presidents Bush and Obama that would have appeared had the numbers been calculated before today’s announcement of second quarter data and revisions to earlier numbers. 
They are listed in reverse order of growth.
Barack Obama, 1.2% annual G.D.P. growth rate (previously 1.5%)
George W. Bush, 1.6% (previously 1.7%)
George H.W. Bush, 2.1%
Gerald Ford, 2.2%
Dwight Eisenhower, 2.5%
Richard Nixon, 3.0%
Jimmy Carter, 3.2%
Ronald Reagan, 3.5%
Bill Clinton, 3.8%
Lyndon B. Johnson, 5.0%
John F. Kennedy, 5.4%

 History of the Hair Care Kit:  Dr. Austin W. Curtis (Baby Carver) Creation
 
 












   Hair Care Kit     EK'Selant Labels


First products of Dr. Austin W. Curtis from Curtis Labs
 
The people of Detroit are well familiar with the Dr. Austin W. Curtis line products.  They are well aware of the EK'Selant products that made up the Hair Care Kit of yesterday.  The people of Detroit can rest ashore and be relieved that the EK'Selant line of products never went away.  You can still purchase these wonderful products again under a new name and label.   It is now being sold under the new name and eye catching labels called Legends 4Ever.  Dr. Curtis created the hair care kit by using the peanut oil technology developed by George Washington Carver.   Dr. Austin Curtis learned everything about the peanut from George Washington Carver's as his assistant during the last eight years of George Washington Carver's life.  As a matter of fact, Dr. Curtis nickname was baby Carver because people reminded him of Dr. George Washington Carver.  The Hair Care Kit was developed and sold under Curtis Labs, the company that Dr. Curtis started after George Washington Carver died in 1943.  Curtis Labs became the largest Black manufacturing company of hair care products in the United States for years.  Dr. Curtis sold his company in 2000 before making the transition to the ancestors in 2003.  Dr. Faye Williams, Elements 4 Nature partners now owns Dr. Curtis old company.  However she changed the name from Curtis Labs to Natural Health Options (NHO).  Dr. Faye Williams gave Elements 4 Nature permission to design the new labels for the EK'Selant Hair Care Kit.  Legends 4Ever (L4E) labels are store ready and E4N is working to get the Legends 4Ever Hair Care Kit into stores nationally and internationally.
 
                                                                                       
 
 
 
 
 










        Dr. Austin W. Curtis  

Dr. Curtis created the Reconstruction Hair Care Kit
 
Elements 4 Nature re-vamped all the old EK'Selant labels to make it more store ready.  The Legends 4Ever products are the same products that Dr. Curtis sold at Curtis Labs under the name EK'Selant.  Dr. Austin Curtis used the knowledge that he attained from working with Dr. George Washington Carver to created the Hair Care Kit.  E4N intentionally put Dr. George Washington Carver picture on our new Legends 4Ever labels to show that these products created by Dr. Austin W. Curtis were heavily influenced by Dr. George Washington Carver.
