What we do:
We provide financing to companies seeking money for:

Growth
Acquisition
Re-structure

Over the past 20 years, Lawrence Financial has supplied an average of $30 million per month of funding, working with hundreds of companies in virtually every industry.
How we are different:
We have a track record of success working with difficult and highly complex situations.
We have close relationships with hundreds of funding sources, including commercial banks, hedge funds, asset-based lenders and a wide range of other sources.
We explore every resource to obtain the funds you need, from receivables, inventory and purchase orders, to equipment, real estate, lease values and intellectual property such as trademarks and patents.
We don't require exclusivity. You are free to "shop" our term sheets to other lenders, to be sure you are getting the best loan available.
We respond quickly and clearly. We know you want straight answers, fast, and that's what we give you.
How to get started:
Let us give you a "no obligation" analysis of your existing loan structure, and of your financing needs.
If there are better options available to you, we will help you find them.
And if your existing arrangements are the best fit for you, we'll tell you so!
Contact us at 310.260.4700 or LNHurwitz@LawrenceFinancial.com.

Experience
Mr. Hurwitz has served as CEO of Lawrence Financial Group (LFG) since its founding in Los Angeles in 1990. Since that time, Lawrence Financial has arranged more than $7 billion in financing, for companies with annual revenues ranging from $3 million to $1 billion, in a wide range of industries.
Lawrence Financial has arranged financing through commercial banks, asset-based lenders, factors, mezzanine lenders, hedge funds, individuals and other sources. 
Prior to establishing LFG, Mr. Hurwitz served as CEO of Country Junction, a family-owned clothing retailer. In 1972, when he became CEO, the firm operated three stores with sales of $3 million. He eventually built the firm to 150 stores located in 17 states, with annual sales of $80 million, and then oversaw its sale.
Mr. Hurwitz also spent a number of years on Wall Street, becoming the youngest member of the New York Stock Exchange and CEO of a member firm broker dealer.
He did his undergraduate work at the University of Texas and earned an MBA with Distinction from Harvard Business School. Subsequently he was admitted into Harvard's doctoral program, and received an appointment to its teaching and research staff.
Mr. Hurwitz is an active participant in the business community of Southern California. He established the California Capital Summit; was a co-founder of Business Forum International; is the founder and group leader of the Provisors Capital Markets Affinity Group;  is a member of the Executive Committee of the Provisors Mergers & Acquisitions Group; and organized the CEO Round Table of the Harvard Business School Association of Orange County.

Why Use Lawrence Financial?
If your company has hit a rough patch... is in turnaround mode... is growing faster than your cash can support... has exhausted its bank lines... or been unable to work with your existing lenders - let us help.
Even if you have a strong balance sheet and a good relationship with your bank, let us do a no-obligation review to see if we can find you a better deal.
Lawrence Financial has arranged debt financings for companies of all sizes, with annual sales from $3 million to $1 billion. 
We've worked with manufacturers, wholesalers and service companies, who provide everything from sophisticated avionics or legal services to golf clubs and garden plants.
Our goal is to find you the financing you need, at the lowest cost and best terms available for your situation.
The single most important factor in this process is to match the borrower with the lender. 
Today the debt marketplace is more turbulent than ever. Banks change their lending policies almost daily. Other financing sources move in and out of the market, or shift their industry focus, risk profile or responsiveness. 
In today's fast-changing environment, a borrower cannot possibly know the most appropriate - and most cost-effective - lender.
But we can. Lawrence Financial is in continuous contact with many financing sources, including traditional as well as innovative or unconventional lenders. 
Many of our sources are money wholesalers who depend upon sophisticated financial intermediaries such as Lawrence Financial to bring them financing clients.
Our wide relationships and deep knowledge of the market enables us to quickly assemble a list of lenders who are realistic candidates to provide you financing, and who can act quickly enough to fit your timeframe.

There's an advantage in working with a financial advisor who knows you – and your financial goals. That's what makes Edward Jones different from other investment firms. Supporting the relationship between you and your financial advisor shapes nearly every aspect of our business.
You may have seen one of our 12,000 offices in your community. That's because we believe you deserve more than a 1-800 number when it comes to your financial future.
What you may not know is that we're a Fortune 500 company with thousands of associates and sophisticated technology supporting your local financial advisor.
The Edward Jones approach in determining your goals, and developing tailored financial strategies, has been helping nearly 7 million clients for more than 90 years.
In fact, we like to think we became one of the largest financial services firms in the country by not acting that way. If you're ready to work with a different kind of investment firm—one that cares as much about why you're investing as what you invest in— you're ready to work with Edward Jones.

These are important goals and you need an advocate – someone who listens and really understands what's important to you. We believe that's the best way to develop a personalized financial strategy.

Are We Right for You?






Understands Me
I want to work with a financial advisor who really gets to know me and my family, our goals and what’s important to us.







Clearly Explains Investing
I’m looking for a financial advisor who will spend time educating me on investment topics and answering my questions.







Knows My Investment Style
I want someone who makes recommendations in my best interest and explains how they can help me make progress towards my goals.







Meets on My Schedule
Meeting with my financial advisor should be convenient. And I want choices – whether that means meeting in person or over the phone.







Stays in Touch
I want my financial advisor to contact me to reassure me that I’m on the right track or make suggestions if I’m not. Even if I’m not expecting it.







Edward Jones & You
If these sound like qualities you’re looking for in a financial advisor, Edward Jones might be right for you.

Focus On You

Focus On You




Every investment firm has principles. And they usually sound exactly the same. We believe Edward Jones is different in almost every way. Our principles were deliberately created with you in mind. We don't just talk about personal service. We're built to deliver it.
Your dedicated financial advisor – It's your financial future, so an 800-number or Internet search for financial advice doesn't cut it. You have a relationship with an Edward Jones financial advisor, who spends time to learn why you're investing and then develops a personalized strategy. No cookie-cutter plans here.
In your neighborhood – With more than 15,000 financial advisors, you shouldn't have to go far to find an Edward Jones office in your community. That means you can actually meet with a financial advisor to discuss what's important to you.
Tailored for individual investors - All of our resources – including investment research, online account access, easy-to-understand statements, sophisticated software and detailed reports – are developed with you in mind.
Experienced support team - Backing up this personal service is a Fortune 500 company with thousands of people and advanced technology. Your financial advisor uses these resources to develop the best strategy for you.
We spend the time and have the knowledge to help you sort through complicated financial questions. Most financial services firms claim to focus on you and your needs, but can they really do it? We believe Edward Jones is uniquely positioned from the ground up to provide the attention, respect and service you deserve.

Prepare for Your First Appointment 
Learn more



Prepare for Your First Appointment 




We're honored that you're considering working with us to help achieve your financial goals. Here are three ways you can prepare our first meeting.


Think about why you're investing
Understanding the "why" will help you be better prepared to discuss your goals and strategies to help reach them. What's important to you and your family? What do you want to achieve?


Gather your statements
If you've worked with a financial advisor before, it's helpful to know about your current investments and your experience to date. If you're new to the investing world, we promise to talk with you, not at you. Our goal is to empower you with the knowledge you'll need to pursue your goals.


Bring your questions
We want to make sure to answer any investment questions you may have, as well as how we can best work together. What do you expect? How often do you want to touch base?

Invested in the Community






We are invested in our community
We value the communities where we work, so we're committed to giving back. You'll find our associates serving clients in our offices, but you'll also find us investing our time and talents to support local organizations and great causes. Many Financial Advisors are on Chambers of Commerce and serve as board members and event coordinators for local organizations, and our associates volunteer, donate and support a variety of charitable organizations.







Tour De Ted
Each year, branch and Home Office associates take to the road to raise funds for cancer research for the firm's annual Tour de Ted. In memory of Ted Jones, former managing partner who died from cancer, the first Tour de Ted showcased the firm's community-oriented culture while paying tribute to the history of Edward Jones. Volunteers rode the path of the original "wire" that connected Pueblo, Colo., to St. Louis, Mo., which created our branch network.







Emergency Assistance
Sixteen Financial Advisors in Texas decided to set aside one day out of their busy schedules to give back to their community. They volunteered at the Montgomery County Emergency Assistance facility by painting offices and hallways, and sorting and tagging clothes.







School Supply Drive
Eight local Edward Jones Financial Advisors teamed up on behalf of school children, clearly demonstrating their commitment to family values. Their school supply drive brought in hundreds of classroom necessities, from notebooks and markers to tissues and cleaning wipes.







Habitat for Humanity
When investors wanted to save for a new home, Edward Jones was there to help. Associates from Ontario, Canada, helped a local family reach its goal of home ownership in another way when they came together for the Habitat for Humanity build in Amherstburg, Ont., the first such home built in this community.







Pedal the Cause
We're proud of our associates who joined the fight against cancer as Edward Jones Pedal the Cause riders. More than 200 bike riders from across the U.S. took to the streets (and the Katy Trail) to help fundraise for cancer research.







Walk to End Alzheimer's®
At Edward Jones, we live and work in the communities we serve. We want to make a difference in people’s lives, both in and out of the office. Alzheimer’s disease has a significant impact on individuals, family, friends and community. That’s why we’ve chosen to partner with the Alzheimer’s Association as the National Presenting Sponsor of the Walk to End Alzheimer’s®. We invite you to join us in the fight to end this terrible disease.

What we do:
We provide financing to companies seeking money for:

Growth
Acquisition
Re-structure

Over the past 20 years, Lawrence Financial has supplied an average of $30 million per month of funding, working with hundreds of companies in virtually every industry.
How we are different:
We have a track record of success working with difficult and highly complex situations.
We have close relationships with hundreds of funding sources, including commercial banks, hedge funds, asset-based lenders and a wide range of other sources.
We explore every resource to obtain the funds you need, from receivables, inventory and purchase orders, to equipment, real estate, lease values and intellectual property such as trademarks and patents.
We don't require exclusivity. You are free to "shop" our term sheets to other lenders, to be sure you are getting the best loan available.
We respond quickly and clearly. We know you want straight answers, fast, and that's what we give you.
How to get started:
Let us give you a "no obligation" analysis of your existing loan structure, and of your financing needs.
If there are better options available to you, we will help you find them.
And if your existing arrangements are the best fit for you, we'll tell you so!
Contact us at 310.260.4700 or LNHurwitz@LawrenceFinancial.com.
