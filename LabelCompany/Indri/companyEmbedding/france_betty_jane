Early life[edit]
France was born in Washington, D.C., to Anne Bledsoe and William Henry Getty France. His family moved to Daytona Beach, Florida in 1935 to escape the Great Depression.[1] He attended Seabreeze High School before attending the University of Florida. He served for two years in the United States Navy before turning to a career in racing.[2]
France grew up helping at race tracks; he sold concessions and helped park cars at the Daytona Beach Road Course. He worked twelve hours per day, seven days a week for thirteen months with the construction of Daytona International Speedway, where he drove a compactor, bulldozer, and grader. He once tried using a mule to pull trees out of the swamp because motorized equipment was getting stuck.[3]
He rode off-road motorcycles, and began competing in enduros in the 1960s. France entered the Baja 1000 in the motorcycle division in the early 1970s. He gave the up-and-coming sport of motocross a chance at Daytona in the early 1970s. The motocross races started with little fanfare, but grew into the popular Daytona Supercross. The supercross inspired the Daytona Beach Bike Week.[3]
Career[edit]
After serving as vice-president for six years, he became the head of NASCAR when his father Bill France Sr. retired on January 10, 1972.[2] The International Motorsports Hall of Fame describes the transition: "Other than the founding of NASCAR itself, Bill Jr.'s appointment to leadership is probably the most significant event in the history of the sanctioning body." [4] NASCAR went from a Southern regional sport to a national sport during his tenure.[4]
France Jr. was instrumental in taking the sport outside of its traditional American base. In 1981 he struck a deal with multimillion-dollar Australian tire retailer and retired racer Bob Jane to take stock car racing to Australia and plans were laid out for a high-banked speedway at the Jane owned Calder Park Raceway in Melbourne. The 1.119 mi (1.801 km) Calder Park Thunderdome, the first high-banked NASCAR style speedway built outside of North America, was built at a cost of A$54 million and was opened in 1987. The new track, modelled on a scaled down version of the Charlotte Motor Speedway, including mimicking its 24° banked turns, held its first NASCAR race, the Goodyear NASCAR 500 (for 500 km) on February 28, 1988 and was won by Alabama Gang member Neil Bonnet driving a Pontiac Grand Prix. Although only an exhibition race, this was also the first NASCAR race held outside of North America. Jane became the head of the sanctioning body for stock car racing in Australia known as Australian Stock Car Auto Racing (AUSCAR), though a falling out between him and France in 1991 saw NASCAR withdraw its support for Jane and his track. NASCAR racing in Australia continued to be sanctioned by Jane until the series folded in 2001.
He continued his father's legacy by fostering growth of the Daytona 500 stock car race and Daytona 200 motorcycle race at Daytona International Speedway. The Winston Million program was launched by R.J. Reynolds in 1985. A $1 million bonus was awarded to any driver who could win three of four preselected races.[citation needed]
NASCAR's Grand National series was renamed Winston Cup (now Monster Energy Cup) in 1973. The points fund increased from $750,000 to $2 million. The champions portion of the points fund rose to $2 million by 1998.[5]
NASCAR had few televised races in 1972. Those races that did air in the 1970s were mixed into shows like ABC Wide World of Sports.[6] France signed a deal with CBS Sports' president Neal Pilson to televise the 1979 Daytona 500 from flag to flag. The race was the first live flag to flag national coverage of a NASCAR race. The race got high television ratings, partly due to a snowstorm in the Midwest and Northeast. Richard Petty won the race after race leaders Donnie Allison and Cale Yarborough crashed together on the final lap. Allison's brother Bobby Allison stopped, and Bobby Allison and Yarborough then exchanged punches. The ratings and ensuing press coverage helped France to sign television contracts with ESPN in 1980, TNN in 1990, and TBS. France's career culminated in a record-setting $2.4 billion television broadcasting contract in 1999 for the 2001 season.[4]
France was a delegate from Florida to the 1972 Democratic National Convention and supported the candidacy of George Wallace, who had won the Florida Democratic presidential preference primary that year.[citation needed]
In 1993, France's employees told him about six-year-old Ohio leukemia patient Sarah Ashley Secoy. He called her father and pledged to make her struggle and international marrow donor search a global news story. His efforts made her a radio and TV news story. He also helped fund "Sarah's Song", a duet recorded with her father that France promoted to tens of thousands of radio stations globally. Millions were thus raised to pay for her six-year hospital fight inside a germ free chamber. Her genetic match donor was found. She became the first patient ever to survive acute myeloid leukemia thus leading to an all new global treatment concept for several deadly childhood cancers that has now saved thousands of children's lives.[citation needed]
Later life[edit]
France turned the presidency of NASCAR over to Mike Helton in 2000 after being diagnosed with cancer. He made his son Brian France the CEO and chairman of NASCAR in 2003. Bill France Jr. remained a member of the six-person NASCAR board of directors.
The France family continues to own NASCAR outright, and has a controlling interest in race track operator International Speedway Corporation. France Jr. continued as chairman of the board of ISC, until his death. His daughter Lesa France Kennedy is ISC's president.[7]
France died of lung cancer in Daytona Beach, Florida, on June 4, 2007 at about 1:00 pm. His death occurred during the rain-delayed Autism Speaks 400 Cup race, and his death was reported during the live broadcast of the race at lap 261. NASCAR on Fox lead announcer Mike Joy held a moment of "silence" during a restart around lap 270, and the track's flag was lowered to half staff.

France's career culminated in a record-setting $2.4 billion television broadcasting contract in 1999 for the 2001 season.[4]
France was a delegate from Florida to the 1972 Democratic National Convention and supported the candidacy of George Wallace, who had won the Florida Democratic presidential preference primary that year.[citation needed]
In 1993, France's employees told him about six-year-old Ohio leukemia patient Sarah Ashley Secoy. He called her father and pledged to make her struggle and international marrow donor search a global news story. His efforts made her a radio and TV news story. He also helped fund "Sarah's Song", a duet recorded with her father that France promoted to tens of thousands of radio stations globally. Millions were thus raised to pay for her six-year hospital fight inside a germ free chamber. Her genetic match donor was found. She became the first patient ever to survive acute myeloid leukemia thus leading to an all new global treatment concept for several deadly childhood cancers that has now saved thousands of children's lives.[citation needed]
Later life[edit]
France turned the presidency of NASCAR over to Mike Helton in 2000 after being diagnosed with cancer. He made his son Brian France the CEO and chairman of NASCAR in 2003. Bill France Jr. remained a member of the six-person NASCAR board of directors.
The France family continues to own NASCAR outright, and has a controlling interest in race track operator International Speedway Corporation. France Jr. continued as chairman of the board of ISC, until his death. His daughter Lesa France Kennedy is ISC's president.[7]
France died of lung cancer in Daytona Beach, Florida, on June 4, 2007 at about 1:00 pm. His death occurred during the rain-delayed Autism Speaks 400 Cup race, and his death was reported during the live broadcast of the race at lap 261. NASCAR on Fox lead announcer Mike Joy held a moment of "silence" during a restart around lap 270, and the track's flag was lowered to half staff.

William Clifton "Bill" France (April 4, 1933 -- June 4, 2007), nicknamed, "Bill France Jr." or "Little Billy", was an American motorsports executive who served from 1972 to 2000 as the chief executive officer (CEO) of NASCAR, the sanctioning body of the US-based stock car racing. He succeeded his father, NASCAR founder Bill France Sr. as its CEO. His son, Brian France, has been CEO since 2003.

Early life[edit]
France was born in Washington, D.C., to Anne Bledsoe and William Henry Getty France. His family moved to Daytona Beach, Florida in 1935 to escape the Great Depression.[1] He attended Seabreeze High School before attending the University of Florida. He served for two years in the United States Navy before turning to a career in racing.[2]
France grew up helping at race tracks; he sold concessions and helped park cars at the Daytona Beach Road Course. He worked twelve hours per day, seven days a week for thirteen months with the construction of Daytona International Speedway, where he drove a compactor, bulldozer, and grader. He once tried using a mule to pull trees out of the swamp because motorized equipment was getting stuck.[3]
He rode off-road motorcycles, and began competing in enduros in the 1960s. France entered the Baja 1000 in the motorcycle division in the early 1970s. He gave the up-and-coming sport of motocross a chance at Daytona in the early 1970s. The motocross races started with little fanfare, but grew into the popular Daytona Supercross. The supercross inspired the Daytona Beach Bike Week.[3]
Career[edit]
After serving as vice-president for six years, he became the head of NASCAR when his father Bill France Sr. retired on January 10, 1972.[2] The International Motorsports Hall of Fame describes the transition: "Other than the founding of NASCAR itself, Bill Jr.'s appointment to leadership is probably the most significant event in the history of the sanctioning body." [4] NASCAR went from a Southern regional sport to a national sport during his tenure.[4]
France Jr. was instrumental in taking the sport outside of its traditional American base. In 1981 he struck a deal with multimillion-dollar Australian tire retailer and retired racer Bob Jane to take stock car racing to Australia and plans were laid out for a high-banked speedway at the Jane owned Calder Park Raceway in Melbourne. The 1.119 mi (1.801 km) Calder Park Thunderdome, the first high-banked NASCAR style speedway built outside of North America, was built at a cost of A$54 million and was opened in 1987. The new track, modelled on a scaled down version of the Charlotte Motor Speedway, including mimicking its 24° banked turns, held its first NASCAR race, the Goodyear NASCAR 500 (for 500 km) on February 28, 1988 and was won by Alabama Gang member Neil Bonnet driving a Pontiac Grand Prix. Although only an exhibition race, this was also the first NASCAR race held outside of North America. Jane became the head of the sanctioning body for stock car racing in Australia known as Australian Stock Car Auto Racing (AUSCAR), though a falling out between him and France in 1991 saw NASCAR withdraw its support for Jane and his track. NASCAR racing in Australia continued to be sanctioned by Jane until the series folded in 2001.
He continued his father's legacy by fostering growth of the Daytona 500 stock car race and Daytona 200 motorcycle race at Daytona International Speedway. The Winston Million program was launched by R.J. Reynolds in 1985. A $1 million bonus was awarded to any driver who could win three of four preselected races.[citation needed]
NASCAR's Grand National series was renamed Winston Cup (now Monster Energy Cup) in 1973. The points fund increased from $750,000 to $2 million. The champions portion of the points fund rose to $2 million by 1998.[5]
NASCAR had few televised races in 1972. Those races that did air in the 1970s were mixed into shows like ABC Wide World of Sports.[6] France signed a deal with CBS Sports' president Neal Pilson to televise the 1979 Daytona 500 from flag to flag. The race was the first live flag to flag national coverage of a NASCAR race. The race got high television ratings, partly due to a snowstorm in the Midwest and Northeast. Richard Petty won the race after race leaders Donnie Allison and Cale Yarborough crashed together on the final lap. Allison's brother Bobby Allison stopped, and Bobby Allison and Yarborough then exchanged punches. The ratings and ensuing press coverage helped France to sign television contracts with ESPN in 1980, TNN in 1990, and TBS. France's career culminated in a record-setting $2.4 billion television broadcasting contract in 1999 for the 2001 season.[4]
France was a delegate from Florida to the 1972 Democratic National Convention and supported the candidacy of George Wallace, who had won the Florida Democratic presidential preference primary that year.[citation needed]
In 1993, France's employees told him about six-year-old Ohio leukemia patient Sarah Ashley Secoy. He called her father and pledged to make her struggle and international marrow donor search a global news story. His efforts made her a radio and TV news story. He also helped fund "Sarah's Song", a duet recorded with her father that France promoted to tens of thousands of radio stations globally. Millions were thus raised to pay for her six-year hospital fight inside a germ free chamber. Her genetic match donor was found. She became the first patient ever to survive acute myeloid leukemia thus leading to an all new global treatment concept for several deadly childhood cancers that has now saved thousands of children's lives.[citation needed]

France turned the presidency of NASCAR over to Mike Helton in 2000 after being diagnosed with cancer. He made his son Brian France the CEO and chairman of NASCAR in 2003. Bill France Jr. remained a member of the six-person NASCAR board of directors.
The France family continues to own NASCAR outright, and has a controlling interest in race track operator International Speedway Corporation. France Jr. continued as chairman of the board of ISC, until his death. His daughter Lesa France Kennedy is ISC's president.[7]
France died of lung cancer in Daytona Beach, Florida, on June 4, 2007 at about 1:00 pm. His death occurred during the rain-delayed Autism Speaks 400 Cup race, and his death was reported during the live broadcast of the race at lap 261. NASCAR on Fox lead announcer Mike Joy held a moment of "silence" during a restart around lap 270, and the track's flag was lowered to half staff.

William Clifton "Bill" France (April 4, 1933 -- June 4, 2007), nicknamed, "Bill France Jr." or "Little Billy", was an American motorsports executive who served from 1972 to 2000 as the chief executive officer (CEO) of NASCAR, the sanctioning body of the US-based stock car racing. He succeeded his father, NASCAR founder Bill France Sr. as its CEO. His son, Brian France, has been CEO since 2003.

Early life[edit]
France was born in Washington, D.C., to Anne Bledsoe and William Henry Getty France. His family moved to Daytona Beach, Florida in 1935 to escape the Great Depression.[1] He attended Seabreeze High School before attending the University of Florida. He served for two years in the United States Navy before turning to a career in racing.[2]
France grew up helping at race tracks; he sold concessions and helped park cars at the Daytona Beach Road Course. He worked twelve hours per day, seven days a week for thirteen months with the construction of Daytona International Speedway, where he drove a compactor, bulldozer, and grader. He once tried using a mule to pull trees out of the swamp because motorized equipment was getting stuck.[3]
He rode off-road motorcycles, and began competing in enduros in the 1960s. France entered the Baja 1000 in the motorcycle division in the early 1970s. He gave the up-and-coming sport of motocross a chance at Daytona in the early 1970s. The motocross races started with little fanfare, but grew into the popular Daytona Supercross. The supercross inspired the Daytona Beach Bike Week.[3]
Career[edit]
After serving as vice-president for six years, he became the head of NASCAR when his father Bill France Sr. retired on January 10, 1972.[2] The International Motorsports Hall of Fame describes the transition: "Other than the founding of NASCAR itself, Bill Jr.'s appointment to leadership is probably the most significant event in the history of the sanctioning body." [4] NASCAR went from a Southern regional sport to a national sport during his tenure.[4]
France Jr. was instrumental in taking the sport outside of its traditional American base. In 1981 he struck a deal with multimillion-dollar Australian tire retailer and retired racer Bob Jane to take stock car racing to Australia and plans were laid out for a high-banked speedway at the Jane owned Calder Park Raceway in Melbourne. The 1.119 mi (1.801 km) Calder Park Thunderdome, the first high-banked NASCAR style speedway built outside of North America, was built at a cost of A$54 million and was opened in 1987. The new track, modelled on a scaled down version of the Charlotte Motor Speedway, including mimicking its 24° banked turns, held its first NASCAR race, the Goodyear NASCAR 500 (for 500 km) on February 28, 1988 and was won by Alabama Gang member Neil Bonnet driving a Pontiac Grand Prix. Although only an exhibition race, this was also the first NASCAR race held outside of North America. Jane became the head of the sanctioning body for stock car racing in Australia known as Australian Stock Car Auto Racing (AUSCAR), though a falling out between him and France in 1991 saw NASCAR withdraw its support for Jane and his track. NASCAR racing in Australia continued to be sanctioned by Jane until the series folded in 2001.
He continued his father's legacy by fostering growth of the Daytona 500 stock car race and Daytona 200 motorcycle race at Daytona International Speedway. The Winston Million program was launched by R.J. Reynolds in 1985. A $1 million bonus was awarded to any driver who could win three of four preselected races.[citation needed]
NASCAR's Grand National series was renamed Winston Cup (now Monster Energy Cup) in 1973. The points fund increased from $750,000 to $2 million. The champions portion of the points fund rose to $2 million by 1998.[5]
NASCAR had few televised races in 1972. Those races that did air in the 1970s were mixed into shows like ABC Wide World of Sports.[6] France signed a deal with CBS Sports' president Neal Pilson to televise the 1979 Daytona 500 from flag to flag. The race was the first live flag to flag national coverage of a NASCAR race. The race got high television ratings, partly due to a snowstorm in the Midwest and Northeast. Richard Petty won the race after race leaders Donnie Allison and Cale Yarborough crashed together on the final lap. Allison's brother Bobby Allison stopped, and Bobby Allison and Yarborough then exchanged punches. The ratings and ensuing press coverage helped France to sign television contracts with ESPN in 1980, TNN in 1990, and TBS. France's career culminated in a record-setting $2.4 billion television broadcasting contract in 1999 for the 2001 season.[4]
France was a delegate from Florida to the 1972 Democratic National Convention and supported the candidacy of George Wallace, who had won the Florida Democratic presidential preference primary that year.[citation needed]
In 1993, France's employees told him about six-year-old Ohio leukemia patient Sarah Ashley Secoy. He called her father and pledged to make her struggle and international marrow donor search a global news story. His efforts made her a radio and TV news story. He also helped fund "Sarah's Song", a duet recorded with her father that France promoted to tens of thousands of radio stations globally. Millions were thus raised to pay for her six-year hospital fight inside a germ free chamber. Her genetic match donor was found. She became the first patient ever to survive acute myeloid leukemia thus leading to an all new global treatment concept for several deadly childhood cancers that has now saved thousands of children's lives.[citation needed]
Later life[edit]
France turned the presidency of NASCAR over to Mike Helton in 2000 after being diagnosed with cancer. He made his son Brian France the CEO and chairman of NASCAR in 2003. Bill France Jr. remained a member of the six-person NASCAR board of directors.
The France family continues to own NASCAR outright, and has a controlling interest in race track operator International Speedway Corporation. France Jr. continued as chairman of the board of ISC, until his death. His daughter Lesa France Kennedy is ISC's president.[7]
France died of lung cancer in Daytona Beach, Florida, on June 4, 2007 at about 1:00 pm. His death occurred during the rain-delayed Autism Speaks 400 Cup race, and his death was reported during the live broadcast of the race at lap 261. NASCAR on Fox lead announcer Mike Joy held a moment of "silence" during a restart around lap 270, and the track's flag was lowered to half staff.

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (Aug. 30, 2016) -- Betty Jane France, a philanthropist in support of children's health causes, passed away Monday evening. France is the mother of NASCAR Chairman and CEO Brian France and International Speedway Corporation CEO Lesa France Kennedy.
 
A native of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, the former Betty Jane Zachary was the widow of the late NASCAR Chairman and CEO William C. France, who passed away in 2007. Betty Jane France was executive vice president and assistant treasurer of NASCAR and the chairwoman emeritus of the NASCAR Foundation.
 
"Last night, the NASCAR family lost a mother, a grandmother, a friend and the light that guided the sport's charitable arm," said Brian France. "My mother taught us incredible values, that of love, patience, compassion and joy. She embraced life every day, and nothing fueled her passion more than children. Her unmatched efforts in building The NASCAR Foundation improved the lives of millions of children throughout this country. And because of that, her legacy will live forever.
 
"My father leaned on my mother throughout his life, relying on her wisdom and calming demeanor to help grow the sport of NASCAR. She was there, every step of the way. When we lost my father, her positive presence remained, as she used her immense skill to grow NASCAR's heart and soul, The NASCAR Foundation.
 
"Our family thanks you for all of your thoughts, prayers and well wishes. My mother was a special woman, and an impressive person, and she will be dearly missed."
 
France became chairwoman of The NASCAR Foundation upon the foundation's inception in 2006. Headquartered in Daytona Beach, the foundation is an entity that embodies the compassion of the NASCAR Family and its commitment to serving communities.

The Betty Jane France Humanitarian Award Presented by Nationwide, recognizing outstanding charitable and volunteer efforts of NASCAR fans, was created in her honor in 2011.
 
France was a longtime community leader in Daytona Beach, Florida and best known as a steadfast champion of health care for children. She assisted in the establishment of "Speediatrics" children's care unit at Halifax Health in Daytona Beach and at Homestead Hospital in Homestead, Florida.
 
In 2003, France was presented the Halifax Medical Center Foundation’s Humanitarian Award in recognition of her advocacy, commitment, support and advancement of numerous area community service organizations including the Volusia/Flagler chapter of the American Red Cross.
 
She was a member of the Junior League of Daytona Beach serving on boards of numerous area community service organizations.
 
In July 2008, she was named as an honorary co-chairperson for the Childress Institute for Pediatric Trauma, a project headed by longtime NASCAR team owner Richard Childress in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.
 
Funeral arrangements will be forthcoming.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Florida:













Does France Betty Jane carry a valid contracting license?



If you pay someone to construct a building or a structure, make structural alterations to load bearing walls, or perform services such as plumbing or air conditioning work, that person must have a state contractor's license.
France Betty Jane currently holds license ID0001048 (Interior Designers), which was Inactive when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Florida?



The Florida Construction Industry License Board maintains high standards for contractor licensing. Prior to receiving their license, Florida contractors are required to prove four years of relevant work experience or education; pass a board examination and prove financial solvency.











Your liability risk when hiring France Betty Jane



In Florida, licensed contractors with employees are required to carry workers' compensation insurance and attest they have obtained public liability and property damage insurance in the amounts determined by the Board.











Financial recourse when hiring France Betty Jane



Florida maintains a recovery fund, called the Florida Homeowners' Construction Recovery Fund, which is available to a natural person who has suffered monetary damages by the financial mismanagement or misconduct of a contractor, and who has exhausted all other sources of payment. The Board makes the determination of eligibility for an award. Florida contractors are not required to carry an active bond.











What else should I know before hiring France Betty Jane



As of 2007, the Florida DBPR began requiring license applicants to submit their fingerprints, which are used to run a criminal background check with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. In addition, they are required to provide a credit report during the license application process to demonstrate financial stability. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Florida Construction Industry License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Betty Jane France, widow of former NASCAR Chairman Bill France Jr., and mother to NASCAR Chairman Brian France and International Speedway Corp. CEO Lesa France Kennedy, died Monday. Funeral arrangements will be forthcoming.
“Last night, the NASCAR family lost a mother, a grandmother, a friend and the light that guided the sport’s charitable arm,” said NASCAR Chairman Brian France in a statement Tuesday morning. “My mother taught us incredible values, that of love, patience, compassion and joy. She embraced life every day, and nothing fueled her passion more than children. Her unmatched efforts in building The NASCAR Foundation improved the lives of millions of children throughout this country. And because of that, her legacy will live forever.
“My father leaned on my mother throughout his life, relying on her wisdom and calming demeanor to help grow the sport of NASCAR. She was there, every step of the way. When we lost my father, her positive presence remained, as she used her immense skill to grow NASCAR’s heart and soul, The NASCAR Foundation.
“Our family thanks you for all of your thoughts, prayers and well wishes. My mother was a special woman, and an impressive person, and she will be dearly missed.”
Said Lesa France Kennedy in a statement Tuesday morning: “We are saddened by the passing of my mother and inspiration Betty Jane France. She played a significant role in NASCAR’s history, leading the charge to elevate the experience of our sport for the fans who love it, and her philanthropic efforts will forever remain a part of our sport.
“My mother launched the NASCAR Foundation as a steadfast champion of children’s healthcare and in 2011, the Betty Jane France Humanitarian Award was created in her honor. In her hometown of Daytona Beach, she served as a community leader touching countless lives with her charitable efforts. She was very touched and proud last year when Halifax Health Medical Center unveiled a statue just outside the hospital tower which also bears our family’s name.
“Beyond her greatest community service, her starring role was that of mother to my brother Brian and me. She was an incredible role model, cherished friend, and someone who demonstrated limitless possibilities that helped so many people pursue their dreams.
“Her legacy will be treasured and she will forever be missed not only by her loving family and close friends, but by the many lives she touched along the way.”
The Betty Jane France Humanitarian Award presents $100,000 to the winner’s charity and $25,000 to each charity of the remaining three finalists. The award honors a NASCAR fan who embodies the ideals of community and charity that she had throughout her life.
She became chairman of the NASCAR Foundation in 2004 upon its inception. In 2008, she was named an honorary co-chairperson for the Childress Institute for Pediatric Trauma, a projected led by team owner Richard Childress.
“They say behind every strong man is a very strong women,” said Richard Petty, co-owner, Richard Petty Motorsports in a statement Tuesday morning. “In this case, Betty Jane stood just as tall as Bill Jr. She did just as much as anyone to build the sport and help it grow. The Petty family sends our thoughts to Brian, Lesa and the entire France family at this time.”
The former Betty Jane Zachary, who was from Winston-Salem, North Carolina, married Bill France Jr. on Sept. 20, 1957. That came seven months after they met at a swimming pool when Bill France Jr. was looking for contestants for Miss Bowman Gray at the Winston-Salem track, according to the book “The Man Who Made NASCAR: Bill France Jr.’’
She gave birth to Lesa France Kennedy on May 24, 1961 and gave birth to Brian France on Aug. 2, 1962.
She was with the family before Daytona International Speedway was built. She recalled in the book “Big Bill: The Life and Times of NASCAR Founder Bill France Sr.’’ taking a trip around the track with him during the construction of it.
“I think I was the first person to ride around the track, along with Bill Sr. We were going fast, too,’’ she said in the book. “Way too fast, I suppose. It was cool, but it was also scary because you have to realize that this was before they had the track even finished. We were just riding around on the lime rock before they even put the asphalt down on top of it.
“I remember as we were riding around, Bill Sr. was saying, ‘This is really going to be something one day.’ Myself, I could not visualize how big the whole thing would be when it was finished. I also remember Bill Sr. telling me as we rode around the banking, ‘This is your future.’ I was thinking … right. But when it came to Bill France Sr., everything was always going to work. It was just going to work. That’s the way it was with him.’’
Services for Betty Jane France will be at 11 a.m. Sept. 1 at Seabreeze United Church of Christ in Daytona Beach, Fla., In lieu of flowers, the family ask that donations be made to The Nascar Foundation.

Betty Jane France, widow of former NASCAR Chairman Bill France Jr., and mother to NASCAR Chairman Brian France and International Speedway Corp. CEO Lesa France Kennedy, died Monday. Funeral arrangements will be forthcoming.
“Last night, the NASCAR family lost a mother, a grandmother, a friend and the light that guided the sport’s charitable arm,” said NASCAR Chairman Brian France in a statement Tuesday morning. “My mother taught us incredible values, that of love, patience, compassion and joy. She embraced life every day, and nothing fueled her passion more than children. Her unmatched efforts in building The NASCAR Foundation improved the lives of millions of children throughout this country. And because of that, her legacy will live forever.
“My father leaned on my mother throughout his life, relying on her wisdom and calming demeanor to help grow the sport of NASCAR. She was there, every step of the way. When we lost my father, her positive presence remained, as she used her immense skill to grow NASCAR’s heart and soul, The NASCAR Foundation.
“Our family thanks you for all of your thoughts, prayers and well wishes. My mother was a special woman, and an impressive person, and she will be dearly missed.”
Said Lesa France Kennedy in a statement Tuesday morning: “We are saddened by the passing of my mother and inspiration Betty Jane France. She played a significant role in NASCAR’s history, leading the charge to elevate the experience of our sport for the fans who love it, and her philanthropic efforts will forever remain a part of our sport.
“My mother launched the NASCAR Foundation as a steadfast champion of children’s healthcare and in 2011, the Betty Jane France Humanitarian Award was created in her honor. In her hometown of Daytona Beach, she served as a community leader touching countless lives with her charitable efforts. She was very touched and proud last year when Halifax Health Medical Center unveiled a statue just outside the hospital tower which also bears our family’s name.
“Beyond her greatest community service, her starring role was that of mother to my brother Brian and me. She was an incredible role model, cherished friend, and someone who demonstrated limitless possibilities that helped so many people pursue their dreams.
“Her legacy will be treasured and she will forever be missed not only by her loving family and close friends, but by the many lives she touched along the way.”
The Betty Jane France Humanitarian Award presents $100,000 to the winner’s charity and $25,000 to each charity of the remaining three finalists. The award honors a NASCAR fan who embodies the ideals of community and charity that she had throughout her life.
She became chairman of the NASCAR Foundation in 2004 upon its inception. In 2008, she was named an honorary co-chairperson for the Childress Institute for Pediatric Trauma, a projected led by team owner Richard Childress.
“They say behind every strong man is a very strong women,” said Richard Petty, co-owner, Richard Petty Motorsports in a statement Tuesday morning. “In this case, Betty Jane stood just as tall as Bill Jr. She did just as much as anyone to build the sport and help it grow. The Petty family sends our thoughts to Brian, Lesa and the entire France family at this time.”
The former Betty Jane Zachary, who was from Winston-Salem, North Carolina, married Bill France Jr. on Sept. 20, 1957. That came seven months after they met at a swimming pool when Bill France Jr. was looking for contestants for Miss Bowman Gray at the Winston-Salem track, according to the book “The Man Who Made NASCAR: Bill France Jr.’’
She gave birth to Lesa France Kennedy on May 24, 1961 and gave birth to Brian France on Aug. 2, 1962.
She was with the family before Daytona International Speedway was built. She recalled in the book “Big Bill: The Life and Times of NASCAR Founder Bill France Sr.’’ taking a trip around the track with him during the construction of it.
“I think I was the first person to ride around the track, along with Bill Sr. We were going fast, too,’’ she said in the book. “Way too fast, I suppose. It was cool, but it was also scary because you have to realize that this was before they had the track even finished. We were just riding around on the lime rock before they even put the asphalt down on top of it.
“I remember as we were riding around, Bill Sr. was saying, ‘This is really going to be something one day.’ Myself, I could not visualize how big the whole thing would be when it was finished. I also remember Bill Sr. telling me as we rode around the banking, ‘This is your future.’ I was thinking … right. But when it came to Bill France Sr., everything was always going to work. It was just going to work. That’s the way it was with him.’’
Services for Betty Jane France will be at 11 a.m. Sept. 1 at Seabreeze United Church of Christ in Daytona Beach, Fla., In lieu of flowers, the family ask that donations be made to The Nascar Foundation.

Betty Jane France, a philanthropist in support of children’s health causes, died Monday evening at age 78. France was the mother of NASCAR Chairman and CEO Brian France and International Speedway Corp. CEO Lesa France Kennedy.A native of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, the former Betty Jane Zachary was the widow of late NASCAR Chairman and CEO William C. France, who died in 2007. Betty Jane France was executive vice president and assistant treasurer of NASCAR and the chairwoman emeritus of The NASCAR Foundation.“Last night, the NASCAR family lost a mother, a grandmother, a friend and the light that guided the sport’s charitable arm,” said Brian France. “My mother taught us incredible values, that of love, patience, compassion and joy. She embraced life every day, and nothing fueled her passion more than children. Her unmatched efforts in building The NASCAR Foundation improved the lives of millions of children throughout this country. And because of that, her legacy will live forever.“My father leaned on my mother throughout his life, relying on her wisdom and calming demeanor to help grow the sport of NASCAR.

My mother was a special woman, and an impressive person, and she will be dearly missed.”France became chairwoman of The NASCAR Foundation upon the foundation’s inception in 2004. Headquartered in Daytona Beach, Florida, the foundation is an entity that embodies the compassion of the NASCAR family and its commitment to serving communities.The Betty Jane France Humanitarian Award Presented by Nationwide, recognizing outstanding charitable and volunteer efforts of NASCAR fans, was created in her honor in 2011.France was a longtime community leader in Daytona Beach and best known as a steadfast champion of health care for children. She assisted in the establishment of the “Speediatrics” children’s care unit at Halifax Health in Daytona Beach and at Homestead Hospital in Homestead, Florida.In 2003, France was presented the Halifax Medical Center Foundation’s Humanitarian Award in recognition of her advocacy, commitment, support and advancement of numerous area community service organizations, including the Volusia/Flagler chapter of the American Red Cross.She was a member of the Junior League of Daytona Beach, serving on the boards of numerous area community service organizations.In July 2008, she was named as an honorary co-chairperson for the Childress Institute for Pediatric Trauma, a project headed by longtime NASCAR team owner Richard Childress in Winston-Salem.“We are saddened by the passing of my mother and inspiration Betty Jane France," Lesa France Kennedy said in a statement released by ISC. "She played a significant role in NASCAR’s history, leading the charge to elevate the experience of our sport for the fans who love it, and her philanthropic efforts will forever remain a part of our sport.“My mother launched the NASCAR Foundation as a steadfast champion of children’s healthcare and in 2011, the Betty Jane France Humanitarian Award was created in her honor.

For sale: NASCAR's Frances' 17,000 sq. ft. home

				Jim Abbott    @JimAbbottwrites
			
DAYTONA BEACH — Every corner of the luxury home of Betty Jane France offers a window into the tastes and travels of the “First Lady of NASCAR Racing,” but a new owner soon could call the gorgeous riverfront estate home.The former home of NASCAR’s First Family — featuring a fully furnished 17,000-square-foot mansion and a 1,700-square-foot guest house on 3.8 acres on the Halifax River — goes on the auction block Saturday.In the meantime, the auction company, Platinum Luxury Auctions, is hosting previews from noon-4 p.m. daily of the sprawling estate behind the metal privacy gates at 1600 S. Peninsula Drive, property that has been appraised for insurance purposes at $13.8 million. According to the Volusia County Property Appraisers Office, the nonschool assessed value is $5,529,525. The home was built in 2003 by Charles Clayton Construction of Winter Park.Betty Jane France, beloved in the area for her charitable work and devotion to children's issues, died on Aug. 29, 2016. She was 78.Potential buyers interested in bidding on the property must register by 5 p.m. Friday, a process that includes completion of required documents and submission of a $100,000 refundable deposit. Those who submit an opening bid of at least $2 million will be eligible for varying reductions in a 10 percent buyer’s premium to be added to the highest bid. Visit platinumluxuryauctions.com for details.“We do most of our screening afterward,” Mathias Lenssen, product manager for the auction, said of the daily preview visitors. “We want to know who will be in the room on (Saturday), who our bidders will be. But anybody can come, no appointment necessary.”That includes a modestly paid newspaper reporter, who received a tour from the Frances’ longtime personal assistant Dana Sunshine on a recent afternoon. No photos allowed.“All the decorating ideas came from their travels around the world,” said Sunshine, 65, striding across the enormous black-and-white Spanish marble checkerboard floor in the 80-foot-long foyer, home to a gleaming black Kawai grand piano equipped with a system to automatically play along with CDs inserted into a player beneath the keys.Like all the furniture and accessories that remain, it comes with the house.The foyer is the connection from the home’s entrance, accented by grand dual staircases, to the River Room, with its picture windows on the Intracoastal Waterway.A bar in the River Room was modeled on the one in the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, Calif., Sunshine said. Across the room, an imposing armoire — customized to hold a flat-screen TV — was shipped from New Orleans, where France found it in an antique store. On a table, bronze statues depict a boy and a girl hunched over a storybook, a nod to Betty Jane's interest in children's causes. Nearby, Betty Jane’s home office is lined with built-in bookshelves where titles reflect other wide-ranging interests:Books on art history, California wines and Earth science share space with literature anthologies, poetry collections, birding, “Venetian Palaces” and “The Hillier Gardener’s Guide to Trees & Shrubs.”That interest in landscaping is evident in the manicured grounds of the 325 feet of private frontage on the Halifax, including a 150-foot dock capable of accommodating several deep-water vessels. Two covered lanais offer large entertainment areas with fireplaces that look more like something from a European cafe.A fountain imported from Italy is the dominant feature, against a backdrop of magnolias, oaks, weeping willows, oleanders, bougainvilleas and fragrant Confederate jasmine.“She had pictures of window treatments, shapes, marble, gardens,” Sunshine said. “Everywhere she went she took pictures. They built the house to entertain.”Befitting its name, the River Room also offers postcard-worthy views of the Halifax through room-length picture windows equipped with electronic shades to shield the sun.Upstairs, there’s an equally lovely river view from a master suite equipped with a grand vestibule, sitting area, separate en-suite baths adorned in custom tiles and wood, as well as separate room-sized his and her dressing areas. A breakfast kitchen in the master suite leads to an oversized balcony, where Betty Jane France used to enjoy reclining on a day bed to watch the activity on the river, Sunshine said.There’s different décor in each of the estate’s five full bathrooms and six half-baths, Sunshine said.That includes green Pakistan onyx in Bill France’s master bath, cross-cut honey onyx in his wife’s master bath to intricately designed rosette patterns in other ornamental light fixtures. A wall of Betty Jane’s dressing area is occupied by custom cabinets to hold her shoes, each illuminated and equipped with glass windows. On another wall was a cedar closet for furs.“I think she almost had it decorated before the house was finished,” Sunshine said. “She knew what she wanted and she was detailed.”

NASCAR’s founding family has lost one of its most cherished leaders with the passing of Betty Jane France, the executive vice president and assistant treasurer of NASCAR and chairperson of the NASCAR Foundation.

Tweets remembering NASCAR's Betty Jane France 



Betty Jane was the mother of Lesa France Kennedy, CEO of International Speedway Corp., and NASCAR Chairman and CEO Brian France.
“Last night, the NASCAR family lost a mother, a grandmother, a friend and the light that guided the sport’s charitable arm,” said Brian France. “My mother taught us incredible values, that of love, patience, compassion and joy. She embraced life every day, and nothing fueled her passion more than children. Her unmatched efforts in building The NASCAR Foundation improved the lives of millions of children throughout this country. And because of that, her legacy will live forever. 
“My father leaned on my mother throughout his life, relying on her wisdom and calming demeanor to help grow the sport of NASCAR. She was there, every step of the way. When we lost my father, her positive presence remained, as she used her immense skill to grow NASCAR’s heart and soul, The NASCAR Foundation.

She assisted in establishing of the "Speediatrics" children’s care unit at Halifax Health in Daytona Beach and was also instrumental in the establishment of a similar unit at Homestead Hospital, Homestead, Florida. She was the driving force in fundraising and design of these units.
She was a member of the Junior League of Daytona Beach and served on boards of numerous area community service organizations including the Volusia/Flagler chapter of the American Red Cross and the Garden Club of Halifax County.
In 2003, Betty Jane was presented the Halifax Medical Center Foundation’s Humanitarian Award in recognition of her advocacy, commitment, support and advancement of health care and human services for women, infants children and families.
France became chairwoman of the NASCAR Foundation upon the foundation’s inception in 2004. The foundation, based in Daytona Beach, Fla., is a  non-profit entity that embodies the compassion of the NASCAR Family and its commitment to serving communities. The foundation’s flagship charitable initiative, the annual NASCAR Day held each May, has benefited a variety of causes, including Speediatrics.
In July 2008, she was named as an honorary co-chairperson for the Childress Institute for Pediatric Trauma, a project headed by longtime NASCAR team owner Richard Childress in Winston Salem, NC.
The Betty Jane France Humanitarian Award was created in her honor in 2011. Through the NASCAR Foundation, this award recognizes outstanding charitable and volunteer efforts of NASCAR fans. She presented this award annually at the NASCAR Awards Banquet.
