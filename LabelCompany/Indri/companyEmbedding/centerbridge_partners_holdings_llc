Centerbridge Partners is a multi-strategy private investment firm focused on leveraged buyouts and distressed securities.
The firm manages over $25 billion of assets[1] and is based in New York City, with an additional office in London. The firm invests in both control (private equity and public debt with a "loan-to-own" strategy) and non-control (public market debt, public market equities, and other publicly traded securities) opportunities.
The firm [2] was founded in 2005 by Jeffrey Aronson and Mark Gallogly. Aronson had previously been the head of distressed securities and had founded the leveraged loan business at Angelo, Gordon & Co., which he had joined in 1989 from L.F. Rothschild & Co. Gallogly was formerly a senior managing director and head of private equity investments at the Blackstone Group from 2003 until his departure. At Blackstone, Gallogly was heavily involved in the firm's investments in New Skies Satellites and Sirius Satellite Radio among others and had joined the firm in 1989 from Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, where he worked in acquisition finance.
In September 2006, the firm raised its debut fund with $3.2 billion of investor commitments to focus on control investments in distressed securities as well as leveraged buyout transactions.[3][4] The firm also raised a $2 billion noncontrol, activist-oriented credit trading fund known as Centerbridge Special Credit Partners through 2009 and 2010.[5] In 2010, the firm announced plans to begin marketing a second investment fund with a target of $3.75 billion of investor commitments.[6] In 2011, the firm closed its second flagship fund, Centerbridge Partners II, on $4.4 billion, including a commitment from the GP.[7] This was followed by a closing of its $2bn second Special Credit Partners fund in March 2012.[2]
In 2010, Centerbridge won control of Extended Stay Hotels, a company that Gallogly had been involved with at Blackstone.[8]
On 24 September 2010, Centerbridge Capital Partners announced acquisition of 'GMAC Commercial Finance', a subsidiary of Ally Financial.[9]
In 2012, Centerbridge acquired P. F. Chang's China Bistro, a chain of Chinese casual dining restaurants.[10]
On 22 January 2015, Centerbridge Partners announced its agreement to buy Senvion SE from Indian wind turbine manufacturer Suzlon.[11]
On 24 March 2015, Centerbridge Partners announced that they reached an agreement to acquire Great Wolf Resorts, the world's largest chain of indoor water park resorts for $1.35 billion.[12]

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Centerbridge Partners is a multi-strategy private investment firm focused on leveraged buyouts and distressed securities.
The firm manages over $25 billion of assets[1] and is based in New York City, with an additional office in London. The firm invests in both control (private equity and public debt with a "loan-to-own" strategy) and non-control (public market debt, public market equities, and other publicly traded securities) opportunities.
The firm [2] was founded in 2005 by Jeffrey Aronson and Mark Gallogly. Aronson had previously been the head of distressed securities and had founded the leveraged loan business at Angelo, Gordon & Co., which he had joined in 1989 from L.F. Rothschild & Co. Gallogly was formerly a senior managing director and head of private equity investments at the Blackstone Group from 2003 until his departure. At Blackstone, Gallogly was heavily involved in the firm's investments in New Skies Satellites and Sirius Satellite Radio among others and had joined the firm in 1989 from Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, where he worked in acquisition finance.
In September 2006, the firm raised its debut fund with $3.2 billion of investor commitments to focus on control investments in distressed securities as well as leveraged buyout transactions.[3][4] The firm also raised a $2 billion noncontrol, activist-oriented credit trading fund known as Centerbridge Special Credit Partners through 2009 and 2010.[5] In 2010, the firm announced plans to begin marketing a second investment fund with a target of $3.75 billion of investor commitments.[6] In 2011, the firm closed its second flagship fund, Centerbridge Partners II, on $4.4 billion, including a commitment from the GP.[7] This was followed by a closing of its $2bn second Special Credit Partners fund in March 2012.[2]
In 2010, Centerbridge won control of Extended Stay Hotels, a company that Gallogly had been involved with at Blackstone.[8]
On 24 September 2010, Centerbridge Capital Partners announced acquisition of 'GMAC Commercial Finance', a subsidiary of Ally Financial.[9]
In 2012, Centerbridge acquired P. F. Chang's China Bistro, a chain of Chinese casual dining restaurants.[10]
On 22 January 2015, Centerbridge Partners announced its agreement to buy Senvion SE from Indian wind turbine manufacturer Suzlon.[11]
On 24 March 2015, Centerbridge Partners announced that they reached an agreement to acquire Great Wolf Resorts, the world's largest chain of indoor water park resorts for $1.35 billion.[12]

Centerbridge Partners is a multi-strategy private investment firm focused on leveraged buyouts and distressed securities.
The firm manages over $25 billion of assets[1] and is based in New York City, with an additional office in London. The firm invests in both control (private equity and public debt with a "loan-to-own" strategy) and non-control (public market debt, public market equities, and other publicly traded securities) opportunities.
The firm [2] was founded in 2005 by Jeffrey Aronson and Mark Gallogly. Aronson had previously been the head of distressed securities and had founded the leveraged loan business at Angelo, Gordon & Co., which he had joined in 1989 from L.F. Rothschild & Co. Gallogly was formerly a senior managing director and head of private equity investments at the Blackstone Group from 2003 until his departure. At Blackstone, Gallogly was heavily involved in the firm's investments in New Skies Satellites and Sirius Satellite Radio among others and had joined the firm in 1989 from Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, where he worked in acquisition finance.
In September 2006, the firm raised its debut fund with $3.2 billion of investor commitments to focus on control investments in distressed securities as well as leveraged buyout transactions.[3][4] The firm also raised a $2 billion noncontrol, activist-oriented credit trading fund known as Centerbridge Special Credit Partners through 2009 and 2010.[5] In 2010, the firm announced plans to begin marketing a second investment fund with a target of $3.75 billion of investor commitments.[6] In 2011, the firm closed its second flagship fund, Centerbridge Partners II, on $4.4 billion, including a commitment from the GP.[7] This was followed by a closing of its $2bn second Special Credit Partners fund in March 2012.[2]
In 2010, Centerbridge won control of Extended Stay Hotels, a company that Gallogly had been involved with at Blackstone.[8]
On 24 September 2010, Centerbridge Capital Partners announced acquisition of 'GMAC Commercial Finance', a subsidiary of Ally Financial.[9]
In 2012, Centerbridge acquired P. F. Chang's China Bistro, a chain of Chinese casual dining restaurants.[10]
On 22 January 2015, Centerbridge Partners announced its agreement to buy Senvion SE from Indian wind turbine manufacturer Suzlon.[11]
On 24 March 2015, Centerbridge Partners announced that they reached an agreement to acquire Great Wolf Resorts, the world's largest chain of indoor water park resorts for $1.35 billion.[12]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
