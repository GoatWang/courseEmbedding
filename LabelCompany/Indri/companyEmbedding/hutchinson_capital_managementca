Our Commitment To Our Clients
Our primary goal is to ensure the financial well-being of our clients by meeting or exceeding their financial objectives and expected level of service.  We believe that building strong relationships is the most important factor in our business and that long-lasting relationships are built on trust, open communication, and mutual understanding.  We fully expect that each of our clients will stay with us for his or her entire life and that we will continue to serve their families for generations to come.
While preservation of wealth and growth of capital are goals common to all of our clients, we recognize that each relationship is unique.  Accordingly, we tailor the asset allocations of each portfolio to the specific needs of our clients based on income requirements, tax considerations, and risk tolerance.  Additionally, we adjust our approach for each client as his or her needs or objectives change.  Since our clients are our most important asset, we make every attempt to ensure that we are meeting their goals.
Our policy is to have annual reviews with our clients at locations that are convenient to them, often in their homes.  Additionally, at all times throughout the year, our portfolio managers are available to talk or meet with our clients as new issues arise or circumstances in our clients' lives change.
We take pride in trying to make the complex simple.  We make every effort to ensure that each of our clients understands fully the course that we have laid out for them and we document that course in our Investment Policy Guidelines prepared specially for each client.
Trust and respect are our most valued rewards.  We believe that we earn the respect and trust of our clients (and other professionals) through our honest approach and commitment to our clients.

FIDUCIARY DUTY

Fiduciary Duty
Investment advisers owe a fiduciary duty to their clients. As such, an investment adviser stands in a special relationship of trust and confidence with its clients. As a fiduciary, an investment adviser has an affirmative duty of care, loyalty, honesty, and good faith to act in the best interests of its clients. The parameters of an investment adviser’s fiduciary duty depend on the scope of the advisory relationship and generally include the following duties: 

to place the interests of clients first at all times; 
to have a reasonable basis for its investment advice;
to seek best execution for client securities transactions where the adviser directs such transactions;
to make investment decisions consistent with any mutually agreed upon client objectives, strategies, policies, guidelines, and restrictions; 
to treat clients fairly;
to make full and fair disclosure to clients of all material facts about the advisory relationship, particularly regarding conflicts of interest; and 
to respect the confidentiality of client information. This fiduciary duty differs from the suitability obligations that govern brokers.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Time (NYSE:TIME) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.20)Consensus Price Target: $15.20 (9.75% upside)
