BMW was established as a business entity following a restructuring of the Rapp Motorenwerke aircraft manufacturing firm in 1912 named Aerowerke Gustav Otto. After the end of World War I in 1918, BMW was forced to cease aircraft-engine production by the terms of the Versailles Armistice Treaty.[5] The company consequently shifted to motorcycle production as the restrictions of the treaty started to be lifted in 1923,[6] followed by automobiles in 1928–29.[7][8][9]
The first car which BMW successfully produced and the car which launched BMW on the road to automobile production was the Dixi, based on the Austin 7 and licensed from the Austin Motor Company in Birmingham, England.
BMW's first significant aircraft engine, and commercial product of any sort, was the BMW IIIa inline-six liquid-cooled engine of 1918, known for good fuel economy and high-altitude performance.[10] With German rearmament in the 1930s, the company again began producing aircraft engines for the Luftwaffe. The factory in Munich made ample use of forced labour: foreign civilians, prisoners of war and inmates of the concentration camp Dachau [1]. Among its successful World War II engine designs were the BMW 132 and BMW 801 air-cooled radial engines, and the pioneering BMW 003 axial-flow turbojet, which powered the tiny, 1944–1945–era jet-powered "emergency fighter", the Heinkel He 162 Spatz. The BMW 003 jet engine was first tested as a prime power plant in the first prototype of the Messerschmitt Me 262, the Me 262 V1, but in 1942 tests the BMW prototype engines failed on takeoff with only the standby Junkers Jumo 210 nose-mounted piston engine powering it to a safe landing.[11][12] The few Me 262 A-1b test examples built used the more developed version of the 003 jet, recording an official top speed of 800 km/h (497 mph). The first-ever four-engine jet aircraft ever flown were the sixth and eighth prototypes of the Arado Ar 234 jet reconnaissance-bomber, which used BMW 003 jets for power. Through 1944 the 003's reliability improved, making it a suitable power plant for air frame designs competing for the Jägernotprogramm's light fighter production contract. which was won by the Heinkel He 162 Spatz design. The BMW 003 aviation turbojet was also under consideration as the basic starting point for a pioneering turboshaft powerplant for German armored fighting vehicles in 1944–45, as the GT 101.[13] Towards the end of the Third Reich, BMW developed some military aircraft projects for the Luftwaffe, the BMW Strahlbomber, the BMW Schnellbomber and the BMW Strahljäger, but none of them were built.[14][15]
[more detail]
By the year 1958, the automotive division of BMW was in financial difficulties and a shareholders meeting was held to decide whether to go into liquidation or find an alternative. It was decided to carry on by trying to cash in on the current economy car boom exploited so successfully by German ex-aircraft manufacturers such as Messerschmitt and Heinkel. BMW bought the rights to manufacture the Italian Iso Isetta. BMW's version of the tiny cars were to be powered by a modified form of BMW's motorcycle engine. This was moderately successful and helped the company get back on its feet.
Since 1959, the controlling majority shareholder of the BMW Aktiengesellschaft has been the Quandt family, which owns about 46% of the stock. The rest is in public float.
BMW acquired the Hans Glas company based in Dingolfing, Germany, in 1966. Glas vehicles were briefly badged as BMW until the company was fully absorbed. It was reputed that the acquisition was mainly to gain access to Glas' development of the timing belt with an overhead camshaft in automotive applications,[16] although some saw Glas' Dingolfing plant as another incentive. However, this factory was outmoded and BMW's biggest immediate gain was, according to themselves, a stock of highly qualified engineers and other personnel.[17] The Glas factories continued to build a limited number of their existing models, while adding the manufacture of BMW front and rear axles until they could be closer incorporated into BMW.[18]




BMW 3-Series (F30)


In 1992, BMW acquired a large stake in California-based industrial design studio DesignworksUSA, which they fully acquired in 1995. In 1994, BMW bought the British Rover Group[19] (which at the time consisted of the Rover, Land Rover and MG brands as well as the rights to defunct brands including Austin and Morris), and owned it for six years. By 2000, Rover was incurring huge losses and BMW decided to sell the combine. The MG and Rover brands were sold to the Phoenix Consortium to form MG Rover, while Land Rover was taken over by Ford. BMW, meanwhile, retained the rights to build the new Mini, which was launched in 2001.
Chief designer Chris Bangle announced his departure from BMW in February 2009, after serving on the design team for nearly seventeen years.[20] He was replaced by Adrian van Hooydonk, Bangle's former right-hand man. Bangle was known for his radical designs such as the 2002 7-Series and the 2002 Z4. In July 2007, the production rights for Husqvarna Motorcycles was purchased by BMW for a reported 93 million euros. BMW Motorrad plans to continue operating Husqvarna Motorcycles as a separate enterprise. All development, sales and production activities, as well as the current workforce, have remained in place at its present location at Varese.
In June 2012, BMW was listed as the #1 most reputable company in the world by Forbes.com.[21] Rankings are based upon aspects such as "people's willingness to buy, recommend, work for, and invest in a company is driven 60% by their perceptions of the company and only 40% by their perceptions of their products."

In 2006, the BMW group (including Mini and Rolls-Royce) produced 1,366,838 four-wheeled vehicles, which were manufactured in five countries.[22] In 2010, it manufactured 1,481,253 four-wheeled vehicles and 112,271 motorcycles (under both the BMW and Husqvarna brands).[23]
The BMW X3 (E83) was made by Magna Steyr, a subsidiary of Magna International, in Graz, Austria under license from BMW until 2010. More than 45,973 were produced in 2009. Starting October 2010, the new BMW X3 (F25) is produced at BMW US Manufacturing Company, Greer, South Carolina.
By 2011, about 56% of BMW-brand vehicles produced are powered by petrol engines and the remaining 44% are powered by diesel engines. Of those petrol vehicles, about 27% are four-cylinder models and about nine percent are eight-cylinder models.[24] BMW also has local assembly operation using complete knock down components in Thailand, Russia, Egypt, Indonesia, Malaysia, and India, for 3, 5, 7 series and X3.[25] On average, 9,000 vehicles per day exit BMW plants, and 63% are transported by rail.[26]

The R32 motorcycle, the first BMW motor vehicle.






The 2015 BMW R1200RT


BMW began production of motorcycle engines and then motorcycles after World War I.[28] Its motorcycle brand is now known as BMW Motorrad. Their first successful motorcycle after the failed Helios and Flink, was the "R32" in 1923, though production originally began in 1921.[29] This had a "boxer" twin engine, in which a cylinder projects into the air-flow from each side of the machine. Apart from their single-cylinder models (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMW's are still produced in this layout, which is designated the R Series.
During the Second World War, BMW produced the BMW R75 motorcycle with a sidecar attached. Having a unique design copied from the Zündapp KS750, its sidecar wheel was also motor-driven. Combined with a lockable differential, this made the vehicle very capable off-road, an equivalent in many ways to the Jeep.
In 1982, came the K Series, shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven F and G series with single and parallel twin Rotax engines.
In the early 1990s, BMW updated the airhead Boxer engine which became known as the oilhead. In 2002, the oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to 1,170 cc and enhanced performance to 100 hp (75 kW) for the R1200GS, compared to 85 hp (63 kW) of the previous R1150GS. More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the R1100S and R1200S, producing 98 and 122 hp (73 and 91 kW), respectively.
In 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It had an engine producing 167 hp (125 kW), derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team, and is lighter than previous K models. Innovations include electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork that BMW calls Duolever.
BMW introduced anti-lock brakes on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s. The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles pave the way for the introduction of electronic stability control, or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year.
BMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an Earles fork, front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called swinging arm). Some BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking.
BMW Group, on 31 January 2013, announced that Pierer Industrie AG has bought Husqvarna for an undisclosed amount, which will not be revealed by either party in the future. The company is headed by Stephan Pierer (CEO of KTM). Pierer Industrie AG is 51% owner of KTM and 100% owner of Husqvarna.

New Class
Main article: BMW New Class
The New Class (German: Neue Klasse) was a line of compact sedans and coupes starting with the 1962 1500 and continuing through the last 2002s in 1977. Powered by BMW's celebrated four-cylinder M10 engine, the New Class models had a fully independent suspension, MacPherson struts in front, and front disc brakes. Initially, a family of four-door sedans and two-door coupes, the New Class line was broadened to two-door sports sedans with the addition of the 02 Series 1600 and 2002 in 1966.
Sharing little in common with the rest of the line beyond power train, the sporty siblings caught auto enthusiasts' attention and established BMW as an international brand. Precursors to the famed BMW 3 Series, the two-doors' success cemented the firm's future as an upper tier performance car maker. New Class four-doors with numbers ending in "0" were replaced by the larger BMW 5 Series in 1972. The upscale 2000C and 2000CS coupes were replaced by the six-cylinder BMW E9, introduced in 1969 with the 2800CS. The 1600 two-door was discontinued in 1975, and the 2002 was replaced by the 320i in 1975.

Starting with the current generation, the 3 Series coupe and convertible are now branded as 4 Series models (F32 and F33 respectively). The 5 Series is a mid-size luxury car, available in sedan (F10) and station wagon (F11) forms. The 5 Series Gran Turismo (F07), which debuted in 2010, created a segment between station wagons and crossover SUV.[30]
BMW's full-size flagship executive sedan is the 7 Series. Typically, BMW introduces many of their innovations in the 7 Series, such as the iDrive system. The latest generation (G11) debuted in 2015. Based on the 5 Series' platform, the 6 Series is BMW's grand touring luxury sport coupe/convertible (F12/F13). A 2-seater roadster and coupe which succeeded the Z3, the Z4 has been sold since 2002.




BMW X3 (F25)


The X3 (F25), BMW's second crossover SUV (called SAV or "Sports Activity Vehicle" by BMW) debuted in 2010 and replaced the X3 (E83)-), which was based on the E46 3 Series' platform, and had been in production since 2003. Marketed in Europe as an off-roader, it benefits from BMW's xDrive all-wheel drive system. The all-wheel drive X5 (E53) was BMW's first crossover SUV (SAV), based on the 5-Series, and is a mid-size luxury SUV sold by BMW since 2000. A 4-seat crossover SUV released by BMW in December 2007, the X6 is marketed as a "Sports Activity Coupe" (SAC) by BMW. The X1 is now in its second generation and extends the BMW X-lineup.

BMW i3 electric car






BMW i8 plug-in hybrid


The BMW i is a sub-brand of BMW founded in 2011 to design and manufacture plug-in electric vehicles.[31][32] The sub-brand initial plans called for the release of two vehicles; series production of the BMW i3 all-electric car began in September 2013,[33] and the market launch took place in November 2013 with the first retail deliveries in Germany.[34] The BMW i8 sports plug-in hybrid car was launched in Germany in June 2014.[35] Combined sales of the BMW i brand models reached the 50,000 unit milestone in January 2016.[36] Two years after its introduction, the BMW i3 ranked as the world's third best selling all-electric car in history.[37] Global sales of the BMW i3 achieved the 50,000 unit milestone in July 2016.[38]
In February 2016, BMW announced the introduction of the "iPerformance" model designation, which will be given to all BMW plug-in hybrid vehicles from July 2016. The aim is to provide a visible indicator of the transfer of technology from BMW i to the BMW core brand. The new designation will be used first on the plug-in hybrid variants of the latest BMW 7 Series.[39] Global sales of all BMW plug-in electrified models achieved the 100,000 unit milestone in early November 2016, consisting of more than 60,000 BMW i3s, over 10,000 BMW i8s, and about 30,000 from combined sales of all BMW iPerformance plug-in hybrid models.[40]
As of November 2016[update], four BMW electrified models have been released, the BMW X5 xDrive40e iPerformance, BMW 225xe iPerformance Active Tourer, BMW 330e iPerformance, and the BMW 740e iPerformance.[41] The BMW 530e iPerformance is scheduled to be released in Europe March 2017 as part of the upcoming seventh generation BMW 5 Series lineup.[42] In November 2016, BMW announced the company expected to deliver 60,000 of its electrified i and iPerformance models in 2016, and a sales target of 100,000 units for 2017. BMW set the goal to expand the share of its electrified models to between 15% and 25% of sales by 2025,[43] when batteries have doubled their capacity.[44]
In 2015, BMW in cooperation with SCHERM Group has started deploying electric trucks on European roads, making it the first company to ever do so. The truck itself is manufactured by the Terberg Group, one of the world's largest independent specialist vehicle suppliers.[45][46][47]

In 2015, BMW Australia launched a customer portal that included integrated access to the new services and apps.[59]
Sponsorships
In football, BMW sponsors Bundesliga club Eintracht Frankfurt.[60]
It was an official sponsor of the London 2012 olympics providing 4000 BMWs and Minis in a deal made in November 2009.[61] The company also made a six-year sponsorship deal with the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) in July 2010.[62]
BMW has sponsored various European golf events such as the PGA Championship at Wentworth, the BMW Italian Open and the BMW International Open in Germany.[63]
In 2012, BMW Australia announced a 2-year sponsorship agreement with the Australian Film Institute's Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts (AACTA) Awards. As part of the agreement, BMW supplied a fleet of vehicles renowned for appearing in feature films.[64] The vehicles supplied included a range of elegant BMW limousines, iconic BMW's of the past and the BMW 6 Series which featured in Mission Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol. The automotive company also sponsored the South African national Rugby team. The sponsorship was cancelled due to controversies on the Rugby team's part.[65]
Environmental record
The company is a charter member of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Environmental Achievement Track, which recognizes companies for their environmental stewardship and performance.[66] It is also a member of the South Carolina Environmental Excellence Program.[67]
In 2012, BMW was named the world's most sustainable automotive company for the eighth consecutive year by the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes. The BMW Group is the only automotive enterprise in the index since its inception in 1999. In 2001, the BMW Group committed itself to the United Nations Environment Programme, the UN Global Compact and the Cleaner Production Declaration. It was also the first company in the automotive industry to appoint an environmental officer, in 1973.[68] BMW is a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.[69]
BMW is industry leader in the Carbon Disclosure Project's Global 500 ranking and 3rd place in Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index across all industries. BMW is listed in the FTSE4GoodIndex. The BMW Group was rated the most sustainable DAX 30 company by Sustainalytics in 2012.[70]
BMW has taken measures to reduce the impact the company has on the environment. It is trying to design less-polluting cars by making existing models more efficient, as well as developing environmentally friendly fuels for future vehicles. Possibilities include: electric power, hybrid power (combustion engines and electric motors) hydrogen engines.[71]
BMW offers 49 models with EU5/6 emissions norm and nearly 20 models with CO2 output less than 140 g/km, which puts it on the lowest tax group and therefore could provide the future owner with eco-bonus offered from some European countries.
However, there have been some criticisms directed at BMW, and in particular, accusations of greenwash in reference to their BMW Hydrogen 7. Some critics claim that the emissions produced during hydrogen fuel production outweigh the reduction of tailpipe emissions, and that the Hydrogen 7 is a distraction from more immediate, practical solutions for car pollution.[72] The BBC's Jorn Madslien questioned whether the Hydrogen 7 was "a truly green initiative or merely a cynical marketing ploy"[73]
Bicycles
BMW has created a range of high-end bicycles sold online and through dealerships. They range from the Kid's Bike to the EUR 4,499 Enduro Bike.[74] In the United States, only the Cruise Bike and Kid's Bike models are sold.
BMW nomenclature




BMW 530d (F10)






BMW 730d xDrive (G11)






BMW X5 (F15)






BMW X6 (E71)


BMW vehicles follow a certain nomenclature; usually a 3 digit number is followed by 1 or 2 letters. The first number represents the series number. The next two numbers traditionally represent the engine displacement in cubic centimeters divided by 100.[75] However, more recent cars use those two numbers as a performance index, as e.g. the 116i, 118i and 120i (all 2,0L petrol-powered), just like the 325d and 330d (both 3,0L diesel) share the same motor block while adjusting engine power through setup and turbocharging. A similar nomenclature is used by BMW Motorrad for their motorcycles.
The system of letters can be used in combination, and is as follows:

A = automatic transmission
C = coupé, last used on the BMW E46 and the BMW E63 (dropped after 2005 model year)
c = cabriolet
d = diesel†
e = eta (efficient economy, from the Greek letter 'η')
g = compressed natural gas/CNG
h = hydrogen
i = fuel-injected
L = long wheelbase
M = Motorsport
s = sport, also means "2 dr" on E36 model††
sDrive = rear-wheel drive
T = touring (wagon/estate)
Ti = hatchback for the BMW 3 Series hatchback
x / xDrive = BMW xDrive all-wheel drive

† historic nomenclature indicating "td" refers to "Turbo Diesel", not a diesel hatchback or touring model (524td, 525td)
†† typically includes sport seats, spoiler, aerodynamic body kit, upgraded wheels and Limit Slip Differential on pre-95 model etc.
For example, the BMW 750iL is a fuel-injected 7 Series with a long wheelbase and 5.4 litres of displacement. This badge was used for successive generations, E65 and F01, except the "i" and "L" switched places, so it read "Li" instead of "iL".
When 'L' supersedes the series number (e.g. L6, L7, etc.) it identifies the vehicle as a special luxury variant, having extended leather and special interior appointments. The L7 is based on the E23 and E38, and the L6 is based on the E24.
When 'X' is capitalised and supersedes the series number (e.g. X3, X5, etc.) it identifies the vehicle as one of BMW's Sports Activity Vehicles (SAV), their brand of crossovers, with BMW's xDrive. The second number in the 'X' series denotes the platform that it is based upon, for instance the X5 is derived from the 5 Series. Unlike BMW cars, the SAV's main badge does not denote engine size; the engine is instead indicated on side badges.
The 'Z' identifies the vehicle as a two-seat roadster (e.g. Z1, Z3, Z4, etc.). 'M' variants of 'Z' models have the 'M' as a suffix or prefix, depending on country of sale (e.g. 'Z4 M' is 'M Roadster' in Canada).
Previous X & Z vehicles had 'i' or 'si' following the engine displacement number (denoted in litres). BMW is now globally standardising this nomenclature on X & Z vehicles by using 'sDrive' or 'xDrive' (simply meaning rear or all-wheel drive, respectively) followed by two numbers which vaguely represent the vehicle's engine (e.g. Z4 sDrive35i is a rear-wheel-drive Z4 roadster with a 3.0 L twin-turbo fuel-injected engine).[76]
BMW last used the 's' for the E36 328is, which ceased production in 1999. However, the 's' nomenclature was brought back on the 2011 model year BMW 335is and BMW Z4 sDrive35is. The 335is is a sport-tuned trim with more performance and an optional dual clutch transmission that slots between the regular 335i and top-of-the-line M3.[77][78]
The 'M' – for Motorsport – identifies the vehicle as a high-performance model of a particular series (e.g. M3, M5, M6, etc.). For example, the M6 is the highest performing vehicle in the 6 Series lineup. Although 'M' cars should be separated into their respective series platforms, it is very common to see 'M' cars grouped together as its own lineup on the official BMW website.
Exceptions
There are exceptions to the numbering nomenclature.[79]
The M version of the BMW 1 Series was named the BMW 1 Series M Coupe rather than the traditional style "M1" due to the possible confusion with BMW's former BMW M1 homologation sports car.
The M versions of the Sports Activity Vehicles, such as the X5 M, could not follow the regular naming convention since MX5 was used for Mazda's MX-5 Miata.
For instance in the 2008 model year, the BMW 125i/128i, 328i, and 528i all had 3.0 naturally aspirated engines (N52), not a 2,500 cc or 2,800 cc engine as the series designation number would lead one to believe. The '28' is to denote a detuned engine in the 2008 cars, compared to the 2006 model year '30' vehicles (330i and 530i) whose 3.0 naturally aspirated engines are from the same N52 family but had more output.
The 2008 BMW 335i and 535i also have 3.0-litre engine; however the engines are twin-turbocharged (N54) which is not identified by the nomenclature. Nonetheless the '35' indicates a more powerful engine than previous '30' models that have the naturally aspirated N52 engine. The 2011 BMW 740i and 335is shares the same twin-turbo 3.0 engine from the N54 family but tuned to higher outputs, although the badging is not consistent ('40' and 's'). The 2013 BMW 640i Gran Coupe's twin-scroll single turbo 3.0L inline-6 engine makes similar output to the older twin turbo inline-6 engines.[80]
The E36 and E46 323i and E39 523i had 2.5-litre engines. The E36 318is made after 1996 has a 1.9 L engine (M44) as opposed to the 1.8 L (M42) used in the 1992 to 1995 models. The E36 316i "Contour" manufactured between 1999 and 2000 could be fitted with the 1.9 L M43B19 (M43). The E39 540i had a 4.4 L M62 engine, instead of a 4.0 L as the designation would suggest.
The badging for recent V8 engines (N62 and N63) also does not indicate displacement, as the 2006 750i and 2009 750i have 4800 cc (naturally aspirated) and 4400 cc (twin-turbocharged) engines, respectively.
In BMW CSL models (for example BMW M3 CSL), the letter L stands for Leichtbau (German for lightweight) instead of Lang (German for long wheelbase).
Carsharing services
In June 2011, BMW and Sixt launched Drivenow, a joint-venture that provides carsharing services in several cities in Europe and North America. As of December 2012, DriveNow operates over 1,000 vehicles, which serve five cities worldwide and over 60,000 customers.[81]
BMW has expanded its DriveNow car-sharing service in Seattle, rebranded as ReachNow.[82]
Light and Charge
BMW has developed street lights equipped with sockets to charge electric cars, called Light and Charge.[83]
Community

From the summer of 2001 until October 2005, BMW hosted The Hire, showcasing sporty models being driven to extremes.[84] These videos are still popular within the enthusiast community and proved to be a ground-breaking online advertising campaign.
Annually since 1999, BMW enthusiasts have met in Santa Barbara, CA to attend Bimmerfest. One of the largest brand-specific gatherings in the United States, over 3,000 people attended in 2006, and over 1,000 BMW cars were present. In 2007, the event was held on 5 May.
BMW slang
The initials BMW are pronounced [ˈbeː ˈɛm ˈveː] in German.[85] The model series are referred to as "Einser" ("One-er" for 1 series), "Dreier" ("Three-er" for 3 series), "Fünfer" ("Five-er" for the 5 series), "Sechser" ("Six-er" for the 6 series), "Siebener" ("Seven-er" for the 7 series). These are not actually slang, but are the normal way that such letters and numbers are pronounced in German.[86]
The English slang terms Beemer, Bimmer and Bee-em are variously used for BMWs of all kinds,[87][88] cars and motorcycles.[89][90]
In the US, specialists have been at pains to prescribe that a distinction must be made between using Beemer exclusively to describe BMW motorcycles, and using Bimmer only to refer to BMW cars,[91][92][93] in the manner of a "true aficionado"[94] and avoid appearing to be "uninitiated."[95][96] The Canadian Globe and Mail prefers Bimmer and calls Beemer a "yuppie abomination,"[97] while the Tacoma News Tribune says it is a distinction made by "auto snobs."[98] Using the wrong slang risks offending BMW enthusiasts.[99][100][101] An editor of Business Week was satisfied in 2003 that the question was resolved in favor of Bimmer by noting that a Google search yielded 10 times as many hits compared to Beemer.[102]
The arts




1975 BMW 3.0CSL painted by Alexander Calder


Manufacturers employ designers for their cars, but BMW has made efforts to gain recognition for exceptional contributions to and support of the arts, including art beyond motor vehicle design. These efforts typically overlap or complement BMW's marketing and branding campaigns.[103] BMW Headquarters designed in 1972 by Karl Schwanzer has become a European icon,[104] and artist Gerhard Richter created his Red, Yellow, Blue series of paintings for the building's lobby.[105][106] In 1975, Alexander Calder was commissioned to paint the 3.0CSL driven by Hervé Poulain at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. This led to more BMW Art Cars, painted by artists including David Hockney, Jenny Holzer, Roy Lichtenstein, and others. The cars, currently numbering 17, have been shown at the Louvre, Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, and, in 2009, at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and New York's Grand Central Terminal.[104] BMW was the principal sponsor of the 1998 The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and other Guggenheim museums, though the financial relationship between BMW and the Guggenheim was criticised in many quarters.[107][108]
In 2012, BMW brought out the BMW Art Guide by Independent Collectors, which had, amongst others, the Dikeou Collection. It is the first global guide to private and publicly accessible collections of contemporary art worldwide.[109]

South Africa
BMWs have been assembled in South Africa since 1968,[119] when Praetor Monteerders' plant was opened in Rosslyn, near Pretoria. BMW initially bought shares in the company, before fully acquiring it in 1975; in so doing, the company became BMW South Africa, the first wholly owned subsidiary of BMW to be established outside Germany. Three unique models that BMW Motorsport created for the South African market were the E23 M745i (1983), which used the M88 engine from the BMW M1, the BMW 333i (1986), which added a six-cylinder 3.2-litre M30 engine to the E30,[120] and the E30 BMW 325is (1989) which was powered by an Alpina-derived 2.7-litre engine.
Unlike United States manufacturers, such as Ford and GM, which divested from the country in the 1980s, BMW retained full ownership of its operations in South Africa. Following the end of apartheid in 1994, and the lowering of import tariffs, BMW South Africa ended local production of the 5-Series and 7-Series, in order to concentrate on production of the 3-Series for the export market. South African–built BMWs are now exported to right hand drive markets including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Hong Kong, as well as Sub-Saharan Africa. Since 1997, BMW South Africa has produced vehicles in left-hand drive for export to Taiwan, the United States and Iran, as well as South America.
BMWs with a VIN starting with "NC0" are manufactured in South Africa.
United States




BMW Spartanburg factory


The BMW Manufacturing Company opened in 1994, in South Carolina, and has been manufacturing all Z4 and X5 models, and more recently the X6 and X3, including those for export to Europe, on the same assembly line in Greer between Greenville and Spartanburg.[121] In an average work day the company builds 600 vehicles: 500 X5s and 100 Z4s. The engines for these vehicles are built in Munich, Germany. BMWs with a VIN starting with "4US and 5US" are manufactured in Greer.
In 2010 BMW announced that it would spend $750 million to expand operations at the Greer plant. This expansion will allow production of 240,000 vehicles a year and will make the plant the largest car factory in the United States by number of employees.[122] BMW's largest single market is the United States, where 339 dealerships sold 346,023 cars in 2015.[123]
As of 2015[update], the Greer facility produces all BMW X3, X4, X5, X5 M, X6 and X6 M models.[124]
Marketing
BMW began using the slogan 'The Ultimate Driving Machine' in the 1970s. In 2010, this long-lived campaign was mostly supplanted by 'Joy', a campaign intended to make the brand more "approachable" and to better appeal to women, but by 2012 they had returned to "The Ultimate Driving Machine", which has a strong public association with BMW.[125]
Audio logo
In 2013, BMW replaced the 'double-gong' sound used in TV and Radio advertising campaigns since 1998. The new sound, developed to represent the future identity of BMW, was described as "introduced by a rising, resonant sound and underscored by two distinctive bass tones that form the sound logo's melodic and rhythmic basis."[126] The new sound was first used in BMW 4 Series Concept Coupe TV commercial.[127] The sound was produced by Thomas Kisser of HASTINGS media music.[128]
Roundel logo




The round BMW logo used for all models


The circular blue and white BMW logo or roundel evolved from the circular Rapp Motorenwerke company logo, from which the BMW company grew, combined with the blue and white colors of the flag of Bavaria.[129] The logo has been portrayed as the movement of an aircraft propeller with the white blades cutting through a blue sky—first used in a BMW advertisement in 1929, twelve years after the roundel was created—but this is not the origin of the logo itself.[130] The BMW logo still used today was created in early 1920.[131]
Problems
Theft using OBD, 2012
In 2012, BMW vehicles were stolen by programming a blank key fob to start the car through the on-board diagnostics (OBD) connection.[132][133][134] The primary causes of this vulnerability lie in the lack of appropriate authentication and authorization in the OBD specifications, which rely largely on security through obscurity. BMW offered all owners a free fix through a software update, and all newer vehicles have upgraded software that fixed this vulnerability.[135]
ConnectedDrive, 2010–14
Dieter Spaar was asked by ADAC to analyze ConnectedDrive and its hardware called Combox. He uncovered the following problems which allowed him e.g. to remotely open the car:[136]

BMW uses the same symmetric keys in all cars.
some services do not encrypt transported data while connecting to the BMW backend.
the integrity of the ConnectedDrive configuration is not protected.
the Combox discloses the vehicle identification number via NGTP (next generation telematics pattern) error messages.
data sent via SMS in NGTP format are encrypted via the nowadays unsecure DES.
the Combox does not protect against replay attacks.

BMW was notified in advance of the publication to provide fixes. The transport is now encrypted and BMW's server certificate is verified. The updates were delivered via ConnectedDrive config change. All BMW, Mini and Rolls Royce cars produced between March 2010 and 8 December 2014 are vulnerable. Cars without battery or parked in places without mobile connection still may be vulnerable, an update can be initiated manually.

BMW was established as a business entity following a restructuring of the Rapp Motorenwerke aircraft manufacturing firm in 1912 named Aerowerke Gustav Otto. After the end of World War I in 1918, BMW was forced to cease aircraft-engine production by the terms of the Versailles Armistice Treaty.[5] The company consequently shifted to motorcycle production as the restrictions of the treaty started to be lifted in 1923,[6] followed by automobiles in 1928–29.[7][8][9]
The first car which BMW successfully produced and the car which launched BMW on the road to automobile production was the Dixi, based on the Austin 7 and licensed from the Austin Motor Company in Birmingham, England.
BMW's first significant aircraft engine, and commercial product of any sort, was the BMW IIIa inline-six liquid-cooled engine of 1918, known for good fuel economy and high-altitude performance.[10] With German rearmament in the 1930s, the company again began producing aircraft engines for the Luftwaffe. The factory in Munich made ample use of forced labour: foreign civilians, prisoners of war and inmates of the concentration camp Dachau [1]. Among its successful World War II engine designs were the BMW 132 and BMW 801 air-cooled radial engines, and the pioneering BMW 003 axial-flow turbojet, which powered the tiny, 1944–1945–era jet-powered "emergency fighter", the Heinkel He 162 Spatz. The BMW 003 jet engine was first tested as a prime power plant in the first prototype of the Messerschmitt Me 262, the Me 262 V1, but in 1942 tests the BMW prototype engines failed on takeoff with only the standby Junkers Jumo 210 nose-mounted piston engine powering it to a safe landing.[11][12] The few Me 262 A-1b test examples built used the more developed version of the 003 jet, recording an official top speed of 800 km/h (497 mph). The first-ever four-engine jet aircraft ever flown were the sixth and eighth prototypes of the Arado Ar 234 jet reconnaissance-bomber, which used BMW 003 jets for power. Through 1944 the 003's reliability improved, making it a suitable power plant for air frame designs competing for the Jägernotprogramm's light fighter production contract. which was won by the Heinkel He 162 Spatz design. The BMW 003 aviation turbojet was also under consideration as the basic starting point for a pioneering turboshaft powerplant for German armored fighting vehicles in 1944–45, as the GT 101.[13] Towards the end of the Third Reich, BMW developed some military aircraft projects for the Luftwaffe, the BMW Strahlbomber, the BMW Schnellbomber and the BMW Strahljäger, but none of them were built.[14][15]
[more detail]
By the year 1958, the automotive division of BMW was in financial difficulties and a shareholders meeting was held to decide whether to go into liquidation or find an alternative. It was decided to carry on by trying to cash in on the current economy car boom exploited so successfully by German ex-aircraft manufacturers such as Messerschmitt and Heinkel. BMW bought the rights to manufacture the Italian Iso Isetta. BMW's version of the tiny cars were to be powered by a modified form of BMW's motorcycle engine. This was moderately successful and helped the company get back on its feet.
Since 1959, the controlling majority shareholder of the BMW Aktiengesellschaft has been the Quandt family, which owns about 46% of the stock. The rest is in public float.
BMW acquired the Hans Glas company based in Dingolfing, Germany, in 1966. Glas vehicles were briefly badged as BMW until the company was fully absorbed. It was reputed that the acquisition was mainly to gain access to Glas' development of the timing belt with an overhead camshaft in automotive applications,[16] although some saw Glas' Dingolfing plant as another incentive. However, this factory was outmoded and BMW's biggest immediate gain was, according to themselves, a stock of highly qualified engineers and other personnel.[17] The Glas factories continued to build a limited number of their existing models, while adding the manufacture of BMW front and rear axles until they could be closer incorporated into BMW.[18]




BMW 3-Series (F30)


In 1992, BMW acquired a large stake in California-based industrial design studio DesignworksUSA, which they fully acquired in 1995. In 1994, BMW bought the British Rover Group[19] (which at the time consisted of the Rover, Land Rover and MG brands as well as the rights to defunct brands including Austin and Morris), and owned it for six years. By 2000, Rover was incurring huge losses and BMW decided to sell the combine. The MG and Rover brands were sold to the Phoenix Consortium to form MG Rover, while Land Rover was taken over by Ford. BMW, meanwhile, retained the rights to build the new Mini, which was launched in 2001.
Chief designer Chris Bangle announced his departure from BMW in February 2009, after serving on the design team for nearly seventeen years.[20] He was replaced by Adrian van Hooydonk, Bangle's former right-hand man. Bangle was known for his radical designs such as the 2002 7-Series and the 2002 Z4. In July 2007, the production rights for Husqvarna Motorcycles was purchased by BMW for a reported 93 million euros. BMW Motorrad plans to continue operating Husqvarna Motorcycles as a separate enterprise. All development, sales and production activities, as well as the current workforce, have remained in place at its present location at Varese.
In June 2012, BMW was listed as the #1 most reputable company in the world by Forbes.com.[21] Rankings are based upon aspects such as "people's willingness to buy, recommend, work for, and invest in a company is driven 60% by their perceptions of the company and only 40% by their perceptions of their products."

The R32 motorcycle, the first BMW motor vehicle.






The 2015 BMW R1200RT


BMW began production of motorcycle engines and then motorcycles after World War I.[28] Its motorcycle brand is now known as BMW Motorrad. Their first successful motorcycle after the failed Helios and Flink, was the "R32" in 1923, though production originally began in 1921.[29] This had a "boxer" twin engine, in which a cylinder projects into the air-flow from each side of the machine. Apart from their single-cylinder models (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMW's are still produced in this layout, which is designated the R Series.
During the Second World War, BMW produced the BMW R75 motorcycle with a sidecar attached. Having a unique design copied from the Zündapp KS750, its sidecar wheel was also motor-driven. Combined with a lockable differential, this made the vehicle very capable off-road, an equivalent in many ways to the Jeep.
In 1982, came the K Series, shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven F and G series with single and parallel twin Rotax engines.
In the early 1990s, BMW updated the airhead Boxer engine which became known as the oilhead. In 2002, the oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to 1,170 cc and enhanced performance to 100 hp (75 kW) for the R1200GS, compared to 85 hp (63 kW) of the previous R1150GS. More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the R1100S and R1200S, producing 98 and 122 hp (73 and 91 kW), respectively.
In 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It had an engine producing 167 hp (125 kW), derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team, and is lighter than previous K models. Innovations include electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork that BMW calls Duolever.
BMW introduced anti-lock brakes on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s. The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles pave the way for the introduction of electronic stability control, or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year.
BMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an Earles fork, front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called swinging arm). Some BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking.
BMW Group, on 31 January 2013, announced that Pierer Industrie AG has bought Husqvarna for an undisclosed amount, which will not be revealed by either party in the future. The company is headed by Stephan Pierer (CEO of KTM). Pierer Industrie AG is 51% owner of KTM and 100% owner of Husqvarna.

New Class
Main article: BMW New Class
The New Class (German: Neue Klasse) was a line of compact sedans and coupes starting with the 1962 1500 and continuing through the last 2002s in 1977. Powered by BMW's celebrated four-cylinder M10 engine, the New Class models had a fully independent suspension, MacPherson struts in front, and front disc brakes. Initially, a family of four-door sedans and two-door coupes, the New Class line was broadened to two-door sports sedans with the addition of the 02 Series 1600 and 2002 in 1966.
Sharing little in common with the rest of the line beyond power train, the sporty siblings caught auto enthusiasts' attention and established BMW as an international brand. Precursors to the famed BMW 3 Series, the two-doors' success cemented the firm's future as an upper tier performance car maker. New Class four-doors with numbers ending in "0" were replaced by the larger BMW 5 Series in 1972. The upscale 2000C and 2000CS coupes were replaced by the six-cylinder BMW E9, introduced in 1969 with the 2800CS. The 1600 two-door was discontinued in 1975, and the 2002 was replaced by the 320i in 1975.
Current models




BMW X1 (F48)






BMW 6 Series (F13)


The 1 Series, originally launched in 2004, is BMW's smallest car. Currently available are the second generation hatchback (F20/F21) and its two-door counterparts, the 2 Series coupe and convertible (F22/F23). The 3 Series, a compact executive car manufactured since model year 1975, is currently in its sixth generation (F30); models include the sports sedan (F30), the fourth generation station wagon (F31) and the Gran Turismo. Starting with the current generation, the 3 Series coupe and convertible are now branded as 4 Series models (F32 and F33 respectively). The 5 Series is a mid-size luxury car, available in sedan (F10) and station wagon (F11) forms. The 5 Series Gran Turismo (F07), which debuted in 2010, created a segment between station wagons and crossover SUV.[30]
BMW's full-size flagship executive sedan is the 7 Series. Typically, BMW introduces many of their innovations in the 7 Series, such as the iDrive system. The latest generation (G11) debuted in 2015. Based on the 5 Series' platform, the 6 Series is BMW's grand touring luxury sport coupe/convertible (F12/F13). A 2-seater roadster and coupe which succeeded the Z3, the Z4 has been sold since 2002.




BMW X3 (F25)


The X3 (F25), BMW's second crossover SUV (called SAV or "Sports Activity Vehicle" by BMW) debuted in 2010 and replaced the X3 (E83)-), which was based on the E46 3 Series' platform, and had been in production since 2003. Marketed in Europe as an off-roader, it benefits from BMW's xDrive all-wheel drive system. The all-wheel drive X5 (E53) was BMW's first crossover SUV (SAV), based on the 5-Series, and is a mid-size luxury SUV sold by BMW since 2000. A 4-seat crossover SUV released by BMW in December 2007, the X6 is marketed as a "Sports Activity Coupe" (SAC) by BMW. The X1 is now in its second generation and extends the BMW X-lineup.

Plug-in electric models
Main article: BMW i




BMW i3 electric car






BMW i8 plug-in hybrid


The BMW i is a sub-brand of BMW founded in 2011 to design and manufacture plug-in electric vehicles.[31][32] The sub-brand initial plans called for the release of two vehicles; series production of the BMW i3 all-electric car began in September 2013,[33] and the market launch took place in November 2013 with the first retail deliveries in Germany.[34] The BMW i8 sports plug-in hybrid car was launched in Germany in June 2014.[35] Combined sales of the BMW i brand models reached the 50,000 unit milestone in January 2016.[36] Two years after its introduction, the BMW i3 ranked as the world's third best selling all-electric car in history.[37] Global sales of the BMW i3 achieved the 50,000 unit milestone in July 2016.[38]
In February 2016, BMW announced the introduction of the "iPerformance" model designation, which will be given to all BMW plug-in hybrid vehicles from July 2016. The aim is to provide a visible indicator of the transfer of technology from BMW i to the BMW core brand. The new designation will be used first on the plug-in hybrid variants of the latest BMW 7 Series.[39] Global sales of all BMW plug-in electrified models achieved the 100,000 unit milestone in early November 2016, consisting of more than 60,000 BMW i3s, over 10,000 BMW i8s, and about 30,000 from combined sales of all BMW iPerformance plug-in hybrid models.[40]
As of November 2016[update], four BMW electrified models have been released, the BMW X5 xDrive40e iPerformance, BMW 225xe iPerformance Active Tourer, BMW 330e iPerformance, and the BMW 740e iPerformance.[41] The BMW 530e iPerformance is scheduled to be released in Europe March 2017 as part of the upcoming seventh generation BMW 5 Series lineup.[42] In November 2016, BMW announced the company expected to deliver 60,000 of its electrified i and iPerformance models in 2016, and a sales target of 100,000 units for 2017. BMW set the goal to expand the share of its electrified models to between 15% and 25% of sales by 2025,[43] when batteries have doubled their capacity.[44]
In 2015, BMW in cooperation with SCHERM Group has started deploying electric trucks on European roads, making it the first company to ever do so. The truck itself is manufactured by the Terberg Group, one of the world's largest independent specialist vehicle suppliers.[45][46][47]

The ConnectedDrive update[57] introduced real-time traffic data, concierge and a new emergency call system to work alongside BMW's existing driver assistance services.[58]
In 2015, BMW Australia launched a customer portal that included integrated access to the new services and apps.[59]
Sponsorships
In football, BMW sponsors Bundesliga club Eintracht Frankfurt.[60]
It was an official sponsor of the London 2012 olympics providing 4000 BMWs and Minis in a deal made in November 2009.[61] The company also made a six-year sponsorship deal with the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) in July 2010.[62]
BMW has sponsored various European golf events such as the PGA Championship at Wentworth, the BMW Italian Open and the BMW International Open in Germany.[63]
In 2012, BMW Australia announced a 2-year sponsorship agreement with the Australian Film Institute's Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts (AACTA) Awards. As part of the agreement, BMW supplied a fleet of vehicles renowned for appearing in feature films.[64] The vehicles supplied included a range of elegant BMW limousines, iconic BMW's of the past and the BMW 6 Series which featured in Mission Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol. The automotive company also sponsored the South African national Rugby team. The sponsorship was cancelled due to controversies on the Rugby team's part.[65]
Environmental record
The company is a charter member of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Environmental Achievement Track, which recognizes companies for their environmental stewardship and performance.[66] It is also a member of the South Carolina Environmental Excellence Program.[67]
In 2012, BMW was named the world's most sustainable automotive company for the eighth consecutive year by the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes. The BMW Group is the only automotive enterprise in the index since its inception in 1999. In 2001, the BMW Group committed itself to the United Nations Environment Programme, the UN Global Compact and the Cleaner Production Declaration. It was also the first company in the automotive industry to appoint an environmental officer, in 1973.[68] BMW is a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.[69]
BMW is industry leader in the Carbon Disclosure Project's Global 500 ranking and 3rd place in Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index across all industries. BMW is listed in the FTSE4GoodIndex. The BMW Group was rated the most sustainable DAX 30 company by Sustainalytics in 2012.[70]
BMW has taken measures to reduce the impact the company has on the environment. It is trying to design less-polluting cars by making existing models more efficient, as well as developing environmentally friendly fuels for future vehicles. Possibilities include: electric power, hybrid power (combustion engines and electric motors) hydrogen engines.[71]
BMW offers 49 models with EU5/6 emissions norm and nearly 20 models with CO2 output less than 140 g/km, which puts it on the lowest tax group and therefore could provide the future owner with eco-bonus offered from some European countries.
However, there have been some criticisms directed at BMW, and in particular, accusations of greenwash in reference to their BMW Hydrogen 7. Some critics claim that the emissions produced during hydrogen fuel production outweigh the reduction of tailpipe emissions, and that the Hydrogen 7 is a distraction from more immediate, practical solutions for car pollution.[72] The BBC's Jorn Madslien questioned whether the Hydrogen 7 was "a truly green initiative or merely a cynical marketing ploy"[73]
Bicycles
BMW has created a range of high-end bicycles sold online and through dealerships. They range from the Kid's Bike to the EUR 4,499 Enduro Bike.[74] In the United States, only the Cruise Bike and Kid's Bike models are sold.
BMW nomenclature




BMW 530d (F10)






BMW 730d xDrive (G11)






BMW X5 (F15)






BMW X6 (E71)


BMW vehicles follow a certain nomenclature; usually a 3 digit number is followed by 1 or 2 letters. The first number represents the series number. The next two numbers traditionally represent the engine displacement in cubic centimeters divided by 100.[75] However, more recent cars use those two numbers as a performance index, as e.g. the 116i, 118i and 120i (all 2,0L petrol-powered), just like the 325d and 330d (both 3,0L diesel) share the same motor block while adjusting engine power through setup and turbocharging. A similar nomenclature is used by BMW Motorrad for their motorcycles.
The system of letters can be used in combination, and is as follows:

A = automatic transmission
C = coupé, last used on the BMW E46 and the BMW E63 (dropped after 2005 model year)
c = cabriolet
d = diesel†
e = eta (efficient economy, from the Greek letter 'η')
g = compressed natural gas/CNG
h = hydrogen
i = fuel-injected
L = long wheelbase
M = Motorsport
s = sport, also means "2 dr" on E36 model††
sDrive = rear-wheel drive
T = touring (wagon/estate)
Ti = hatchback for the BMW 3 Series hatchback
x / xDrive = BMW xDrive all-wheel drive

† historic nomenclature indicating "td" refers to "Turbo Diesel", not a diesel hatchback or touring model (524td, 525td)
†† typically includes sport seats, spoiler, aerodynamic body kit, upgraded wheels and Limit Slip Differential on pre-95 model etc.
For example, the BMW 750iL is a fuel-injected 7 Series with a long wheelbase and 5.4 litres of displacement. This badge was used for successive generations, E65 and F01, except the "i" and "L" switched places, so it read "Li" instead of "iL".
When 'L' supersedes the series number (e.g. L6, L7, etc.) it identifies the vehicle as a special luxury variant, having extended leather and special interior appointments. The L7 is based on the E23 and E38, and the L6 is based on the E24.
When 'X' is capitalised and supersedes the series number (e.g. X3, X5, etc.) it identifies the vehicle as one of BMW's Sports Activity Vehicles (SAV), their brand of crossovers, with BMW's xDrive. The second number in the 'X' series denotes the platform that it is based upon, for instance the X5 is derived from the 5 Series. Unlike BMW cars, the SAV's main badge does not denote engine size; the engine is instead indicated on side badges.
The 'Z' identifies the vehicle as a two-seat roadster (e.g. Z1, Z3, Z4, etc.). 'M' variants of 'Z' models have the 'M' as a suffix or prefix, depending on country of sale (e.g. 'Z4 M' is 'M Roadster' in Canada).
Previous X & Z vehicles had 'i' or 'si' following the engine displacement number (denoted in litres). BMW is now globally standardising this nomenclature on X & Z vehicles by using 'sDrive' or 'xDrive' (simply meaning rear or all-wheel drive, respectively) followed by two numbers which vaguely represent the vehicle's engine (e.g. Z4 sDrive35i is a rear-wheel-drive Z4 roadster with a 3.0 L twin-turbo fuel-injected engine).[76]
BMW last used the 's' for the E36 328is, which ceased production in 1999. However, the 's' nomenclature was brought back on the 2011 model year BMW 335is and BMW Z4 sDrive35is. The 335is is a sport-tuned trim with more performance and an optional dual clutch transmission that slots between the regular 335i and top-of-the-line M3.[77][78]
The 'M' – for Motorsport – identifies the vehicle as a high-performance model of a particular series (e.g. M3, M5, M6, etc.). For example, the M6 is the highest performing vehicle in the 6 Series lineup. Although 'M' cars should be separated into their respective series platforms, it is very common to see 'M' cars grouped together as its own lineup on the official BMW website.
Exceptions
There are exceptions to the numbering nomenclature.[79]
The M version of the BMW 1 Series was named the BMW 1 Series M Coupe rather than the traditional style "M1" due to the possible confusion with BMW's former BMW M1 homologation sports car.
The M versions of the Sports Activity Vehicles, such as the X5 M, could not follow the regular naming convention since MX5 was used for Mazda's MX-5 Miata.
For instance in the 2008 model year, the BMW 125i/128i, 328i, and 528i all had 3.0 naturally aspirated engines (N52), not a 2,500 cc or 2,800 cc engine as the series designation number would lead one to believe. The '28' is to denote a detuned engine in the 2008 cars, compared to the 2006 model year '30' vehicles (330i and 530i) whose 3.0 naturally aspirated engines are from the same N52 family but had more output.
The 2008 BMW 335i and 535i also have 3.0-litre engine; however the engines are twin-turbocharged (N54) which is not identified by the nomenclature. Nonetheless the '35' indicates a more powerful engine than previous '30' models that have the naturally aspirated N52 engine. The 2011 BMW 740i and 335is shares the same twin-turbo 3.0 engine from the N54 family but tuned to higher outputs, although the badging is not consistent ('40' and 's'). The 2013 BMW 640i Gran Coupe's twin-scroll single turbo 3.0L inline-6 engine makes similar output to the older twin turbo inline-6 engines.[80]
The E36 and E46 323i and E39 523i had 2.5-litre engines. The E36 318is made after 1996 has a 1.9 L engine (M44) as opposed to the 1.8 L (M42) used in the 1992 to 1995 models. The E36 316i "Contour" manufactured between 1999 and 2000 could be fitted with the 1.9 L M43B19 (M43). The E39 540i had a 4.4 L M62 engine, instead of a 4.0 L as the designation would suggest.
The badging for recent V8 engines (N62 and N63) also does not indicate displacement, as the 2006 750i and 2009 750i have 4800 cc (naturally aspirated) and 4400 cc (twin-turbocharged) engines, respectively.
In BMW CSL models (for example BMW M3 CSL), the letter L stands for Leichtbau (German for lightweight) instead of Lang (German for long wheelbase).
Carsharing services
In June 2011, BMW and Sixt launched Drivenow, a joint-venture that provides carsharing services in several cities in Europe and North America. As of December 2012, DriveNow operates over 1,000 vehicles, which serve five cities worldwide and over 60,000 customers.[81]
BMW has expanded its DriveNow car-sharing service in Seattle, rebranded as ReachNow.[82]
Light and Charge
BMW has developed street lights equipped with sockets to charge electric cars, called Light and Charge.[83]
Community




BMW logo sign in Düsseldorf


From the summer of 2001 until October 2005, BMW hosted The Hire, showcasing sporty models being driven to extremes.[84] These videos are still popular within the enthusiast community and proved to be a ground-breaking online advertising campaign.
Annually since 1999, BMW enthusiasts have met in Santa Barbara, CA to attend Bimmerfest. One of the largest brand-specific gatherings in the United States, over 3,000 people attended in 2006, and over 1,000 BMW cars were present. In 2007, the event was held on 5 May.
BMW slang
The initials BMW are pronounced [ˈbeː ˈɛm ˈveː] in German.[85] The model series are referred to as "Einser" ("One-er" for 1 series), "Dreier" ("Three-er" for 3 series), "Fünfer" ("Five-er" for the 5 series), "Sechser" ("Six-er" for the 6 series), "Siebener" ("Seven-er" for the 7 series). These are not actually slang, but are the normal way that such letters and numbers are pronounced in German.[86]
The English slang terms Beemer, Bimmer and Bee-em are variously used for BMWs of all kinds,[87][88] cars and motorcycles.[89][90]
In the US, specialists have been at pains to prescribe that a distinction must be made between using Beemer exclusively to describe BMW motorcycles, and using Bimmer only to refer to BMW cars,[91][92][93] in the manner of a "true aficionado"[94] and avoid appearing to be "uninitiated."[95][96] The Canadian Globe and Mail prefers Bimmer and calls Beemer a "yuppie abomination,"[97] while the Tacoma News Tribune says it is a distinction made by "auto snobs."[98] Using the wrong slang risks offending BMW enthusiasts.[99][100][101] An editor of Business Week was satisfied in 2003 that the question was resolved in favor of Bimmer by noting that a Google search yielded 10 times as many hits compared to Beemer.[102]
The arts




1975 BMW 3.0CSL painted by Alexander Calder


Manufacturers employ designers for their cars, but BMW has made efforts to gain recognition for exceptional contributions to and support of the arts, including art beyond motor vehicle design. These efforts typically overlap or complement BMW's marketing and branding campaigns.[103] BMW Headquarters designed in 1972 by Karl Schwanzer has become a European icon,[104] and artist Gerhard Richter created his Red, Yellow, Blue series of paintings for the building's lobby.[105][106] In 1975, Alexander Calder was commissioned to paint the 3.0CSL driven by Hervé Poulain at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. This led to more BMW Art Cars, painted by artists including David Hockney, Jenny Holzer, Roy Lichtenstein, and others. The cars, currently numbering 17, have been shown at the Louvre, Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, and, in 2009, at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and New York's Grand Central Terminal.[104] BMW was the principal sponsor of the 1998 The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and other Guggenheim museums, though the financial relationship between BMW and the Guggenheim was criticised in many quarters.[107][108]
In 2012, BMW brought out the BMW Art Guide by Independent Collectors, which had, amongst others, the Dikeou Collection. It is the first global guide to private and publicly accessible collections of contemporary art worldwide.[109]

The 2006 "BMW Performance Series" was a marketing event geared to attract black car buyers, and included the "BMW Pop-Jazz Live Series," a tour headlined by jazz musician Mike Phillips, and the "BMW Blackfilms.com Film Series" highlighting black filmmakers.[110]
April Fools
BMW has garnered a reputation over the years for its April Fools pranks, which are printed in the British press every year. In 2010, they ran an advertisement in The Guardian announcing that customers would be able to order BMWs with different coloured badges to show their affiliation with the political party they supported.[111]
Overseas subsidiaries
Brazil
On 9 October 2014, BMW's new South American automobile plant in Araquari, Santa Catarina produced its first car. BMW intend to increase its production capacity to over 30,000 vehicles a year. The new site is intended to create around 1,300 new jobs, of which 500 have already been filled.[112]
Canada
In October 2008, BMW Group Canada was named one of Greater Toronto's Top Employers by Mediacorp Canada Inc., which was announced by the Toronto Star newspaper.[113]
China
Main article: BMW Brilliance
Signing a deal in 2003 for the production of sedans in China,[114] May 2004 saw the opening of a factory in the North-eastern city of Shenyang where Brilliance Auto produces BMW-branded automobiles[115] in a joint venture with the German company.[116]
Egypt
Bavarian Auto Group is a multinational group of companies established in March 2003 when it was appointed as the sole importer of BMW and Mini in Egypt, with monopoly rights for import, assembly, distribution, sales and after-sales support of BMW products in Egypt. Since that date, BAG invested a total amount of US$100 million distributed on seven companies and 11 premises in addition to three stores.
India
BMW India was established in 2006 as a sales subsidiary in Gurgaon (National Capital Region). A state-of-the-art assembly plant for BMW 3 and 5 Series started operation in early 2007 in Chennai. Construction of the plant started in January 2006 with an initial investment of more than one billion Indian Rupees. The plant started operation in the first quarter of 2007 and produces the different variants of BMW 3 Series, BMW GT, BMW 5 Series, BMW 7 Series, BMW X1, BMW X3, BMW X5, Mini Cooper S, Mini Cooper D and Mini Countryman. Further more, it has expanded its model range to include the BMW Z4, BMW X6, BMW M Cars, and BMW i8. There are a total of 31 variants of BMW cars on offer in the Indian market today.[117]
Japan
The vast majority of BMW automobiles in Japan are imported and sold by BMW Japan Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of BMW AG.
Mexico
In July 2014, BMW announced it was establishing a plant in Mexico, in the city and state of San Luis Potosi involving an investment of $1 billion. The plant will employ 1,500 people, and produce 150,000 cars annually, commencing in 2019.[118]
South Africa
BMWs have been assembled in South Africa since 1968,[119] when Praetor Monteerders' plant was opened in Rosslyn, near Pretoria. BMW initially bought shares in the company, before fully acquiring it in 1975; in so doing, the company became BMW South Africa, the first wholly owned subsidiary of BMW to be established outside Germany. Three unique models that BMW Motorsport created for the South African market were the E23 M745i (1983), which used the M88 engine from the BMW M1, the BMW 333i (1986), which added a six-cylinder 3.2-litre M30 engine to the E30,[120] and the E30 BMW 325is (1989) which was powered by an Alpina-derived 2.7-litre engine.
Unlike United States manufacturers, such as Ford and GM, which divested from the country in the 1980s, BMW retained full ownership of its operations in South Africa. Following the end of apartheid in 1994, and the lowering of import tariffs, BMW South Africa ended local production of the 5-Series and 7-Series, in order to concentrate on production of the 3-Series for the export market. South African–built BMWs are now exported to right hand drive markets including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Hong Kong, as well as Sub-Saharan Africa. Since 1997, BMW South Africa has produced vehicles in left-hand drive for export to Taiwan, the United States and Iran, as well as South America.
BMWs with a VIN starting with "NC0" are manufactured in South Africa.
United States




BMW Spartanburg factory


The BMW Manufacturing Company opened in 1994, in South Carolina, and has been manufacturing all Z4 and X5 models, and more recently the X6 and X3, including those for export to Europe, on the same assembly line in Greer between Greenville and Spartanburg.[121] In an average work day the company builds 600 vehicles: 500 X5s and 100 Z4s. The engines for these vehicles are built in Munich, Germany. BMWs with a VIN starting with "4US and 5US" are manufactured in Greer.
In 2010 BMW announced that it would spend $750 million to expand operations at the Greer plant. This expansion will allow production of 240,000 vehicles a year and will make the plant the largest car factory in the United States by number of employees.[122] BMW's largest single market is the United States, where 339 dealerships sold 346,023 cars in 2015.[123]
As of 2015[update], the Greer facility produces all BMW X3, X4, X5, X5 M, X6 and X6 M models.[124]
Marketing
BMW began using the slogan 'The Ultimate Driving Machine' in the 1970s. In 2010, this long-lived campaign was mostly supplanted by 'Joy', a campaign intended to make the brand more "approachable" and to better appeal to women, but by 2012 they had returned to "The Ultimate Driving Machine", which has a strong public association with BMW.[125]
Audio logo
In 2013, BMW replaced the 'double-gong' sound used in TV and Radio advertising campaigns since 1998. The new sound, developed to represent the future identity of BMW, was described as "introduced by a rising, resonant sound and underscored by two distinctive bass tones that form the sound logo's melodic and rhythmic basis."[126] The new sound was first used in BMW 4 Series Concept Coupe TV commercial.[127] The sound was produced by Thomas Kisser of HASTINGS media music.[128]
Roundel logo




The round BMW logo used for all models


The circular blue and white BMW logo or roundel evolved from the circular Rapp Motorenwerke company logo, from which the BMW company grew, combined with the blue and white colors of the flag of Bavaria.[129] The logo has been portrayed as the movement of an aircraft propeller with the white blades cutting through a blue sky—first used in a BMW advertisement in 1929, twelve years after the roundel was created—but this is not the origin of the logo itself.[130] The BMW logo still used today was created in early 1920.[131]
Problems
Theft using OBD, 2012
In 2012, BMW vehicles were stolen by programming a blank key fob to start the car through the on-board diagnostics (OBD) connection.[132][133][134] The primary causes of this vulnerability lie in the lack of appropriate authentication and authorization in the OBD specifications, which rely largely on security through obscurity. BMW offered all owners a free fix through a software update, and all newer vehicles have upgraded software that fixed this vulnerability.[135]
ConnectedDrive, 2010–14
Dieter Spaar was asked by ADAC to analyze ConnectedDrive and its hardware called Combox. He uncovered the following problems which allowed him e.g. to remotely open the car:[136]

BMW uses the same symmetric keys in all cars.
some services do not encrypt transported data while connecting to the BMW backend.
the integrity of the ConnectedDrive configuration is not protected.
the Combox discloses the vehicle identification number via NGTP (next generation telematics pattern) error messages.
data sent via SMS in NGTP format are encrypted via the nowadays unsecure DES.
the Combox does not protect against replay attacks.

BMW was notified in advance of the publication to provide fixes. The transport is now encrypted and BMW's server certificate is verified. The updates were delivered via ConnectedDrive config change. All BMW, Mini and Rolls Royce cars produced between March 2010 and 8 December 2014 are vulnerable. Cars without battery or parked in places without mobile connection still may be vulnerable, an update can be initiated manually.

^ "ROAD WARRIOR Q&A: Freeway Frustration". Las Vegas Review-Journal. 25 May 2005. I was informed a while back that BMW cars are 'Bimmers' and BMW motorcycles are 'Beemers' or 'Beamers.'

BMW was established as a business entity following a restructuring of the Rapp Motorenwerke aircraft manufacturing firm in 1912 named Aerowerke Gustav Otto. After the end of World War I in 1918, BMW was forced to cease aircraft-engine production by the terms of the Versailles Armistice Treaty.[5] The company consequently shifted to motorcycle production as the restrictions of the treaty started to be lifted in 1923,[6] followed by automobiles in 1928–29.[7][8][9]
The first car which BMW successfully produced and the car which launched BMW on the road to automobile production was the Dixi, based on the Austin 7 and licensed from the Austin Motor Company in Birmingham, England.
BMW's first significant aircraft engine, and commercial product of any sort, was the BMW IIIa inline-six liquid-cooled engine of 1918, known for good fuel economy and high-altitude performance.[10] With German rearmament in the 1930s, the company again began producing aircraft engines for the Luftwaffe. The factory in Munich made ample use of forced labour: foreign civilians, prisoners of war and inmates of the concentration camp Dachau [1]. Among its successful World War II engine designs were the BMW 132 and BMW 801 air-cooled radial engines, and the pioneering BMW 003 axial-flow turbojet, which powered the tiny, 1944–1945–era jet-powered "emergency fighter", the Heinkel He 162 Spatz. The BMW 003 jet engine was first tested as a prime power plant in the first prototype of the Messerschmitt Me 262, the Me 262 V1, but in 1942 tests the BMW prototype engines failed on takeoff with only the standby Junkers Jumo 210 nose-mounted piston engine powering it to a safe landing.[11][12] The few Me 262 A-1b test examples built used the more developed version of the 003 jet, recording an official top speed of 800 km/h (497 mph). The first-ever four-engine jet aircraft ever flown were the sixth and eighth prototypes of the Arado Ar 234 jet reconnaissance-bomber, which used BMW 003 jets for power. Through 1944 the 003's reliability improved, making it a suitable power plant for air frame designs competing for the Jägernotprogramm's light fighter production contract. which was won by the Heinkel He 162 Spatz design. The BMW 003 aviation turbojet was also under consideration as the basic starting point for a pioneering turboshaft powerplant for German armored fighting vehicles in 1944–45, as the GT 101.[13] Towards the end of the Third Reich, BMW developed some military aircraft projects for the Luftwaffe, the BMW Strahlbomber, the BMW Schnellbomber and the BMW Strahljäger, but none of them were built.[14][15]
[more detail]
By the year 1958, the automotive division of BMW was in financial difficulties and a shareholders meeting was held to decide whether to go into liquidation or find an alternative. It was decided to carry on by trying to cash in on the current economy car boom exploited so successfully by German ex-aircraft manufacturers such as Messerschmitt and Heinkel. BMW bought the rights to manufacture the Italian Iso Isetta. BMW's version of the tiny cars were to be powered by a modified form of BMW's motorcycle engine. This was moderately successful and helped the company get back on its feet.
Since 1959, the controlling majority shareholder of the BMW Aktiengesellschaft has been the Quandt family, which owns about 46% of the stock. The rest is in public float.
BMW acquired the Hans Glas company based in Dingolfing, Germany, in 1966. Glas vehicles were briefly badged as BMW until the company was fully absorbed. It was reputed that the acquisition was mainly to gain access to Glas' development of the timing belt with an overhead camshaft in automotive applications,[16] although some saw Glas' Dingolfing plant as another incentive. However, this factory was outmoded and BMW's biggest immediate gain was, according to themselves, a stock of highly qualified engineers and other personnel.[17] The Glas factories continued to build a limited number of their existing models, while adding the manufacture of BMW front and rear axles until they could be closer incorporated into BMW.[18]




BMW 3-Series (F30)


In 1992, BMW acquired a large stake in California-based industrial design studio DesignworksUSA, which they fully acquired in 1995. In 1994, BMW bought the British Rover Group[19] (which at the time consisted of the Rover, Land Rover and MG brands as well as the rights to defunct brands including Austin and Morris), and owned it for six years. By 2000, Rover was incurring huge losses and BMW decided to sell the combine. The MG and Rover brands were sold to the Phoenix Consortium to form MG Rover, while Land Rover was taken over by Ford. BMW, meanwhile, retained the rights to build the new Mini, which was launched in 2001.
Chief designer Chris Bangle announced his departure from BMW in February 2009, after serving on the design team for nearly seventeen years.[20] He was replaced by Adrian van Hooydonk, Bangle's former right-hand man. Bangle was known for his radical designs such as the 2002 7-Series and the 2002 Z4. In July 2007, the production rights for Husqvarna Motorcycles was purchased by BMW for a reported 93 million euros. BMW Motorrad plans to continue operating Husqvarna Motorcycles as a separate enterprise. All development, sales and production activities, as well as the current workforce, have remained in place at its present location at Varese.
In June 2012, BMW was listed as the #1 most reputable company in the world by Forbes.com.[21] Rankings are based upon aspects such as "people's willingness to buy, recommend, work for, and invest in a company is driven 60% by their perceptions of the company and only 40% by their perceptions of their products."

In 2006, the BMW group (including Mini and Rolls-Royce) produced 1,366,838 four-wheeled vehicles, which were manufactured in five countries.[22] In 2010, it manufactured 1,481,253 four-wheeled vehicles and 112,271 motorcycles (under both the BMW and Husqvarna brands).[23]
The BMW X3 (E83) was made by Magna Steyr, a subsidiary of Magna International, in Graz, Austria under license from BMW until 2010. More than 45,973 were produced in 2009. Starting October 2010, the new BMW X3 (F25) is produced at BMW US Manufacturing Company, Greer, South Carolina.
By 2011, about 56% of BMW-brand vehicles produced are powered by petrol engines and the remaining 44% are powered by diesel engines. Of those petrol vehicles, about 27% are four-cylinder models and about nine percent are eight-cylinder models.[24] BMW also has local assembly operation using complete knock down components in Thailand, Russia, Egypt, Indonesia, Malaysia, and India, for 3, 5, 7 series and X3.[25] On average, 9,000 vehicles per day exit BMW plants, and 63% are transported by rail.[26]

The R32 motorcycle, the first BMW motor vehicle.






The 2015 BMW R1200RT


BMW began production of motorcycle engines and then motorcycles after World War I.[28] Its motorcycle brand is now known as BMW Motorrad. Their first successful motorcycle after the failed Helios and Flink, was the "R32" in 1923, though production originally began in 1921.[29] This had a "boxer" twin engine, in which a cylinder projects into the air-flow from each side of the machine. Apart from their single-cylinder models (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMW's are still produced in this layout, which is designated the R Series.
During the Second World War, BMW produced the BMW R75 motorcycle with a sidecar attached. Having a unique design copied from the Zündapp KS750, its sidecar wheel was also motor-driven. Combined with a lockable differential, this made the vehicle very capable off-road, an equivalent in many ways to the Jeep.
In 1982, came the K Series, shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven F and G series with single and parallel twin Rotax engines.
In the early 1990s, BMW updated the airhead Boxer engine which became known as the oilhead. In 2002, the oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to 1,170 cc and enhanced performance to 100 hp (75 kW) for the R1200GS, compared to 85 hp (63 kW) of the previous R1150GS. More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the R1100S and R1200S, producing 98 and 122 hp (73 and 91 kW), respectively.
In 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It had an engine producing 167 hp (125 kW), derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team, and is lighter than previous K models. Innovations include electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork that BMW calls Duolever.
BMW introduced anti-lock brakes on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s. The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles pave the way for the introduction of electronic stability control, or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year.
BMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an Earles fork, front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called swinging arm). Some BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking.
BMW Group, on 31 January 2013, announced that Pierer Industrie AG has bought Husqvarna for an undisclosed amount, which will not be revealed by either party in the future. The company is headed by Stephan Pierer (CEO of KTM). Pierer Industrie AG is 51% owner of KTM and 100% owner of Husqvarna.

New Class
Main article: BMW New Class
The New Class (German: Neue Klasse) was a line of compact sedans and coupes starting with the 1962 1500 and continuing through the last 2002s in 1977. Powered by BMW's celebrated four-cylinder M10 engine, the New Class models had a fully independent suspension, MacPherson struts in front, and front disc brakes. Initially, a family of four-door sedans and two-door coupes, the New Class line was broadened to two-door sports sedans with the addition of the 02 Series 1600 and 2002 in 1966.
Sharing little in common with the rest of the line beyond power train, the sporty siblings caught auto enthusiasts' attention and established BMW as an international brand. Precursors to the famed BMW 3 Series, the two-doors' success cemented the firm's future as an upper tier performance car maker. New Class four-doors with numbers ending in "0" were replaced by the larger BMW 5 Series in 1972. The upscale 2000C and 2000CS coupes were replaced by the six-cylinder BMW E9, introduced in 1969 with the 2800CS. The 1600 two-door was discontinued in 1975, and the 2002 was replaced by the 320i in 1975.
Current models




BMW X1 (F48)






BMW 6 Series (F13)


The 1 Series, originally launched in 2004, is BMW's smallest car. Currently available are the second generation hatchback (F20/F21) and its two-door counterparts, the 2 Series coupe and convertible (F22/F23). The 3 Series, a compact executive car manufactured since model year 1975, is currently in its sixth generation (F30); models include the sports sedan (F30), the fourth generation station wagon (F31) and the Gran Turismo. Starting with the current generation, the 3 Series coupe and convertible are now branded as 4 Series models (F32 and F33 respectively). The 5 Series is a mid-size luxury car, available in sedan (F10) and station wagon (F11) forms. The 5 Series Gran Turismo (F07), which debuted in 2010, created a segment between station wagons and crossover SUV.[30]
BMW's full-size flagship executive sedan is the 7 Series. Typically, BMW introduces many of their innovations in the 7 Series, such as the iDrive system. The latest generation (G11) debuted in 2015. Based on the 5 Series' platform, the 6 Series is BMW's grand touring luxury sport coupe/convertible (F12/F13). A 2-seater roadster and coupe which succeeded the Z3, the Z4 has been sold since 2002.




BMW X3 (F25)


The X3 (F25), BMW's second crossover SUV (called SAV or "Sports Activity Vehicle" by BMW) debuted in 2010 and replaced the X3 (E83)-), which was based on the E46 3 Series' platform, and had been in production since 2003. Marketed in Europe as an off-roader, it benefits from BMW's xDrive all-wheel drive system. The all-wheel drive X5 (E53) was BMW's first crossover SUV (SAV), based on the 5-Series, and is a mid-size luxury SUV sold by BMW since 2000. A 4-seat crossover SUV released by BMW in December 2007, the X6 is marketed as a "Sports Activity Coupe" (SAC) by BMW. The X1 is now in its second generation and extends the BMW X-lineup.

Plug-in electric models
Main article: BMW i




BMW i3 electric car






BMW i8 plug-in hybrid


The BMW i is a sub-brand of BMW founded in 2011 to design and manufacture plug-in electric vehicles.[31][32] The sub-brand initial plans called for the release of two vehicles; series production of the BMW i3 all-electric car began in September 2013,[33] and the market launch took place in November 2013 with the first retail deliveries in Germany.[34] The BMW i8 sports plug-in hybrid car was launched in Germany in June 2014.[35] Combined sales of the BMW i brand models reached the 50,000 unit milestone in January 2016.[36] Two years after its introduction, the BMW i3 ranked as the world's third best selling all-electric car in history.[37] Global sales of the BMW i3 achieved the 50,000 unit milestone in July 2016.[38]
In February 2016, BMW announced the introduction of the "iPerformance" model designation, which will be given to all BMW plug-in hybrid vehicles from July 2016. The aim is to provide a visible indicator of the transfer of technology from BMW i to the BMW core brand. The new designation will be used first on the plug-in hybrid variants of the latest BMW 7 Series.[39] Global sales of all BMW plug-in electrified models achieved the 100,000 unit milestone in early November 2016, consisting of more than 60,000 BMW i3s, over 10,000 BMW i8s, and about 30,000 from combined sales of all BMW iPerformance plug-in hybrid models.[40]
As of November 2016[update], four BMW electrified models have been released, the BMW X5 xDrive40e iPerformance, BMW 225xe iPerformance Active Tourer, BMW 330e iPerformance, and the BMW 740e iPerformance.[41] The BMW 530e iPerformance is scheduled to be released in Europe March 2017 as part of the upcoming seventh generation BMW 5 Series lineup.[42] In November 2016, BMW announced the company expected to deliver 60,000 of its electrified i and iPerformance models in 2016, and a sales target of 100,000 units for 2017. BMW set the goal to expand the share of its electrified models to between 15% and 25% of sales by 2025,[43] when batteries have doubled their capacity.[44]
In 2015, BMW in cooperation with SCHERM Group has started deploying electric trucks on European roads, making it the first company to ever do so. The truck itself is manufactured by the Terberg Group, one of the world's largest independent specialist vehicle suppliers.[45][46][47]

BMW first entered Formula One as a full-fledged team in 2006.


BMW has a history of success in Formula One. BMW powered cars have won 20 races. In 2006 BMW took over the Sauber team and became Formula One constructors. In 2007 and 2008 the team enjoyed some success. The most recent win is a lone constructor team's victory by BMW Sauber F1 Team, on 8 June 2008, at the Canadian Grand Prix with Robert Kubica driving. Achievements include:

Driver championship: 1 (1983)
Constructor championship: 0 (Runner-up 2002, 2003, 2007)
Fastest laps: 33
Grand Prix wins: 20
Podium finishes: 76
Pole positions: 33

BMW was an engine supplier to Williams, Benetton, Brabham, and Arrows. Notable drivers who have started their Formula One careers with BMW include Jenson Button, Juan Pablo Montoya, Robert Kubica, and Sebastian Vettel.
In July 2009, BMW announced that it would withdraw from Formula One at the end of the 2009 season.[52] The team was sold back to the previous owner, Peter Sauber, who kept the BMW part of the name for the 2010 season due to issues with the Concorde Agreement. The team has since dropped BMW from their name starting in 2011.

Dr. Klaus Draeger, director of research and development of the BMW Group, who was in charge of the return to DTM racing (Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters), commented that "The return of BMW to the DTM is a fundamental part of the restructuring of our motorsport activities. With its increased commitment to production car racing, BMW is returning to its roots. The race track is the perfect place to demonstrate the impressive sporting characteristics of our vehicles against our core competitors in a high-powered environment. The DTM is the ideal stage on which to do this."[54]

Technology
BMW has signed deals to license Toyota technology in the areas of diesel engines, lithium batteries, and hydrogen fuel cells.[55]
BMW Connected Drive
BMW ConnectedDrive provides services and apps controlled through the vehicle's on-board computer. BMW announced the rollout of additional ConnectedDrive functions based around telecommunications in 2014. The new services and apps were made available to Australian delivered cars built during the April/March period.[56]
The ConnectedDrive update[57] introduced real-time traffic data, concierge and a new emergency call system to work alongside BMW's existing driver assistance services.[58]
In 2015, BMW Australia launched a customer portal that included integrated access to the new services and apps.[59]
Sponsorships
In football, BMW sponsors Bundesliga club Eintracht Frankfurt.[60]
It was an official sponsor of the London 2012 olympics providing 4000 BMWs and Minis in a deal made in November 2009.[61] The company also made a six-year sponsorship deal with the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) in July 2010.[62]
BMW has sponsored various European golf events such as the PGA Championship at Wentworth, the BMW Italian Open and the BMW International Open in Germany.[63]
In 2012, BMW Australia announced a 2-year sponsorship agreement with the Australian Film Institute's Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts (AACTA) Awards. As part of the agreement, BMW supplied a fleet of vehicles renowned for appearing in feature films.[64] The vehicles supplied included a range of elegant BMW limousines, iconic BMW's of the past and the BMW 6 Series which featured in Mission Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol. The automotive company also sponsored the South African national Rugby team. The sponsorship was cancelled due to controversies on the Rugby team's part.[65]
Environmental record
The company is a charter member of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Environmental Achievement Track, which recognizes companies for their environmental stewardship and performance.[66] It is also a member of the South Carolina Environmental Excellence Program.[67]
In 2012, BMW was named the world's most sustainable automotive company for the eighth consecutive year by the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes. The BMW Group is the only automotive enterprise in the index since its inception in 1999. In 2001, the BMW Group committed itself to the United Nations Environment Programme, the UN Global Compact and the Cleaner Production Declaration. It was also the first company in the automotive industry to appoint an environmental officer, in 1973.[68] BMW is a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.[69]
BMW is industry leader in the Carbon Disclosure Project's Global 500 ranking and 3rd place in Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index across all industries. BMW is listed in the FTSE4GoodIndex. The BMW Group was rated the most sustainable DAX 30 company by Sustainalytics in 2012.[70]
BMW has taken measures to reduce the impact the company has on the environment. It is trying to design less-polluting cars by making existing models more efficient, as well as developing environmentally friendly fuels for future vehicles. Possibilities include: electric power, hybrid power (combustion engines and electric motors) hydrogen engines.[71]
BMW offers 49 models with EU5/6 emissions norm and nearly 20 models with CO2 output less than 140 g/km, which puts it on the lowest tax group and therefore could provide the future owner with eco-bonus offered from some European countries.
However, there have been some criticisms directed at BMW, and in particular, accusations of greenwash in reference to their BMW Hydrogen 7. Some critics claim that the emissions produced during hydrogen fuel production outweigh the reduction of tailpipe emissions, and that the Hydrogen 7 is a distraction from more immediate, practical solutions for car pollution.[72] The BBC's Jorn Madslien questioned whether the Hydrogen 7 was "a truly green initiative or merely a cynical marketing ploy"[73]
Bicycles
BMW has created a range of high-end bicycles sold online and through dealerships. They range from the Kid's Bike to the EUR 4,499 Enduro Bike.[74] In the United States, only the Cruise Bike and Kid's Bike models are sold.
BMW nomenclature




BMW 530d (F10)






BMW 730d xDrive (G11)






BMW X5 (F15)






BMW X6 (E71)


BMW vehicles follow a certain nomenclature; usually a 3 digit number is followed by 1 or 2 letters. The first number represents the series number. The next two numbers traditionally represent the engine displacement in cubic centimeters divided by 100.[75] However, more recent cars use those two numbers as a performance index, as e.g. the 116i, 118i and 120i (all 2,0L petrol-powered), just like the 325d and 330d (both 3,0L diesel) share the same motor block while adjusting engine power through setup and turbocharging. A similar nomenclature is used by BMW Motorrad for their motorcycles.
The system of letters can be used in combination, and is as follows:

A = automatic transmission
C = coupé, last used on the BMW E46 and the BMW E63 (dropped after 2005 model year)
c = cabriolet
d = diesel†
e = eta (efficient economy, from the Greek letter 'η')
g = compressed natural gas/CNG
h = hydrogen
i = fuel-injected
L = long wheelbase
M = Motorsport
s = sport, also means "2 dr" on E36 model††
sDrive = rear-wheel drive
T = touring (wagon/estate)
Ti = hatchback for the BMW 3 Series hatchback
x / xDrive = BMW xDrive all-wheel drive

† historic nomenclature indicating "td" refers to "Turbo Diesel", not a diesel hatchback or touring model (524td, 525td)
†† typically includes sport seats, spoiler, aerodynamic body kit, upgraded wheels and Limit Slip Differential on pre-95 model etc.
For example, the BMW 750iL is a fuel-injected 7 Series with a long wheelbase and 5.4 litres of displacement. This badge was used for successive generations, E65 and F01, except the "i" and "L" switched places, so it read "Li" instead of "iL".
When 'L' supersedes the series number (e.g. L6, L7, etc.) it identifies the vehicle as a special luxury variant, having extended leather and special interior appointments. The L7 is based on the E23 and E38, and the L6 is based on the E24.
When 'X' is capitalised and supersedes the series number (e.g. X3, X5, etc.) it identifies the vehicle as one of BMW's Sports Activity Vehicles (SAV), their brand of crossovers, with BMW's xDrive. The second number in the 'X' series denotes the platform that it is based upon, for instance the X5 is derived from the 5 Series. Unlike BMW cars, the SAV's main badge does not denote engine size; the engine is instead indicated on side badges.
The 'Z' identifies the vehicle as a two-seat roadster (e.g. Z1, Z3, Z4, etc.). 'M' variants of 'Z' models have the 'M' as a suffix or prefix, depending on country of sale (e.g. 'Z4 M' is 'M Roadster' in Canada).
Previous X & Z vehicles had 'i' or 'si' following the engine displacement number (denoted in litres). BMW is now globally standardising this nomenclature on X & Z vehicles by using 'sDrive' or 'xDrive' (simply meaning rear or all-wheel drive, respectively) followed by two numbers which vaguely represent the vehicle's engine (e.g. Z4 sDrive35i is a rear-wheel-drive Z4 roadster with a 3.0 L twin-turbo fuel-injected engine).[76]
BMW last used the 's' for the E36 328is, which ceased production in 1999. However, the 's' nomenclature was brought back on the 2011 model year BMW 335is and BMW Z4 sDrive35is. The 335is is a sport-tuned trim with more performance and an optional dual clutch transmission that slots between the regular 335i and top-of-the-line M3.[77][78]
The 'M' – for Motorsport – identifies the vehicle as a high-performance model of a particular series (e.g. M3, M5, M6, etc.). For example, the M6 is the highest performing vehicle in the 6 Series lineup. Although 'M' cars should be separated into their respective series platforms, it is very common to see 'M' cars grouped together as its own lineup on the official BMW website.
Exceptions
There are exceptions to the numbering nomenclature.[79]
The M version of the BMW 1 Series was named the BMW 1 Series M Coupe rather than the traditional style "M1" due to the possible confusion with BMW's former BMW M1 homologation sports car.
The M versions of the Sports Activity Vehicles, such as the X5 M, could not follow the regular naming convention since MX5 was used for Mazda's MX-5 Miata.
For instance in the 2008 model year, the BMW 125i/128i, 328i, and 528i all had 3.0 naturally aspirated engines (N52), not a 2,500 cc or 2,800 cc engine as the series designation number would lead one to believe. The '28' is to denote a detuned engine in the 2008 cars, compared to the 2006 model year '30' vehicles (330i and 530i) whose 3.0 naturally aspirated engines are from the same N52 family but had more output.
The 2008 BMW 335i and 535i also have 3.0-litre engine; however the engines are twin-turbocharged (N54) which is not identified by the nomenclature. Nonetheless the '35' indicates a more powerful engine than previous '30' models that have the naturally aspirated N52 engine. The 2011 BMW 740i and 335is shares the same twin-turbo 3.0 engine from the N54 family but tuned to higher outputs, although the badging is not consistent ('40' and 's'). The 2013 BMW 640i Gran Coupe's twin-scroll single turbo 3.0L inline-6 engine makes similar output to the older twin turbo inline-6 engines.[80]
The E36 and E46 323i and E39 523i had 2.5-litre engines. The E36 318is made after 1996 has a 1.9 L engine (M44) as opposed to the 1.8 L (M42) used in the 1992 to 1995 models. The E36 316i "Contour" manufactured between 1999 and 2000 could be fitted with the 1.9 L M43B19 (M43). The E39 540i had a 4.4 L M62 engine, instead of a 4.0 L as the designation would suggest.
The badging for recent V8 engines (N62 and N63) also does not indicate displacement, as the 2006 750i and 2009 750i have 4800 cc (naturally aspirated) and 4400 cc (twin-turbocharged) engines, respectively.
In BMW CSL models (for example BMW M3 CSL), the letter L stands for Leichtbau (German for lightweight) instead of Lang (German for long wheelbase).
Carsharing services
In June 2011, BMW and Sixt launched Drivenow, a joint-venture that provides carsharing services in several cities in Europe and North America. As of December 2012, DriveNow operates over 1,000 vehicles, which serve five cities worldwide and over 60,000 customers.[81]
BMW has expanded its DriveNow car-sharing service in Seattle, rebranded as ReachNow.[82]
Light and Charge
BMW has developed street lights equipped with sockets to charge electric cars, called Light and Charge.[83]
Community




BMW logo sign in Düsseldorf


From the summer of 2001 until October 2005, BMW hosted The Hire, showcasing sporty models being driven to extremes.[84] These videos are still popular within the enthusiast community and proved to be a ground-breaking online advertising campaign.
Annually since 1999, BMW enthusiasts have met in Santa Barbara, CA to attend Bimmerfest. One of the largest brand-specific gatherings in the United States, over 3,000 people attended in 2006, and over 1,000 BMW cars were present. In 2007, the event was held on 5 May.
BMW slang
The initials BMW are pronounced [ˈbeː ˈɛm ˈveː] in German.[85] The model series are referred to as "Einser" ("One-er" for 1 series), "Dreier" ("Three-er" for 3 series), "Fünfer" ("Five-er" for the 5 series), "Sechser" ("Six-er" for the 6 series), "Siebener" ("Seven-er" for the 7 series). These are not actually slang, but are the normal way that such letters and numbers are pronounced in German.[86]
The English slang terms Beemer, Bimmer and Bee-em are variously used for BMWs of all kinds,[87][88] cars and motorcycles.[89][90]
In the US, specialists have been at pains to prescribe that a distinction must be made between using Beemer exclusively to describe BMW motorcycles, and using Bimmer only to refer to BMW cars,[91][92][93] in the manner of a "true aficionado"[94] and avoid appearing to be "uninitiated."[95][96] The Canadian Globe and Mail prefers Bimmer and calls Beemer a "yuppie abomination,"[97] while the Tacoma News Tribune says it is a distinction made by "auto snobs."[98] Using the wrong slang risks offending BMW enthusiasts.[99][100][101] An editor of Business Week was satisfied in 2003 that the question was resolved in favor of Bimmer by noting that a Google search yielded 10 times as many hits compared to Beemer.[102]
The arts




1975 BMW 3.0CSL painted by Alexander Calder


Manufacturers employ designers for their cars, but BMW has made efforts to gain recognition for exceptional contributions to and support of the arts, including art beyond motor vehicle design. These efforts typically overlap or complement BMW's marketing and branding campaigns.[103] BMW Headquarters designed in 1972 by Karl Schwanzer has become a European icon,[104] and artist Gerhard Richter created his Red, Yellow, Blue series of paintings for the building's lobby.[105][106] In 1975, Alexander Calder was commissioned to paint the 3.0CSL driven by Hervé Poulain at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. This led to more BMW Art Cars, painted by artists including David Hockney, Jenny Holzer, Roy Lichtenstein, and others. The cars, currently numbering 17, have been shown at the Louvre, Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, and, in 2009, at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and New York's Grand Central Terminal.[104] BMW was the principal sponsor of the 1998 The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and other Guggenheim museums, though the financial relationship between BMW and the Guggenheim was criticised in many quarters.[107][108]
In 2012, BMW brought out the BMW Art Guide by Independent Collectors, which had, amongst others, the Dikeou Collection. It is the first global guide to private and publicly accessible collections of contemporary art worldwide.[109]

The 2006 "BMW Performance Series" was a marketing event geared to attract black car buyers, and included the "BMW Pop-Jazz Live Series," a tour headlined by jazz musician Mike Phillips, and the "BMW Blackfilms.com Film Series" highlighting black filmmakers.[110]
April Fools
BMW has garnered a reputation over the years for its April Fools pranks, which are printed in the British press every year. In 2010, they ran an advertisement in The Guardian announcing that customers would be able to order BMWs with different coloured badges to show their affiliation with the political party they supported.[111]
Overseas subsidiaries
Brazil
On 9 October 2014, BMW's new South American automobile plant in Araquari, Santa Catarina produced its first car. BMW intend to increase its production capacity to over 30,000 vehicles a year. The new site is intended to create around 1,300 new jobs, of which 500 have already been filled.[112]
Canada
In October 2008, BMW Group Canada was named one of Greater Toronto's Top Employers by Mediacorp Canada Inc., which was announced by the Toronto Star newspaper.[113]
China
Main article: BMW Brilliance
Signing a deal in 2003 for the production of sedans in China,[114] May 2004 saw the opening of a factory in the North-eastern city of Shenyang where Brilliance Auto produces BMW-branded automobiles[115] in a joint venture with the German company.[116]
Egypt
Bavarian Auto Group is a multinational group of companies established in March 2003 when it was appointed as the sole importer of BMW and Mini in Egypt, with monopoly rights for import, assembly, distribution, sales and after-sales support of BMW products in Egypt. Since that date, BAG invested a total amount of US$100 million distributed on seven companies and 11 premises in addition to three stores.
India
BMW India was established in 2006 as a sales subsidiary in Gurgaon (National Capital Region). A state-of-the-art assembly plant for BMW 3 and 5 Series started operation in early 2007 in Chennai. Construction of the plant started in January 2006 with an initial investment of more than one billion Indian Rupees. The plant started operation in the first quarter of 2007 and produces the different variants of BMW 3 Series, BMW GT, BMW 5 Series, BMW 7 Series, BMW X1, BMW X3, BMW X5, Mini Cooper S, Mini Cooper D and Mini Countryman. Further more, it has expanded its model range to include the BMW Z4, BMW X6, BMW M Cars, and BMW i8. There are a total of 31 variants of BMW cars on offer in the Indian market today.[117]
Japan
The vast majority of BMW automobiles in Japan are imported and sold by BMW Japan Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of BMW AG.
Mexico
In July 2014, BMW announced it was establishing a plant in Mexico, in the city and state of San Luis Potosi involving an investment of $1 billion. The plant will employ 1,500 people, and produce 150,000 cars annually, commencing in 2019.[118]
South Africa
BMWs have been assembled in South Africa since 1968,[119] when Praetor Monteerders' plant was opened in Rosslyn, near Pretoria. BMW initially bought shares in the company, before fully acquiring it in 1975; in so doing, the company became BMW South Africa, the first wholly owned subsidiary of BMW to be established outside Germany. Three unique models that BMW Motorsport created for the South African market were the E23 M745i (1983), which used the M88 engine from the BMW M1, the BMW 333i (1986), which added a six-cylinder 3.2-litre M30 engine to the E30,[120] and the E30 BMW 325is (1989) which was powered by an Alpina-derived 2.7-litre engine.
Unlike United States manufacturers, such as Ford and GM, which divested from the country in the 1980s, BMW retained full ownership of its operations in South Africa. Following the end of apartheid in 1994, and the lowering of import tariffs, BMW South Africa ended local production of the 5-Series and 7-Series, in order to concentrate on production of the 3-Series for the export market. South African–built BMWs are now exported to right hand drive markets including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Hong Kong, as well as Sub-Saharan Africa. Since 1997, BMW South Africa has produced vehicles in left-hand drive for export to Taiwan, the United States and Iran, as well as South America.
BMWs with a VIN starting with "NC0" are manufactured in South Africa.
United States




BMW Spartanburg factory


The BMW Manufacturing Company opened in 1994, in South Carolina, and has been manufacturing all Z4 and X5 models, and more recently the X6 and X3, including those for export to Europe, on the same assembly line in Greer between Greenville and Spartanburg.[121] In an average work day the company builds 600 vehicles: 500 X5s and 100 Z4s. The engines for these vehicles are built in Munich, Germany. BMWs with a VIN starting with "4US and 5US" are manufactured in Greer.
In 2010 BMW announced that it would spend $750 million to expand operations at the Greer plant. This expansion will allow production of 240,000 vehicles a year and will make the plant the largest car factory in the United States by number of employees.[122] BMW's largest single market is the United States, where 339 dealerships sold 346,023 cars in 2015.[123]
As of 2015[update], the Greer facility produces all BMW X3, X4, X5, X5 M, X6 and X6 M models.[124]
Marketing
BMW began using the slogan 'The Ultimate Driving Machine' in the 1970s. In 2010, this long-lived campaign was mostly supplanted by 'Joy', a campaign intended to make the brand more "approachable" and to better appeal to women, but by 2012 they had returned to "The Ultimate Driving Machine", which has a strong public association with BMW.[125]
Audio logo
In 2013, BMW replaced the 'double-gong' sound used in TV and Radio advertising campaigns since 1998. The new sound, developed to represent the future identity of BMW, was described as "introduced by a rising, resonant sound and underscored by two distinctive bass tones that form the sound logo's melodic and rhythmic basis."[126] The new sound was first used in BMW 4 Series Concept Coupe TV commercial.[127] The sound was produced by Thomas Kisser of HASTINGS media music.[128]
Roundel logo




The round BMW logo used for all models


The circular blue and white BMW logo or roundel evolved from the circular Rapp Motorenwerke company logo, from which the BMW company grew, combined with the blue and white colors of the flag of Bavaria.[129] The logo has been portrayed as the movement of an aircraft propeller with the white blades cutting through a blue sky—first used in a BMW advertisement in 1929, twelve years after the roundel was created—but this is not the origin of the logo itself.[130] The BMW logo still used today was created in early 1920.[131]
Problems
Theft using OBD, 2012
In 2012, BMW vehicles were stolen by programming a blank key fob to start the car through the on-board diagnostics (OBD) connection.[132][133][134] The primary causes of this vulnerability lie in the lack of appropriate authentication and authorization in the OBD specifications, which rely largely on security through obscurity. BMW offered all owners a free fix through a software update, and all newer vehicles have upgraded software that fixed this vulnerability.[135]
ConnectedDrive, 2010–14
Dieter Spaar was asked by ADAC to analyze ConnectedDrive and its hardware called Combox. He uncovered the following problems which allowed him e.g. to remotely open the car:[136]

BMW uses the same symmetric keys in all cars.
some services do not encrypt transported data while connecting to the BMW backend.
the integrity of the ConnectedDrive configuration is not protected.
the Combox discloses the vehicle identification number via NGTP (next generation telematics pattern) error messages.
data sent via SMS in NGTP format are encrypted via the nowadays unsecure DES.
the Combox does not protect against replay attacks.

BMW was notified in advance of the publication to provide fixes. The transport is now encrypted and BMW's server certificate is verified. The updates were delivered via ConnectedDrive config change. All BMW, Mini and Rolls Royce cars produced between March 2010 and 8 December 2014 are vulnerable. Cars without battery or parked in places without mobile connection still may be vulnerable, an update can be initiated manually.

BMW was established as a business entity following a restructuring of the Rapp Motorenwerke aircraft manufacturing firm in 1912 named Aerowerke Gustav Otto. After the end of World War I in 1918, BMW was forced to cease aircraft-engine production by the terms of the Versailles Armistice Treaty.[5] The company consequently shifted to motorcycle production as the restrictions of the treaty started to be lifted in 1923,[6] followed by automobiles in 1928–29.[7][8][9]
The first car which BMW successfully produced and the car which launched BMW on the road to automobile production was the Dixi, based on the Austin 7 and licensed from the Austin Motor Company in Birmingham, England.
BMW's first significant aircraft engine, and commercial product of any sort, was the BMW IIIa inline-six liquid-cooled engine of 1918, known for good fuel economy and high-altitude performance.[10] With German rearmament in the 1930s, the company again began producing aircraft engines for the Luftwaffe. The factory in Munich made ample use of forced labour: foreign civilians, prisoners of war and inmates of the concentration camp Dachau [1]. Among its successful World War II engine designs were the BMW 132 and BMW 801 air-cooled radial engines, and the pioneering BMW 003 axial-flow turbojet, which powered the tiny, 1944–1945–era jet-powered "emergency fighter", the Heinkel He 162 Spatz. The BMW 003 jet engine was first tested as a prime power plant in the first prototype of the Messerschmitt Me 262, the Me 262 V1, but in 1942 tests the BMW prototype engines failed on takeoff with only the standby Junkers Jumo 210 nose-mounted piston engine powering it to a safe landing.[11][12] The few Me 262 A-1b test examples built used the more developed version of the 003 jet, recording an official top speed of 800 km/h (497 mph). The first-ever four-engine jet aircraft ever flown were the sixth and eighth prototypes of the Arado Ar 234 jet reconnaissance-bomber, which used BMW 003 jets for power. Through 1944 the 003's reliability improved, making it a suitable power plant for air frame designs competing for the Jägernotprogramm's light fighter production contract. which was won by the Heinkel He 162 Spatz design. The BMW 003 aviation turbojet was also under consideration as the basic starting point for a pioneering turboshaft powerplant for German armored fighting vehicles in 1944–45, as the GT 101.[13] Towards the end of the Third Reich, BMW developed some military aircraft projects for the Luftwaffe, the BMW Strahlbomber, the BMW Schnellbomber and the BMW Strahljäger, but none of them were built.[14][15]
[more detail]
By the year 1958, the automotive division of BMW was in financial difficulties and a shareholders meeting was held to decide whether to go into liquidation or find an alternative. It was decided to carry on by trying to cash in on the current economy car boom exploited so successfully by German ex-aircraft manufacturers such as Messerschmitt and Heinkel. BMW bought the rights to manufacture the Italian Iso Isetta. BMW's version of the tiny cars were to be powered by a modified form of BMW's motorcycle engine. This was moderately successful and helped the company get back on its feet.
Since 1959, the controlling majority shareholder of the BMW Aktiengesellschaft has been the Quandt family, which owns about 46% of the stock. The rest is in public float.
BMW acquired the Hans Glas company based in Dingolfing, Germany, in 1966. Glas vehicles were briefly badged as BMW until the company was fully absorbed. It was reputed that the acquisition was mainly to gain access to Glas' development of the timing belt with an overhead camshaft in automotive applications,[16] although some saw Glas' Dingolfing plant as another incentive. However, this factory was outmoded and BMW's biggest immediate gain was, according to themselves, a stock of highly qualified engineers and other personnel.[17] The Glas factories continued to build a limited number of their existing models, while adding the manufacture of BMW front and rear axles until they could be closer incorporated into BMW.[18]




BMW 3-Series (F30)


In 1992, BMW acquired a large stake in California-based industrial design studio DesignworksUSA, which they fully acquired in 1995. In 1994, BMW bought the British Rover Group[19] (which at the time consisted of the Rover, Land Rover and MG brands as well as the rights to defunct brands including Austin and Morris), and owned it for six years. By 2000, Rover was incurring huge losses and BMW decided to sell the combine. The MG and Rover brands were sold to the Phoenix Consortium to form MG Rover, while Land Rover was taken over by Ford. BMW, meanwhile, retained the rights to build the new Mini, which was launched in 2001.
Chief designer Chris Bangle announced his departure from BMW in February 2009, after serving on the design team for nearly seventeen years.[20] He was replaced by Adrian van Hooydonk, Bangle's former right-hand man. Bangle was known for his radical designs such as the 2002 7-Series and the 2002 Z4. In July 2007, the production rights for Husqvarna Motorcycles was purchased by BMW for a reported 93 million euros. BMW Motorrad plans to continue operating Husqvarna Motorcycles as a separate enterprise. All development, sales and production activities, as well as the current workforce, have remained in place at its present location at Varese.
In June 2012, BMW was listed as the #1 most reputable company in the world by Forbes.com.[21] Rankings are based upon aspects such as "people's willingness to buy, recommend, work for, and invest in a company is driven 60% by their perceptions of the company and only 40% by their perceptions of their products."

In 2006, the BMW group (including Mini and Rolls-Royce) produced 1,366,838 four-wheeled vehicles, which were manufactured in five countries.[22] In 2010, it manufactured 1,481,253 four-wheeled vehicles and 112,271 motorcycles (under both the BMW and Husqvarna brands).[23]
The BMW X3 (E83) was made by Magna Steyr, a subsidiary of Magna International, in Graz, Austria under license from BMW until 2010. More than 45,973 were produced in 2009. Starting October 2010, the new BMW X3 (F25) is produced at BMW US Manufacturing Company, Greer, South Carolina.
By 2011, about 56% of BMW-brand vehicles produced are powered by petrol engines and the remaining 44% are powered by diesel engines. Of those petrol vehicles, about 27% are four-cylinder models and about nine percent are eight-cylinder models.[24] BMW also has local assembly operation using complete knock down components in Thailand, Russia, Egypt, Indonesia, Malaysia, and India, for 3, 5, 7 series and X3.[25] On average, 9,000 vehicles per day exit BMW plants, and 63% are transported by rail.[26]

The R32 motorcycle, the first BMW motor vehicle.






The 2015 BMW R1200RT


BMW began production of motorcycle engines and then motorcycles after World War I.[28] Its motorcycle brand is now known as BMW Motorrad. Their first successful motorcycle after the failed Helios and Flink, was the "R32" in 1923, though production originally began in 1921.[29] This had a "boxer" twin engine, in which a cylinder projects into the air-flow from each side of the machine. Apart from their single-cylinder models (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMW's are still produced in this layout, which is designated the R Series.
During the Second World War, BMW produced the BMW R75 motorcycle with a sidecar attached. Having a unique design copied from the Zündapp KS750, its sidecar wheel was also motor-driven. Combined with a lockable differential, this made the vehicle very capable off-road, an equivalent in many ways to the Jeep.
In 1982, came the K Series, shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven F and G series with single and parallel twin Rotax engines.
In the early 1990s, BMW updated the airhead Boxer engine which became known as the oilhead. In 2002, the oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to 1,170 cc and enhanced performance to 100 hp (75 kW) for the R1200GS, compared to 85 hp (63 kW) of the previous R1150GS. More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the R1100S and R1200S, producing 98 and 122 hp (73 and 91 kW), respectively.
In 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It had an engine producing 167 hp (125 kW), derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team, and is lighter than previous K models. Innovations include electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork that BMW calls Duolever.
BMW introduced anti-lock brakes on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s. The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles pave the way for the introduction of electronic stability control, or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year.
BMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an Earles fork, front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called swinging arm). Some BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking.
BMW Group, on 31 January 2013, announced that Pierer Industrie AG has bought Husqvarna for an undisclosed amount, which will not be revealed by either party in the future. The company is headed by Stephan Pierer (CEO of KTM). Pierer Industrie AG is 51% owner of KTM and 100% owner of Husqvarna.

New Class
Main article: BMW New Class
The New Class (German: Neue Klasse) was a line of compact sedans and coupes starting with the 1962 1500 and continuing through the last 2002s in 1977. Powered by BMW's celebrated four-cylinder M10 engine, the New Class models had a fully independent suspension, MacPherson struts in front, and front disc brakes. Initially, a family of four-door sedans and two-door coupes, the New Class line was broadened to two-door sports sedans with the addition of the 02 Series 1600 and 2002 in 1966.
Sharing little in common with the rest of the line beyond power train, the sporty siblings caught auto enthusiasts' attention and established BMW as an international brand. Precursors to the famed BMW 3 Series, the two-doors' success cemented the firm's future as an upper tier performance car maker. New Class four-doors with numbers ending in "0" were replaced by the larger BMW 5 Series in 1972. The upscale 2000C and 2000CS coupes were replaced by the six-cylinder BMW E9, introduced in 1969 with the 2800CS. The 1600 two-door was discontinued in 1975, and the 2002 was replaced by the 320i in 1975.

Plug-in electric models
Main article: BMW i




BMW i3 electric car






BMW i8 plug-in hybrid


The BMW i is a sub-brand of BMW founded in 2011 to design and manufacture plug-in electric vehicles.[31][32] The sub-brand initial plans called for the release of two vehicles; series production of the BMW i3 all-electric car began in September 2013,[33] and the market launch took place in November 2013 with the first retail deliveries in Germany.[34] The BMW i8 sports plug-in hybrid car was launched in Germany in June 2014.[35] Combined sales of the BMW i brand models reached the 50,000 unit milestone in January 2016.[36] Two years after its introduction, the BMW i3 ranked as the world's third best selling all-electric car in history.[37] Global sales of the BMW i3 achieved the 50,000 unit milestone in July 2016.[38]
In February 2016, BMW announced the introduction of the "iPerformance" model designation, which will be given to all BMW plug-in hybrid vehicles from July 2016. The aim is to provide a visible indicator of the transfer of technology from BMW i to the BMW core brand. The new designation will be used first on the plug-in hybrid variants of the latest BMW 7 Series.[39] Global sales of all BMW plug-in electrified models achieved the 100,000 unit milestone in early November 2016, consisting of more than 60,000 BMW i3s, over 10,000 BMW i8s, and about 30,000 from combined sales of all BMW iPerformance plug-in hybrid models.[40]
As of November 2016[update], four BMW electrified models have been released, the BMW X5 xDrive40e iPerformance, BMW 225xe iPerformance Active Tourer, BMW 330e iPerformance, and the BMW 740e iPerformance.[41] The BMW 530e iPerformance is scheduled to be released in Europe March 2017 as part of the upcoming seventh generation BMW 5 Series lineup.[42] In November 2016, BMW announced the company expected to deliver 60,000 of its electrified i and iPerformance models in 2016, and a sales target of 100,000 units for 2017. BMW set the goal to expand the share of its electrified models to between 15% and 25% of sales by 2025,[43] when batteries have doubled their capacity.[44]
In 2015, BMW in cooperation with SCHERM Group has started deploying electric trucks on European roads, making it the first company to ever do so. The truck itself is manufactured by the Terberg Group, one of the world's largest independent specialist vehicle suppliers.[45][46][47]

BMW was an engine supplier to Williams, Benetton, Brabham, and Arrows. Notable drivers who have started their Formula One careers with BMW include Jenson Button, Juan Pablo Montoya, Robert Kubica, and Sebastian Vettel.
In July 2009, BMW announced that it would withdraw from Formula One at the end of the 2009 season.[52] The team was sold back to the previous owner, Peter Sauber, who kept the BMW part of the name for the 2010 season due to issues with the Concorde Agreement. The team has since dropped BMW from their name starting in 2011.

Technology
BMW has signed deals to license Toyota technology in the areas of diesel engines, lithium batteries, and hydrogen fuel cells.[55]
BMW Connected Drive
BMW ConnectedDrive provides services and apps controlled through the vehicle's on-board computer. BMW announced the rollout of additional ConnectedDrive functions based around telecommunications in 2014. The new services and apps were made available to Australian delivered cars built during the April/March period.[56]
The ConnectedDrive update[57] introduced real-time traffic data, concierge and a new emergency call system to work alongside BMW's existing driver assistance services.[58]
In 2015, BMW Australia launched a customer portal that included integrated access to the new services and apps.[59]
Sponsorships
In football, BMW sponsors Bundesliga club Eintracht Frankfurt.[60]
It was an official sponsor of the London 2012 olympics providing 4000 BMWs and Minis in a deal made in November 2009.[61] The company also made a six-year sponsorship deal with the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) in July 2010.[62]
BMW has sponsored various European golf events such as the PGA Championship at Wentworth, the BMW Italian Open and the BMW International Open in Germany.[63]
In 2012, BMW Australia announced a 2-year sponsorship agreement with the Australian Film Institute's Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts (AACTA) Awards. As part of the agreement, BMW supplied a fleet of vehicles renowned for appearing in feature films.[64] The vehicles supplied included a range of elegant BMW limousines, iconic BMW's of the past and the BMW 6 Series which featured in Mission Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol. The automotive company also sponsored the South African national Rugby team. The sponsorship was cancelled due to controversies on the Rugby team's part.[65]
Environmental record
The company is a charter member of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Environmental Achievement Track, which recognizes companies for their environmental stewardship and performance.[66] It is also a member of the South Carolina Environmental Excellence Program.[67]
In 2012, BMW was named the world's most sustainable automotive company for the eighth consecutive year by the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes. The BMW Group is the only automotive enterprise in the index since its inception in 1999. In 2001, the BMW Group committed itself to the United Nations Environment Programme, the UN Global Compact and the Cleaner Production Declaration. It was also the first company in the automotive industry to appoint an environmental officer, in 1973.[68] BMW is a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.[69]
BMW is industry leader in the Carbon Disclosure Project's Global 500 ranking and 3rd place in Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index across all industries. BMW is listed in the FTSE4GoodIndex. The BMW Group was rated the most sustainable DAX 30 company by Sustainalytics in 2012.[70]
BMW has taken measures to reduce the impact the company has on the environment. It is trying to design less-polluting cars by making existing models more efficient, as well as developing environmentally friendly fuels for future vehicles. Possibilities include: electric power, hybrid power (combustion engines and electric motors) hydrogen engines.[71]
BMW offers 49 models with EU5/6 emissions norm and nearly 20 models with CO2 output less than 140 g/km, which puts it on the lowest tax group and therefore could provide the future owner with eco-bonus offered from some European countries.
However, there have been some criticisms directed at BMW, and in particular, accusations of greenwash in reference to their BMW Hydrogen 7. Some critics claim that the emissions produced during hydrogen fuel production outweigh the reduction of tailpipe emissions, and that the Hydrogen 7 is a distraction from more immediate, practical solutions for car pollution.[72] The BBC's Jorn Madslien questioned whether the Hydrogen 7 was "a truly green initiative or merely a cynical marketing ploy"[73]
Bicycles
BMW has created a range of high-end bicycles sold online and through dealerships. They range from the Kid's Bike to the EUR 4,499 Enduro Bike.[74] In the United States, only the Cruise Bike and Kid's Bike models are sold.
BMW nomenclature




BMW 530d (F10)






BMW 730d xDrive (G11)






BMW X5 (F15)






BMW X6 (E71)


BMW vehicles follow a certain nomenclature; usually a 3 digit number is followed by 1 or 2 letters. The first number represents the series number. The next two numbers traditionally represent the engine displacement in cubic centimeters divided by 100.[75] However, more recent cars use those two numbers as a performance index, as e.g. the 116i, 118i and 120i (all 2,0L petrol-powered), just like the 325d and 330d (both 3,0L diesel) share the same motor block while adjusting engine power through setup and turbocharging. A similar nomenclature is used by BMW Motorrad for their motorcycles.
The system of letters can be used in combination, and is as follows:

A = automatic transmission
C = coupé, last used on the BMW E46 and the BMW E63 (dropped after 2005 model year)
c = cabriolet
d = diesel†
e = eta (efficient economy, from the Greek letter 'η')
g = compressed natural gas/CNG
h = hydrogen
i = fuel-injected
L = long wheelbase
M = Motorsport
s = sport, also means "2 dr" on E36 model††
sDrive = rear-wheel drive
T = touring (wagon/estate)
Ti = hatchback for the BMW 3 Series hatchback
x / xDrive = BMW xDrive all-wheel drive

† historic nomenclature indicating "td" refers to "Turbo Diesel", not a diesel hatchback or touring model (524td, 525td)
†† typically includes sport seats, spoiler, aerodynamic body kit, upgraded wheels and Limit Slip Differential on pre-95 model etc.
For example, the BMW 750iL is a fuel-injected 7 Series with a long wheelbase and 5.4 litres of displacement. This badge was used for successive generations, E65 and F01, except the "i" and "L" switched places, so it read "Li" instead of "iL".
When 'L' supersedes the series number (e.g. L6, L7, etc.) it identifies the vehicle as a special luxury variant, having extended leather and special interior appointments. The L7 is based on the E23 and E38, and the L6 is based on the E24.
When 'X' is capitalised and supersedes the series number (e.g. X3, X5, etc.) it identifies the vehicle as one of BMW's Sports Activity Vehicles (SAV), their brand of crossovers, with BMW's xDrive. The second number in the 'X' series denotes the platform that it is based upon, for instance the X5 is derived from the 5 Series. Unlike BMW cars, the SAV's main badge does not denote engine size; the engine is instead indicated on side badges.
The 'Z' identifies the vehicle as a two-seat roadster (e.g. Z1, Z3, Z4, etc.). 'M' variants of 'Z' models have the 'M' as a suffix or prefix, depending on country of sale (e.g. 'Z4 M' is 'M Roadster' in Canada).
Previous X & Z vehicles had 'i' or 'si' following the engine displacement number (denoted in litres). BMW is now globally standardising this nomenclature on X & Z vehicles by using 'sDrive' or 'xDrive' (simply meaning rear or all-wheel drive, respectively) followed by two numbers which vaguely represent the vehicle's engine (e.g. Z4 sDrive35i is a rear-wheel-drive Z4 roadster with a 3.0 L twin-turbo fuel-injected engine).[76]
BMW last used the 's' for the E36 328is, which ceased production in 1999. However, the 's' nomenclature was brought back on the 2011 model year BMW 335is and BMW Z4 sDrive35is. The 335is is a sport-tuned trim with more performance and an optional dual clutch transmission that slots between the regular 335i and top-of-the-line M3.[77][78]
The 'M' – for Motorsport – identifies the vehicle as a high-performance model of a particular series (e.g. M3, M5, M6, etc.). For example, the M6 is the highest performing vehicle in the 6 Series lineup. Although 'M' cars should be separated into their respective series platforms, it is very common to see 'M' cars grouped together as its own lineup on the official BMW website.
Exceptions
There are exceptions to the numbering nomenclature.[79]
The M version of the BMW 1 Series was named the BMW 1 Series M Coupe rather than the traditional style "M1" due to the possible confusion with BMW's former BMW M1 homologation sports car.
The M versions of the Sports Activity Vehicles, such as the X5 M, could not follow the regular naming convention since MX5 was used for Mazda's MX-5 Miata.
For instance in the 2008 model year, the BMW 125i/128i, 328i, and 528i all had 3.0 naturally aspirated engines (N52), not a 2,500 cc or 2,800 cc engine as the series designation number would lead one to believe. The '28' is to denote a detuned engine in the 2008 cars, compared to the 2006 model year '30' vehicles (330i and 530i) whose 3.0 naturally aspirated engines are from the same N52 family but had more output.
The 2008 BMW 335i and 535i also have 3.0-litre engine; however the engines are twin-turbocharged (N54) which is not identified by the nomenclature. Nonetheless the '35' indicates a more powerful engine than previous '30' models that have the naturally aspirated N52 engine. The 2011 BMW 740i and 335is shares the same twin-turbo 3.0 engine from the N54 family but tuned to higher outputs, although the badging is not consistent ('40' and 's'). The 2013 BMW 640i Gran Coupe's twin-scroll single turbo 3.0L inline-6 engine makes similar output to the older twin turbo inline-6 engines.[80]
The E36 and E46 323i and E39 523i had 2.5-litre engines. The E36 318is made after 1996 has a 1.9 L engine (M44) as opposed to the 1.8 L (M42) used in the 1992 to 1995 models. The E36 316i "Contour" manufactured between 1999 and 2000 could be fitted with the 1.9 L M43B19 (M43). The E39 540i had a 4.4 L M62 engine, instead of a 4.0 L as the designation would suggest.
The badging for recent V8 engines (N62 and N63) also does not indicate displacement, as the 2006 750i and 2009 750i have 4800 cc (naturally aspirated) and 4400 cc (twin-turbocharged) engines, respectively.
In BMW CSL models (for example BMW M3 CSL), the letter L stands for Leichtbau (German for lightweight) instead of Lang (German for long wheelbase).
Carsharing services
In June 2011, BMW and Sixt launched Drivenow, a joint-venture that provides carsharing services in several cities in Europe and North America. As of December 2012, DriveNow operates over 1,000 vehicles, which serve five cities worldwide and over 60,000 customers.[81]
BMW has expanded its DriveNow car-sharing service in Seattle, rebranded as ReachNow.[82]
Light and Charge
BMW has developed street lights equipped with sockets to charge electric cars, called Light and Charge.[83]
Community




BMW logo sign in Düsseldorf


From the summer of 2001 until October 2005, BMW hosted The Hire, showcasing sporty models being driven to extremes.[84] These videos are still popular within the enthusiast community and proved to be a ground-breaking online advertising campaign.
Annually since 1999, BMW enthusiasts have met in Santa Barbara, CA to attend Bimmerfest. One of the largest brand-specific gatherings in the United States, over 3,000 people attended in 2006, and over 1,000 BMW cars were present. In 2007, the event was held on 5 May.
BMW slang
The initials BMW are pronounced [ˈbeː ˈɛm ˈveː] in German.[85] The model series are referred to as "Einser" ("One-er" for 1 series), "Dreier" ("Three-er" for 3 series), "Fünfer" ("Five-er" for the 5 series), "Sechser" ("Six-er" for the 6 series), "Siebener" ("Seven-er" for the 7 series). These are not actually slang, but are the normal way that such letters and numbers are pronounced in German.[86]
The English slang terms Beemer, Bimmer and Bee-em are variously used for BMWs of all kinds,[87][88] cars and motorcycles.[89][90]
In the US, specialists have been at pains to prescribe that a distinction must be made between using Beemer exclusively to describe BMW motorcycles, and using Bimmer only to refer to BMW cars,[91][92][93] in the manner of a "true aficionado"[94] and avoid appearing to be "uninitiated."[95][96] The Canadian Globe and Mail prefers Bimmer and calls Beemer a "yuppie abomination,"[97] while the Tacoma News Tribune says it is a distinction made by "auto snobs."[98] Using the wrong slang risks offending BMW enthusiasts.[99][100][101] An editor of Business Week was satisfied in 2003 that the question was resolved in favor of Bimmer by noting that a Google search yielded 10 times as many hits compared to Beemer.[102]
The arts




1975 BMW 3.0CSL painted by Alexander Calder


Manufacturers employ designers for their cars, but BMW has made efforts to gain recognition for exceptional contributions to and support of the arts, including art beyond motor vehicle design. These efforts typically overlap or complement BMW's marketing and branding campaigns.[103] BMW Headquarters designed in 1972 by Karl Schwanzer has become a European icon,[104] and artist Gerhard Richter created his Red, Yellow, Blue series of paintings for the building's lobby.[105][106] In 1975, Alexander Calder was commissioned to paint the 3.0CSL driven by Hervé Poulain at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. This led to more BMW Art Cars, painted by artists including David Hockney, Jenny Holzer, Roy Lichtenstein, and others. The cars, currently numbering 17, have been shown at the Louvre, Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, and, in 2009, at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and New York's Grand Central Terminal.[104] BMW was the principal sponsor of the 1998 The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and other Guggenheim museums, though the financial relationship between BMW and the Guggenheim was criticised in many quarters.[107][108]
In 2012, BMW brought out the BMW Art Guide by Independent Collectors, which had, amongst others, the Dikeou Collection. It is the first global guide to private and publicly accessible collections of contemporary art worldwide.[109]

The 2006 "BMW Performance Series" was a marketing event geared to attract black car buyers, and included the "BMW Pop-Jazz Live Series," a tour headlined by jazz musician Mike Phillips, and the "BMW Blackfilms.com Film Series" highlighting black filmmakers.[110]
April Fools
BMW has garnered a reputation over the years for its April Fools pranks, which are printed in the British press every year. In 2010, they ran an advertisement in The Guardian announcing that customers would be able to order BMWs with different coloured badges to show their affiliation with the political party they supported.[111]
Overseas subsidiaries
Brazil
On 9 October 2014, BMW's new South American automobile plant in Araquari, Santa Catarina produced its first car. BMW intend to increase its production capacity to over 30,000 vehicles a year. The new site is intended to create around 1,300 new jobs, of which 500 have already been filled.[112]
Canada
In October 2008, BMW Group Canada was named one of Greater Toronto's Top Employers by Mediacorp Canada Inc., which was announced by the Toronto Star newspaper.[113]
China
Main article: BMW Brilliance
Signing a deal in 2003 for the production of sedans in China,[114] May 2004 saw the opening of a factory in the North-eastern city of Shenyang where Brilliance Auto produces BMW-branded automobiles[115] in a joint venture with the German company.[116]
Egypt
Bavarian Auto Group is a multinational group of companies established in March 2003 when it was appointed as the sole importer of BMW and Mini in Egypt, with monopoly rights for import, assembly, distribution, sales and after-sales support of BMW products in Egypt. Since that date, BAG invested a total amount of US$100 million distributed on seven companies and 11 premises in addition to three stores.
India
BMW India was established in 2006 as a sales subsidiary in Gurgaon (National Capital Region). A state-of-the-art assembly plant for BMW 3 and 5 Series started operation in early 2007 in Chennai. Construction of the plant started in January 2006 with an initial investment of more than one billion Indian Rupees. The plant started operation in the first quarter of 2007 and produces the different variants of BMW 3 Series, BMW GT, BMW 5 Series, BMW 7 Series, BMW X1, BMW X3, BMW X5, Mini Cooper S, Mini Cooper D and Mini Countryman. Further more, it has expanded its model range to include the BMW Z4, BMW X6, BMW M Cars, and BMW i8. There are a total of 31 variants of BMW cars on offer in the Indian market today.[117]
Japan
The vast majority of BMW automobiles in Japan are imported and sold by BMW Japan Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of BMW AG.
Mexico
In July 2014, BMW announced it was establishing a plant in Mexico, in the city and state of San Luis Potosi involving an investment of $1 billion. The plant will employ 1,500 people, and produce 150,000 cars annually, commencing in 2019.[118]
South Africa
BMWs have been assembled in South Africa since 1968,[119] when Praetor Monteerders' plant was opened in Rosslyn, near Pretoria. BMW initially bought shares in the company, before fully acquiring it in 1975; in so doing, the company became BMW South Africa, the first wholly owned subsidiary of BMW to be established outside Germany. Three unique models that BMW Motorsport created for the South African market were the E23 M745i (1983), which used the M88 engine from the BMW M1, the BMW 333i (1986), which added a six-cylinder 3.2-litre M30 engine to the E30,[120] and the E30 BMW 325is (1989) which was powered by an Alpina-derived 2.7-litre engine.
Unlike United States manufacturers, such as Ford and GM, which divested from the country in the 1980s, BMW retained full ownership of its operations in South Africa. Following the end of apartheid in 1994, and the lowering of import tariffs, BMW South Africa ended local production of the 5-Series and 7-Series, in order to concentrate on production of the 3-Series for the export market. South African–built BMWs are now exported to right hand drive markets including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Hong Kong, as well as Sub-Saharan Africa. Since 1997, BMW South Africa has produced vehicles in left-hand drive for export to Taiwan, the United States and Iran, as well as South America.
BMWs with a VIN starting with "NC0" are manufactured in South Africa.
United States




BMW Spartanburg factory


The BMW Manufacturing Company opened in 1994, in South Carolina, and has been manufacturing all Z4 and X5 models, and more recently the X6 and X3, including those for export to Europe, on the same assembly line in Greer between Greenville and Spartanburg.[121] In an average work day the company builds 600 vehicles: 500 X5s and 100 Z4s. The engines for these vehicles are built in Munich, Germany. BMWs with a VIN starting with "4US and 5US" are manufactured in Greer.
In 2010 BMW announced that it would spend $750 million to expand operations at the Greer plant. This expansion will allow production of 240,000 vehicles a year and will make the plant the largest car factory in the United States by number of employees.[122] BMW's largest single market is the United States, where 339 dealerships sold 346,023 cars in 2015.[123]
As of 2015[update], the Greer facility produces all BMW X3, X4, X5, X5 M, X6 and X6 M models.[124]
Marketing
BMW began using the slogan 'The Ultimate Driving Machine' in the 1970s. In 2010, this long-lived campaign was mostly supplanted by 'Joy', a campaign intended to make the brand more "approachable" and to better appeal to women, but by 2012 they had returned to "The Ultimate Driving Machine", which has a strong public association with BMW.[125]
Audio logo
In 2013, BMW replaced the 'double-gong' sound used in TV and Radio advertising campaigns since 1998. The new sound, developed to represent the future identity of BMW, was described as "introduced by a rising, resonant sound and underscored by two distinctive bass tones that form the sound logo's melodic and rhythmic basis."[126] The new sound was first used in BMW 4 Series Concept Coupe TV commercial.[127] The sound was produced by Thomas Kisser of HASTINGS media music.[128]
Roundel logo




The round BMW logo used for all models


The circular blue and white BMW logo or roundel evolved from the circular Rapp Motorenwerke company logo, from which the BMW company grew, combined with the blue and white colors of the flag of Bavaria.[129] The logo has been portrayed as the movement of an aircraft propeller with the white blades cutting through a blue sky—first used in a BMW advertisement in 1929, twelve years after the roundel was created—but this is not the origin of the logo itself.[130] The BMW logo still used today was created in early 1920.[131]
Problems
Theft using OBD, 2012
In 2012, BMW vehicles were stolen by programming a blank key fob to start the car through the on-board diagnostics (OBD) connection.[132][133][134] The primary causes of this vulnerability lie in the lack of appropriate authentication and authorization in the OBD specifications, which rely largely on security through obscurity. BMW offered all owners a free fix through a software update, and all newer vehicles have upgraded software that fixed this vulnerability.[135]
ConnectedDrive, 2010–14
Dieter Spaar was asked by ADAC to analyze ConnectedDrive and its hardware called Combox. He uncovered the following problems which allowed him e.g. to remotely open the car:[136]

BMW uses the same symmetric keys in all cars.
some services do not encrypt transported data while connecting to the BMW backend.
the integrity of the ConnectedDrive configuration is not protected.
the Combox discloses the vehicle identification number via NGTP (next generation telematics pattern) error messages.
data sent via SMS in NGTP format are encrypted via the nowadays unsecure DES.
the Combox does not protect against replay attacks.

BMW was notified in advance of the publication to provide fixes. The transport is now encrypted and BMW's server certificate is verified. The updates were delivered via ConnectedDrive config change. All BMW, Mini and Rolls Royce cars produced between March 2010 and 8 December 2014 are vulnerable. Cars without battery or parked in places without mobile connection still may be vulnerable, an update can be initiated manually.

BMW was established as a business entity following a restructuring of the Rapp Motorenwerke aircraft manufacturing firm in 1912 named Aerowerke Gustav Otto. After the end of World War I in 1918, BMW was forced to cease aircraft-engine production by the terms of the Versailles Armistice Treaty.[5] The company consequently shifted to motorcycle production as the restrictions of the treaty started to be lifted in 1923,[6] followed by automobiles in 1928–29.[7][8][9]
The first car which BMW successfully produced and the car which launched BMW on the road to automobile production was the Dixi, based on the Austin 7 and licensed from the Austin Motor Company in Birmingham, England.
BMW's first significant aircraft engine, and commercial product of any sort, was the BMW IIIa inline-six liquid-cooled engine of 1918, known for good fuel economy and high-altitude performance.[10] With German rearmament in the 1930s, the company again began producing aircraft engines for the Luftwaffe. The factory in Munich made ample use of forced labour: foreign civilians, prisoners of war and inmates of the concentration camp Dachau [1]. Among its successful World War II engine designs were the BMW 132 and BMW 801 air-cooled radial engines, and the pioneering BMW 003 axial-flow turbojet, which powered the tiny, 1944–1945–era jet-powered "emergency fighter", the Heinkel He 162 Spatz. The BMW 003 jet engine was first tested as a prime power plant in the first prototype of the Messerschmitt Me 262, the Me 262 V1, but in 1942 tests the BMW prototype engines failed on takeoff with only the standby Junkers Jumo 210 nose-mounted piston engine powering it to a safe landing.[11][12] The few Me 262 A-1b test examples built used the more developed version of the 003 jet, recording an official top speed of 800 km/h (497 mph). The first-ever four-engine jet aircraft ever flown were the sixth and eighth prototypes of the Arado Ar 234 jet reconnaissance-bomber, which used BMW 003 jets for power. Through 1944 the 003's reliability improved, making it a suitable power plant for air frame designs competing for the Jägernotprogramm's light fighter production contract. which was won by the Heinkel He 162 Spatz design. The BMW 003 aviation turbojet was also under consideration as the basic starting point for a pioneering turboshaft powerplant for German armored fighting vehicles in 1944–45, as the GT 101.[13] Towards the end of the Third Reich, BMW developed some military aircraft projects for the Luftwaffe, the BMW Strahlbomber, the BMW Schnellbomber and the BMW Strahljäger, but none of them were built.[14][15]
[more detail]
By the year 1958, the automotive division of BMW was in financial difficulties and a shareholders meeting was held to decide whether to go into liquidation or find an alternative. It was decided to carry on by trying to cash in on the current economy car boom exploited so successfully by German ex-aircraft manufacturers such as Messerschmitt and Heinkel. BMW bought the rights to manufacture the Italian Iso Isetta. BMW's version of the tiny cars were to be powered by a modified form of BMW's motorcycle engine. This was moderately successful and helped the company get back on its feet.
Since 1959, the controlling majority shareholder of the BMW Aktiengesellschaft has been the Quandt family, which owns about 46% of the stock. The rest is in public float.
BMW acquired the Hans Glas company based in Dingolfing, Germany, in 1966. Glas vehicles were briefly badged as BMW until the company was fully absorbed. It was reputed that the acquisition was mainly to gain access to Glas' development of the timing belt with an overhead camshaft in automotive applications,[16] although some saw Glas' Dingolfing plant as another incentive. However, this factory was outmoded and BMW's biggest immediate gain was, according to themselves, a stock of highly qualified engineers and other personnel.[17] The Glas factories continued to build a limited number of their existing models, while adding the manufacture of BMW front and rear axles until they could be closer incorporated into BMW.[18]




BMW 3-Series (F30)


In 1992, BMW acquired a large stake in California-based industrial design studio DesignworksUSA, which they fully acquired in 1995. In 1994, BMW bought the British Rover Group[19] (which at the time consisted of the Rover, Land Rover and MG brands as well as the rights to defunct brands including Austin and Morris), and owned it for six years. By 2000, Rover was incurring huge losses and BMW decided to sell the combine. The MG and Rover brands were sold to the Phoenix Consortium to form MG Rover, while Land Rover was taken over by Ford. BMW, meanwhile, retained the rights to build the new Mini, which was launched in 2001.
Chief designer Chris Bangle announced his departure from BMW in February 2009, after serving on the design team for nearly seventeen years.[20] He was replaced by Adrian van Hooydonk, Bangle's former right-hand man. Bangle was known for his radical designs such as the 2002 7-Series and the 2002 Z4. In July 2007, the production rights for Husqvarna Motorcycles was purchased by BMW for a reported 93 million euros. BMW Motorrad plans to continue operating Husqvarna Motorcycles as a separate enterprise. All development, sales and production activities, as well as the current workforce, have remained in place at its present location at Varese.
In June 2012, BMW was listed as the #1 most reputable company in the world by Forbes.com.[21] Rankings are based upon aspects such as "people's willingness to buy, recommend, work for, and invest in a company is driven 60% by their perceptions of the company and only 40% by their perceptions of their products."

The R32 motorcycle, the first BMW motor vehicle.






The 2015 BMW R1200RT


BMW began production of motorcycle engines and then motorcycles after World War I.[28] Its motorcycle brand is now known as BMW Motorrad. Their first successful motorcycle after the failed Helios and Flink, was the "R32" in 1923, though production originally began in 1921.[29] This had a "boxer" twin engine, in which a cylinder projects into the air-flow from each side of the machine. Apart from their single-cylinder models (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMW's are still produced in this layout, which is designated the R Series.
During the Second World War, BMW produced the BMW R75 motorcycle with a sidecar attached. Having a unique design copied from the Zündapp KS750, its sidecar wheel was also motor-driven. Combined with a lockable differential, this made the vehicle very capable off-road, an equivalent in many ways to the Jeep.
In 1982, came the K Series, shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven F and G series with single and parallel twin Rotax engines.
In the early 1990s, BMW updated the airhead Boxer engine which became known as the oilhead. In 2002, the oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to 1,170 cc and enhanced performance to 100 hp (75 kW) for the R1200GS, compared to 85 hp (63 kW) of the previous R1150GS. More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the R1100S and R1200S, producing 98 and 122 hp (73 and 91 kW), respectively.
In 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It had an engine producing 167 hp (125 kW), derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team, and is lighter than previous K models. Innovations include electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork that BMW calls Duolever.
BMW introduced anti-lock brakes on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s. The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles pave the way for the introduction of electronic stability control, or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year.
BMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an Earles fork, front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called swinging arm). Some BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking.
BMW Group, on 31 January 2013, announced that Pierer Industrie AG has bought Husqvarna for an undisclosed amount, which will not be revealed by either party in the future. The company is headed by Stephan Pierer (CEO of KTM). Pierer Industrie AG is 51% owner of KTM and 100% owner of Husqvarna.

New Class
Main article: BMW New Class
The New Class (German: Neue Klasse) was a line of compact sedans and coupes starting with the 1962 1500 and continuing through the last 2002s in 1977. Powered by BMW's celebrated four-cylinder M10 engine, the New Class models had a fully independent suspension, MacPherson struts in front, and front disc brakes. Initially, a family of four-door sedans and two-door coupes, the New Class line was broadened to two-door sports sedans with the addition of the 02 Series 1600 and 2002 in 1966.
Sharing little in common with the rest of the line beyond power train, the sporty siblings caught auto enthusiasts' attention and established BMW as an international brand. Precursors to the famed BMW 3 Series, the two-doors' success cemented the firm's future as an upper tier performance car maker. New Class four-doors with numbers ending in "0" were replaced by the larger BMW 5 Series in 1972. The upscale 2000C and 2000CS coupes were replaced by the six-cylinder BMW E9, introduced in 1969 with the 2800CS. The 1600 two-door was discontinued in 1975, and the 2002 was replaced by the 320i in 1975.

Plug-in electric models
Main article: BMW i




BMW i3 electric car






BMW i8 plug-in hybrid


The BMW i is a sub-brand of BMW founded in 2011 to design and manufacture plug-in electric vehicles.[31][32] The sub-brand initial plans called for the release of two vehicles; series production of the BMW i3 all-electric car began in September 2013,[33] and the market launch took place in November 2013 with the first retail deliveries in Germany.[34] The BMW i8 sports plug-in hybrid car was launched in Germany in June 2014.[35] Combined sales of the BMW i brand models reached the 50,000 unit milestone in January 2016.[36] Two years after its introduction, the BMW i3 ranked as the world's third best selling all-electric car in history.[37] Global sales of the BMW i3 achieved the 50,000 unit milestone in July 2016.[38]
In February 2016, BMW announced the introduction of the "iPerformance" model designation, which will be given to all BMW plug-in hybrid vehicles from July 2016. The aim is to provide a visible indicator of the transfer of technology from BMW i to the BMW core brand. The new designation will be used first on the plug-in hybrid variants of the latest BMW 7 Series.[39] Global sales of all BMW plug-in electrified models achieved the 100,000 unit milestone in early November 2016, consisting of more than 60,000 BMW i3s, over 10,000 BMW i8s, and about 30,000 from combined sales of all BMW iPerformance plug-in hybrid models.[40]
As of November 2016[update], four BMW electrified models have been released, the BMW X5 xDrive40e iPerformance, BMW 225xe iPerformance Active Tourer, BMW 330e iPerformance, and the BMW 740e iPerformance.[41] The BMW 530e iPerformance is scheduled to be released in Europe March 2017 as part of the upcoming seventh generation BMW 5 Series lineup.[42] In November 2016, BMW announced the company expected to deliver 60,000 of its electrified i and iPerformance models in 2016, and a sales target of 100,000 units for 2017. BMW set the goal to expand the share of its electrified models to between 15% and 25% of sales by 2025,[43] when batteries have doubled their capacity.[44]
In 2015, BMW in cooperation with SCHERM Group has started deploying electric trucks on European roads, making it the first company to ever do so. The truck itself is manufactured by the Terberg Group, one of the world's largest independent specialist vehicle suppliers.[45][46][47]

BMW is industry leader in the Carbon Disclosure Project's Global 500 ranking and 3rd place in Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index across all industries. BMW is listed in the FTSE4GoodIndex. The BMW Group was rated the most sustainable DAX 30 company by Sustainalytics in 2012.[70]
BMW has taken measures to reduce the impact the company has on the environment. It is trying to design less-polluting cars by making existing models more efficient, as well as developing environmentally friendly fuels for future vehicles. Possibilities include: electric power, hybrid power (combustion engines and electric motors) hydrogen engines.[71]
BMW offers 49 models with EU5/6 emissions norm and nearly 20 models with CO2 output less than 140 g/km, which puts it on the lowest tax group and therefore could provide the future owner with eco-bonus offered from some European countries.
However, there have been some criticisms directed at BMW, and in particular, accusations of greenwash in reference to their BMW Hydrogen 7. Some critics claim that the emissions produced during hydrogen fuel production outweigh the reduction of tailpipe emissions, and that the Hydrogen 7 is a distraction from more immediate, practical solutions for car pollution.[72] The BBC's Jorn Madslien questioned whether the Hydrogen 7 was "a truly green initiative or merely a cynical marketing ploy"[73]
Bicycles
BMW has created a range of high-end bicycles sold online and through dealerships. They range from the Kid's Bike to the EUR 4,499 Enduro Bike.[74] In the United States, only the Cruise Bike and Kid's Bike models are sold.
BMW nomenclature




BMW 530d (F10)






BMW 730d xDrive (G11)






BMW X5 (F15)






BMW X6 (E71)


BMW vehicles follow a certain nomenclature; usually a 3 digit number is followed by 1 or 2 letters. The first number represents the series number. The next two numbers traditionally represent the engine displacement in cubic centimeters divided by 100.[75] However, more recent cars use those two numbers as a performance index, as e.g. the 116i, 118i and 120i (all 2,0L petrol-powered), just like the 325d and 330d (both 3,0L diesel) share the same motor block while adjusting engine power through setup and turbocharging. A similar nomenclature is used by BMW Motorrad for their motorcycles.
The system of letters can be used in combination, and is as follows:

A = automatic transmission
C = coupé, last used on the BMW E46 and the BMW E63 (dropped after 2005 model year)
c = cabriolet
d = diesel†
e = eta (efficient economy, from the Greek letter 'η')
g = compressed natural gas/CNG
h = hydrogen
i = fuel-injected
L = long wheelbase
M = Motorsport
s = sport, also means "2 dr" on E36 model††
sDrive = rear-wheel drive
T = touring (wagon/estate)
Ti = hatchback for the BMW 3 Series hatchback
x / xDrive = BMW xDrive all-wheel drive

† historic nomenclature indicating "td" refers to "Turbo Diesel", not a diesel hatchback or touring model (524td, 525td)
†† typically includes sport seats, spoiler, aerodynamic body kit, upgraded wheels and Limit Slip Differential on pre-95 model etc.
For example, the BMW 750iL is a fuel-injected 7 Series with a long wheelbase and 5.4 litres of displacement. This badge was used for successive generations, E65 and F01, except the "i" and "L" switched places, so it read "Li" instead of "iL".
When 'L' supersedes the series number (e.g. L6, L7, etc.) it identifies the vehicle as a special luxury variant, having extended leather and special interior appointments. The L7 is based on the E23 and E38, and the L6 is based on the E24.
When 'X' is capitalised and supersedes the series number (e.g. X3, X5, etc.) it identifies the vehicle as one of BMW's Sports Activity Vehicles (SAV), their brand of crossovers, with BMW's xDrive. The second number in the 'X' series denotes the platform that it is based upon, for instance the X5 is derived from the 5 Series. Unlike BMW cars, the SAV's main badge does not denote engine size; the engine is instead indicated on side badges.
The 'Z' identifies the vehicle as a two-seat roadster (e.g. Z1, Z3, Z4, etc.). 'M' variants of 'Z' models have the 'M' as a suffix or prefix, depending on country of sale (e.g. 'Z4 M' is 'M Roadster' in Canada).
Previous X & Z vehicles had 'i' or 'si' following the engine displacement number (denoted in litres). BMW is now globally standardising this nomenclature on X & Z vehicles by using 'sDrive' or 'xDrive' (simply meaning rear or all-wheel drive, respectively) followed by two numbers which vaguely represent the vehicle's engine (e.g. Z4 sDrive35i is a rear-wheel-drive Z4 roadster with a 3.0 L twin-turbo fuel-injected engine).[76]
BMW last used the 's' for the E36 328is, which ceased production in 1999. However, the 's' nomenclature was brought back on the 2011 model year BMW 335is and BMW Z4 sDrive35is. The 335is is a sport-tuned trim with more performance and an optional dual clutch transmission that slots between the regular 335i and top-of-the-line M3.[77][78]
The 'M' – for Motorsport – identifies the vehicle as a high-performance model of a particular series (e.g. M3, M5, M6, etc.). For example, the M6 is the highest performing vehicle in the 6 Series lineup. Although 'M' cars should be separated into their respective series platforms, it is very common to see 'M' cars grouped together as its own lineup on the official BMW website.
Exceptions
There are exceptions to the numbering nomenclature.[79]
The M version of the BMW 1 Series was named the BMW 1 Series M Coupe rather than the traditional style "M1" due to the possible confusion with BMW's former BMW M1 homologation sports car.
The M versions of the Sports Activity Vehicles, such as the X5 M, could not follow the regular naming convention since MX5 was used for Mazda's MX-5 Miata.
For instance in the 2008 model year, the BMW 125i/128i, 328i, and 528i all had 3.0 naturally aspirated engines (N52), not a 2,500 cc or 2,800 cc engine as the series designation number would lead one to believe. The '28' is to denote a detuned engine in the 2008 cars, compared to the 2006 model year '30' vehicles (330i and 530i) whose 3.0 naturally aspirated engines are from the same N52 family but had more output.
The 2008 BMW 335i and 535i also have 3.0-litre engine; however the engines are twin-turbocharged (N54) which is not identified by the nomenclature. Nonetheless the '35' indicates a more powerful engine than previous '30' models that have the naturally aspirated N52 engine. The 2011 BMW 740i and 335is shares the same twin-turbo 3.0 engine from the N54 family but tuned to higher outputs, although the badging is not consistent ('40' and 's'). The 2013 BMW 640i Gran Coupe's twin-scroll single turbo 3.0L inline-6 engine makes similar output to the older twin turbo inline-6 engines.[80]
The E36 and E46 323i and E39 523i had 2.5-litre engines. The E36 318is made after 1996 has a 1.9 L engine (M44) as opposed to the 1.8 L (M42) used in the 1992 to 1995 models. The E36 316i "Contour" manufactured between 1999 and 2000 could be fitted with the 1.9 L M43B19 (M43). The E39 540i had a 4.4 L M62 engine, instead of a 4.0 L as the designation would suggest.
The badging for recent V8 engines (N62 and N63) also does not indicate displacement, as the 2006 750i and 2009 750i have 4800 cc (naturally aspirated) and 4400 cc (twin-turbocharged) engines, respectively.
In BMW CSL models (for example BMW M3 CSL), the letter L stands for Leichtbau (German for lightweight) instead of Lang (German for long wheelbase).
Carsharing services
In June 2011, BMW and Sixt launched Drivenow, a joint-venture that provides carsharing services in several cities in Europe and North America. As of December 2012, DriveNow operates over 1,000 vehicles, which serve five cities worldwide and over 60,000 customers.[81]
BMW has expanded its DriveNow car-sharing service in Seattle, rebranded as ReachNow.[82]
Light and Charge
BMW has developed street lights equipped with sockets to charge electric cars, called Light and Charge.[83]
Community




BMW logo sign in Düsseldorf


From the summer of 2001 until October 2005, BMW hosted The Hire, showcasing sporty models being driven to extremes.[84] These videos are still popular within the enthusiast community and proved to be a ground-breaking online advertising campaign.
Annually since 1999, BMW enthusiasts have met in Santa Barbara, CA to attend Bimmerfest. One of the largest brand-specific gatherings in the United States, over 3,000 people attended in 2006, and over 1,000 BMW cars were present. In 2007, the event was held on 5 May.
BMW slang
The initials BMW are pronounced [ˈbeː ˈɛm ˈveː] in German.[85] The model series are referred to as "Einser" ("One-er" for 1 series), "Dreier" ("Three-er" for 3 series), "Fünfer" ("Five-er" for the 5 series), "Sechser" ("Six-er" for the 6 series), "Siebener" ("Seven-er" for the 7 series). These are not actually slang, but are the normal way that such letters and numbers are pronounced in German.[86]
The English slang terms Beemer, Bimmer and Bee-em are variously used for BMWs of all kinds,[87][88] cars and motorcycles.[89][90]
In the US, specialists have been at pains to prescribe that a distinction must be made between using Beemer exclusively to describe BMW motorcycles, and using Bimmer only to refer to BMW cars,[91][92][93] in the manner of a "true aficionado"[94] and avoid appearing to be "uninitiated."[95][96] The Canadian Globe and Mail prefers Bimmer and calls Beemer a "yuppie abomination,"[97] while the Tacoma News Tribune says it is a distinction made by "auto snobs."[98] Using the wrong slang risks offending BMW enthusiasts.[99][100][101] An editor of Business Week was satisfied in 2003 that the question was resolved in favor of Bimmer by noting that a Google search yielded 10 times as many hits compared to Beemer.[102]
The arts




1975 BMW 3.0CSL painted by Alexander Calder


Manufacturers employ designers for their cars, but BMW has made efforts to gain recognition for exceptional contributions to and support of the arts, including art beyond motor vehicle design. These efforts typically overlap or complement BMW's marketing and branding campaigns.[103] BMW Headquarters designed in 1972 by Karl Schwanzer has become a European icon,[104] and artist Gerhard Richter created his Red, Yellow, Blue series of paintings for the building's lobby.[105][106] In 1975, Alexander Calder was commissioned to paint the 3.0CSL driven by Hervé Poulain at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. This led to more BMW Art Cars, painted by artists including David Hockney, Jenny Holzer, Roy Lichtenstein, and others. The cars, currently numbering 17, have been shown at the Louvre, Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, and, in 2009, at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and New York's Grand Central Terminal.[104] BMW was the principal sponsor of the 1998 The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and other Guggenheim museums, though the financial relationship between BMW and the Guggenheim was criticised in many quarters.[107][108]
In 2012, BMW brought out the BMW Art Guide by Independent Collectors, which had, amongst others, the Dikeou Collection. It is the first global guide to private and publicly accessible collections of contemporary art worldwide.[109]

The 2006 "BMW Performance Series" was a marketing event geared to attract black car buyers, and included the "BMW Pop-Jazz Live Series," a tour headlined by jazz musician Mike Phillips, and the "BMW Blackfilms.com Film Series" highlighting black filmmakers.[110]
April Fools
BMW has garnered a reputation over the years for its April Fools pranks, which are printed in the British press every year. In 2010, they ran an advertisement in The Guardian announcing that customers would be able to order BMWs with different coloured badges to show their affiliation with the political party they supported.[111]
Overseas subsidiaries
Brazil
On 9 October 2014, BMW's new South American automobile plant in Araquari, Santa Catarina produced its first car. BMW intend to increase its production capacity to over 30,000 vehicles a year. The new site is intended to create around 1,300 new jobs, of which 500 have already been filled.[112]
Canada
In October 2008, BMW Group Canada was named one of Greater Toronto's Top Employers by Mediacorp Canada Inc., which was announced by the Toronto Star newspaper.[113]
China
Main article: BMW Brilliance
Signing a deal in 2003 for the production of sedans in China,[114] May 2004 saw the opening of a factory in the North-eastern city of Shenyang where Brilliance Auto produces BMW-branded automobiles[115] in a joint venture with the German company.[116]
Egypt
Bavarian Auto Group is a multinational group of companies established in March 2003 when it was appointed as the sole importer of BMW and Mini in Egypt, with monopoly rights for import, assembly, distribution, sales and after-sales support of BMW products in Egypt. Since that date, BAG invested a total amount of US$100 million distributed on seven companies and 11 premises in addition to three stores.
India
BMW India was established in 2006 as a sales subsidiary in Gurgaon (National Capital Region). A state-of-the-art assembly plant for BMW 3 and 5 Series started operation in early 2007 in Chennai. Construction of the plant started in January 2006 with an initial investment of more than one billion Indian Rupees. The plant started operation in the first quarter of 2007 and produces the different variants of BMW 3 Series, BMW GT, BMW 5 Series, BMW 7 Series, BMW X1, BMW X3, BMW X5, Mini Cooper S, Mini Cooper D and Mini Countryman. Further more, it has expanded its model range to include the BMW Z4, BMW X6, BMW M Cars, and BMW i8. There are a total of 31 variants of BMW cars on offer in the Indian market today.[117]
Japan
The vast majority of BMW automobiles in Japan are imported and sold by BMW Japan Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of BMW AG.
Mexico
In July 2014, BMW announced it was establishing a plant in Mexico, in the city and state of San Luis Potosi involving an investment of $1 billion. The plant will employ 1,500 people, and produce 150,000 cars annually, commencing in 2019.[118]
South Africa
BMWs have been assembled in South Africa since 1968,[119] when Praetor Monteerders' plant was opened in Rosslyn, near Pretoria. BMW initially bought shares in the company, before fully acquiring it in 1975; in so doing, the company became BMW South Africa, the first wholly owned subsidiary of BMW to be established outside Germany. Three unique models that BMW Motorsport created for the South African market were the E23 M745i (1983), which used the M88 engine from the BMW M1, the BMW 333i (1986), which added a six-cylinder 3.2-litre M30 engine to the E30,[120] and the E30 BMW 325is (1989) which was powered by an Alpina-derived 2.7-litre engine.
Unlike United States manufacturers, such as Ford and GM, which divested from the country in the 1980s, BMW retained full ownership of its operations in South Africa. Following the end of apartheid in 1994, and the lowering of import tariffs, BMW South Africa ended local production of the 5-Series and 7-Series, in order to concentrate on production of the 3-Series for the export market. South African–built BMWs are now exported to right hand drive markets including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Hong Kong, as well as Sub-Saharan Africa. Since 1997, BMW South Africa has produced vehicles in left-hand drive for export to Taiwan, the United States and Iran, as well as South America.
BMWs with a VIN starting with "NC0" are manufactured in South Africa.
United States




BMW Spartanburg factory


The BMW Manufacturing Company opened in 1994, in South Carolina, and has been manufacturing all Z4 and X5 models, and more recently the X6 and X3, including those for export to Europe, on the same assembly line in Greer between Greenville and Spartanburg.[121] In an average work day the company builds 600 vehicles: 500 X5s and 100 Z4s. The engines for these vehicles are built in Munich, Germany. BMWs with a VIN starting with "4US and 5US" are manufactured in Greer.
In 2010 BMW announced that it would spend $750 million to expand operations at the Greer plant. This expansion will allow production of 240,000 vehicles a year and will make the plant the largest car factory in the United States by number of employees.[122] BMW's largest single market is the United States, where 339 dealerships sold 346,023 cars in 2015.[123]
As of 2015[update], the Greer facility produces all BMW X3, X4, X5, X5 M, X6 and X6 M models.[124]
Marketing
BMW began using the slogan 'The Ultimate Driving Machine' in the 1970s. In 2010, this long-lived campaign was mostly supplanted by 'Joy', a campaign intended to make the brand more "approachable" and to better appeal to women, but by 2012 they had returned to "The Ultimate Driving Machine", which has a strong public association with BMW.[125]
Audio logo
In 2013, BMW replaced the 'double-gong' sound used in TV and Radio advertising campaigns since 1998. The new sound, developed to represent the future identity of BMW, was described as "introduced by a rising, resonant sound and underscored by two distinctive bass tones that form the sound logo's melodic and rhythmic basis."[126] The new sound was first used in BMW 4 Series Concept Coupe TV commercial.[127] The sound was produced by Thomas Kisser of HASTINGS media music.[128]
Roundel logo




The round BMW logo used for all models


The circular blue and white BMW logo or roundel evolved from the circular Rapp Motorenwerke company logo, from which the BMW company grew, combined with the blue and white colors of the flag of Bavaria.[129] The logo has been portrayed as the movement of an aircraft propeller with the white blades cutting through a blue sky—first used in a BMW advertisement in 1929, twelve years after the roundel was created—but this is not the origin of the logo itself.[130] The BMW logo still used today was created in early 1920.[131]
Problems
Theft using OBD, 2012
In 2012, BMW vehicles were stolen by programming a blank key fob to start the car through the on-board diagnostics (OBD) connection.[132][133][134] The primary causes of this vulnerability lie in the lack of appropriate authentication and authorization in the OBD specifications, which rely largely on security through obscurity. BMW offered all owners a free fix through a software update, and all newer vehicles have upgraded software that fixed this vulnerability.[135]
ConnectedDrive, 2010–14
Dieter Spaar was asked by ADAC to analyze ConnectedDrive and its hardware called Combox. He uncovered the following problems which allowed him e.g. to remotely open the car:[136]

BMW uses the same symmetric keys in all cars.
some services do not encrypt transported data while connecting to the BMW backend.
the integrity of the ConnectedDrive configuration is not protected.
the Combox discloses the vehicle identification number via NGTP (next generation telematics pattern) error messages.
data sent via SMS in NGTP format are encrypted via the nowadays unsecure DES.
the Combox does not protect against replay attacks.

BMW was notified in advance of the publication to provide fixes. The transport is now encrypted and BMW's server certificate is verified. The updates were delivered via ConnectedDrive config change. All BMW, Mini and Rolls Royce cars produced between March 2010 and 8 December 2014 are vulnerable. Cars without battery or parked in places without mobile connection still may be vulnerable, an update can be initiated manually.

BMW was established as a business entity following a restructuring of the Rapp Motorenwerke aircraft manufacturing firm in 1912 named Aerowerke Gustav Otto. After the end of World War I in 1918, BMW was forced to cease aircraft-engine production by the terms of the Versailles Armistice Treaty.[5] The company consequently shifted to motorcycle production as the restrictions of the treaty started to be lifted in 1923,[6] followed by automobiles in 1928–29.[7][8][9]
The first car which BMW successfully produced and the car which launched BMW on the road to automobile production was the Dixi, based on the Austin 7 and licensed from the Austin Motor Company in Birmingham, England.
BMW's first significant aircraft engine, and commercial product of any sort, was the BMW IIIa inline-six liquid-cooled engine of 1918, known for good fuel economy and high-altitude performance.[10] With German rearmament in the 1930s, the company again began producing aircraft engines for the Luftwaffe. The factory in Munich made ample use of forced labour: foreign civilians, prisoners of war and inmates of the concentration camp Dachau [1]. Among its successful World War II engine designs were the BMW 132 and BMW 801 air-cooled radial engines, and the pioneering BMW 003 axial-flow turbojet, which powered the tiny, 1944–1945–era jet-powered "emergency fighter", the Heinkel He 162 Spatz. The BMW 003 jet engine was first tested as a prime power plant in the first prototype of the Messerschmitt Me 262, the Me 262 V1, but in 1942 tests the BMW prototype engines failed on takeoff with only the standby Junkers Jumo 210 nose-mounted piston engine powering it to a safe landing.[11][12] The few Me 262 A-1b test examples built used the more developed version of the 003 jet, recording an official top speed of 800 km/h (497 mph). The first-ever four-engine jet aircraft ever flown were the sixth and eighth prototypes of the Arado Ar 234 jet reconnaissance-bomber, which used BMW 003 jets for power. Through 1944 the 003's reliability improved, making it a suitable power plant for air frame designs competing for the Jägernotprogramm's light fighter production contract. which was won by the Heinkel He 162 Spatz design. The BMW 003 aviation turbojet was also under consideration as the basic starting point for a pioneering turboshaft powerplant for German armored fighting vehicles in 1944–45, as the GT 101.[13] Towards the end of the Third Reich, BMW developed some military aircraft projects for the Luftwaffe, the BMW Strahlbomber, the BMW Schnellbomber and the BMW Strahljäger, but none of them were built.[14][15]
[more detail]
By the year 1958, the automotive division of BMW was in financial difficulties and a shareholders meeting was held to decide whether to go into liquidation or find an alternative. It was decided to carry on by trying to cash in on the current economy car boom exploited so successfully by German ex-aircraft manufacturers such as Messerschmitt and Heinkel. BMW bought the rights to manufacture the Italian Iso Isetta. BMW's version of the tiny cars were to be powered by a modified form of BMW's motorcycle engine. This was moderately successful and helped the company get back on its feet.
Since 1959, the controlling majority shareholder of the BMW Aktiengesellschaft has been the Quandt family, which owns about 46% of the stock. The rest is in public float.
BMW acquired the Hans Glas company based in Dingolfing, Germany, in 1966. Glas vehicles were briefly badged as BMW until the company was fully absorbed. It was reputed that the acquisition was mainly to gain access to Glas' development of the timing belt with an overhead camshaft in automotive applications,[16] although some saw Glas' Dingolfing plant as another incentive. However, this factory was outmoded and BMW's biggest immediate gain was, according to themselves, a stock of highly qualified engineers and other personnel.[17] The Glas factories continued to build a limited number of their existing models, while adding the manufacture of BMW front and rear axles until they could be closer incorporated into BMW.[18]




BMW 3-Series (F30)


In 1992, BMW acquired a large stake in California-based industrial design studio DesignworksUSA, which they fully acquired in 1995. In 1994, BMW bought the British Rover Group[19] (which at the time consisted of the Rover, Land Rover and MG brands as well as the rights to defunct brands including Austin and Morris), and owned it for six years. By 2000, Rover was incurring huge losses and BMW decided to sell the combine. The MG and Rover brands were sold to the Phoenix Consortium to form MG Rover, while Land Rover was taken over by Ford. BMW, meanwhile, retained the rights to build the new Mini, which was launched in 2001.
Chief designer Chris Bangle announced his departure from BMW in February 2009, after serving on the design team for nearly seventeen years.[20] He was replaced by Adrian van Hooydonk, Bangle's former right-hand man. Bangle was known for his radical designs such as the 2002 7-Series and the 2002 Z4. In July 2007, the production rights for Husqvarna Motorcycles was purchased by BMW for a reported 93 million euros. BMW Motorrad plans to continue operating Husqvarna Motorcycles as a separate enterprise. All development, sales and production activities, as well as the current workforce, have remained in place at its present location at Varese.
In June 2012, BMW was listed as the #1 most reputable company in the world by Forbes.com.[21] Rankings are based upon aspects such as "people's willingness to buy, recommend, work for, and invest in a company is driven 60% by their perceptions of the company and only 40% by their perceptions of their products."

In 2006, the BMW group (including Mini and Rolls-Royce) produced 1,366,838 four-wheeled vehicles, which were manufactured in five countries.[22] In 2010, it manufactured 1,481,253 four-wheeled vehicles and 112,271 motorcycles (under both the BMW and Husqvarna brands).[23]
The BMW X3 (E83) was made by Magna Steyr, a subsidiary of Magna International, in Graz, Austria under license from BMW until 2010. More than 45,973 were produced in 2009. Starting October 2010, the new BMW X3 (F25) is produced at BMW US Manufacturing Company, Greer, South Carolina.
By 2011, about 56% of BMW-brand vehicles produced are powered by petrol engines and the remaining 44% are powered by diesel engines. Of those petrol vehicles, about 27% are four-cylinder models and about nine percent are eight-cylinder models.[24] BMW also has local assembly operation using complete knock down components in Thailand, Russia, Egypt, Indonesia, Malaysia, and India, for 3, 5, 7 series and X3.[25] On average, 9,000 vehicles per day exit BMW plants, and 63% are transported by rail.[26]

The R32 motorcycle, the first BMW motor vehicle.






The 2015 BMW R1200RT


BMW began production of motorcycle engines and then motorcycles after World War I.[28] Its motorcycle brand is now known as BMW Motorrad. Their first successful motorcycle after the failed Helios and Flink, was the "R32" in 1923, though production originally began in 1921.[29] This had a "boxer" twin engine, in which a cylinder projects into the air-flow from each side of the machine. Apart from their single-cylinder models (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMW's are still produced in this layout, which is designated the R Series.
During the Second World War, BMW produced the BMW R75 motorcycle with a sidecar attached. Having a unique design copied from the Zündapp KS750, its sidecar wheel was also motor-driven. Combined with a lockable differential, this made the vehicle very capable off-road, an equivalent in many ways to the Jeep.
In 1982, came the K Series, shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven F and G series with single and parallel twin Rotax engines.
In the early 1990s, BMW updated the airhead Boxer engine which became known as the oilhead. In 2002, the oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to 1,170 cc and enhanced performance to 100 hp (75 kW) for the R1200GS, compared to 85 hp (63 kW) of the previous R1150GS. More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the R1100S and R1200S, producing 98 and 122 hp (73 and 91 kW), respectively.
In 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It had an engine producing 167 hp (125 kW), derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team, and is lighter than previous K models. Innovations include electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork that BMW calls Duolever.
BMW introduced anti-lock brakes on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s. The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles pave the way for the introduction of electronic stability control, or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year.
BMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an Earles fork, front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called swinging arm). Some BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking.
BMW Group, on 31 January 2013, announced that Pierer Industrie AG has bought Husqvarna for an undisclosed amount, which will not be revealed by either party in the future. The company is headed by Stephan Pierer (CEO of KTM). Pierer Industrie AG is 51% owner of KTM and 100% owner of Husqvarna.

New Class
Main article: BMW New Class
The New Class (German: Neue Klasse) was a line of compact sedans and coupes starting with the 1962 1500 and continuing through the last 2002s in 1977. Powered by BMW's celebrated four-cylinder M10 engine, the New Class models had a fully independent suspension, MacPherson struts in front, and front disc brakes. Initially, a family of four-door sedans and two-door coupes, the New Class line was broadened to two-door sports sedans with the addition of the 02 Series 1600 and 2002 in 1966.
Sharing little in common with the rest of the line beyond power train, the sporty siblings caught auto enthusiasts' attention and established BMW as an international brand. Precursors to the famed BMW 3 Series, the two-doors' success cemented the firm's future as an upper tier performance car maker. New Class four-doors with numbers ending in "0" were replaced by the larger BMW 5 Series in 1972. The upscale 2000C and 2000CS coupes were replaced by the six-cylinder BMW E9, introduced in 1969 with the 2800CS. The 1600 two-door was discontinued in 1975, and the 2002 was replaced by the 320i in 1975.
Current models




BMW X1 (F48)






BMW 6 Series (F13)


The 1 Series, originally launched in 2004, is BMW's smallest car. Currently available are the second generation hatchback (F20/F21) and its two-door counterparts, the 2 Series coupe and convertible (F22/F23). The 3 Series, a compact executive car manufactured since model year 1975, is currently in its sixth generation (F30); models include the sports sedan (F30), the fourth generation station wagon (F31) and the Gran Turismo. Starting with the current generation, the 3 Series coupe and convertible are now branded as 4 Series models (F32 and F33 respectively). The 5 Series is a mid-size luxury car, available in sedan (F10) and station wagon (F11) forms. The 5 Series Gran Turismo (F07), which debuted in 2010, created a segment between station wagons and crossover SUV.[30]
BMW's full-size flagship executive sedan is the 7 Series. Typically, BMW introduces many of their innovations in the 7 Series, such as the iDrive system. The latest generation (G11) debuted in 2015. Based on the 5 Series' platform, the 6 Series is BMW's grand touring luxury sport coupe/convertible (F12/F13). A 2-seater roadster and coupe which succeeded the Z3, the Z4 has been sold since 2002.




BMW X3 (F25)


The X3 (F25), BMW's second crossover SUV (called SAV or "Sports Activity Vehicle" by BMW) debuted in 2010 and replaced the X3 (E83)-), which was based on the E46 3 Series' platform, and had been in production since 2003. Marketed in Europe as an off-roader, it benefits from BMW's xDrive all-wheel drive system. The all-wheel drive X5 (E53) was BMW's first crossover SUV (SAV), based on the 5-Series, and is a mid-size luxury SUV sold by BMW since 2000. A 4-seat crossover SUV released by BMW in December 2007, the X6 is marketed as a "Sports Activity Coupe" (SAC) by BMW. The X1 is now in its second generation and extends the BMW X-lineup.

BMW i3 electric car






BMW i8 plug-in hybrid


The BMW i is a sub-brand of BMW founded in 2011 to design and manufacture plug-in electric vehicles.[31][32] The sub-brand initial plans called for the release of two vehicles; series production of the BMW i3 all-electric car began in September 2013,[33] and the market launch took place in November 2013 with the first retail deliveries in Germany.[34] The BMW i8 sports plug-in hybrid car was launched in Germany in June 2014.[35] Combined sales of the BMW i brand models reached the 50,000 unit milestone in January 2016.[36] Two years after its introduction, the BMW i3 ranked as the world's third best selling all-electric car in history.[37] Global sales of the BMW i3 achieved the 50,000 unit milestone in July 2016.[38]
In February 2016, BMW announced the introduction of the "iPerformance" model designation, which will be given to all BMW plug-in hybrid vehicles from July 2016. The aim is to provide a visible indicator of the transfer of technology from BMW i to the BMW core brand. The new designation will be used first on the plug-in hybrid variants of the latest BMW 7 Series.[39] Global sales of all BMW plug-in electrified models achieved the 100,000 unit milestone in early November 2016, consisting of more than 60,000 BMW i3s, over 10,000 BMW i8s, and about 30,000 from combined sales of all BMW iPerformance plug-in hybrid models.[40]
As of November 2016[update], four BMW electrified models have been released, the BMW X5 xDrive40e iPerformance, BMW 225xe iPerformance Active Tourer, BMW 330e iPerformance, and the BMW 740e iPerformance.[41] The BMW 530e iPerformance is scheduled to be released in Europe March 2017 as part of the upcoming seventh generation BMW 5 Series lineup.[42] In November 2016, BMW announced the company expected to deliver 60,000 of its electrified i and iPerformance models in 2016, and a sales target of 100,000 units for 2017. BMW set the goal to expand the share of its electrified models to between 15% and 25% of sales by 2025,[43] when batteries have doubled their capacity.[44]
In 2015, BMW in cooperation with SCHERM Group has started deploying electric trucks on European roads, making it the first company to ever do so. The truck itself is manufactured by the Terberg Group, one of the world's largest independent specialist vehicle suppliers.[45][46][47]

BMW Connected Drive
BMW ConnectedDrive provides services and apps controlled through the vehicle's on-board computer. BMW announced the rollout of additional ConnectedDrive functions based around telecommunications in 2014. The new services and apps were made available to Australian delivered cars built during the April/March period.[56]
The ConnectedDrive update[57] introduced real-time traffic data, concierge and a new emergency call system to work alongside BMW's existing driver assistance services.[58]
In 2015, BMW Australia launched a customer portal that included integrated access to the new services and apps.[59]
Sponsorships
In football, BMW sponsors Bundesliga club Eintracht Frankfurt.[60]
It was an official sponsor of the London 2012 olympics providing 4000 BMWs and Minis in a deal made in November 2009.[61] The company also made a six-year sponsorship deal with the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) in July 2010.[62]
BMW has sponsored various European golf events such as the PGA Championship at Wentworth, the BMW Italian Open and the BMW International Open in Germany.[63]
In 2012, BMW Australia announced a 2-year sponsorship agreement with the Australian Film Institute's Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts (AACTA) Awards. As part of the agreement, BMW supplied a fleet of vehicles renowned for appearing in feature films.[64] The vehicles supplied included a range of elegant BMW limousines, iconic BMW's of the past and the BMW 6 Series which featured in Mission Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol. The automotive company also sponsored the South African national Rugby team. The sponsorship was cancelled due to controversies on the Rugby team's part.[65]
Environmental record
The company is a charter member of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Environmental Achievement Track, which recognizes companies for their environmental stewardship and performance.[66] It is also a member of the South Carolina Environmental Excellence Program.[67]
In 2012, BMW was named the world's most sustainable automotive company for the eighth consecutive year by the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes. The BMW Group is the only automotive enterprise in the index since its inception in 1999. In 2001, the BMW Group committed itself to the United Nations Environment Programme, the UN Global Compact and the Cleaner Production Declaration. It was also the first company in the automotive industry to appoint an environmental officer, in 1973.[68] BMW is a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.[69]
BMW is industry leader in the Carbon Disclosure Project's Global 500 ranking and 3rd place in Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index across all industries. BMW is listed in the FTSE4GoodIndex. The BMW Group was rated the most sustainable DAX 30 company by Sustainalytics in 2012.[70]
BMW has taken measures to reduce the impact the company has on the environment. It is trying to design less-polluting cars by making existing models more efficient, as well as developing environmentally friendly fuels for future vehicles. Possibilities include: electric power, hybrid power (combustion engines and electric motors) hydrogen engines.[71]
BMW offers 49 models with EU5/6 emissions norm and nearly 20 models with CO2 output less than 140 g/km, which puts it on the lowest tax group and therefore could provide the future owner with eco-bonus offered from some European countries.
However, there have been some criticisms directed at BMW, and in particular, accusations of greenwash in reference to their BMW Hydrogen 7. Some critics claim that the emissions produced during hydrogen fuel production outweigh the reduction of tailpipe emissions, and that the Hydrogen 7 is a distraction from more immediate, practical solutions for car pollution.[72] The BBC's Jorn Madslien questioned whether the Hydrogen 7 was "a truly green initiative or merely a cynical marketing ploy"[73]
Bicycles
BMW has created a range of high-end bicycles sold online and through dealerships. They range from the Kid's Bike to the EUR 4,499 Enduro Bike.[74] In the United States, only the Cruise Bike and Kid's Bike models are sold.
BMW nomenclature




BMW 530d (F10)






BMW 730d xDrive (G11)






BMW X5 (F15)






BMW X6 (E71)


BMW vehicles follow a certain nomenclature; usually a 3 digit number is followed by 1 or 2 letters. The first number represents the series number. The next two numbers traditionally represent the engine displacement in cubic centimeters divided by 100.[75] However, more recent cars use those two numbers as a performance index, as e.g. the 116i, 118i and 120i (all 2,0L petrol-powered), just like the 325d and 330d (both 3,0L diesel) share the same motor block while adjusting engine power through setup and turbocharging. A similar nomenclature is used by BMW Motorrad for their motorcycles.
The system of letters can be used in combination, and is as follows:

A = automatic transmission
C = coupé, last used on the BMW E46 and the BMW E63 (dropped after 2005 model year)
c = cabriolet
d = diesel†
e = eta (efficient economy, from the Greek letter 'η')
g = compressed natural gas/CNG
h = hydrogen
i = fuel-injected
L = long wheelbase
M = Motorsport
s = sport, also means "2 dr" on E36 model††
sDrive = rear-wheel drive
T = touring (wagon/estate)
Ti = hatchback for the BMW 3 Series hatchback
x / xDrive = BMW xDrive all-wheel drive

† historic nomenclature indicating "td" refers to "Turbo Diesel", not a diesel hatchback or touring model (524td, 525td)
†† typically includes sport seats, spoiler, aerodynamic body kit, upgraded wheels and Limit Slip Differential on pre-95 model etc.
For example, the BMW 750iL is a fuel-injected 7 Series with a long wheelbase and 5.4 litres of displacement. This badge was used for successive generations, E65 and F01, except the "i" and "L" switched places, so it read "Li" instead of "iL".
When 'L' supersedes the series number (e.g. L6, L7, etc.) it identifies the vehicle as a special luxury variant, having extended leather and special interior appointments. The L7 is based on the E23 and E38, and the L6 is based on the E24.
When 'X' is capitalised and supersedes the series number (e.g. X3, X5, etc.) it identifies the vehicle as one of BMW's Sports Activity Vehicles (SAV), their brand of crossovers, with BMW's xDrive. The second number in the 'X' series denotes the platform that it is based upon, for instance the X5 is derived from the 5 Series. Unlike BMW cars, the SAV's main badge does not denote engine size; the engine is instead indicated on side badges.
The 'Z' identifies the vehicle as a two-seat roadster (e.g. Z1, Z3, Z4, etc.). 'M' variants of 'Z' models have the 'M' as a suffix or prefix, depending on country of sale (e.g. 'Z4 M' is 'M Roadster' in Canada).
Previous X & Z vehicles had 'i' or 'si' following the engine displacement number (denoted in litres). BMW is now globally standardising this nomenclature on X & Z vehicles by using 'sDrive' or 'xDrive' (simply meaning rear or all-wheel drive, respectively) followed by two numbers which vaguely represent the vehicle's engine (e.g. Z4 sDrive35i is a rear-wheel-drive Z4 roadster with a 3.0 L twin-turbo fuel-injected engine).[76]
BMW last used the 's' for the E36 328is, which ceased production in 1999. However, the 's' nomenclature was brought back on the 2011 model year BMW 335is and BMW Z4 sDrive35is. The 335is is a sport-tuned trim with more performance and an optional dual clutch transmission that slots between the regular 335i and top-of-the-line M3.[77][78]
The 'M' – for Motorsport – identifies the vehicle as a high-performance model of a particular series (e.g. M3, M5, M6, etc.). For example, the M6 is the highest performing vehicle in the 6 Series lineup. Although 'M' cars should be separated into their respective series platforms, it is very common to see 'M' cars grouped together as its own lineup on the official BMW website.
Exceptions
There are exceptions to the numbering nomenclature.[79]
The M version of the BMW 1 Series was named the BMW 1 Series M Coupe rather than the traditional style "M1" due to the possible confusion with BMW's former BMW M1 homologation sports car.
The M versions of the Sports Activity Vehicles, such as the X5 M, could not follow the regular naming convention since MX5 was used for Mazda's MX-5 Miata.
For instance in the 2008 model year, the BMW 125i/128i, 328i, and 528i all had 3.0 naturally aspirated engines (N52), not a 2,500 cc or 2,800 cc engine as the series designation number would lead one to believe. The '28' is to denote a detuned engine in the 2008 cars, compared to the 2006 model year '30' vehicles (330i and 530i) whose 3.0 naturally aspirated engines are from the same N52 family but had more output.
The 2008 BMW 335i and 535i also have 3.0-litre engine; however the engines are twin-turbocharged (N54) which is not identified by the nomenclature. Nonetheless the '35' indicates a more powerful engine than previous '30' models that have the naturally aspirated N52 engine. The 2011 BMW 740i and 335is shares the same twin-turbo 3.0 engine from the N54 family but tuned to higher outputs, although the badging is not consistent ('40' and 's'). The 2013 BMW 640i Gran Coupe's twin-scroll single turbo 3.0L inline-6 engine makes similar output to the older twin turbo inline-6 engines.[80]
The E36 and E46 323i and E39 523i had 2.5-litre engines. The E36 318is made after 1996 has a 1.9 L engine (M44) as opposed to the 1.8 L (M42) used in the 1992 to 1995 models. The E36 316i "Contour" manufactured between 1999 and 2000 could be fitted with the 1.9 L M43B19 (M43). The E39 540i had a 4.4 L M62 engine, instead of a 4.0 L as the designation would suggest.
The badging for recent V8 engines (N62 and N63) also does not indicate displacement, as the 2006 750i and 2009 750i have 4800 cc (naturally aspirated) and 4400 cc (twin-turbocharged) engines, respectively.
In BMW CSL models (for example BMW M3 CSL), the letter L stands for Leichtbau (German for lightweight) instead of Lang (German for long wheelbase).
Carsharing services
In June 2011, BMW and Sixt launched Drivenow, a joint-venture that provides carsharing services in several cities in Europe and North America. As of December 2012, DriveNow operates over 1,000 vehicles, which serve five cities worldwide and over 60,000 customers.[81]
BMW has expanded its DriveNow car-sharing service in Seattle, rebranded as ReachNow.[82]
Light and Charge
BMW has developed street lights equipped with sockets to charge electric cars, called Light and Charge.[83]
Community




BMW logo sign in Düsseldorf


From the summer of 2001 until October 2005, BMW hosted The Hire, showcasing sporty models being driven to extremes.[84] These videos are still popular within the enthusiast community and proved to be a ground-breaking online advertising campaign.
Annually since 1999, BMW enthusiasts have met in Santa Barbara, CA to attend Bimmerfest. One of the largest brand-specific gatherings in the United States, over 3,000 people attended in 2006, and over 1,000 BMW cars were present. In 2007, the event was held on 5 May.
BMW slang
The initials BMW are pronounced [ˈbeː ˈɛm ˈveː] in German.[85] The model series are referred to as "Einser" ("One-er" for 1 series), "Dreier" ("Three-er" for 3 series), "Fünfer" ("Five-er" for the 5 series), "Sechser" ("Six-er" for the 6 series), "Siebener" ("Seven-er" for the 7 series). These are not actually slang, but are the normal way that such letters and numbers are pronounced in German.[86]
The English slang terms Beemer, Bimmer and Bee-em are variously used for BMWs of all kinds,[87][88] cars and motorcycles.[89][90]
In the US, specialists have been at pains to prescribe that a distinction must be made between using Beemer exclusively to describe BMW motorcycles, and using Bimmer only to refer to BMW cars,[91][92][93] in the manner of a "true aficionado"[94] and avoid appearing to be "uninitiated."[95][96] The Canadian Globe and Mail prefers Bimmer and calls Beemer a "yuppie abomination,"[97] while the Tacoma News Tribune says it is a distinction made by "auto snobs."[98] Using the wrong slang risks offending BMW enthusiasts.[99][100][101] An editor of Business Week was satisfied in 2003 that the question was resolved in favor of Bimmer by noting that a Google search yielded 10 times as many hits compared to Beemer.[102]
The arts




1975 BMW 3.0CSL painted by Alexander Calder


Manufacturers employ designers for their cars, but BMW has made efforts to gain recognition for exceptional contributions to and support of the arts, including art beyond motor vehicle design. These efforts typically overlap or complement BMW's marketing and branding campaigns.[103] BMW Headquarters designed in 1972 by Karl Schwanzer has become a European icon,[104] and artist Gerhard Richter created his Red, Yellow, Blue series of paintings for the building's lobby.[105][106] In 1975, Alexander Calder was commissioned to paint the 3.0CSL driven by Hervé Poulain at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. This led to more BMW Art Cars, painted by artists including David Hockney, Jenny Holzer, Roy Lichtenstein, and others. The cars, currently numbering 17, have been shown at the Louvre, Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, and, in 2009, at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and New York's Grand Central Terminal.[104] BMW was the principal sponsor of the 1998 The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and other Guggenheim museums, though the financial relationship between BMW and the Guggenheim was criticised in many quarters.[107][108]
In 2012, BMW brought out the BMW Art Guide by Independent Collectors, which had, amongst others, the Dikeou Collection. It is the first global guide to private and publicly accessible collections of contemporary art worldwide.[109]

The 2006 "BMW Performance Series" was a marketing event geared to attract black car buyers, and included the "BMW Pop-Jazz Live Series," a tour headlined by jazz musician Mike Phillips, and the "BMW Blackfilms.com Film Series" highlighting black filmmakers.[110]
April Fools
BMW has garnered a reputation over the years for its April Fools pranks, which are printed in the British press every year. In 2010, they ran an advertisement in The Guardian announcing that customers would be able to order BMWs with different coloured badges to show their affiliation with the political party they supported.[111]
Overseas subsidiaries
Brazil
On 9 October 2014, BMW's new South American automobile plant in Araquari, Santa Catarina produced its first car. BMW intend to increase its production capacity to over 30,000 vehicles a year. The new site is intended to create around 1,300 new jobs, of which 500 have already been filled.[112]
Canada
In October 2008, BMW Group Canada was named one of Greater Toronto's Top Employers by Mediacorp Canada Inc., which was announced by the Toronto Star newspaper.[113]
China
Main article: BMW Brilliance
Signing a deal in 2003 for the production of sedans in China,[114] May 2004 saw the opening of a factory in the North-eastern city of Shenyang where Brilliance Auto produces BMW-branded automobiles[115] in a joint venture with the German company.[116]
Egypt
Bavarian Auto Group is a multinational group of companies established in March 2003 when it was appointed as the sole importer of BMW and Mini in Egypt, with monopoly rights for import, assembly, distribution, sales and after-sales support of BMW products in Egypt. Since that date, BAG invested a total amount of US$100 million distributed on seven companies and 11 premises in addition to three stores.
India
BMW India was established in 2006 as a sales subsidiary in Gurgaon (National Capital Region). A state-of-the-art assembly plant for BMW 3 and 5 Series started operation in early 2007 in Chennai. Construction of the plant started in January 2006 with an initial investment of more than one billion Indian Rupees. The plant started operation in the first quarter of 2007 and produces the different variants of BMW 3 Series, BMW GT, BMW 5 Series, BMW 7 Series, BMW X1, BMW X3, BMW X5, Mini Cooper S, Mini Cooper D and Mini Countryman. Further more, it has expanded its model range to include the BMW Z4, BMW X6, BMW M Cars, and BMW i8. There are a total of 31 variants of BMW cars on offer in the Indian market today.[117]
Japan
The vast majority of BMW automobiles in Japan are imported and sold by BMW Japan Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of BMW AG.
Mexico
In July 2014, BMW announced it was establishing a plant in Mexico, in the city and state of San Luis Potosi involving an investment of $1 billion. The plant will employ 1,500 people, and produce 150,000 cars annually, commencing in 2019.[118]
South Africa
BMWs have been assembled in South Africa since 1968,[119] when Praetor Monteerders' plant was opened in Rosslyn, near Pretoria. BMW initially bought shares in the company, before fully acquiring it in 1975; in so doing, the company became BMW South Africa, the first wholly owned subsidiary of BMW to be established outside Germany. Three unique models that BMW Motorsport created for the South African market were the E23 M745i (1983), which used the M88 engine from the BMW M1, the BMW 333i (1986), which added a six-cylinder 3.2-litre M30 engine to the E30,[120] and the E30 BMW 325is (1989) which was powered by an Alpina-derived 2.7-litre engine.
Unlike United States manufacturers, such as Ford and GM, which divested from the country in the 1980s, BMW retained full ownership of its operations in South Africa. Following the end of apartheid in 1994, and the lowering of import tariffs, BMW South Africa ended local production of the 5-Series and 7-Series, in order to concentrate on production of the 3-Series for the export market. South African–built BMWs are now exported to right hand drive markets including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Hong Kong, as well as Sub-Saharan Africa. Since 1997, BMW South Africa has produced vehicles in left-hand drive for export to Taiwan, the United States and Iran, as well as South America.
BMWs with a VIN starting with "NC0" are manufactured in South Africa.
United States




BMW Spartanburg factory


The BMW Manufacturing Company opened in 1994, in South Carolina, and has been manufacturing all Z4 and X5 models, and more recently the X6 and X3, including those for export to Europe, on the same assembly line in Greer between Greenville and Spartanburg.[121] In an average work day the company builds 600 vehicles: 500 X5s and 100 Z4s. The engines for these vehicles are built in Munich, Germany. BMWs with a VIN starting with "4US and 5US" are manufactured in Greer.
In 2010 BMW announced that it would spend $750 million to expand operations at the Greer plant. This expansion will allow production of 240,000 vehicles a year and will make the plant the largest car factory in the United States by number of employees.[122] BMW's largest single market is the United States, where 339 dealerships sold 346,023 cars in 2015.[123]
As of 2015[update], the Greer facility produces all BMW X3, X4, X5, X5 M, X6 and X6 M models.[124]
Marketing
BMW began using the slogan 'The Ultimate Driving Machine' in the 1970s. In 2010, this long-lived campaign was mostly supplanted by 'Joy', a campaign intended to make the brand more "approachable" and to better appeal to women, but by 2012 they had returned to "The Ultimate Driving Machine", which has a strong public association with BMW.[125]
Audio logo
In 2013, BMW replaced the 'double-gong' sound used in TV and Radio advertising campaigns since 1998. The new sound, developed to represent the future identity of BMW, was described as "introduced by a rising, resonant sound and underscored by two distinctive bass tones that form the sound logo's melodic and rhythmic basis."[126] The new sound was first used in BMW 4 Series Concept Coupe TV commercial.[127] The sound was produced by Thomas Kisser of HASTINGS media music.[128]

The circular blue and white BMW logo or roundel evolved from the circular Rapp Motorenwerke company logo, from which the BMW company grew, combined with the blue and white colors of the flag of Bavaria.[129] The logo has been portrayed as the movement of an aircraft propeller with the white blades cutting through a blue sky—first used in a BMW advertisement in 1929, twelve years after the roundel was created—but this is not the origin of the logo itself.[130] The BMW logo still used today was created in early 1920.[131]
Problems
Theft using OBD, 2012
In 2012, BMW vehicles were stolen by programming a blank key fob to start the car through the on-board diagnostics (OBD) connection.[132][133][134] The primary causes of this vulnerability lie in the lack of appropriate authentication and authorization in the OBD specifications, which rely largely on security through obscurity. BMW offered all owners a free fix through a software update, and all newer vehicles have upgraded software that fixed this vulnerability.[135]
ConnectedDrive, 2010–14
Dieter Spaar was asked by ADAC to analyze ConnectedDrive and its hardware called Combox. He uncovered the following problems which allowed him e.g. to remotely open the car:[136]

BMW uses the same symmetric keys in all cars.
some services do not encrypt transported data while connecting to the BMW backend.
the integrity of the ConnectedDrive configuration is not protected.
the Combox discloses the vehicle identification number via NGTP (next generation telematics pattern) error messages.
data sent via SMS in NGTP format are encrypted via the nowadays unsecure DES.
the Combox does not protect against replay attacks.

BMW was notified in advance of the publication to provide fixes. The transport is now encrypted and BMW's server certificate is verified. The updates were delivered via ConnectedDrive config change. All BMW, Mini and Rolls Royce cars produced between March 2010 and 8 December 2014 are vulnerable. Cars without battery or parked in places without mobile connection still may be vulnerable, an update can be initiated manually.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

      Fitch Rates BMW Vehicle Owner Trust 2016-A
    





July 20, 2016 11:57 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assign the following ratings to the BMW Vehicle Owner 
      Trust 2016-A (BMWOT 2016-A) notes:
    

      --$329,000,000 class A-1 'F1+sf';
    

      --$325,000,000 class A-2a 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$125,000,000 class A-2b 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$356,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$115,000,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Strong Collateral Quality: The weighted average (WA) Fair Isaac Corp. 
      (FICO) score of 763 is consistent with prior BMWOT pools and indicates 
      strong borrower credit quality. Extended-term contracts and certified 
      pre-owned (CPO) collateral have slightly decreased from the prior 
      transaction.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement: 2016-A incorporates a sequential-pay 
      structure. Total initial hard credit enhancement (CE) in 2016-A for 
      class A notes is 2.75% (overcollateralization [OC] of 2.50% plus a 0.25% 
      initial reserve), consistent with 2014-A. Yield supplement OC will be 
      used to boost the transaction's annual percentage rate (APR), providing 
      expected excess spread of 3.34%. Hard CE is sufficient to cover Fitch's 
      'AAAsf' stressed loss expectation.
    

      Strong Portfolio/Securitization Performance: BMWFS's securitizations and 
      serviced portfolio have experienced stable delinquency and loss 
      performance over the past few years following peak levels recorded 
      during the recent recession (2008-2010).
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market is 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      increasing used vehicle supply from off-lease vehicles and trade-ins to 
      pressure ABS recovery rates, leading to moderately higher loss rates. 
      Fitch's analysis accounts for this risk by including periods of weak 
      wholesale vehicle market performance in the derivation of its base case 
      loss expectation.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of BMWFS would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      Stable Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Fitch believes BMWFS is a 
      capable originator, underwriter, and servicer for prime auto loan 
      collateral as evidenced by the historical delinquency and loss 
      performance of its securitizations and managed portfolio.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This in turn could result in potential negative rating actions on 
      the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to 
      BMWOT 2016-A to increased losses over the life of the transaction. 
      Fitch's analysis found that the class A notes display minimal 
      sensitivity to a moderate increase in defaults and losses, under Fitch's 
      moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. However, class A notes could 
      experience downgrades of up to two rating categories under Fitch's 
      severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from KPMG 
      LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on comparing or recalculating 
      certain information with respect to 140 receivables. Fitch considered 
      this information in its analysis and the findings did not have an impact 
      on our analysis/conclusions. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E 
      received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be obtained 
      through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating action 
      commentary.

BMW Certified Pre-Owned
WARRANTY

                    We’ve added even more reasons to own a Certified Pre-Owned BMW.
                

                    Every Certified Pre-Owned BMW comes with a protection plan designed to give you the ultimate peace-of-mind. All Certified Pre-Owned BMW vehicles are exceptional, as are our two tiers of Certification:
                

BMW Certified Pre-Owned: Covers you for 2 years/50,000 miles* whichever comes first, after the expiration of the 4-year/50,000-mile New Vehicle Limited Warranty for Passenger Cars and Light Trucks – 2016 Models (Valid only in the U.S.A. including Puerto Rico) for a total of 6 years/100,000 miles.* For Certified Pre-Owned vehicles retailed on or after January 1, 2014, up to 6 years of BMW Roadside Assistance is included.
                

BMW Certified Pre-Owned Elite: These are newer model year, lower mileage (more than 300 miles but less than 15,001 miles) vehicles. This warranty covers you for 1 year/25,000 miles* after the expiration of the 4-year/50,000-mile New Vehicle Limited Warranty for Passenger Cars and Light Trucks – 2016 Models (Valid only in the U.S.A. including Puerto Rico) or for a total of 5 years/75,000 miles.* For Certified Pre-Owned vehicles retailed on or after January 1, 2014, up to 5 years of BMW Roadside Assistance is included.

My car got caught in fire yesterday and it covered with flames. Luckily I got out the car quickly and nobody is hurt. It's too dramatic and I would never have expected this. I used to love its apparent and the car's handling, even though there are numerous problems I had to deal with (random misfires, water pump, fuel pump and crankshaft position sensor failures). Up to this point, I am hesitated to buy another BMW in future. I Googled and there is a list of news reported about BMWs get caught in fire.Helpful?YesNoSonmi of Nashville, TN on May 11, 2017Satisfaction RatingI own BMW 2009 335i and had fuel injector went wrong. I took it to import car specialist and diagnosed/ready to be repaired when I read the article about the injector recall on 2010, previously produced BMW. I called toll free to confirm if that is true. A representative responded my call and told me it is not the recall, but they extended warranty and told me to take it to the dealership. I was about to spend $1700 at the import specialist, so I was so excited about it. I called repair shop right away and canceled the repair, and told them I just spoke BMW representatives and he said I have warranty. The repair guy congratulated me saving a lot and asked me to tow my car since the sounds are real unstable so I towed my car to dealership. They took my statement took my car.The next day, the dealership called me and told me I don't have warranty and call the company again to confirm. So I called the same number, the representative who answered my phone was so rude (and she will contact me several more times to tell me the exactly the same story) and asked my VIN number, and the VIN number I gave her doesn't have the warranty. I tried to explain to her what had happened a day before, but she wouldn't listen. She kept saying that she doesn't have any record of me calling, even if I copied my phone call photos and Verizon statement. Several uncomfortable conversations/emails/proof of BMW dealer's statement of it saying I believed that the warranty was covered at the time of my vehicle was received at the dealership, they denied their responsibilities, and treated me like I am the liar.Who would go through that trouble not believing having warranty, paying $700 more than the imported specialist and towing and double dipping diagnostic fees. My car is still in dealer's while I argued with them to admit their mistakes, but no apologies, but I became a liar of calling them, they couldn't find my number that morning calls... etc.I still don't have car two weeks later (still in the dealership) and wrote a last email, I gave up. All I can do is let my friends and family know what they've done to me, how they treat their customers and encourage them not to be in a situations like me. It is not only pain to deal with people who doesn't believe me with all the evidence I presented, but also ignore their responsibilities of what they informed to their customers. I ended up will pay close to $2500 to change the problem injectors, but I ended up not suffering from them ever because I will never take my car to the dealership and never buy another BMW.I really regret my friend's recommendation not to buy one years ago, all I would get is trouble... and yes. Anyone out there, know this. They will tell you, while looking at the image of your phone record, "You never called us, we don't have a record of your number". Not honest, soon or later the business will pay the price for it. Just like our lives.Helpful?YesNoNinuvyur of Santa Clarita, CA on May 6, 2017Satisfaction RatingI just want to say I love my BMW and have never had any problems with my car. It has run beautifully since the day I bought it used from a private party with 48,000 miles on it 2 years ago. I only have 1 major complaint and that is the underside of the front bumper being that it seems to be too low. When parking, those cement stoppers? The car will easily park where the bumper is rested above the concrete stopper which is normal parking. HOWEVER if you do this BEWARE, because when you back out? KA-KLUNK! Sounds like someone was thrown into your vehicle but no, there's a piece under the bumper that gets caught on the cement piece and when you back out it gets caught on your bumper and nearly pulls it off! This has happened too many times to count as you cannot see the cement bumper and should not have to and should be able to park normally.The result is a separated bumper which will eventually get torn off. I've had to have mine reattached several times. The clips have been broken numerous times and it is now held on with a strong black wire and the bumper has literally been screwed on. Unless I nearly park 3/4s of the way into a spot or back in it will inevitably happen again. Other than that the front seat does not recline flat. At best it reclines to a 30 angle which is weird for a luxury car.Otherwise I love my BMW. People don't understand these cars are very complex and technologically advanced. If taken care of properly... (using the proper grade fuel, proper fluids, etc.) Your car will run as good as the day it left the showroom. The red no " in between" with these cars, if something's not right it wont run like crap. It just wont run at all until it's dealt with.Helpful?YesNoAugusto of Riverside, CT on May 3, 2017Satisfaction RatingI leased a 2 series as a third car - Just returned with 6k miles. Half way the car went dead - Ok, it happens. But it took 24h and 5 or 6 calls - Yes - For BMW roadside assistance to tow the car to the dealership (And then I had a few issues with the dealership, but minor so won't make this too long). I then proceeded to return it a couple weeks ago. They did an inspection a month before lease return (Just like my Range Rover went through, which showed a lot of charges, but then to my surprise US Bank did not charge any of them as I believe someone actually checked it and saw they were unwarranted - Kudos to them). Anyways, BMW are now charging me the same exact 2k from the "Inspection" even though I changed one tire at the dealership as requested (I deemed that to be right) AND the key that was "Missing" wasn't and was returned - They said the inspection was final, and it is upon me to show all receipts. Plus they are charging me for minor wheel scratches and other things I had never heard of before from Mercedes or Range Rover or anyone else I've dealt with for that matter. BMW never, ever again.Helpful?YesNoPatrick of Marthasville, MO on April 26, 2017Satisfaction RatingMy wife bought a used BMW X3 2014 with about 35M miles on it. After a couple oil changes and 42M miles the engine had a drivetrain fault and BMW said it was a computer issue and we needed to pay to update our program. A month later we got another drivetrain malfunction fault but this time the oil pump quit on the way to the dealership and the engine seized up. BMW insists this is not their fault and they have no liability.Helpful?YesNo

The first year I took it back for so many reasons. It was unbelievable. Yet it was suppose to be certified pre-owned. I have fibromyalgia and it was very frustrating for me. I lost all confidence in the car. I have depression, anxiety, and the car when bought only had 24,000 miles. The problems I had was not call for with a BMW.Helpful?YesNoThuan of West Hills, CA on April 15, 2017Satisfaction RatingWe purchased a 2010 BMW 535i station wagon from Bob Smith BMW in Calabasas 4 years ago. We even paid for extended warranty to 100k miles. The engine broke down on 89k miles. Contacted BMW North America AND Bob Smith to repair, no one takes responsibility to help us. After the car had to towed to Bob Smith for diagnosed (it was already diagnosed elsewhere to determined the engine went bad already) they told us it will cost over $1600 to diagnosed. Then they told us it will cost us over $20,000 to replace the engine. Yes, you read it correctly... $20,000 NOT $2,000.Bad customer service when it comes to warranty. Only if we could beg the public not to purchase BMW, we would. If you're thinking of owning one, please think twice before you do it. BMW will give you the best service when everything is going well, but the minute something is seriously wrong with the car they will show their true color. So sad & extremely disappointed with the way BMW handled the whole situation. We've owned 4 BMW but we are going a different direction now. Unfortunately we still have another BMW 328i, can't wait to just get rid of it as well. Sighed.Helpful?YesNoIan of Lehi, UT on April 12, 2017Satisfaction RatingI own a 1999 BMW 328i e46. At 0715hrs March/23/2017 I was driving to work when out of nowhere and for no reason the drivers side A-pillar and door airbags deployed striking my left arm leaving a bruise and pushing me towards the center console. I contacted BMW of North America and spoke to a representative and was asked to deliver the vehicle to the nearest dealership so they can perform an investigation. At 1525 hrs April/11/2017 I contacted the representative at BMW, she told me that the sensors sensed an impact even though there is no recent physical damage to the undercarriage of my car. She then proceeded to tell me my car's suspension is worn out and could've caused enough shock to set off my airbag.Instead of taking responsibility for an obvious manufacturer issue she then tried to blame it on age then changed back to a sensor recorded an impact. Then offered me $1500 to "Help" with repairs to my car "in-house only". I need my car. It's how I get to work so I can take care of my family. I can't cover the existing amount of $3000 to cover the rest as quick as I need my car! BMW should pay for all the damages! Airbags should NEVER deploy without an accident! The car broke itself and tried to kill me in the process. Luckily I am 230 pounds and 6'1" tall. This could've killed anyone smaller!!! Very scary and disappointing!Helpful?YesNoBeatriz of Westlake Village, CA on March 28, 2017Satisfaction RatingOur BMW M235i coupe, was involved in an accident, another car hit it from the back, so they are responsible. The car has been sitting in the body shop for over 2 months as it is missing one piece that BMW USA does not have available. They are not giving us any estimation as of when this piece will be ready but minimum it could be another month! And in the meantime not compensation for the lease payments while we are waiting for that piece from BMW! It is unbelievable that BMW leases cars that they don't have the all the spare parts available and they expect customers to continue renting a car until it's ready! Over 3 months or more... Also their customer services is appalling! They don't bother to even be nice or understanding of the situation.Helpful?YesNoDavid of Oak Forest, IL on March 21, 2017Satisfaction RatingI recently waited 3:15 minutes in my car for the towing company that BMW contracted to get to me. I'm in the Chicago metro area. There are literally hundreds of towing companies and absolutely NO reason for this to happen. I hit a pothole and blew out my right front tire. I called BMW RA and received the confirmation email and ETA at 4:14 pm. The ETA for the tow truck was originally set for 5:53 pm, a full 90 minutes from the time I placed the call. That time came and went and no tow truck. I called back and BMW RA said, "We contacted them, they are running a little behind and will be there in 30 min." That was a bold-faced lie, because I then received another text from R.A. stating that the NEW ETA was 6:40 pm, which was a full HOUR longer. 6:40 pm came and went and I called AGAIN. I was told at that point, "We contacted the company and the driver is 15 minutes away. That was a bold-faced lie because shortly after that call I received another text changing the ETA to 7:12 pm. I called back and started screaming and they said they contacted a 2nd towing company "just in case" the original company didn't show. At 7:30 pm a different company showed up and that driver showed me his phone to prove to me that he had just been dispatched 15 min. earlier. The original company NEVER SHOWED. This is proof that the BMW RA people were lying right to my face and is also BEYOND PATHETIC that I had to wait in my car for 3:15 min. no bathroom, no food, running out of gas in the Winter in Chicago. This is the 2nd bad experience I've had with BMW Roadside Assist. and I have to tell you I will think twice about purchasing another BMW. I didn't have these issues with Mercedes.Helpful?YesNoDoug of Montgomery City, MO on March 19, 2017Satisfaction RatingI bought a 2003 Dinan 525i used with ~60K on it. In the last 7 years I've logged another 180K+ on it. While I have had to do repairs (I work on it myself) it is nothing out of the ordinary; tires, brakes, coolant system rebuild (pump, radiator, fan clutch, overflow tank and pulleys/belt), alternator, O2 sensors, vanos seals and intake rubber ducting, all gearbox fluids changed. It is all to be expected for a car of this age. I have no complaints as the car has served me well. Some interior trim has broken or weathered and has been replaced, and the sunroof tracks will get replaced this summer. I am getting it detailed to celebrate its 250K milestone. This car owes me nothing! It has served me well and I have no indication that it's getting tired.Helpful?YesNoDaniel of Severna, MD on March 9, 2017Satisfaction RatingI purchased a BMW 550i new from the dealer ($75K). I was sold a maintenance warranty on the understanding that it covered the cost of replacing the brakes at 80K miles. When it reached the 80K I was told that the brakes still had too much life on them to replace and since the 5-year warranty was expiring, they would not replace the brakes. There's some small print that was not clear that allows them to do this. DON'T BUY THE EXTENDED SERVICE WARRANTY if you decide to purchase a BMW. It's a total rip off. Unless you drive very aggressively, you will basically overpay for for oil changes and windshield wipers. Read on about whether you should buy a BMW.While I liked the car, it has had an endless set of repairs. This was fine while it was under warranty but a money drain once it was off warranty. DO NOT BUY A BMW. Better off choosing another German engineered car or something Japanese. Will never buy another BMW and will share my story with anyone who will listen.Helpful?YesNoMak of Lansdale, PA on Feb. 28, 2017Satisfaction RatingI have had my BMW for 3 years and it was time to turn in my lease. Autovin had come to my house and inspected the car - they reported no problems at all to me. Called BMW FS to confirm that everything was fine a few days later and was informed that everything was good to go and I could turn in the car. I return the car a few days later to BMW Freehold & that evening I called BMW FS to inform them I dropped off the car and that I had fulfilled all responsibility on my end including paying for mileage overages. At that time, the representative advised I had to pay $300 for a tire that was 3 on the tread since they allow 4 and above. This was complete news to me & I called spoke to manager Asha ** who was the least bit helpful and all she could say was, "Sorry, we cannot do anything else." I spoke to another supervisor Erin ** who also "had no authority" to make any changes & said this is how it is. It would have been nice to been informed of any wear on the tire as I could have replaced it myself and saved $200. I am about to get a new BMW in two weeks but definitely will not get that anymore. Word to the wise - DO NOT LEASE FROM BMW, they will screw you at the end and won't tell you about it until later when you are helpless.Helpful?YesNoWayne of New Canaan, CT on Feb. 7, 2017Satisfaction RatingFor the past 10 months I have been unsuccessful in getting BMW North America to pay a rebate. If this was the first time I would accept this as just bad luck - however in ALL cases that I have applied for rebates the same BMW policy/process has been adopted to reject a rebate claim regardless if all documents have been submitted correctly. BMW should not offer rebates if the intent is not to pay the rebate or they make it so difficult that the average person just gives up as the rebate value does not warrant the effort.I have received excellent (amazing) service from Darian BMW for the past 7 years, however BMW's corporate policy regarding automatic rejection of rebates is an unethical business practice and is going to drive customers like myself to support competing manufacturer like Discovery who honor their programs and pay rebates promptly. I have applied for 3 rebates in the past 6 years from BMW, with only one rebate been paid after many months of continues arguments and re-submissions.Rebate 1: After months of following up I was informed that the first rebate was received by BMW but the voucher needed to be submitted by myself as the program had ended. BMW North America informed me that it is the customers responsibility to retain advertising documents as proof of rebate. As I did not retain a copy of the advertising documents, and was unable to get a copy from BMW the claim was rejected and not paid.Rebate 2: I submitted a rebate claim with advertising documents and BMW invoice. As with rebate 1 the application was in the system and been processed, however after 3 months of continues follow-up I was informed that the application was rejected as not all of the paperwork was received (even though BMW had confirmed previously that documents had been received and payment was been processed). In this case I had proof of submission and that all paperwork was provided.BMW apologized and said they would process, however 2 months later I followed up to query why I did not receive the rebate. BMW informed me that they are unable to process the rebate as they have no record of the rebate program. Having learnt from the first rebate I retained all documents. I resubmitted (3 times) the paperwork with a copy of the rebate advertising documents etc. BMW once again apologized and finally processed the rebate. Total process time over 8 months with numerous calls, emails and re-submissions.Rebate 3: Rebate 3 was submitted with Rebate 2 (same time) as the work was completed at the same time. BMW received all paperwork but in this case BMW North America "forgot" to process this rebate with rebate 2. BMW apologized and at first agreed to honor the rebate. After 9 months of continues follow-up BMW North America have informed me that they do not have the money to pay this rebate and that payment will need to be processed from BMW Germany? BMW North America acknowledge receipt of all the paperwork including the advertising documents. Today (02/07/2017) I receive a call from BMW North America notifying me that I am refusing to submit the paperwork and therefore BMW are unable to process the rebate???Helpful?YesNoCHRISTIAN of Bronx, NY on Feb. 1, 2017Satisfaction RatingI leased a 2015 320i BMW. The check engine light turned on. When I took it to BMW they told that unfortunately they have put a sensor in the bottom of the car and that the sensor has no cover. Since BMW are low cars and the city is full of bumps and potholes the cables of the sensor broke. They told me that the warranty doesn't cover that. I had to pay for the part and hours of labor. I believe it's not fair to any bmw customer that because bmw (unfortunately) located a sensor in an inappropriate place and decided not cover it, we have to pay for that when it should be included on the warranty.Helpful?YesNoTimothy of Beverly Hills, CA on Jan. 30, 2017Satisfaction RatingI have owned several cars, and in the modern Era, the E60 535i started off with tons of trouble, along with my X6M. My E85 Z4 was an amazing car, even if it was not a driver's car with the electronic steering, but I loved it. I got the 535i as a daily driver. Water pumps (2), fuel pumps (2), disintegrating chargepipe, multiple injector replacements (2x had all of them replaced), the mystery 30ff error nobody can fix, the seat mat/airbag issue, the wastegate rattle and it would not be a BMW without a leaky valve cover gasket. There was always something wrong. So I bought an X6M a few months ago. Airbag recall, battery recall, injector recall... I have owned E30s, E9, E38, E39, E85 and an E31. Mostly trouble-free cars, then came the turbos and BMW's total inability to make a good engine that does not start causing issues, interiors that look dated and recalls that keep it parked more than I drive it. Even the driving experience has gone to hell.Helpful?YesNoDerrick of Douglasville, GA on Jan. 29, 2017Satisfaction RatingProblem 1: Transfer case have been replace several times and I'm still having problems with this high price Junk. Problem 2: About 6 months ago the car started sputtering when you accelerate. I found online that you can take your BMW 2011 750LI xdrive in for a customer care package (They did not call it a recall but a customer care package). I thought this would correct the problems because they replace some sensors and vacuum hose but the problem is still there. BMW did a full diagnostic and said "Remove and replace all injectors (x8), ignition coils (x8), and spark plugs (x8)." (During the inspection found the vehicle misfiring). Final cost will run $6777.00. My warranty company will refuse to pay because they wanted to know what would you replace all 8 injectors and all of the other parts because all 8 injectors cant be bad. The warranty company think BMW know they have a faulted Injection systems and trying to upgrade and correct the problem at the customer expense. The car burn major oil, BMW claim this is normal. I will get a second opinion. This is the worst car I have ever own and when you spend a 100,000 on a car you expect to drive it more then 4 years without all of the problems these car has cost us. I thought BMW quality meant something. I will never, never buy another BMW in Life.Problem 3: Car have 114k now they are telling me the Transmission needs to be replace. This car have been a nightmare from hell. BMW NEED TO BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES FOR PUTTING OUT SUCH horrible quality. YOU HAVE LOST US FOR LIFE. Now when I see a BMW commercial I laugh. "They are truly the new Ford in the world of Automobiles".Helpful?YesNoMarc of Rosemere, QC on Jan. 27, 2017Satisfaction RatingI bought Blizzak winter tires from Bridgestone for the 2 time in 3 years. This last time I had an issue with one of the tire after 3 weeks. It was deflating. I stopped at the BMW garage in Oakville and they had to replace my tire. I wrote to Bridgestone from their website. They never got my request and realized when I called that did not even know where the web inquiries went!!! They basically wash their hands of any support. You spend $3,000 in tires in 3 years and they won't stand behind their products for $300!!! I will never buy any Bridgestone tires again, not because of their products but because of the lack of vision and consumer care from the company. I gave them an 8 on 10 for their products but a 1 on 10 for their consumer care service.Helpful?YesNoDr of Someset, NJ on Jan. 24, 2017Satisfaction RatingI purchase a BMW X5 diesel in December 2014. Since then, I have been having problem. I took the vehicle to NJMVC inspection station in Edison, NJ. I failed for emissions. To date, I have spent $3200. I have replaced the oxygen sensors, the active tank, the catalytic converter and now the dealer is saying that I need to replace the passive tank. This vehicle seems to have a fault. I wrote to the Federal Trade Commission and even spoke with Rebecca Franks from BMW, NJ and the issue is still unresolved.Helpful?YesNoJ of Sanford, FL on Jan. 15, 2017Satisfaction RatingI have purchased 3 consecutive BMW's. I love the brand. I've had my most recent vehicle for 3 months, a 535i, and it's a great car. I noticed that one of my door handle trim pieces was missing and the other was loose. I looked for damage and there wasn't any. I went to the dealer and they were very helpful and accommodating. They took pictures, took notice of there not being any damage, and they said they would contact BMW on my behalf. A few days later the dealer called me to let me know that BMW would not offer assistance. The resolution they suggested is that I purchase new door handles plus the cost of programming comfort access because the trim pieces are not sold separately. ($500+ Per Handle.)After, I have spoken to BMW independent of the dealer and they are asking for more pictures. I don't understand this since they already have them. I conclude that the trim pieces have fallen off due to a problem with the adhesive not performing to specs (The trim piece itself is made of plastic with tape strip on the inner side). I am very disappointed that as a loyal customer, I would be dismissed in this fashion. I just spent over $60k for this vehicle.Helpful?YesNoOmar of Phoenix, AZ on Jan. 11, 2017Satisfaction RatingAs a midlife crisis buy, I sold my very dependable 05 Honda Pilot and opted for a 1 owner, exceptionally clean, 3rd row X5 with 96K. I got it for a good price at the auction, but it was an as is sale. Immediately after purchase, I noticed an intermittent clunk and bounce in the transmission/motor area about 1 second after startup. I took it to the dealer, and they told me the fix was a software issue for which I paid $340 for. Well, that didn't work. The repair rep told me there was no other fix, that it would be a waste of money looking for the problem, and to live with it till it broke completely. That was comforting.Then the other day, the radiator reservoir blew up which cost me another $290, because it happened in the middle of nowhere and the only repair shop knows that. I knew the windshield washer pump wasn't working, now the fluid is leaking out and the the washer fluid low light is permanently on. To fit it, you have to take the right tire and wheel well liner off. Another $200 fix. There is a loud clicking noise from the motor which seems to come from a design flaw in the head which doesn't allow oil to get to the lifters fast enough. I've only had this POS for 3 weeks. I can't wait to see what failing item sucks my wallet dry next. I've never had roadside assistance insurance with any of my cars, and never needed it, but with BMW, it's a must. Definitely won't be buying a money sucking BMW again.Helpful?YesNoJered of Oregon City, OR on Jan. 7, 2017Satisfaction RatingHave owned Chevys, Fords, Hondas, Lexus, Jeeps, but none of them compared to the Junk of a BMW. I thought Ford was the worst vehicle I have owned...until I decided to purchase "The ultimate driving machine" against the advice of my 5 uncles who are mechanics. Thought "Why not see what these "High class cars?"" I am now a believer that these cars are sold to wealthy people mostly who know nothing about cars other than the reputation they have amongst the wealthy. With under 100k I had a leaky valve cover gasket, which caused my ignition coils to go out and have to be replaced. After that repair the fuel pump needed replaced then following that the injectors needed replaced. Luckily for me, I bought the extended warranty and those repairs were covered. After it broke 100k miles I pulled out of my driveway and noticed a bunch of steam coming from under the hood. After further examination I found that BMW used a cheap assistance black piece of plastic literally comparable to the material a plastic straw from McDonalds is made out of. Well that cheap piece had crumbled. After repairing that problem, the check engine light came on again, from leaky valve cover again, fouling the ignition coils, again. Immediately following that repair... It has snowed and I was sitting in my car with the heater on, when a big plume of smoke came out from under the dash. I immediately shut the car off and located the problem. Hindsight I should have just let the car catch fire and burn to the ground. Turns out that there has been a slow drip coming from the cabin air filter, which dripped down behind the dash onto the heater fan, which made its way slowly down to the heater fan regulator and eventually made its way inside the regulator, which with a well engineered vehicle, should have just blown the fuse. Instead of the fuse blowing, the regulator grounded out melted the connector inside the regulator and melted the wires down to copper wire about 3 inches down the wire harness. When the repairs were finished, hooked the battery back up and started the car, went to look under the hood to check everything going out just to notice a ton of oil that was spewing out of my oil filter housing between the engine and housing. Oh yeah and heater doesn't work still. Next is the heater fan which had no sign of a short but is now fried too. For how great these cars are suppose to be, I would take it from someone who has a familiarity with working on vehicles. Buy Honda, Toyota, Acura, or Lexus. DO NOT BUY A BMW!! Unless you want to ride in a stylish unreliable Piece of Junk. It is fun to drive when it works. However being stranded on the side of the road, especially in a subfreezing climate sucks. I have had as many problems with this car than I have had with an old 1996 Honda Accord with 300k plus miles on it. There's now only 112k on the BMW and I am driving the old Honda again. Even my 91 Honda crx with 160k miles has had fewer problems than this car. My BMW HAS even had more problems than my old 92 Ford 250 with 212k on it.If you have the money for a BMW, save yourself the headache and get a Lexus or Acura. I will never recommend a BMW to anyone. In fact I have kept 4 people at work from making the same mistake as me. When I get it fixed to drive again, I am getting rid of it. I will never own another nor do I recommend buying one, unless you like to spend thousands and thousands and thousands on repairs or you like to work on cars. The amount of money repairs and maintenance cost, a person could buy 2 cars instead of 1 BMW.Helpful?YesNoscott of Cincinnati, OH on Jan. 6, 2017Satisfaction RatingI have had a new rear differential installed on my x3 for $3600. After 4 months and 4000 miles it started to make noises. I checked and it was only halfway filled with fluid. The fluid I removed was black and full of metal shavings. When I took it to the dealer he says he did not see any problem with the unit. So he would not replace it. I was told until it totally failed it's mine to own. If it falls while under warranty he will replace. But if it falls a day later it all my issue. You can easily see it's wearing too soon but they will not admit it. Where do I go now??? The oil from the old unit that did fail was nothing like this. It brownish and see  through, no metal. But I cannot get them to admit this is not correct for such a new unit. They want to wait out the warranty and try to not replace it.Helpful?YesNoMarla of Lubbock, TX on Jan. 4, 2017Satisfaction RatingI have owned the car 2.5 years and have 9 flats high could not be repaired due to the issues of the side walls near the rim punctured. When took in they stated could not replicate the issue. The tire purchases show up on carfax. I have left town 4 different times in a car that I pay 650 a month for and have had a flat just driving down the highway each time. They could not replicate the problem so basically said not their problemHelpful?YesNoMike of Plainfield, IL on Dec. 29, 2016Satisfaction RatingMy wife and I have 2 vehicles. A 2008 Mitsubishi Outlander with 130k miles and a 2007 Ford Edge with 128k miles. We decided to buy a certified pre-owned 2010 BMW X5 with 64k miles on it in March of 2016. Over the last 9 months, we have only put 6k miles on this vehicle and it has been serviced numerous times. We bought an Elite Plus, 2 year warranty. When we do drive this car, we baby it. This past week, we backed it out of the garage and instantly heard the engine fan going at max speed. About a mile later, warning messages came on to drive the car moderately and then to pull over and turn it off. Said the engine temperature was too high. We had it towed into BMW and after reading BMW forums, the exact same problem had happened to many X5 owners. The fix was nearly all the same: Failed electric water pump requiring replacement along with thermostat.Most people had their vehicles fixed for $1400 or less. Local BMW dealer said we not only need to replace the water pump and thermostat, but also coolant hoses, need a coolant flush and the reservoir replaced. $3500 in cost. My "warranty" is only good for $800 contribution to this problem. I was amazed at the vast number of BMW owners reporting on this problem at 60-70k miles for the exact same issue. One would think there would be a recall on this, but no. I bought a BMW for the "Ultimate Driving Machine" experience and had heard of its reputation as a reliable vehicle. 2016 has been a disaster for this vehicle and I am not only disenchanted with the need to replace the water pump and thermostat, but I also feel like the BMW dealer is trying to bilk me by replacing coolant hoses and the reservoir when I don't even have a leak problem.Helpful?YesNoJohn of Brooklyn, NY on Dec. 23, 2016Satisfaction RatingTime, stress and money wasted. I bought my BMW X3 2008 in 2010. It was a pre-certified model. I got the extended warranty for 2 extra yrs. which gave me 4 years of coverage Expiration: 4/11/2014. I had the car serviced near my office JMK BMW in Springfield NJ. After 7 months after my warranty was over I've had gasket replaced and coils replaced. I called BMW HQ and was perplexed how I went to the dealer for all my services and all of sudden these major problems were occurring. HQ helped. I had to fork out 2k however. I'm a safe driver. Only accident I've ever had in all my years of driving was backing up to a van in a parking lot and it wasn't with this car it was with my Subaru in 2008. I never abused any cars I had. I've been always good about changing my oil and bringing my car for service. After these problems were fixed, my past year and a half has been utter nightmare. I have 100k miles. Washer pump and water pump replaced. Coils replaced. Transfer case actuator replaced. Power steering replaced. Thermostat needs to be replaced and transfer case needs to be replaced now. Battery obviously replaced but now my starter had to be replaced.I thought BMW made high quality cars and that's why I bought it hoping to have it for at least 10years. I barely reached 100k. To me this is unacceptable. I've already put 8k into the vehicle and I'm utterly exhausted beyond belief from renting cars to get to work and waiting for my mechanics to finish the job and not knowing what will happen next. I called BMW HQ again to let them know my frustration and amount of money I had spent on this awful SUV. They were going to give me an incentive of $1000 to BMW Springfield NJ to fix my car or buy another. BMW Springfield serviceman not the manager pretty much said it's not a good car and I should get rid of it. I was glad he was honest. But at same time I felt robbed - all that money and time and exhausting amount of stress. Car not starting, 4x4 not working in snow, on and on. I booked the appointment at BMW Springfield but manager to figure out what to do but was a no show. Never followed up. I called their GM and no call. I recall when the suv was under warranty I went to the dealer and told them about Idling issues which was never fixed. My thought was it was ok since it went through their service. At the end I wonder if they did anything when it was under the warranty to maintain my vehicle? A BMW specialist L&M foreign Cars in Utica Brooklyn tells me they never applied the fluid in the transfer case. How was I suppose to know this? This part costs 3k and labor 800 to replace now. I felt robbed of my extended Warranty which cost 2K. What was the point of getting it? I will never buy another BMW and will never recommend this junk. The philosophy's all wrong. It is the ultimate money pit. 8k later and more. Now to trade it in, it's worthless with all the problems it has. It should be worth at least 8k. A dealer offered for me at 3K. What a huge loss in every way. I just feel robbed.Helpful?YesNoMahmut of Davie, FL on Dec. 20, 2016Satisfaction RatingToday I went 25K regular service for my 2016 X+ BMW car. And I waited almost more than 2 hours and service just finished. Service manager told to me My X4 and many X4 has some problem about on back seat babe sitting fixing problem. This is fabrication error for all X4 BMW models. And they told to me this between 2-5 days service and they offer me complementary car replace with my car and fix my car. I accepted and I waited more than 1 hours. After that they took my car and they offer me TOYOTA COROLLA for one week driving for free. But I bought less than 1 year ago paid 59 K and bought BMW X4 and service try to give me Corolla. Ridiculous and I didn't accepted and go back to my house and I waste my time for with stupid paper works.I won't refer to anyone and BMW driver do not choose this Service... And service guy extremely rude too. His name is Joseph **. Don't waste your time and try another BMW service and dealer. Before I used 2 different BMW service dealer and both gave to me wonderful service. I am stupid to try Lauderdale BMW of Pembroke Pines but again hell NOOO.Helpful?YesNoJamal of Dearborn Heights, MI on Dec. 14, 2016Satisfaction RatingI purchased this vehicle brand new. During the warranty period, there were issues that were resolved. However, at only 67k miles the car is no longer under warranty and starting to fall apart. My problems have been a bad blower motor, steering angle sensor and water pump. It's unfortunate that BMW strives on quality when their vehicles cannot reach 100k. From my experience, BMW is overrated and their customer service is even worse.Helpful?YesNoDeb of Chico, California on Dec. 9, 2016Satisfaction RatingReliable, fast, safe and well built. I had an old BMW that just kept on running even when it needed repairs. It kept going and got me to where I needed to be. This 20 year old car looked no more older than most 10 year old cars and with over 250,000 miles on it. Ran and started up better than many newer vehicles of lesser years and miles; that is until admittedly my dog and I caused interior damage that aged the vehicle's appearance. That 1996 BMW 740il was still running and reliably starting every day right up until when I sold it to someone who was willing to fix it up a bit and run it some more. I have spoken to many people that state, BMW's are known to last beyond the 300,000 miles that few other cars make it to.Helpful?YesNoM. of Lake Tahoe, NV on Dec. 8, 2016Satisfaction RatingThe car worked pretty well overall, but occasionally there were issues with the iDrive. The iDrive just shut down a few times. Also the UI of the iDrive is annoying - using the radio is a hassle. I had the car for 5 years and never really learned how to use the radio. I liked the All-wheel drive feature though. Overall I was satisfied and would consider getting another 5-series. I'm 6'7 and the car fit me well enough. I never had to spend any money on repairs. There were some issues such as Bluetooth not working great that bothered me, but no dealbreakers.Helpful?YesNoBMW Company ProfileCompany Name:BMWWebsite:

        	Top
        	PricePrice is one of the most important factors when you’re planning to buy a new automobile. Make sure to set and stick to a realistic budget.Financing: Most car dealerships offer financing, and they often advertise very interest low rates, but not everyone will qualify for those rates. Compare the financing the dealership offers you to financing at a local bank or credit union to ensure you get the best deal. Leasing or purchasing are options to consider.
                                    Certified pre-owned: Consider buying a certified pre-owned model. These vehicles have passed thorough inspections and usually come with a warranty. They will save you money upfront, and you’ll also lose less on depreciation. However, a certified pre-owned vehicle means you do not get to build the vehicle to your exact specifications.
                                    Base models: Consider what features you truly need and decide whether the base model of your chosen vehicle meets your needs. By determining your needs first, you’ll avoid adding on unnecessary features and options. Based on your budget, then you can add the wants to your chosen vehicle.
                                    TechnologyAuto manufactures know the modern consumer is accustomed to a lot of technology, and different models feature a variety of tools that might make your drive time easier, safer, more connected or more pleasant.Onboard navigation: Built in navigation systems give you directions when you’re driving in an unfamiliar area. Some systems are more advanced than others, and adaptive systems can often reroute you to avoid traffic jams. Base models do not usually include this feature, so if you a map system on your smartphone or have a separate GPS system, you may not really need this built-in technology.
                                    Emergency assistance: Many companies offer programs that automatically contact the brand’s support center if your airbags deploy. The support center can then speak to you to determine whether you need medical or police assistance, call the appropriate authorities and give them your location. This feature could help emergency personnel reach you more quickly, but you will probably have to pay extra for the technology. Many companies do offer a free trial period.
                                    Connectedness: Wi-Fi and Bluetooth can connect your car to your smartphone. This technology allows you to make and receive calls through your car’s audio system, listen to music from your smartphone or stream music from an app. The level of connectedness offered on base models vary greatly, so determine whether this is a feature you really want to pay for before heading to the dealership. Having Bluetooth technology in your vehicle is a safer choice and may be required in many states to meet the “hands free” laws that do not allow a driver to have their phone at your ear.
                                    Safety: There are many additional safety features that will save you from a potential accident.  These safety features can be standard or an optional package. Safety features can not be added later and should be considered when choosing one vehicle versus another.
                                    PurposeThe way you use your vehicle should be an important factor when selecting a brand and model. Realistically consider the reasons you drive to figure out what kind of automobile you should buy.Commuting: If you primarily drive to and from work, you may be happy with a smaller car. A small lightweight vehicle will be less expensive up front and more fuel efficient in the long run. If you have a long commute, consider purchasing a compact car and using the money you save on extra features that will make your drive more enjoyable. If you carry equipment or business supplies then consider a larger vehicle.
                                    Carpooling: If you regularly take children to school or other events or if you carpool with others to and from work, consider a larger sedan, minivan, mid-sized crossover or SUV. These models may cost a little more, but making sure that all of your passengers and cargo have plenty of room will be worth it.
                                    Business/Work: If you use your vehicle for business or work, consider what you need it to do—a tradesman worker would likely benefit from purchasing a truck while a financial consultant might want an impressive luxury car. Consider how your automobile will help you do your job before you make a purchase.
                                    Fun: If you love driving or if you want driving to be enjoyable, consider a sports car, convertible or SUV with off-road capabilities. Test drive a few models to determine what offers the spirited drive you prefer.
                                    CostsA down payment and monthly payments on a vehicle are the most significant cost of owning a car. However, many other factors can determine how much money you’ll spend on your car each month.Fuel: More fuel-efficient vehicles will save you gas money every time you fill up the tank. Hybrids require even less gas, but they often come with a higher price tag up front. If you don’t drive that many miles, the investment in the hybrid might not pay off financially. Some cars require diesel or high-octane fuel, consider the cost in your final choice.
                                    Insurance: Different brands and models of cars will cost different amounts to insure. Your driving record and credit rating are also considered in your insurance rates. Talk to your insurance company about the models you are considering so you’re not surprised by your new premium.
                                    Maintenance and repairs: Factor in the cost of regular maintenance when budgeting. Proper maintenance is required on all vehicles; being proactive and completing the maintenance required by following the service schedule in your owner’s manual will vary, each vehicle will have different cost for repairs and maintenance.
                                    Passenger capacityA vehicle’s size may be classified by its weight, length, wheelbase, cargo capacity, towing capability or interior cubic space. When shopping for a new automobile, you will probably be most interested in how much room there is in the interior space.Mini compact: This type of car is very small and good in urban areas. These are very small cars. This type is the most fuel-efficient vehicle.
                                    Sub compact: A small car that is great for commuting. These have limited rear seat room and trunk space.
                                    Compact: If you will use your car primarily to commute and/or if only one or two passengers will be riding in the car with you, a compact car might be a good choice. These cars will have less room but will also be more fuel efficient.
                                    Mid-size: Mid-size vehicles may include sedans, midsize crossovers or midsize SUVs. These automobiles will comfortably accommodate four or five adult occupants.
                                    Large: If you need a vehicle that can safely and comfortably hold more than five people, consider a minivan or full-size SUV. If you’re not sure if you need a mid-size or large vehicle, take one of each for a test drive.
                                    SafetyNew cars come standard with passive safety features like airbags, anti-lock brakes and tension-adjusting seatbelts. Active safety features, which protect you by preventing accidents, are now available on many vehicles, usually at an additional cost.Backup camera: Backup cameras will show you what is behind your car whenever it is in reverse. This feature ensures that you see small children, animals, other vehicles and short items and do not back over them. They might also have an audible alarm that triggers when an object is behind you to warn you to stop backing up.
                                    Blind spot monitoring: Cameras or lasers mounted on your car will detect objects in your blind spot and alert you to them. These systems help prevent accidents on busy multi-lane roads and highways.
                                    Brake assist: Brake assist detects when a driver initiates a panic stop (as opposed to ordinary gradual stops) and applies the brakes to maximum force. In conjunction with anti-lock brakes, the system enables threshold braking without locking up the wheels.
                                    Forward-collision warning (FCW): Forward-collision warning uses cameras, radar or laser (or some combination) to scan for cars ahead and alert the driver if they are approaching a vehicle in their lane too fast and a crash is imminent. Most systems alert the driver with some sort of visual and or audible signal to a potential crash, allowing time for you to react.
                                    Adaptive cruise control: Adaptive cruise uses lasers, radar, cameras, or a combination of these systems to keep a constant distance between you and the car ahead, automatically maintaining a safe following distance. If highway traffic slows, some systems will bring the car to a complete stop and automatically come back to speed when traffic gets going again, allowing the driver to do little more than pay attention and steer. Some vehicles equipped with lane keeping assist will also allow the car to stay within the lane markings.
                                    Lane-departure warning (LDW): This alerts you if you steer your car out of its lane without the turn signals activated. Using a camera or lasers to monitor lane markers, the LDW may sound a chime, blink a dashboard telltale, and/or vibrate the steering wheel or seat.
                                    Lane-keeping assist (LKA): In addition to sensing when you leave your lane, this technology will introduce a mild steering input to put you back into your lane.
                                    Active head restraints: Active head restraints move up and forward in a rear crash to cradle the head and absorb energy in an effort to mitigate whiplash injury.
                                    Parking assist systems: These are sensors embedded in the front, rear or both bumpers that alert you—at parking speeds—that light poles, walls, shrubbery and other obstacles are getting close.
                                    Automatic high beams: This function automatically switches from low to high beam and back again, for improved nighttime visibility as conditions warrant.
                                    Automatic emergency braking (AEB): This feature is usually a part of a forward-collision system (FCS), which uses lasers or cameras to detect objects in front of your vehicle. While all FCSs will alert the driver to the object, systems with AEB will automatically break if the driver does not respond and can significantly reduce front-end collisions caused by distracted driving.
                                    What are different types of vehicles?

A few of the larger wagons even offer a third-row seat.HatchbackAvailable in two- and four-door body styles, hatchbacks have the same footprint as a comparably sized sedan, but instead of a conventional trunk, they offer a spacious cargo area accessed by a liftgate.ConvertiblesConvertibles have a removable top. Tops may be cloth, vinyl, fiberglass, metal or a combination of these materials.

All modern diesel engines are turbocharged for increased power and very high fuel efficiency.HybridsHybrids are vehicles powered by a battery and a standard engine. These may be more expensive upfront, but offer significantly better fuel efficiency and reduce your dependence on fossil fuels. Some are plug-in hybrids while others regenerate energy to charge the battery.ElectricElectric vehicles have a battery that is charged with electricity, and the range between necessary charges varies with model and age. Range can be impacted by very cold and very warm temperatures.Who's it for?

        	Parents of teensParents buying cars for their teenage children will want to look for cars with excellent safety ratings and may be interested in adding on active safety features that are not included in the base model.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
