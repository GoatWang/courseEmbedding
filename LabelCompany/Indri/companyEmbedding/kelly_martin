From Hollywood Actress to Toy Store CEO

Five years ago, Kellie Martin, the actress famous for playing Becca Thacher on the early ‘90s TV series “Life Goes On” and later for her roles on “ER” and “Grey’s Anatomy,” was doing a photo shoot for PEOPLE Magazine about being a new mom to daughter Maggie. “At the time I was searching for safe toys to surround Maggie with,” she says. “We weren’t doing any plastic or battery toys, but I was having trouble finding stuff.”
She started chatting with the photographer about her plight, when, in between camera clicks, the woman mentioned this cool wooden camera she had recently purchased for her own daughter from a store called Romp, which sells old-fashioned, creative toys. A budding photographer herself, Martin loved the idea of a beautiful play camera for her daughter. “I fell in love with it because it forces kids to use their imagination,” says Martin, who bought the same camera shortly after the shoot. “Maggie played with it when she was eight months old and she still picks it up all the time now. It’s what a toy should be—something that she keeps coming back to.”
It didn’t take long for Martin to become a regular at Romp’s online store. The brick-and-mortar operation in Brooklyn closed in 2008 when its owner, Jenn LaBelle, moved upstate, but the store remained a popular online destination. This past June, however, LaBelle sent all her customers an email saying she was closing the store to focus on running her other business, Twine, an online gift store. Martin’s first thought: “I can’t let it close!” She called her husband, distraught. “I said right away I think we should buy it,” says Martin. “I didn’t even know if she wanted to sell, but I said to my husband ‘You’ve got to call her!’”
(MORE: High Country Kombucha Shows How Small Businesses Can Capitalize on a Crisis)
Kellie’s husband, Keith Christian, is the entrepreneur in the family. (The two met as college students at Yale University.) A lawyer turned cattle rancher—he owns a ranch in Colorado, which he runs from Los Angeles—Christian called up LaBelle shortly after Martin received the email and talked to her for an hour and a half about the store. The two hit it off. Two months later, he and his wife became the proud new owners of Romp. “This is definitely Kellie’s business,” says her husband. “I am just the support staff.”
Taking over as the owner of an online children’s toy store isn’t exactly easy, especially when your other job takes you away on location. The mom to five-year-old Maggie continues to act fulltime: She’s a recurring guest star on Lifetime’s hit show Army Wives and has a Hallmark Channel movie, “Always a Bride,” coming out in July. But Martin has learned how to run the business via email and cell phone when she’s away and her husband chips in too, manning the books.
While the move to become a retail owner was impulsive, it was also savvy. Martin took over a company that already had a loyal customer base and had a departing owner who was willing to guide her through the transition. “We skipped the pure startup phase by purchasing a company that was operating profitably and had strong brand identification,” says Christian. “We are way ahead of where we would have been if we had just started a business in August.” And the store has remained profitable under their watch. “Being my own boss isn’t something I thought I could do,” says Martin. “If Keith and Jenn [LaBelle] hadn’t been encouraging me, I don’t think I could have done it.”
Martin’s enthusiasm for the products and her thrill at sharing her finds with customers is what won over LaBelle in the first place. “In the beginning when I heard a Hollywood actress wanted to do this, I thought it would be a vanity project, she would put her name on it and hire people to do it,” says LaBelle. “But as soon as I met her it was clear she wanted to be very hands on, down to packing the boxes. I was really impressed.”

"Typical Hallmark movie (which is a good thing) with Kellie Martin" - By 
Desert Tortoise 


Typical Hallmark movie (which is a good thing) with Kellie Martin, who always brightens any movie she makes.  There is nothing particularly original about the plot, but it makes for an enjoyable afternoon of relaxation.

"Entertaining for the whole family!" - By 
Dad of Divas  (Michigan)


This is a touching story about a widow, Kathy, who is trying to decide her future. She had owned a bicycle shop with her husband who passed away, but she really wants to become a baker and has the talent. It is through friends old and new that she finds her heart to move forward in loving someone new and in taking a path on a career she loves.It is a sweet story which has a predictable ending, but it is entertaining and the actors do a fine job in their roles.*I received this for review - all opinions are my own*

""Why can't you be like other girls your age and just be obsessed with werewolves and vampires?"" - By 
H. Bala  (Recently moved back to Carson, California, or as I call it... the center of the universe)


More or less, it starts like this: One evening, in San Francisco, when Percival (Simon Kassianides), the spoiled Marques of Summerland, flashes his wad of cash in a bar and then wanders off to Golden Gate Park in a drunken stupor, he's just asking to get rolled. And he gets rolled. He absorbs a, um, royal beating.The next morning 11-year-old Zoe Cole (Kiernan Shipka) ditches school. She arrives at the very same park to set free the frog she'd rescued from a science class dissection. It's like this: Zoe frequently inhabits an inner world in which she indulges her fascination with the fairy tale of The Frog Prince. By the pond in the park, she gives the frog a farewell good luck kiss. Moments later she glimpses an addled man folded into a boat. She eyeballs the royal sash on him and the webbed toes and comes to ... full review

"A must see!" - By 
Alicia Miller 


great movie or docu., for my expectant daughter to see as a first time mother. I liked it because of the different interviews and experiences in comparison to medical birth vs. home-birth experi., I saw Business Of Being Born long before my second child was born and 22 years after my first at age 17 and let me say I sincerely wished I had this knowledge then back in 1992! My water broke a home the first time then had a 15.5 hour vag., labor and drugged out recovery which was NOT necessary. The second the same with my water breaking at home and birth was natural, drug free, in hospital stay was 24 hrs with the exception that I made it there at 8am and my son came out at 8:49 am! I had a home-birth plan but I was 3 days shy of 37 weeks so by Texas ... full review

"Not quite Murder, She Wrote but charming nevertheless" - By 
Z Hayes  (TX, USA)


I am a great fan of the amazing sleuth Jessica Fletcher in the iconic TV series [[ASIN:B00005JN8S Murder, She Wrote - The Complete First Season]] which ran for twelve seasons (and was followed by four TV movies). Since the show ended, I've been watching reruns and also checking out the DVDs from my local public library. I stumbled across the Mystery Woman series one day on the Hallmark Channel and promptly tivo-ed them all, a good thing since not all of the episodes are available on DVD.The Mystery Woman investigative drama is kind of like a grown-up version of Nancy Drew. It stars Kellie Martin (who first impressed me in her portrayal of devoted schoolteacher Christy in the TV series, [[ASIN:B000LC4ZBC Christy - The Complete Series]]). Here she plays photographer Samantha Kinsey who inherits an old mystery bookstore from her deceased uncle. She renames it Mystery Woman Bookstore, ... full review

I am so glad to be able to add these 4 special Christmas movies to my Hallmark Christmas collection so I can enjoy them thruout the year.  These are among my favorites and my list just keeps getting longer with each new season of Countdown to Christmas!!

"An Excellent 90's Film and One of Dante's Best" - By 
Richard Harborough  (Coastal)


All or most of director Joe Dante's films can be considered fun popcorn movies, something that is for both the kids and the adults, for genre fans and for fans of film in general. Dante gained recognition with the huge hit Gremlins, which Steven Spielberg produced.But in 1993, Dante decided to make a rather personal film, a pseudo-biography of filmmaker and 'shock-expert,' William Castle, renamed in the film 'Matinee' as Lawrence Woolsey (played with the perfect amount of schlock by John Goodman).The story concerns Woolsey coming to Key West Florida during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 promoting his new film, MANT. While Woolsey is busy promoting his cheapie, a young boy and his little brother have to deal with the fact that their world might end, and that their father, a Navy man, is out on a boat in the Gulf of Mexico on the ... full review
