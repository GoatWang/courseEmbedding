We've served more than 1.4 million people all across America in need of relief from IRS back taxes. Below are comments from taxpayers who have been successful at putting stress and worry over IRS back taxes behind them.





...from the first phone call I felt so relieved. Their confidence of relieving from this IRS burden rubbed off on me. I was still scared and spent many sleepness nights worrying but contacting them was the best thing I could have done. I feel like a 100 pounds is off my shoulders so I want to thank Tax Defense. They even told me that I can always call them years from now if I have any questions or need advise and that is another reason why I would advise people to put their trust in them as I did... — Sherri
When you receive a letter in the mail that has IRS on it - you tend to lose a lot of sleep and sometimes don't even open the envelope! I've had that experience and after making contact with TDN, I have to tell you, I slept better. They certainly know how to work through the issues and tame the 900 pound gorilla! — Steve B.
I have to tell you that I was so nervous going through this process however [my tax specialist] walked me though the steps and explained everything in detail. She was able to have a tax levy on my wages released the same day we talked. Trust them they are the real thing. I can't thank you enough [my tax specialist]. — Joel P.








How It Works


Individuals or businesses in need of IRS relief from back taxes call or submit a request online to receive a free consultation from tax resolution experts.

Tax relief specialists take the time to listen, understand your current situation and goals (including any immediate relief you may need to stop or prevent a wage garnishment, tax lien, or bank levy.)

Based on your unique circumstances, tax resolution experts apply existing tax relief code to provide your best options to get immediate relief and reach the lowest possible settlement with the IRS.

You may choose to resolve IRS back taxes on your own, or utilize the expertise of tax specialists who will negotiate the best possible IRS resolution or settlement on your behalf. There are no upfront retainer fees and any fees that apply must be pre-approved by taxpayers in advance, based on the scope of services provided.

View Common Questions About Tax Relief


Q: Why would the IRS agree to settle back taxes for less?
A: There are a variety of reasons why the IRS agrees to work with taxpayers and settle for less. Often individuals or families are experiencing financial hardship, whether through loss of a job or income, illness, extenuating business or marital circumstances, or a number of other reasons. In addition, there may be "doubt as to collectability", "doubt as to liability", "innocent spouse" or a variety of other tax relief options or tax appeal provisions under the current tax code. In addition, the IRS may lower your tax liability because they feel you simply don't have the financial ability to pay the full amount owed within the statutory time period.
Q: How Can the IRS Fresh Start Initiative Provide Relief for Taxpayers?
A. The IRS Fresh Start program is an effort on the part of the IRS to make it easier for financially distressed taxpayers to resolve back taxes as quickly as possible.  Through a free tax relief consultation, taxpayers can find out if the leniency offered via Fresh Start can provide relief for IRS penalties, IRS liens, and also offer more streamlined processes for Installment Agreement and Offers in Compromise.
Q: What should you do if you've received a collection letter/notice from IRS?
A: Do not ignore IRS letters or enforcement notices. They may be auto-generated but, if ignored, they will lead to a wage garnishment, tax lien, bank account levy or other asset seizure or enforcement action. Stay in contact with the IRS and consider the advantages of a free tax relief consultation - speaking to tax relief specialists who can apprise you fully of your tax relief rights and options under the law and, at your request, negotiate directly with the IRS, to bring your case to a favorable resolution.
Q. How does a free tax relief consultation work?
A. As an individual or business, when you contact the IRS directly, you will likely be communicating with a frontline IRS collector whose task it is to collect on the total amount of tax liability assessed. Through a free tax relief consultation, you will have the opportunity to get a free and fair assessment from a tax relief specialist who can review with you all the circumstances surrounding the amount you owe the IRS, or the IRS claims you owe.  In addition, the tax resolution specialist can also take the time to listen to you, understand what you are going through, and review the options available to reach the best possible settlement with the IRS.
Q. What are some of the most common reasons why taxpayers may qualify for relief?
Many people owe the IRS back taxes for a variety of reasons, in many cases due to unforeseen circumstances beyond their control - including personal or financial hardship, business hardship, medical issues and more. In addition, taxpayers may not have been able to file back taxes for one or more years, or feel they have been unfairly assessed.  There also may be taxpayers who fall into the "currently not collectable" status because they simply cannot afford to pay the tax assessed. In many cases, taxpayers may qualify for relief via the IRS Fresh Start initiative.
Q: If I've fallen behind on my taxes and have the ability to pay the original amount but cannot afford to pay all the penalties and interest added on, can I pay the original amount?
A: Yes, you may qualify for a "Penalty Abatement" to remove penalties and interest. The IRS may waive penalties and interest for a variety of reasons including medical reasons, poor accounting advice, ignorance of the tax laws that apply, ex-spouse circumstances, the need to care and provide for a loved one, and more.
Q: Who can most benefit from tax relief assistance?
A: Typically, individuals and businesses who owe the IRS back taxes ranging from $10,000 to $250,000 or more can realize the greatest benefit from tax relief services.  Tax relief specialists and attorneys have a depth of knowledge and expertise and understand how to apply current tax relief code to reach the best possible tax resolution on behalf of taxpayers - including those who have not filed returns for one or multiple years for a variety of reasons. In addition, tax relief can help individuals or businesses in need of immediate relief to stop or prevent a wage garnishment, tax lien, or bank account levy.
Q: What are the benefits of a free tax relief consultation?
A: For individuals and businesses who owe back taxes to the IRS and have an urgent need to stop or prevent IRS enforcement action and settle IRS tax debt for substantially less than the full amount owed, a free tax relief consultation will provide an overview of the taxpayer's legal tax relief rights and options to resolve taxes and settle for less. All tax relief consultations come with no obligation and there is no charge to get an honest assessment of your current situation and the realistic IRS settlement options available to you.

We've served more than 1.4 million people all across America in need of relief from IRS back taxes. Below are comments from taxpayers who have been successful at putting stress and worry over IRS back taxes behind them.





...from the first phone call I felt so relieved. Their confidence of relieving from this IRS burden rubbed off on me. I was still scared and spent many sleepness nights worrying but contacting them was the best thing I could have done. I feel like a 100 pounds is off my shoulders so I want to thank Tax Defense. They even told me that I can always call them years from now if I have any questions or need advise and that is another reason why I would advise people to put their trust in them as I did... — Sherri
When you receive a letter in the mail that has IRS on it - you tend to lose a lot of sleep and sometimes don't even open the envelope! I've had that experience and after making contact with TDN, I have to tell you, I slept better. They certainly know how to work through the issues and tame the 900 pound gorilla! — Steve B.
I have to tell you that I was so nervous going through this process however [my tax specialist] walked me though the steps and explained everything in detail. She was able to have a tax levy on my wages released the same day we talked. Trust them they are the real thing. I can't thank you enough [my tax specialist]. — Joel P.

Based on your unique circumstances, tax resolution experts apply existing tax relief code to provide your best options to get immediate relief and reach the lowest possible settlement with the IRS.

You may choose to resolve IRS back taxes on your own, or utilize the expertise of tax specialists who will negotiate the best possible IRS resolution or settlement on your behalf.

View Common Questions About Tax Relief


Q: Why would the IRS agree to settle back taxes for less?
A: There are a variety of reasons why the IRS agrees to work with taxpayers and settle for less. Often individuals or families are experiencing financial hardship, whether through loss of a job or income, illness, extenuating business or marital circumstances, or a number of other reasons. In addition, there may be "doubt as to collectability", "doubt as to liability", "innocent spouse" or a variety of other tax relief options or tax appeal provisions under the current tax code. In addition, the IRS may lower your tax liability because they feel you simply don't have the financial ability to pay the full amount owed within the statutory time period.
Q: How Can the IRS Fresh Start Initiative Provide Relief for Taxpayers?
A. The IRS Fresh Start program is an effort on the part of the IRS to make it easier for financially distressed taxpayers to resolve back taxes as quickly as possible.  Through a free tax relief consultation, taxpayers can find out if the leniency offered via Fresh Start can provide relief for IRS penalties, IRS liens, and also offer more streamlined processes for Installment Agreement and Offers in Compromise.
Q: What should you do if you've received a collection letter/notice from IRS?
A: Do not ignore IRS letters or enforcement notices. They may be auto-generated but, if ignored, they will lead to a wage garnishment, tax lien, bank account levy or other asset seizure or enforcement action. Stay in contact with the IRS and consider the advantages of a free tax relief consultation - speaking to tax relief specialists who can apprise you fully of your tax relief rights and options under the law and, at your request, negotiate directly with the IRS, to bring your case to a favorable resolution.
Q. How does a free tax relief consultation work?
A. As an individual or business, when you contact the IRS directly, you will likely be communicating with a frontline IRS collector whose task it is to collect on the total amount of tax liability assessed. Through a free tax relief consultation, you will have the opportunity to get a free and fair assessment from a tax relief specialist who can review with you all the circumstances surrounding the amount you owe the IRS, or the IRS claims you owe.  In addition, the tax resolution specialist can also take the time to listen to you, understand what you are going through, and review the options available to reach the best possible settlement with the IRS.
Q. What are some of the most common reasons why taxpayers may qualify for relief?
Many people owe the IRS back taxes for a variety of reasons, in many cases due to unforeseen circumstances beyond their control - including personal or financial hardship, business hardship, medical issues and more. In addition, taxpayers may not have been able to file back taxes for one or more years, or feel they have been unfairly assessed.  There also may be taxpayers who fall into the "currently not collectable" status because they simply cannot afford to pay the tax assessed. In many cases, taxpayers may qualify for relief via the IRS Fresh Start initiative.
Q: If I've fallen behind on my taxes and have the ability to pay the original amount but cannot afford to pay all the penalties and interest added on, can I pay the original amount?
A: Yes, you may qualify for a "Penalty Abatement" to remove penalties and interest. The IRS may waive penalties and interest for a variety of reasons including medical reasons, poor accounting advice, ignorance of the tax laws that apply, ex-spouse circumstances, the need to care and provide for a loved one, and more.
Q: Who can most benefit from tax relief assistance?
A: Typically, individuals and businesses who owe the IRS back taxes ranging from $10,000 to $250,000 or more can realize the greatest benefit from tax relief services.  Tax relief specialists and attorneys have a depth of knowledge and expertise and understand how to apply current tax relief code to reach the best possible tax resolution on behalf of taxpayers - including those who have not filed returns for one or multiple years for a variety of reasons.
