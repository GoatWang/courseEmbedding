			Russell J. Knittel has served as a director of our company since April 2015. Mr. Knittel currently serves on the Board of Directors of Synaptics Incorporated. Mr. Knittel served as Interim President and Chief Executive Officer of Synaptics from October 2010 to September 2011; as Executive Vice President from July 2007 to October 2010; as Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Secretary, and Treasurer from November 2001 to October 2009; as Senior Vice President from November 2001 to July 2007; and as Vice President of Administration and Finance, Chief Financial Officer, and Secretary from April 2000 to November 2001.  Synaptics is a leading worldwide developer and supplier of custom-designed human interface solutions that enable people to interact more easily and intuitively with a wide variety of mobile computing, communications, entertainment and other devices and whose stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.  Mr. Knittel also served as a director of Source Photonics, a privately held, equity-backed provider of optical communication products from March 2012 to January 2017, as a director of MarineMax, Inc., a New York Stock Exchange-listed company that is the nation's largest recreational boat dealer, from June 2009 to February 2014, and as a director of OCZ Technology Group, Inc., formerly a public company, that designed, manufactured, and distributed solid-state drives and computer components, from June 2010 to August 2014. Mr. Knittel holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Accounting from California State University at Fullerton and a Master's degree in Business Administration from San Jose State University. We believe that Mr. Knittel's experience as an executive officer of a public company, as well as his board service at other companies provide the requisite qualifications, skills, perspectives, and experiences that make him well qualified to serve on our Board of Directors.

Francis Lee, Chairman of the Board, stated, "We thank Tom for his efforts on behalf of our company and wish him well in his future endeavors."  Mr. Lee added, "Russ has played a key role in the success of our company and is familiar with all aspects of our business.  We are fortunate to have a long-time, highly capable executive to assume the leadership role while we search for a successor to lead the company forward. Russ has informed us that he wishes to continue with his previously announced plan to retire from active management, which will take place following the selection of a successor, a process in which he will be actively involved.  The board is appreciative of Russ's agreement to assume the role on an interim basis and to join our Board of Directors."
Mr. Knittel commented, "My involvement with Synaptics for more than 10 years has given me a deep appreciation of its many strengths, including innovation, product offerings, customer service, and employee talent and creativity.  During this important transition period, the Board of Directors and I are committed to working with our employees to continue to enhance our business and take advantage of the expanding market opportunities."
Mr. Tiernan commented, "I have enjoyed helping lead this dynamic company over the past four years of record growth and expansion.  It has been a great pleasure to have worked with its outstanding employees, management team, and Board of Directors.  Synaptics is a wonderful company and is well positioned to capitalize on the many opportunities ahead of it."
