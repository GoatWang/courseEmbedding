Our People | Lakeview Capital Partners | For Our Investors

































 



  

















Our People


You will never be assigned to a random “service representative.” In an era where the large, traditional Wall Street firms are sending clients to “service centers” with 1-800 numbers, Lakeview advisors are here to advise you personally. And most importantly, they have chosen Lakeview Capital Partners for their long-term career path.
Lakeview strongly supports a partnership model. Our belief is that if the advisors are significant owners in the firm, then decision won’t be made to harm the firm, its clients, or the advisors serving them. We have created a culture that we think is truly enviable to others in our industry that allows our advisors to serve our clients with consistency and helps them to avoid many of the attrition issues that so deeply plague the financial services industry.

Lakeview Capital Partners LLC, a newly formed investment firm, says it will grow to manage $1 billion of assets by the end of this year.
The company was founded by former Morgan Keegan & Co. Senior Vice President Scott Wilder and counts former CEO of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Thomas Tracy and John Rhett, retired chairman of SunTrust Investment Services, on its advisory board.




 


“Lakeview started as a registered investment adviser but turned into what’s called a hybrid quickly,” Wilder said.
“Our investment advisers would be able to do fee-based, commission-based, structured products transactions ... you name it, which they’ve traditionally been able to only do when operating under a big investment firm,” he said.
“Many investment advisers are unhappy in the current model of operating under banks,” Tracy said. “The one-size-fits-all way of doing things doesn’t work anymore.”
“Lakeview is likely to attract top professionals in this part of the country,” he said. When asked about the firm’s potential to grow to $1 billion of assets under management, he said “absolutely.”
Lakeview grew from its smaller predecessor, Lakeview Capital Management, which was founded in 2009. The new firm has backers including Kyle Tomlin, founder of Atlanta-based hedge fund Riverside Advisors LLC and two other Riverside principals, Ana Kolar and Brian Simmons.





Lakeview claims to be the only fee- and commission-based investment adviser in the Atlanta area, unlike other registered investment advisers who are fee-based.
“With new technology, there’s definitely a place for a firm providing Lakeview’s services in the Southeast,” Tracy added.
Lakeview’s brand new office in Midtown Atlanta is at the Four Seasons building, formerly where bankrupt Arcapita Bank, a Middle Eastern investment firm with its North American headquarters located in Atlanta, was housed.
Lakeview firm will hire three advisers in the next 30 days, and each will bring a minimum of $100 million of AUM, Wilder said.
The firm recently set up an office of six, in Greenville, S.C., made up mostly of former BB&T wealth advisers. The firm in Greenville operates under the name Parallel Financial Partners LLC.

“Currently, the investment advisory business is fragmented. There’s a lot of growth opportunity for Lakeview,” Rhett said.
Wilder said investment advisers are “frustrated with the current model” as they “usually keep 40 percent of revenues at a traditional wire house.”
CHASE TO OPEN 4 BRANCHES.




 


Chase plans to open four branches in Georgia this year, adding more than 15,000 square feet and creating 40 jobs in the market, said Maribel Ferrer, a spokesperson for the company.
In 2014, the lender plans to open an additional 10 branches inside the Perimeter.
The company will also introduce its Chase Private Client offering to the Atlanta market, because its in-house research showed a need for additional services for affluent families and individuals. By the end of April, the offering will be available in 10 locations in Georgia, and in 16 by the end of the year.
Its first of four planned new branches opened in Georgia in North Decatur. The new location is the 79th branch in the market.
Other planned branches will be in Buckhead and North Druid Hills in Atlanta, and Dallas Highway and Lost Mountain in Powder Springs.
INVESCO BIG INVESTOR IN REIT
Atlanta-based Invesco Ltd. is now the sixth-largest institutional investor in a real estate investment trust based in Colorado, UDR Inc. (NYSE: UDR). According to an April 8 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the investment giant owned a 6.55 percent stake in the REIT, as of March 25.
UDR owned or had an ownership position in 54,195 apartment homes including 3,066 homes under development, as of Dec. 31, 2012, according to its website.
GEORGIA WOMEN EARN LESS
A woman in Georgia who works full-time is paid on average 81 cents for every dollar earned by a man, according to a report by the National Women’s Law Center.
That places Georgia at No. 13 in the nation for women’s pay. Women in Georgia average $35,438 a year, while men here average $43,904 annually.
The wage gap is even wider for African-American and Hispanic women in the Peach State, who earn 61 cents and 48 cents, respectively, to every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men.
Georgia ranks 35th for African-American women’s pay and ranks 40th for Hispanic women’s pay.

CONTINUE TO READ

In comparison to majority of big cities you will be surprised to know that the housing market in Pittsburgh is actually booming up and is refreshingly affordable. Today Pittsburgh ranks fifth among most affordable housing markets in Unites States, according to the National Association of Realtors, and is one of the top 20 “Hottest Housing Markets in the US” today, according to Realtor.com.Pittsburgh, also known as the Steel City, has more than 300 different steel related businesses. Likewise, it is known as the “City of Bridges” because it has a world record of 446 bridges (more than Venice). Pittsburgh offers excellent job opportunities in different industries, such as hi-tech, health care, and academics. These industries are growing at a steady pace in the city. Population growth in Pittsburgh is solid, and the people who live here are enjoying incomes that are slightly higher than the national average income.
The recession in Pittsburgh has been very mild comparing to other metro cities in the US.

UAS Labs Acquired

Lakeview Equity Partners LLC has acquired UAS Laboratories Inc., a pioneer in the research, development and manufacture of probiotic nutritional supplements. Dr. S.K. Dash founded UAS Labs in 1979 to manufacture and market probiotics in the U.S., Canada and more than 60 other countries worldwide. He will remain with the company as chairman, founder and director of new business development.
Two probiotic pros are also stepping to the plate as partners in the transaction. Kevin Mehring will serve as the new president of UAS Labs, and Dr. Greg Leyer as chief scientific officer. Both are industry veterans with deep roots in the probiotic arena. And while the company will launch new products, its mission and passion will remain in the realm of probiotics.
With plans to expand science around digestive and immune health, Mehring says that most products are based on the well-documented DDS1 strain of L. acidophilus, adding that strain-specific formulations targeted at particular health conditions are the future of probiotics.
The company will also continue to focus on research and development—a cornerstone at UAS since the beginning.
 In December 2014, Lakeview Equity Partners provided funding for UAS Laboratories to acquire certain intellectual property assets of Micropharma Limited, Montreal, Canada, whose researchers have developed an award-winning probiotic strain, LRC™. The LRC™ strain has been shown to support healthy cholesterol levels and maintain heart health. As part of the agreement, UAS Labs also took ownership of the pioneering Cardioviva™brand of probiotics; which can be found at major retailers in the US and Canada. The companies have enjoyed a close relationship as partners and industry leaders in the probiotic space and were both winners of the 2014 NEXT Innovation Summit’s NutraAward presented at Natural Products Expo West.
Also in late 2014, Lakeview Equity Partners provided funding for UAS Laboratories to complete a $4 million state-of-the-art upgrade to their probiotic focused manufacturing facility in central Wisconsin. This upgrade positions UAS to continue to grow as an industry leader in probiotics.

The company’s senior management team continues to manage day-to-day operations while working with Lakeview Equity on future growth strategies.

We’re committed to driving service excellence in the event planning industry,” said Joseph Cesarz, vice president of Lakeview. “Both companies are innovative market leaders and will continue to define industry standards.”
In December 2009, Travel Technology Group, LLC and Ambassadors, both industry-known for their event housing expertise and tenure in the meetings and conventions world, unveiled the new brand identity for their merged organization. "onPeak represents the best of unparalleled customer service and next-generation technology between both companies since our merger in April 2009." said Michael Howe, President & CFO for onPeak. "This new identity represents what we're all about: elevating the expectations of event housing providers through end-to-end solutions and next-generation technology that deliver top performance for clients."
On October 7, 2014,  Lakeview Equity Partners successfully divested its majority interest in onPeak LLC to Global Experience Specialists (GES), a full service provider of live events and a wholly owned subsidiary of Viad Corp (NYSE:VVI), a publicly traded company based in Phoenix, AZ.
