First chartered in 1948, FirstBank was the first Savings & Loan institution 
	established in Puerto Rico with a capital of $200,000. 
Since its inception the bank played a fundamental role in improving the quality 
	of life in Puerto Rico, by helping thousands of citizens to acquire their first 
	home, thus enhancing their social and economic status.
It converted to a commercial bank charter and changed its name to First Federal 
	Savings Bank in 1983. In 1987, First Federal became a stockholder-owned savings 
	bank and went public, trading on Nasdaq. A few years later, in 1993, it was 
	listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol FBP and, in 1994, the 
	name changes to FirstBank Puerto Rico. In 1998, the Bank reorganized into a 
	holding company under the name of First BanCorp.
Thanks to the visionary leadership of its management team, the institution 
	experienced an impressive growth and transformation, becoming one of Puerto 
	Rico's leading financial institutions with approximately 2,500 employees. It 
	offers a full range of financial services to individual, commercial, and corporate 
	customers through its more than a hundred and seventy financial facilities in 
	Puerto Rico, the US mainland, and the US and British Virgin Islands.
First BanCorp. is the parent corporation of FirstBank Puerto Rico, a state-chartered 
	commercial bank with operations in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Florida, 
	and of FirstBank Insurance Agency. FirstBank Puerto Rico, in turn, has the following 
	wholly-owned subsidiaries: FirstBank Puerto Rico Securities, a broker-dealer 
	subsidiary; First Insurance Agency, Inc, an insurance agency in USVI; First 
	Management of Puerto Rico, a domestic corporation that holds tax-exempts assets; 
	First Federal Finance Corp. (d/b/a Money Express La Financiera), a small loan 
	company; and FirstBank Overseas Corp., an international banking entity organized 
	under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
In 2002, and after acquiring Chase Manhattan Bank, FirstBank became the largest 
	bank in the Virgin Islands (USVI & BVI), serving St. Thomas, St. Croix, St. 
	John, Tortola and Virgin Gorda, with 14 branches. In the US and British Virgin 
	Islands, the Corporation operates FirstBank in addition to the subsidiary First 
	Express, a finance company specializing in the origination of small loans. In 
	2008, FirstBank acquired the Virgin Island Community Bank in St. Croix, increasing 
	its customer base and share in this market.
In the United States, FirstBank operates a full-line commercial bank under 
	the brand name FirstBank Florida. In March 31, 2005, FirstBank acquired Ponce 
	General Corporation and its subsidiaries FirstBank Florida, a federal savings 
	and loan association, and Ponce Realty Corporation, a company with real estate 
	holdings. FirstBank Florida has a network of 10 branch offices in Miami/Dade 
	and Broward counties in Florida, and regional headquarters in Miami, Florida.
First BanCorp and its subsidiaries are subject to supervision, examination, 
	and regulation of the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
	(FDIC) and the Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions of the Commonwealth 
	of Puerto Rico. FirstBank Insurance Agency, Inc. is regulated by the Office 
	of the Insurance Commissioner of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The Virgin 
	Islands operations are supervised by the Virgin Islands Banking Board (for the 
	USVI) and by the British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission (for the 
	BVI).
