Fiscal Year 2018 Outlook


Net Sales expected to increase at low-to-mid single digit rate


Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures expected to be $740-$760 million


      
        EAGLE, Idaho--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW) announced today its fourth quarter and full year 2017 results, and provided its outlook for fiscal year 2018.
      
      
        'We are pleased with our solid performance in fiscal year 2017, as we continued to deliver high service levels for our customers, while completing the spinoff from Conagra and building a strong foundation for sustainable growth as an independent company,' said Tom Werner, President and CEO. 'We are also proud of our financial performance for the year as we exceeded each of our financial goals through balanced price/mix and volume-driven sales growth as well as disciplined cost management to expand product contribution margins.'
      
      
        'Looking ahead to fiscal year 2018, we anticipate the operating environment to remain generally favorable, with solid demand growth for frozen potato products across most of our markets. In addition, we expect the industry's production capacity to continue to be constrained, especially in North America. We are confident in our ability to build upon the momentum that we have created, leverage our investments in additional capacity to support our customers, execute our strategies and win in the marketplace to deliver on our outlook for the year.'
      
      
        Q4 2017 Commentary
      
      
        Net sales were $832.5 million, up 7 percent versus the year-ago period. Volume increased 4 percent, with growth across all business segments. Price/mix increased 3 percent due to pricing actions and favorable product and customer mix.
      
      
        Income from operations rose 136 percent to $122.5 million from the prior year period and included $2.8 million of costs related to the spinoff from Conagra Brands, Inc. (formerly ConAgra Foods, Inc., 'Conagra') and a $3.1 million non-cash gain on assets. Most of the increase reflects the impact of $64.1 million of expenses incurred in the prior year period, including pension charges for actuarial losses and costs related to the spinoff. Excluding these comparability items, favorable price/mix and volume, as well as supply chain efficiency savings, largely drove the growth in income from operations, partially offset by packaging, manufacturing, edible oil and transportation and warehousing cost inflation. In addition, selling, general and administrative expense rose, largely due to incremental costs associated with being a stand-alone public company, as well as higher incentive compensation costs attributable to the Company's operating performance.
      
      
        Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures was $176.4 million, up 12 percent versus the prior year, mainly reflecting higher equity method investment earnings as well as growth in income from operations.
      
      
        Diluted EPS increased 76 percent to $0.51 from $0.29 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, largely due to pension charges for actuarial losses and costs related to the spinoff from Conagra in the prior year period, higher equity method investment earnings and growth in income from operations. The increase was partially offset by higher interest costs. Adjusted Diluted EPS was $0.51, down 11 percent from $0.57 in the prior year period, primarily due to higher interest costs, partially offset by higher equity method investment earnings and growth in income from operations.
      
      
        The effective tax rate was 34 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.
      
      
        Q4 2017 Segment Highlights
Global
      
      
        Net sales for the Global segment, which is comprised of the top 100 North American based restaurant chain customers as well as its international business, increased 6 percent to $421.4 million. Volume increased 4 percent, driven by growth in both domestic and international markets. Price/mix increased 2 percent, largely reflecting price increases and improvement in customer and product mix.
      
      
        Global Segment Product Contribution Margin increased 10 percent to $83.9 million, primarily driven by favorable volume and price/mix.
      
      
        Foodservice
      
      
        Net sales for the Foodservice segment, which services North American foodservice distributors and restaurant chains outside the top 100 North American based restaurant chain customers, increased 9 percent to $277.0 million. Price/mix increased 8 percent, reflecting pricing actions and improvement in customer and product mix. Volume increased 1 percent, largely driven by demand from independent restaurant operators, as well as small and mid-sized restaurant chains.
      
      
        Foodservice Segment Product Contribution Margin increased 24 percent to $89.3 million, primarily driven by favorable price/mix.
      
      
        Retail
      
      
        Net sales for the Retail segment, which includes sales of Alexia branded, licensed branded and private label products to grocery, mass merchant and club customers in North America, increased 5 percent to $99.0 million. Volume increased 7 percent, primarily driven by growth of private label products. Price/mix declined 2 percent, largely due to higher trade spending in support of the introduction of Grown in Idaho branded products as well as unfavorable mix.
      
      
        Retail Segment Product Contribution Margin declined 17 percent to $14.7 million, mainly due to lower price/mix.
      
      
        Equity Method Investment Earnings
      
      
        Equity method investment earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures were $23.8 million, an increase of $8.4 million from the prior year period, as favorable price/mix and cost savings initiatives more than offset the impacts of higher raw potato costs in Europe.
      
      
        Fiscal Year 2017 Commentary
      
      
        Net sales were $3,168.0 million, up 6 percent versus the year-ago period. Price/mix increased 4 percent due to pricing actions and favorable product and customer mix. Volume increased 2 percent, with growth across all business segments.
      
      
        Income from operations rose 39 percent to $518.3 million from the prior year period, and included $26.5 million of costs related to the spinoff from Conagra as well as a $3.1 million non-cash gain on assets. A portion of the increase for fiscal 2017 reflects the impact of $64.9 million of expenses incurred in the prior year, which are largely comprised of the actuarial losses of a pension liability and costs related to the spinoff. Favorable price/mix, volume gains and supply chain efficiency savings largely drove the remainder of the increase. The increase was partially offset by edible oil, manufacturing and packaging inflation, as well as higher selling, general and administrative expenses, largely due to incremental costs associated with being a stand-alone public company and higher incentive compensation costs attributable to the Company's operating performance.
      
      
        Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures was $707.1 million, up 19 percent versus the prior year period, mainly reflecting growth in income from operations. Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventureswas $692.1 million, and includes an additional $15.0 million of selling, general and administrative expenses to reflect the full-year impact of incremental costs associated with being a stand-alone public company.
      
      
        Diluted EPS increased 16 percent to $2.22 from $1.92 in fiscal 2016, largely due to higher income from operations and pension charges for actuarial losses in the prior year. The increase was partially offset by higher interest expense, higher costs related to the spinoff from Conagra and lower equity method investment earnings. Adjusted Diluted EPS was $2.32, up 10 percent from $2.11 in the prior year, primarily due to higher income from operations, partially offset by higher interest costs. Pro forma Adjusted Diluted EPSwas $2.02 and includes the after-tax, per share impact of the additional selling, general and administrative expenses described above as well as an additional $50.0 million of interest expense to reflect the full-year impact of the Company's capital structure after the spinoff.
      
      
        The effective tax rate was 33 percent for fiscal 2017.
      
      
        Fiscal Year 2017 Segment Highlights
Global
      
      
        Net sales for the Global segment increased 5 percent to $1,624.8 million. Volume increased 4 percent, driven by growth in both domestic and international markets. Price/mix increased 1 percent, largely reflecting price increases as well as improved customer and product mix.
      
      
        Global Segment Product Contribution Margin increased 16 percent to $343.0 million, primarily driven by favorable price/mix, supply chain efficiency savings and volume gains.
      
      
        Foodservice
      
      
        Net sales for the Foodservice segment increased 9 percent to $1,030.0 million. Price/mix increased 8 percent, reflecting pricing actions as well as improvement in customer and product mix.
      
      
        Foodservice Segment Product Contribution Margin increased 31 percent to $333.1 million, largely due to favorable price/mix, supply chain efficiency savings and volume gains.
      
      
        Retail
      
      
        Net sales for the Retail segment increased 3 percent to $384.9 million. Price/mix increased 2 percent, reflecting higher prices and favorable customer and product mix. Volume increased 1 percent, primarily driven by growth of licensed brands and private label products.
      
      
        Retail Segment Product Contribution Margin increased 13 percent to $78.3 million, driven by favorable price/mix, supply chain efficiency savings, lower advertising and promotional expense and volume gains.
      
      
        Equity Method Investment Earnings
      
      
        Equity method investment earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures were $53.3 million, a decrease of $18.4 million from the prior year, largely due to a $17.7 million non-cash gain related to the settlement of a pension plan of the Company's Lamb-Weston/Meijer joint venture in the prior year, as well as higher raw potato costs in Europe, which were essentially offset by favorable price/mix and cost savings initiatives.
      
      
        Outlook
      
      
        The Company provides earnings guidance on a non-GAAP basis and does not reconcile guidance to GAAP as the Company cannot predict certain elements that are included in reported GAAP results, including costs related to the spinoff from Conagra and other items impacting comparability.
      
      
        For fiscal 2018, the Company expects:
      
      

          Net sales to grow low-to-mid single digits, with price/mix and volume growth improving in the second half of the year as new pricing structures for an increasing number of customer contracts become effective and as the Company's new processing capacity becomes available.
        

          Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures in the range of $740 million to $760 million, including higher selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales due to the full-year impact of incremental costs associated with being a stand-alone public company, as well as higher advertising and promotional expense in support of the launch of the Company's Grown in Idaho product line in retail. Using the mid-point of the range, this represents an increase of approximately 8 percent versus a fiscal 2017 pro forma Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures of $692 million.
        

      
        In addition, the Company expects:
      
      

          Total interest expense to be in the range of $105 million to $110 million, which is an increase of approximately $45 million to $50 million from fiscal 2017 due to the full-year impact of the Company's capital structure after the spinoff.
        

          An effective tax rate in the range of 33 to 34 percent.
        

          Cash used for capital expenditures of approximately $225 million, with the majority spent in the first half of the fiscal year as the Company completes the construction of an additional production line at its Richland, Washington facility.
        

End Notes
      
      
        (1) Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures, pro forma Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures, Adjusted Income from Operations, Adjusted Diluted EPS, pro forma Adjusted Diluted EPS and Segment Product Contribution Margin are non-GAAP financial measures.

        Forward-Looking Statements
      
      
        This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. The Company undertakes no responsibility for updating these statements. Readers of this press release should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. Many factors could affect the Company's actual financial results and cause them to vary materially from the expectations contained in the forward-looking statements, including those set forth in this press release. These risks and uncertainties include, among other things: the Company's ability to successfully execute its long-term value creation strategy; the competitive environment and related conditions in the markets in which we operate; political and economic conditions of the countries in which it conducts business and other factors related to its international operations; disruption of its access to export mechanisms; its ability to complete proposed acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses or execute on large capital projects; its future debt levels; the availability and prices of raw materials; changes in its relationships with its growers or significant customers; the success of its joint ventures; actions of governments and regulatory factors affecting its businesses; the ultimate outcome of litigation or any product recalls; levels of pension, labor and people-related expenses; its ability to pay regular quarterly cash dividends and the amounts and timing of any future dividends; and other risks described in the Company's reports filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements included in this press release, which speak only as of the date of this press release.
      
      
        Non-GAAP Financial Measures
      
      
        To supplement the financial information included in this press release, the Company has presented Adjusted Income from Operations, Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures, pro forma Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures, Adjusted Diluted EPS, pro forma Adjusted Diluted EPS and Segment Product Contribution Margin, each of which is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ('GAAP') that are presented in this press release. The non-GAAP financial measures presented may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non-GAAP financial measures in the same way. These measures are not substitutes for their comparable GAAP financial measures, such as net income, diluted earnings per share, or other measures prescribed by GAAP, and there are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures.
      
      
        Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assist in comparing the Company's performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company's underlying operations. Management believes that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful information because they (i) provide meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items, (ii) permit investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate historical performance, and (iii) otherwise provide supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating the Company's results. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provides investors with additional understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company's business than could be obtained absent these disclosures.

What makes a potato perfect?

						Crispy golden fries don’t come from ordinary potatoes. They come from potatoes grown in rich, fertile
						soil, in an ideal climate, by dedicated farmers. When all the elements come together, the results are nothing short of delicious.
					







Soil
Potatoes prefer rich, sandy soil that’s
								well drained.







Sun
Potatoes do best in full sun, requiring at least 6 hours
								each day during the growing season.







Water
Potatoes like a controlled and consistent source of water
								— about 1-2 inches per week.







Temperature

								Warm, sun-filled days and cool, clear nights keep potatoes
								happy. They prefer temperatures between 50 °F and 85 °F.
















Where perfect potatoes come from

						Five regions in North America have the ideal combination of soil and climate to produce our
						perfect potatoes.

        Q3 2017 Commentary
      Net sales were $769 million, up 5 percent versus the year-ago period.
      Price/mix increased 4 percent due to pricing actions and favorable
      product and customer mix. Volume increased 1 percent as the Company
      continued to operate essentially at full capacity.
    
      Income from operations increased 14 percent to $145 million from the
      prior year period, and included $5 million of costs related to the
      spinoff from Conagra Brands, Inc. (formerly ConAgra Foods, Inc.,
      “Conagra”). Favorable price/mix largely drove the increase. On a per
      pound basis, while raw potato costs were essentially flat versus the
      prior year period, other inputs, manufacturing, transportation and
      warehousing costs increased, partially offset by supply chain efficiency
      savings. Selling, general and administrative expense increased, largely
      due to incremental costs associated with being a stand-alone public
      company, as well as higher incentive compensation costs as a result of
      the Company’s strong operating performance.
    
      Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures(1)
      was $191 million, up 11 percent versus the prior year period, mainly
      reflecting growth in income from operations, partially offset by lower
      equity method investment earnings due to the impacts of higher raw
      potato costs in Europe.
    
      Diluted EPS decreased 20 percent to $0.57 from $0.71 in the prior year
      period, and Adjusted Diluted EPS(1) was $0.59, down 5 percent
      compared to the prior year period. The decreases were largely due to
      higher interest costs and lower equity method investment earnings. The
      decrease in Diluted EPS was also due to a $17.7 million non-cash gain
      related to the settlement of a pension plan of the Company’s
      Lamb-Weston/Meijer joint venture in the prior year quarter.
    
      The effective tax rate(2) was 33 percent in the third quarter
      of fiscal 2017.

      Volume increased 1 percent, primarily driven by growth of licensed
      brands and private label products.
    
      Retail Segment Product Contribution Margin(1) was flat at $23
      million, with higher gross profit offset by increased advertising
      spending.
    Equity Method Investment Earnings
      Equity method investment earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures
      were $12.7 million, a decrease of $23.4 million from the prior year
      quarter, largely due to the $17.7 million non-cash gain related to the
      settlement of a pension plan of the Company’s Lamb-Weston/Meijer joint
      venture in the prior year quarter as well as the impacts of higher raw
      potato costs in Europe.
    Outlook
      The Company provides earnings guidance on a non-GAAP basis and does not
      reconcile guidance to GAAP as the Company cannot predict certain
      elements that are included in reported GAAP results, including costs
      related to the spinoff from Conagra and other items impacting
      comparability.

      For fiscal 2017, the Company continues to expect net sales to grow at a

      ventures(1) to grow at a mid-teens rate and Adjusted Diluted
      EPS(1) of $2.20 to $2.28.
    
      In addition, the Company continues to expect total interest expense to
      be approximately $60 million, and now expects its effective tax rate(2)
      to be 33 to 34 percent. The Company’s previous estimate was
      approximately 34 percent.

      are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to
      uncertainty and changes in circumstances. The Company undertakes no
      responsibility for updating these statements. Readers of this press
      release should understand that these statements are not guarantees of
      performance or results. Many factors could affect the Company’s actual
      financial results and cause them to vary materially from the
      expectations contained in the forward-looking statements, including
      those set forth in this press release. These risks and uncertainties
      include, among other things: the Company’s ability to successfully
      execute its long-term value creation strategy; the competitive
      environment and related market conditions; political and economic
      conditions of the countries in which it conducts business and other
      factors related to its international operations; disruption of its
      access to export mechanisms; its ability to complete proposed
      acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses or execute on large
      capital projects; its future debt levels; the availability and prices of
      raw materials; changes in its relationships with its growers or
      significant customers; the success of its joint ventures; actions of
      governments and regulatory factors affecting its businesses; the
      ultimate outcome of litigation or any product recalls; increased
      pension, labor and people-related expenses; its ability to pay regular
      quarterly cash dividends and the amounts and timing of any future
      dividends; and other risks described in the Company’s reports filed from
      time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company
      cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking
      statements included in this press release, which speak only as of the

    Non-GAAP Financial Measures
      To supplement the financial information included in this press release,
      the Company has presented Adjusted Income from Operations, Adjusted
      EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures,
      Adjusted Net Income attributable to Lamb Weston, Adjusted Diluted EPS
      and Segment Product Contribution Margin, each of which is considered a
      non-GAAP financial measure. The non-GAAP financial measures provided
      should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for,
      financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles
      generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") that are
      presented in this press release. The non-GAAP financial measures
      presented may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures
      presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these
      non-GAAP financial measures in the same way. These measures are not
      substitutes for their comparable GAAP financial measures, such as net
      income, diluted earnings per share, or other measures prescribed by
      GAAP, and there are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures.
    
      Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assist in comparing
      the Company's performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business
      decision making by removing the impact of certain items that management
      believes do not directly reflect the Company's underlying operations.
      Management believes that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures
      provide investors with useful information because they (i) provide
      meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by
      excluding certain items, (ii) permit investors to view performance using
      the same tools that management uses to budget, make operating and
      strategic decisions, and evaluate historical performance, and (iii)
      otherwise provide supplemental information that may be useful to
      investors in evaluating the Company's results. The Company believes that
      the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered
      together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and the
      reconciliations to those measures, provides investors with additional
      understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company's business
      than could be obtained absent these disclosures.

          On November 9, 2016, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (“Lamb Weston”)
          separated from Conagra Brands, Inc. (formerly ConAgra Foods, Inc.,
          “Conagra”) and became an independent publicly traded company through
          the pro rata distribution by Conagra of 100% of the outstanding
          common stock of Lamb Weston to Conagra stockholders (the
          “Separation” or “Spinoff”). The condensed combined and consolidated
          earnings in all periods prior to November 9, 2016, were carved out
          of Conagra’s consolidated financial statements. These financial
          statements may not reflect what the Company’s results of operations
          would have been had it operated as a separate stand-alone public
          company and may not be indicative of its future results of
          operations. These financial statements should be read together with
          the consolidated financial statements and notes filed with the
          Securities and Exchange Commission in the Company’s registration
          statement on Form 10, as amended, on October 17, 2016, and its
          fiscal 2017 third quarter Form 10-Q.
        
           
        
            (2)
          
            The thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended February 26, 2017,
            include $5.1 million and $23.8 million, respectively, of expenses
            related to the Separation as discussed in footnote (1) above. The
            thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended February 28, 2016, both
            include $0.7 million of Separation-related expenses. In all
            periods, the expenses related primarily to professional fees.
          
           
        
            (3)
          
            The thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended February 28, 2016, both
            include a $17.7 million non-cash gain related to the settlement of
            a pension plan of the Company’s Lamb-Weston/Meijer joint venture.

            Adjusted income from operations is a non-GAAP financial measure.
            Management excludes items impacting comparability between periods
            as it believes these items are not necessarily reflective of the
            ongoing operations of the Company. These non-GAAP measures provide
            a means to evaluate the performance of Lamb Weston’s segments and
            the Company on an ongoing basis using the same measures that are
            frequently used by the Company’s management and assist in
            providing a meaningful comparison between periods. Any analysis of
            non-GAAP financial measures should be done only in conjunction
            with results presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP
            measures are not intended to be substitutes for GAAP financial
            measures and should not be used as such.

            measures. Management excludes items impacting comparability
            between periods as it believes these items are not necessarily
            reflective of the ongoing operations of Lamb Weston. These
            non-GAAP measures provide a means to evaluate the performance of
            Lamb Weston on an ongoing basis using the same measures that are
            frequently used by the Company’s management and assist in
            providing a meaningful comparison between periods. Any analysis of
            non-GAAP financial measures should be done only in conjunction
            with results presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP
            measures are not intended to be substitutes for GAAP financial
            measures and should not be used as such.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Forward-Looking Statements  This report, including Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. We undertake no responsibility for updating these statements. Readers of this report should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. Many factors could affect our actual financial results and cause them to vary materially from the expectations contained in the forward-looking statements, including those set forth in this report. These risks and uncertainties include, among other things: our ability to successfully execute our long-term value creation strategy; the competitive environment and related market conditions; political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations; disruption of our access to export mechanisms; our ability to complete proposed acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses or execute on large capital projects; our future debt levels; the availability and prices of raw materials; changes in our relationships with our growers or significant customers; the success of our joint ventures; actions of governments and regulatory factors affecting our businesses; the ultimate outcome of litigation or any product recalls; increased pension, labor and people-related expenses; our ability to pay regular quarterly cash dividends and the amounts and timing of any future dividends; and other risks described in our reports filed from time to time with the SEC. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements included in this report, which speak only as of the date of this report.  You should read the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in conjunction with the unaudited condensed combined and consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this report.  Overview  Lamb Weston, along with its joint venture partners, is a leading global producer, distributor, and marketer of value-added frozen potato products. We are the number one supplier of value-added frozen potato products in North America-the largest market for frozen potato products in the world. We are also a leading supplier of value-added frozen potato products internationally, with a strong and growing presence in high-growth emerging markets. We offer a broad product portfolio to a diverse channel and customer base in over 100 countries. French fries represent the majority of our valued-added frozen potato product portfolio.  Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, references to "we," "our," "us," "the Company" and "Lamb Weston" refer to Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries or, in the case of information as of dates or for periods prior to the Separation (as defined below), the combined and consolidated entities of the Lamb Weston business of Conagra Brands, Inc. (formerly, ConAgra Foods, Inc., "Conagra" or "our former parent") and certain other assets and liabilities that had been historically held at the Conagra corporate level but were specifically identifiable and attributable to the Lamb Weston business.  Table of Contents  Management's discussion and analysis, which we refer to in this filing as "MD&A," of our results of operations and financial condition is provided as a supplement to the Condensed Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere herein to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of our operations. Our MD&A is based on financial data derived from the financial statements prepared in accordance with the United States ("U.S.") generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and certain other financial data (Adjusted EBITDA) that is prepared using non-GAAP measures. Refer to "Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Reported Amounts" below for a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income.  Lamb Weston's management uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the company's performance excluding the impact of certain non-cash charges and other special items in order to have comparable financial results to analyze changes in our underlying business between reporting periods. The company includes this non-GAAP financial measure because management believes it is useful to investors in that it provides for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. We believe that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure, when used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, is a useful financial analysis tool that can assist investors in assessing the company's operating performance and underlying prospects. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for net (loss) income.  Separation from Conagra  On November 9, 2016, Lamb Weston separated from Conagra and became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by Conagra of 100% of the outstanding common stock of Lamb Weston to Conagra stockholders (which we refer to as the "Separation"). Each Conagra stockholder of record as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 1, 2016, the "record date" received one share of Lamb Weston common stock for every three shares of Conagra common stock held on the record date. Approximately 146 million shares of Lamb Weston common stock were distributed on November 9, 2016 to Conagra stockholders. Lamb Weston's common stock began "regular way" trading under the ticker symbol "LW" on the New York Stock Exchange on November 10, 2016.  The Separation was completed pursuant to a separation and distribution agreement and several other agreements with Conagra, including a transition services agreement, tax matters agreement, employee matters agreement, and trademark license agreement, each of which was filed with the SEC as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K on November 10, 2016. These agreements govern the relationship among Lamb Weston and Conagra following the Separation and provide for the allocation of various assets, liabilities, rights and obligations. These agreements also include arrangements for transition services to be provided by Conagra to Lamb Weston. For a discussion of each agreement see the section entitled "Relationship with Conagra After the Spinoff" in our registration statement on Form 10, as amended, which was filed with the SEC on October 17, 2016 (the "Form 10").  In connection with the Separation, Conagra transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities and operations of Lamb Weston to us. Combined financial statements prior to the Separation were prepared on a stand-alone basis and were derived from Conagra's consolidated financial statements and accounting records. The combined financial statements contained in this report reflect our financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows as our business was operated as part of Conagra prior to the Separation. Following the Separation, our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The condensed combined and consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of dates and for periods prior to the Separation may not be indicative of what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows would have been as a separate stand-alone entity during the periods presented, nor are they indicative of what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be in the future. For additional information, see Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Condensed Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in "Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements" of this report.  Executive Summary  Fiscal 2017 second quarter net sales increased 7% to $790.7 million, compared with $740.3 million in the comparable quarter of the prior year. Sales grew 5% in the first half of fiscal 2017 to $1,567.0 million, compared with  Table of Contents  $1,488.1 million in the comparable prior year period. Net income attributable to Lamb Weston increased 19% to $87.2 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, during the second quarter 2017, compared with $73.3 million of net income, or $0.50 per diluted share, during the same period in fiscal 2016. Net income attributable to Lamb Weston increased 23% to $166.8 million for the first half of fiscal 2017, compared with $135.3 million reported in the same period in the prior year. The second quarter and first half of fiscal 2017 included $5.7 million and $11.8 million, respectively, of after-tax expense for costs (primarily professional fees) related to our Separation from Conagra. Excluding these comparability items, net income increased 27% to $92.9 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, and increased 32% to $178.6 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, compared with the first half in the prior year. The second quarter and first half of fiscal 2017 Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures, was $168.1 million and $339.9 million, a 19% and 29% increase compared with the same periods in the prior year.  Compared with the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2016, the increase in net income and Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures was driven primarily by favorable year-over-year pricing and mix and increased sales volume, as well as cost savings related to transportation, warehousing and conversion costs. Partially offsetting these benefits in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, were higher selling, general and administrative expenses related to incremental costs incurred as a stand-alone company and higher incentive compensation costs.  Demand for frozen potato products continues to grow around the world. We are meeting the increase in demand by investing in additional capacity at our Boardman, Oregon and Richland, Washington facilities, which we expect to complete in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and second quarter of fiscal 2018, respectively. Additionally, through our Lamb-Weston/Meijer joint venture, we have recently expanded capacity in our facility at Bergen op Zoom, The Netherlands, and are participating in a joint venture that is constructing a new production facility in Lipetsk, a special economic zone in south Moscow. The Lipetsk plant is expected to be operational in early 2018.  Outlook  We manage Lamb Weston for sustainable performance as defined by our long-term annual financial targets, including net sales growth in the mid-single digits, Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures growth in the mid-teen digits and Adjusted Diluted EPS of $2.20 to $2.28. For fiscal 2017, we expect the operating environment to remain favorable for the remainder of our fiscal year given the continued growth in volume demand and high industry manufacturing capacity utilization levels.  Operating Results  We have four reportable segments: Global, Foodservice, Retail, and Other. For each period presented, we report product contribution margin by segment. Product contribution margin is the primary measure reported to our chief operating decision maker for purposes of allocating resources to our segments and assessing their performance. We define product contribution margin as net sales less cost of sales and advertising and promotion expenses. For additional information on our reportable segments, see Note 16, Business Segments and Related Information, of the Notes to Condensed Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in "Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements" of this report.  Table of Contents  Thirteen Weeks Ended November 27, 2016 compared to Thirteen Weeks Ended November 29, 2015  Net Sales and Product Contribution Margin (dollars in millions) Thirteen Weeks Ended Net Sales Product Contribution Margin November 27, November 29, % Inc November 27, November 29, % Inc 2016 2015 (Dec) 2016 2015 (Dec) Global $ 412.6 $ 388.3 6% $ 92.3 $ 78.9 17% Foodservice 250.6 225.2 11% 80.2 57.8 39% Retail 96.5 91.8 5% 20.9 15.4 36% Other 31.0 35.0 (11%) (0.4) 2.2 (118%) Total $ 790.7 $ 740.3 7% $ 193.0 $ 154.3 25%  Net Sales  Lamb Weston's net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 were $790.7 million, an increase of $50.4 million, or 7%, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016.  Global net sales increased $24.3 million, or 6%, to $412.6 million, compared with $388.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Fiscal 2017 second quarter net sales reflect a 5% increase in sales volume, driven by growth domestically, which included organic growth and new business with major chains, as well as growth in international markets. Additionally, fiscal 2017 second quarter net sales reflect a 1% increase in price associated with domestic and international pricing actions.  Foodservice net sales increased $25.4 million, or 11%, to $250.6 million, compared with $225.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Fiscal 2017 second quarter net sales reflect a 6% increase related to favorable mix and pricing, which reflects the continued implementation of a broad-based price increase announced earlier in the year as well as actions to improve customer and product mix. Sales volume increased 5%, which related to growth of small and mid-sized restaurant chain operators as well as regional and independent food distributors.  Retail net sales increased $4.7 million, or 5%, to $96.5 million, compared with $91.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Fiscal 2017 second quarter net sales reflect a 4% increase in sales volume, reflecting growth of licensed brands and private label. Positive customer mix change due to the increase of licensed brands and trade efficiency drove the remaining increase in net sales.  Net sales in our Other segment decreased $4.0 million, or 11%, to $31.0 million, compared with $35.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Compared with fiscal second quarter 2016, the decrease in net sales reflected lower sales in the vegetable business.  Product Contribution Margin  Global product contribution margin increased $13.4 million, or 17%, to $92.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, as a result of favorable price/mix, supply chain efficiency savings and volume growth. Global cost of sales was $318.9 million, or 4%, higher for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016 driven by an increase in sales volumes and commodity input, transportation, warehousing, and conversion costs. Advertising and promotion spending decreased slightly in the second quarter of 2017 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016, driven by the timing of costs related to our global rebranding.  Foodservice product contribution margin increased $22.4 million, or 39%, to $80.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 as a result of favorable price/mix, supply chain efficiency savings and volume growth. Cost of sales was $168.6 million, or 1%, higher in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016.  Table of Contents  Advertising and promotion spending was flat in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016.  Retail product contribution margin increased $5.5 million, or 36%, to $20.9 million due to the increase in net sales, as discussed above, as well as supply chain efficiency savings. Cost of sales was $73.3 million, for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, which was flat compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Advertising and promotion spending was down $1.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016, driven by the timing of marketing spend for our Alexia brand products.  Other product contribution margin decreased to a $0.4 million loss, compared with $2.2 million of income in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, due primarily to lower sales in our vegetable business.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $21.1 million, or 40%, to $73.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared with the same period in 2016. The second quarter of fiscal 2017 included $9.0 million of expense for costs related to the Separation. Excluding the costs recorded in connection with the Separation, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 23%, largely due to incremental costs associated with being a stand-alone business as well as higher incentive compensation costs.  Interest Expense, Net  Interest expense, net was $6.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, an increase of $5.3 million compared with $1.5 million in the same period in fiscal 2016. The increase in interest expense, net was the result of the debt incurred in connection with the Separation. For more information, see Note 11, Debt and Financing Obligations in the Notes to Condensed Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in "Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements" of this report and "Obligations and Commitments" in this MD&A. For the period prior to the Separation from Conagra, interest expense was included for only the legal entities that made-up Lamb Weston, and did not include any allocated interest expense from Conagra.  Income Taxes  Income tax expense for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and 2016 was $33.9 million and $38.7 million, respectively. The effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre-tax income, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was approximately 27% and 33% for the thirteen weeks ended November 27, 2016 and November 29, 2015, respectively. The lower rate in second quarter fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase in costs determined to be deductible, as well as a discrete benefit related to a change in estimate for prior year foreign taxes.  We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017, exclusive of any unusual transactions or tax events which we cannot predict, to be approximately 34%.  Equity Method Investment Earnings  We conduct meaningful business through unconsolidated joint ventures and include our share of the earnings based on our economic ownership interest in them. Our two most significant joint ventures produce and market value-added frozen potato products for retail and foodservice customers:  � We hold a 50% ownership interest in Lamb-Weston/Meijer, a Netherlands joint venture that manufactures and sells frozen potato products principally in Europe. We and our partner are jointly and severally liable for all legal liabilities of Lamb Weston/Meijer. Lamb-Weston/Meijer and Belaya Dacha (Russian real estate company) have formed a joint venture and have committed approximately EUR100 million to establish a French fry plant in Lipetsk, a special economic zone in south Moscow. Construction on the project began in mid-2016 and the plant is expected to become operational in early fiscal 2018.  Table of Contents  � We hold a 50% ownership interest in Lamb Weston RDO, a potato processing venture. We provide all sales and marketing services to Lamb Weston RDO. We receive a fee for these services based on a percentage of the net sales of the venture.  Lamb Weston's share of earnings from its equity method investments was $6.2 million and $7.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. Equity method investment earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 were lower due to higher raw potato costs in Europe and unfavorable currency translation with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the Euro.  Twenty-Six Weeks Ended November 27, 2016 compared to the Twenty-Six Weeks Ended November 29, 2015  Net Sales and Product Contribution Margin (dollars in millions) Twenty-Six Weeks Ended Net Sales Product Contribution Margin November 27, November 29, % Inc November 27, November 29, % Inc 2016 2015 (Dec) 2016 2015 (Dec) Global $ 811.8 $ 771.1 5% $ 165.9 $ 134.3 24% Foodservice 510.9 471.5 8% 159.7 118.0 35% Retail 186.1 179.5 4% 40.5 28.6 42% Other 58.2 66.0 (12%) 2.8 8.9 (69%) Total $ 1,567.0 $ 1,488.1 5% $ 368.9 $ 289.8 27%  Net Sales  Lamb Weston's net sales for the first half of fiscal 2017 were $1,567.0 million, an increase of $78.9 million, or 5%, compared with the same period in fiscal 2016.  Global net sales increased $40.7 million, or 5%, to $811.8 million, compared with $771.1 million in the first half of fiscal 2016. Net sales in the first half of fiscal 2017 reflect a 4% increase in sales volume, driven by growth domestically, which included organic growth and new business with major restaurant chains, as well as growth in international markets. Additionally, net sales in the first half of fiscal 2017 reflect a 1% increase in price/mix associated with price increases in both domestic and international markets, as well as actions to improve customer and product mix.  Foodservice net sales increased $39.4 million, or 8%, to $510.9 million, compared with $471.5 million in the first half of fiscal 2016. Net sales in the first half of fiscal 2017 reflect a 5% increase related to favorable customer mix and pricing, which reflects the continued implementation of a broad-based price increase announced earlier in the year as well as actions to improve customer and product mix. Sales volume increased 3%, which related to growth of small and mid-sized restaurant chain operators as well as regional and independent food distributors.  Retail net sales increased $6.6 million, or 4%, to $186.1 million, compared with $179.5 million in the first half of fiscal 2016. Net sales in the first half of fiscal 2017 reflect a 3% increase related to favorable customer mix changes due to the increase of licensed brands and trade efficiencies. Sales volume increased 1%, reflecting distribution growth of licensed brands and private label.  Net sales in our Other segment decreased $7.8 million, or 12%, to $58.2 million, compared with $66.0 million in the first half of fiscal 2016. The decrease in net sales in the first half of fiscal 2017 is due primarily to lower sales in our vegetable business.  Product Contribution Margin  Global product contribution margin increased $31.6 million, or 24%, to $165.9 million in the first half of fiscal 2017, as a result of favorable price/mix, supply chain efficiency savings and volume growth. Global cost of sales was  Table of Contents  $643.3 million, or 2% higher, in the first half of fiscal 2017, as compared to the same period in the prior year. While total costs were higher in connection with increased volumes, as a percent of sales, global cost of sales declined 3% in the first half of fiscal 2017, compared with the first half of fiscal 2016, due to supply chain efficiency savings driven by operational efficiencies. Advertising and promotion spending was $0.8 million lower for the first half of 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016, driven by the timing of costs related to our global rebranding.  Foodservice product contribution margin increased $41.7 million, or 35%, to $159.7 million in the first half of fiscal 2017 as a result of favorable price/mix, supply chain efficiency savings and volume growth. Cost of sales was $347.8 million, or 1%, lower in the first half of fiscal 2017, as compared to the same period in the prior year, driven by operational efficiencies. Advertising and promotion spending was $0.2 million lower in the first half of fiscal 2017, compared with the first half of fiscal 2016.  Retail product contribution margin increased $11.9 million, or 42%, to $40.5 million due to favorable price/mix and volume growth. Cost of sales was $141.6 million, or 3% lower in the first half of fiscal 2017 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2016, driven by supply chain efficiency savings and partially offset by an increase from higher volume. Advertising and promotion spending was $1.5 million lower in the first half of fiscal 2017, compared with the first half of fiscal 2016, due to the timing of marketing and promotional spending related to our Alexia brand.  Other product contribution margin decreased $6.1 million, or 69%, in the first half of fiscal 2017, due primarily to lower sales in our vegetable business as described above.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $20.0 million, or 18%, in the first half of fiscal 2017 compared with the same period in 2016. The first half of fiscal 2017 included $18.7 million of expense for costs related to the Separation from Conagra, primarily related to professional fees. Excluding the costs recorded in connection with the Separation, selling, general and administrative expenses increased less than 1%.  Interest Expense, Net  Interest expense, net was $8.3 million in the first half of fiscal 2017, an increase of $5.5 million compared with the same period in fiscal 2016. The increase in interest expense, net was the result of the new debt incurred in connection with the Separation from Conagra on November 9, 2016. For more information, see Note 11, Debt and Financial Obligations in the Notes to Condensed Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in "Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements" of this report.
