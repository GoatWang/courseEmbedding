Try On Service



How does the try-on service work?
For those who are new to our brand, we offer the option of trying on a second size- free of charge- so that you can find your perfect fit. Our Try-On Service is available for our Signature pant styles and other year-round styles.  The Try-On Service is NOT available for seasonal or limited-edition styles due to limited inventory!
Simply select your second size, we recommend trying one size up, and we’ll ship you both pants. You have seven (7) days after your package is delivered to place in the mail whichever size that doesn’t work out for you, unworn and undamaged. So long as you put your optional size in the mail in our return envelope by the seventh day after delivery, you will only be charged for the item you keep.
Please note that we cannot provide the Try-On Service for international orders. We do not yet have the capability to provide return postage for international orders. If you are unsure about your sizing, please go ahead and order two sizes or inquire about detailed sizing information through our Customer Service (customerservice@aella.co).
 





What if I don’t return the second size within the seven-day period?
If you do not return the second size within the seven (7) day period (again, that’s seven days AFTER your package is delivered), then you will be charged for the item. We will also have to charge you for the second size if it comes back with signs of wear or damage.
 
Can I wear the second size out and about during the seven-day period?
You can if you want to buy both sizes! However, if you only want to buy the item in one size, the size you don’t want must be in unworn and undamaged condition. Otherwise we will have to charge for the worn but returned item.
 
How do I know which two sizes to order?
We know that finding your size can be tricky! So we have our handy Pant Guide to help your decision-making process and sizing information on each product page. Just FYI, our sizing is very similar to Theory and slightly smaller than J.Crew. If you want any help with figuring out which size will work best for you, please email us at stylist@aella.co.
 
Do I have to use the try-on service?
Of course not! If you know your size, you can simply opt out of receiving a second size pant by not selecting a size in the second size area of the product page.  
 
Do you offer Try-On Service for international orders? 
Unfortunately, we are not able to support Try-On options for international orders at this time. If you select try-on sizes in your order, we will not be able to fulfill that optional size, so please choose your size carefully!






Sizing



What is your sizing like?
﻿Our sizing is very similar to Theory and a little bit smaller than J. Crew. Our Size 4 corresponds to a jean size 27 (so if you wear a size 27 in Rag & Bone or JBrand, then our Size 4 would be your size). We also include the sizing information for each product under the "Fit" tab in the product description.
 
I’m petite, will the clothes fit me?
Probably! Many of our petite customers are able to order their usual size and simply alter the length of the pants or make minor alterations to the blazers.
Our most petite friendly pants are the Ankle Skinny and Short Flare. The Cigarette Pant & Trouser each feature a straight cut leg and can easily be hemmed to your desired length. Further Questions? Email us at stylist@aella.co
 
I’m tall, will the pants for long enough for me?
Most of our pants are long enough for our tall customers. Our most tall-friendly style is the High Waist Flare with a 35” inseam. The Ankle Skinny will hit ladies 5’8” and above a bit higher on the leg, but it is still a great look! All of the inseams are noted on the product pages for the pants. Further Questions? Email us at stylist@aella.co.






Stylist



How long does it take to receive my pant recommendation?
A real, living human is hard at work synthizing customer needs and providing a personal recommendation for pant silhouette based on body type and wardrobe needs. This takes time. For any requests submitted, please allow 2 business days for us to provide you a personalized recommendation. Don’t worry, the peace of mind will be well worth the wait!
 
I didn’t receive my recommendation...
First, please ensure that stylist@aella.co is added to your address book, and check your SPAM folder. If you don’t see it there, please send us a note at stylist@aella.co.
 
How accurate are these recommendations?
By combining years of AELLA customer data with technical design details, our stylists have extensive experience in assisting customers in finding the right AELLA pant silhouette for their body type & wardrobe needs. However, there are always exceptions to the rule. We’ll do our best to recommend the best pant for you based on your answers, but there’s always a chance that the pant doesn’t work out.
If that happens, please let us know. Your feedback helps us to improve our recommendations.
 
What if I have follow up questions?
We’d be happy to answer any questions you have. Please email us at stylist@aella.co, we can arrange for one of our stylists to call you.
