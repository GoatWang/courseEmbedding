All-new Ford GT supercar sets new standards for Ford innovation through performance with advances in light-weighting, aerodynamics and ultra-efficient EcoBoost® engine
Ford GT features the most powerful EcoBoost production engine ever – a new twin-turbocharged Ford EcoBoost V6 producing more than 600 horsepower
Ultra-high-performance supercar is Ford’s most extreme offering, infused with race-proven technology engineered to keep company with exotics when it goes into production in 2016

The all-new Ford GT serves as a technology showcase for top EcoBoost® performance, aerodynamics and lightweight carbon fiber construction.
The GT is one of more than 12 new Ford Performance vehicles coming by 2020. It joins Focus RS, F-150 Raptor, Shelby GT350 and Shelby GT350R in the growing Ford Performance lineup.
Beginning production in late 2016, the GT hits the road in select global markets to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Ford GT race cars placing 1-2-3 at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans.
“As we at Ford drive innovation into every part of our business, it’s worth remembering that our first innovation as a company was not in a laboratory, but on the racetrack,” said Mark Fields, Ford president and chief executive officer, referring to Henry Ford’s win of a 1901 car race that inspired financial backers to invest in his company. “We are passionate about innovation through performance and creating vehicles that make people’s hearts pound.”
The all-new GT supercar features rear-wheel drive, a mid-mounted engine, and a sleek, aerodynamic, two-door coupe body shell. It is propelled by the most powerful EcoBoost production engine ever – a next-generation twin-turbocharged EcoBoost V6 producing more than 600 horsepower.
The GT makes extensive use of lightweight materials, including carbon fiber and aluminum – enabling outstanding acceleration and handling with improved efficiency.
Ford’s commitment to and capability in delivering technologies typically offered only in elite vehicles is evident in the GT. These include advanced active aerodynamics, such as a deployable rear spoiler, and a host of material and technology innovations to help better serve the driver, such as SYNC® 3 – the latest version of Ford’s advanced connectivity system.
“The GT is the ultimate execution of an enthusiast supercar,” said Raj Nair, Ford group vice president, Global Product Development. “GT includes innovations and technologies that can be applied broadly across Ford’s future product portfolio – another proof point that Ford continues raising the performance bar while ultimately improving vehicles for all of our customers.”
Carbon fiber innovation

Few innovations provide a more wide-ranging performance and efficiency advantage than reducing weight. All factors of a vehicle’s capabilities – acceleration, handling, braking, safety, efficiency – can improve through the use of advanced, lighter materials.
The all-new GT features advanced lightweight composites, which will help serve Ford’s entire product lineup moving forward. With the broad application of structural carbon fiber elements, the GT will exhibit one of the best power-to-weight ratios of any production car.
Anchored by a carbon fiber passenger cell, the GT features aluminum front and rear subframes encapsulated in structural carbon fiber body panels. Carbon fiber is one of the world’s strongest materials for its mass – enabling an ultra-stiff foundation for chassis components, while creating a lighter overall package for increased dynamic performance and efficiency.
Most powerful production EcoBoost ever

Ford EcoBoost technology is available in every new Ford car, utility and light-duty pickup in North America.
EcoBoost engines power a growing number of Ford performance models, including the new Mustang, just-announced F-150 Raptor, as well as Fiesta ST and Focus ST.
Based on the same race-proven engine architecture serving Ford’s IMSA Daytona Prototype endurance racing efforts, the next-generation twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 in the GT features a wide powerband with impressive time-to-torque characteristics.
The engine demonstrates remarkable efficiency – a key attribute of its endurance racing-derived powertrain, where exceptional performance combined with efficiency is a critical competitive advantage.
Ford’s twin-turbo EcoBoost V6 raced to three wins in its first season of the IMSA TUDOR United SportsCar Championship in 2014, including a win in the prestigious 12 Hours of Sebring, and won the prestigious 24 Hours of Daytona to start the 2015 season.
The GT features an all-new, port/direct dual fuel-injection setup to improve engine response, plus a low-friction roller-finger-follower valvetrain. The twin-turbocharged EcoBoost V6 will be paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch transaxle for near-instantaneous gear changes and exceptional driver control.
Aero innovation gets active

Aerodynamic efficiency is at the heart of the GT design, actively reducing drag while aiding downforce and stability.
From its optimum tear-drop shape to its aircraft-inspired fuselage and visibility-enhancing curved windshield, every slope and shape is designed to minimize drag and optimize downforce.
Although each surface on the GT is functionally crafted to manage airflow, it also features fully active aerodynamic components to improve braking, handling and stability.
An active rear spoiler is keyed to both speed and driver input, reactively deploying and adjusting its height and/or pitch angle depending on conditions.
Designed for purpose

While it shares a legacy with classic Ford racing and performance cars, GT is a fully contemporary and functional shape that communicates modernity and pure beauty.
The state-of-the-art chassis is suspended by an active racing-style torsion bar and pushrod suspension, with adjustable ride height. The 20-inch wheels are shod with Michelin Pilot Super Sport Cup 2 tires featuring a unique compound and structure designed specifically for the Ford GT. Multi-spoke wheels encircle carbon-ceramic brake discs at all four corners.
The narrow-profile canopy reduces frontal area and caps a purposeful interior that provides state-of-the-art technology to ensure control, comfort and safety. The two-seat cockpit is accessed by upward-swinging doors, and features driver and passenger seats integrated directly into the carbon fiber passenger cell.
This configuration significantly reduces seating hardware and weight, and provides a consistent and direct sensory connection to the chassis. The fixed seating is combined with adjustable pedals and steering column to accommodate a very wide range of driver statures.
An F1-style steering wheel integrates all necessary driver controls, creating a stalkless steering column that allows uncluttered access to the transmission paddle-shift controls. A fully digital and configurable instrument cluster provides a wealth of driver-focused data. The display is configurable for multiple driving environments and different driving modes.
“While we hope enthusiasts rejoice about this all-new GT, all Ford customers will benefit from the ultimate performance Ford and its new-generation innovations,” said Nair.

Archaeological work[edit]
In 1933 Ford build a tentative chronology of the cultures on the lower Mississippi River.[1] Between 1933 and 1934, he worked at the Ocmulgee National Monument in Macon, Georgia, under Arthur Randolph Kelly. Also in 1934, he investigated the Tabby ruins at Elizafield Plantation near Brunswick, Georgia. From August 1 to September 1, 1934, he worked for the Georgia State Parks Service; and later that year, from September 2 to October 15, he worked for the Southeast Fair Association to develop an American Indian Exhibition in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1937, he became involved in a restoration project of an earthen lodge at Ocmulgee National Monument for the National Park Service. In the winter of 1939-40 he excavated the Medora Site for the Louisiana State Archaeological Survey, a joint project of Louisiana State University and the Work Projects Administration. The excavations of the site were instrumental in defining the characteristics of the Plaquemine culture and period.[2]

Archaeological work[edit]
In 1933 Ford build a tentative chronology of the cultures on the lower Mississippi River.[1] Between 1933 and 1934, he worked at the Ocmulgee National Monument in Macon, Georgia, under Arthur Randolph Kelly. Also in 1934, he investigated the Tabby ruins at Elizafield Plantation near Brunswick, Georgia. From August 1 to September 1, 1934, he worked for the Georgia State Parks Service; and later that year, from September 2 to October 15, he worked for the Southeast Fair Association to develop an American Indian Exhibition in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1937, he became involved in a restoration project of an earthen lodge at Ocmulgee National Monument for the National Park Service. In the winter of 1939-40 he excavated the Medora Site for the Louisiana State Archaeological Survey, a joint project of Louisiana State University and the Work Projects Administration. The excavations of the site were instrumental in defining the characteristics of the Plaquemine culture and period.[2]
In the early 1950s he led the first large scale excavations at Poverty Point, Louisiana; a project that took him with breaks until his death. He discovered the ridge structure of the precolumbian earthworks as the unique features of that site. His experiments with loess soil to find the purpose of the hundreds of thousands Poverty Point objects were the beginnings of experimental archaeology in North America. His theories over the origin of the Poverty Point culture later became obsolete, his samples and results of radiocarbon dating were inaccurate due to the very early stages of that technology.[1] In 1958 he excavated the Menard-Hodges Site in southeastern Arkansas.[3]

Unformatted text preview: For exclusive use NMIMS, 2015 KEL663 JAMES B. SHEIN At Ford, Turnaround Is Job One
When Alan Mulally became CEO of Ford Motor Company in September 2006, the company
was bleeding red ink. All of its brands were losing money. Ford’s U.S. market share had been in
freefall for more than ten years, dropping since 1995 from 25 to 16.8 percent and leaving the
company with its smallest market share since 1920. Total losses for 2006 were estimated at $8
billion.
Ford was losing ground domestically and internationally. General Motors’ (GM) Chevrolet
brand had overtaken Ford to become the number-one U.S. brand. Toyota had surpassed Ford to
become the second-largest automaker in the world behind GM (by early 2007, Toyota would
become number one, pushing Ford to third place).
As recently as fall 2000, Ford’s shares paid a quarterly dividend of $0.50, but by the time
Mulally accepted the job, it had been reduced four times and stood at $0.05. During the few
weeks before he actually started, the dividend was suspended.
In some ways, Mulally was a surprising choice. He was a thirty-seven-year veteran of
Boeing, and there was no precedent for bringing an outsider into the insular world of automaking.
Still, Mulally’s hiring was widely seen as a good decision. Analysts pointed out numerous
similarities between Boeing and Ford. Both were subject to global competition, complex
regulations, and fast-changing technologies. Both had a unionized workforce. In both the auto and
aviation industries, designing and introducing new models took years (in fact, nearly every new
vehicle Ford rolled out in the two years following Mulally’s arrival was approved before he
began his Ford career).
Perhaps most importantly, as head of Boeing’s commercial airplane division Mulally had led
a successful turnaround effort. The company had been losing market share to archrival Airbus,
struggling with inefficiencies, and dealing with diminished public perceptions about the
company. An airline industry downturn brought on by the 9/11 terrorist attacks had led to a
massive restructuring effort at Boeing in which Mulally cut the workforce from 120,000 to
50,000, reduced the time it took to build an airliner by 50 percent, and introduced the fastestselling new airplane ever.1 When he left Boeing, the company was an example of what could be
accomplished through good leadership and a sharpened focus on product. With Ford in dire need 1

AT FORD, TURNAROUND IS JOB ONE KEL663 of turning itself around, Mulally’s revitalization of Boeing was especially appealing to Ford CEO
William Clay Ford Jr.
But there was also a healthy dose of skepticism as to whether Mulally could keep Ford out of
bankruptcy. Some felt he was brought in too late.2 A Brief History of Ford
Henry Ford Sr. was born in 1863 in Detroit. He was an engineer, first by hobby and then,
beginning in 1890, by profession. While working for the Detroit Edison Company, he used his
free time to build experimental gasoline engines, eventually building a gasoline-powered buggy.
By 1899 his superiors thought his hobby was becoming a distraction and they forced him out.
Shortly thereafter, Ford founded the Detroit Automobile Company, but left over disputes with
colleagues who did not share his vision for faster production of lower-margin vehicles.
In June 1903 he founded Ford Motor Company to pursue his vision. The company quickly
became famous for making cars for the masses.
Ford introduced the Model T in 1908 and over the course of eighteen years went on to sell
nearly 15.5 million units with help from the moving automobile assembly line he invented in
1913. An important key to the Model T’s success was Ford’s commitment to manufacturing
simplicity, exemplified by his famous statement: “A customer can have a car painted any color
that he wants, so long as it is black.”
The Model T ran into its first serious competition in 1926 when GM introduced the more
powerful and stylish Chevrolet automobile. Ford discontinued the Model T in May 1927.
Henry Ford Sr.’s son, Edsel, became company president in 1918 and led the business until his
death from cancer at age forty-nine in 1943. Ford Sr. then resumed his leadership of the company
but quickly began grooming Edsel’s son, Henry II, to take over, which he did in 1945.
Over time, Ford acquired partial or full ownership of numerous other brands, including
Mazda, Aston Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover, and Volvo.
William Clay Ford Jr. took over as chairman and CEO at the end of 2001. That year, the
company lost nearly $5 billion. The company was suffering from poor employee morale, quality
issues, sluggish sales, and intense competition.3 It was also reeling from tire problems with its
Explorer SUV, which caused numerous accidents and led the company to take a $2.1 billion
charge to replace all Explorer tires.
In 2002 Bill Ford launched a major effort to revitalize the company, divesting several
noncore companies, lowering costs, and launching “the biggest wave of new products in our 2

KEL663 AT FORD, TURNAROUND IS JOB ONE history.”4 He noted the challenges of full-scale global competition and acknowledged that the
days of unlimited, inexpensive gasoline were gone forever.
In January 2006, when the company was still losing market share, it launched a new
turnaround effort dubbed “The Way Forward,” which was the first fundamental restructuring of
the company. But before this effort was even a year old, he realized new leadership was needed
and he persuaded Mulally to take the job. The Decline of a Once-Great Brand
Despite its long-used motto, “Quality Is Job One,” by the time Mulally came on board, Ford
had dug itself into a rut of churning out poor-quality, uninteresting vehicles. One such example
was the Ford Focus, a subcompact introduced in 2000 as a car for the thirty-five-and-under set
and heavily promoted for its driving pleasure. It was recalled no less than nine times to fix a host
of safety and quality issues.5 Ford’s attempt at succeeding in the minivan market failed miserably
with its Windstar and Freestar, which suffered from self-inflicted wounds of poor quality and low
safety ratings.
In terms of design aesthetics, for a painfully honest critique one had to look no further than
Ford’s own Mark Fields, head of the North America division. In 2006 he told one interviewer that
some of the company’s products had been so bland that “the only way you’d recognize them is if
they ran over you.”6
Despite its founding on the principles of simplicity, Ford had become extremely complex,
with numerous vehicle platforms and countless vehicle configurations; each region, division, and
brand running independently; and a corporate culture in which people hesitated to deliver bad
news. That last shortcoming went a long way toward explaining why overly aggressive sales
forecasts had become the norm, which resulted in consistent excess capacity at Ford’s
manufacturing plants through the 2000s.
Ford’s market share continued to erode under intense competition, especially from Toyota
and Honda. Its financials also deteriorated through 2006. (See Exhibit 1 through Exhibit 3.)
Ford, like its domestic competitors, had become heavily dependent on sales of its highmargin trucks and SUVs. Such vehicles had been generating $6,000 to $10,000 of profit per unit,
while passenger car sales had been a mostly break-even proposition, and small cars were sold at a
loss.7
That dependence on high-margin, big vehicles left each of Detroit’s automakers woefully
unprepared for rising fuel prices, which hit $4 per gallon in 2008, and the resulting change in
consumer preferences toward smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles. 4 Ford 2005 Annual Report, p. 2.

AT FORD, TURNAROUND IS JOB ONE KEL663 That same year also marked the start of a multiyear recession. With tighter credit, consumers
had a harder time financing new car purchases. A rising level of unemployment along with
feelings of insecurity among those who had jobs brought a wave of frugality to the country, with
people hanging onto their cars longer. A 2009 survey by Consumer Reports found that half of
respondents had delayed the purchase of a new vehicle, with 30 percent citing concerns about the
weak economy.8 (See Exhibit 4.) Previous Turnaround Attempts
When Mulally took over, Bill Ford was in the midst of his second turnaround effort. His 2002
restructuring included a major downsizing, with 20,000 job cuts and numerous plant closings.
Asked why another, much larger restructuring effort was needed just four years later, Ford
president and chief operating officer Jim Padilla said the mistake with the 2002 restructuring was
that Ford thought it was in the midst of a normal cycle of industry ups and downs, when what was
really happening was a fundamental shift in the very nature of the market.9 The company needed
to figure out how to profitably manufacture and sell smaller vehicles. There was no attempt to
change strategy before downsizing.
Ford’s 2006 restructuring, “The Way Forward,” included cutting another 30,000 jobs and
idling fourteen plants worldwide by 2012.10 Analysts felt that Ford was beginning to recognize
the need to change every aspect of the company. But before long Bill Ford realized that its
corporate culture was blocking changes throughout the company, and therefore new leadership
was required.
Even before the 2002 restructuring, Ford had tried to make sweeping operational changes,
such as cutting vehicle development costs, by engineering a car once to serve multiple markets
worldwide and trying to operate as one company rather than as a collection of regional
companies. But these prior efforts failed, in large part because the company’s executives and
managers resisted the pressure to give up their turf. The Turnaround Tripod
Strategy
Shortly after becoming CEO, Mulally reengineered the turnaround effort he inherited and
rebranded it as “One Ford.” That stood for One Team, One Plan, One Goal. The new plan was
built on the themes of focus and simplification.
Before slashing costs, Mulally considered what Ford’s strategy should be. He put a laser
focus on the Ford and Lincoln brands, divested its other brands, and launched a full family of 8

KEL663 AT FORD, TURNAROUND IS JOB ONE Ford vehicles aimed at moving the company away from its dependence on trucks and SUVs. His
goal was to make each model the best in its class in terms of quality, fuel efficiency, safety, smart
design, and value.
The company’s focus on fuel efficiency led it to develop the EcoBoost engine that generated
up to 20 percent better fuel efficiency. The company also began producing hybrid vehicles and
made plans to introduce electric vehicles in the near future.
To help make money from smaller vehicles, Ford created packages of high-margin, musthave options, such as high-tech “infotainment” features. Its Sync infotainment suite, which
enabled drivers to control stereos, smart phones, seat controls, and more with a voice command–
operated system,11 added $400 to a vehicle’s sticker price while costing the company less than
$30.12 Not only did Sync help grow Ford’s margins, but it helped enhance the company’s image
as well. In a 2010 survey, 80 percent of potential customers said Sync improved their overall
image of Ford and 70 percent said it made them more likely to buy a Ford. Operations
An important aspect of Mulally’s turnaround plan was improved manufacturing productivity,
which brought manufacturing capacity in line with consumer demand. That required paring its
workforce from 122,400 in 2006 to 72,600 at the end of 2009 and closing twelve North American
manufacturing plants. The company planned to close four more plants by 2011.
Another key aspect of manufacturing productivity was a greatly simplified product lineup.
Under Mulally’s leadership, Ford reduced the number of platforms (chassis) it used to build
vehicles from twenty to eight, and the number of vehicle models it produced from ninety-seven in
2006 to forty-five in 2010. The company’s intention was to eventually offer as few as twenty to
twenty-five vehicle models. Mulally had done something similar at Boeing, where he reduced the
number of aircraft models from fourteen to four.13
The number of configurations available for each model was reduced as well. When Ford
introduced its newest Explorer in July 2010, it was offered in 1,500 different configurations—
down from a whopping 76,000 configurations just two years earlier.
Ford’s simplified product line-up resulted in far greater “parts commonality,” meaning that
the same or similar vehicles built in different countries used the same parts. In late 2010, for
example, Mulally said 80 percent of the 2011 Ford Focus’s parts would be the same no matter
where it was built.14 Greater parts commonality also enabled the company to reduce its global
suppliers from 3,300 in 2004 to 1,600 at the end of 2009. Ultimately, the company had a goal of
reducing that number to 750.15 11 John Rosevear, “Ford Just Keeps Rolling,” The Motley Fool, July 23, 2010, http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2010/07/23

AT FORD, TURNAROUND IS JOB ONE KEL663 Financials
Within ninety days of becoming Ford’s CEO, Mulally appeared before a room full of bankers
and raised $23.6 billion—enough money to stave off bankruptcy, fund the company’s turnaround,
and protect against an economic downturn that he sensed was looming. He mortgaged all of the
company’s assets to raise the money, including the company’s iconic brand logo.16
Still, two years later, in November 2008, Mulally joined his Detroit counterparts in
Washington, D.C., to lobby the federal government for a bailout. They were rebuffed—even
scolded—for showing up in private jets. A month later the three leaders returned, each driving a
fuel-efficient company car, and this time the reception was warmer.
GM and Chrysler were in danger of going out of business by the end of the year. Ford’s
position was much stronger thanks to the private funding raised by Mulally, and he said he never
intended to use government money. He appeared before Congress, he explained, mostly to
support the other automakers but also to appeal to government leaders just in case the economy
worsened and Ford needed the money in the future. A week after that meeting he declared that
Ford would forgo government funds.17
Both GM and Chrysler ended up receiving billions in government loans. Ford’s ability to
survive without the government’s assistance helped Ford distinguish itself from its cross-town
rivals, improving its reputation and increasing its brand equity.
Ford’s turnaround also required concessions from the UAW, which it won, including a
reduction in salaried benefits.18 Concessions from the UAW in 2007 and 2009 were estimated to
save the company $500 million per year.
Ford’s revitalized cost structure helped it hold down incentives, which raised its profit
margins. (See Exhibit 5.) The Leadership Factor
Ford’s success was about more than a revitalized product line, better manufacturing
efficiency, and fundraising. There was a distinct leadership difference, starting at the board level.
The company’s board deserved credit for bringing in fresh leadership. While GM’s board
stuck with Rick Wagoner, Ford recognized the need for a new perspective and brought in
Mulally. Even Bill Ford admitted that the company’s leaders, himself included, had become
cautious. He had confidence that Mulally would put a business framework in place that would
liberate people to pull off bolder designs.19 16

KEL663 AT FORD, TURNAROUND IS JOB ONE Mulally’s teambuilding and communication skills went a long way toward reconnecting
employees with the pride of the once-great company, which resulted in a much-needed boost in
morale.
Recognizing that it takes time to bring about sweeping changes in the auto industry, one of
Mulally’s first moves was to line up enough financing to bring his vision to fruition. The New
York Times declared, “Ford’s decision to borrow billions in 2006 when the capital markets were
thriving will go down as one of the most significant moves in the company’s 105-year history.”20
In 2007 he sold Jaguar, Land Rover, Volvo, and Aston Martin, and reduced the company’s
stake in Mazda.
One of his other top priorities was to stop inflated sales forecasts. In an early interview, he
said, “Turnarounds of this magnitude succeed when capacity and costs are aligned with a realistic
expectation of demand.”21
But he recognized that the company’s survival depended on much more than the cost
structure. Ford needed to revitalize its product offerings and public perceptions.
Mulally fostered a culture of transparency, demanding that the company deal with the reality
of the situation. For instance, every Thursday at 7:00 a.m. (a tradition he had started at Boeing),
Mulally conducted a two-and-a-half-hour business plan review (BPR) with his eighteen direct
reports. Everyone gave a status update on his or her function’s contribution to the turnaround and
its performance against corporate profit targets. Some three hundred PowerPoint slides containing
key performance metrics were reviewed. The purpose was not to highlight successes but to
provide accurate reports. There had been a strong history of resistance against bad news.22
At these meetings, participants were required to pay attention—no cell phones, Blackberrys,
or side conversations. Candor was expected as data and then more data were reviewed. No one
was punished for bringing bad news to the table.23 In fact, when one manager detailed the poor
performance of his unit, some Ford executives were stunned by Mulally’s applause and his
encouragement, telling the bearer of bad news, “Great visibility.”24
The fact that Mulally was not a “car guy” allowed him to ask innocent questions. In one early
meeting in his office, he laid out twelve different metal rods that Ford used to hold up a vehicle’s
hood. He wanted to demonstrate to managers that this kind of variation was costly and did not
matter to consumers.
In order to familiarize himself with the Ford product, Mulally began driving a different Ford
vehicle to and from work each day. In the predawn darkness one morning, he got into a Mercury
Milan and reached for the light switch, but it was not where he expected it to be. He had to get
out of the car and turn on the lights in his garage to find it. Another time, in a Ford Escape, he hit

AT FORD, TURNAROUND IS JOB ONE KEL663 what he had learned to be the light switch, but the windshield wipers came on. He found that the
wipers and lights were in still different positions in a Mustang.
After complaining to Americas product head Derrick Kuzak, Mulally learned that Ford had a
longstanding practice of each product line operating independently, which resulted in
differentiation in a bid to produce a “unique car.” Mulally’s response: “World-class companies do
not operate this way.”
Kuzak soon began creating a “Ford feel” for all its vehicles. “When you get into a Ford
vehicle blindfolded, you should know immediately it’s a Ford by the feel,” Kuzak said.25 Leadership at the Competition
GM While Ford recognized the need for new leadership, it took the U.S. government to help GM
see the need for a new CEO, pushing out Rick Wagoner in early 2009. Steven Rattner, who led
the government’s efforts to restructure GM and Chrysler, branded Wagoner as “aloof and in
denial” and “living in a fantasy that [GM] was still the greatest carmaker on earth.”26
Wagoner was replaced by fellow GM insider Fritz Henderson, who lasted only until the end
of 2009, when former AT&T CEO Ed Whitacre replaced him. Named to lead the company after it
emerged from bankruptcy, Whitacre was seen as a good choice, having taken regional phone
company Southwestern Bell through more than a dozen mergers and acquisitions and turning it
into the AT&T of today. But Whitacre made it clear he was taking the GM position only until the
company was on the road to profitability.
In August 2010, with GM poised for an initial public offering designed to help pay back the
billions borrowed from the government, Whitacre declared his mission complete and stepped
down. Dan Akerson, a managing director at buyout shop Carlyle Group and a GM board member
since 2009, replaced him.
It is difficult to compare Mulally’s leadership style with that of GM’s leader, because GM
had four CEOs in a span of just eighteen months. But it is safe to say that GM was slower to
respond to changing market conditions than Ford. While Ford became focused on the Ford brand,
GM steadfastly held onto its eight brands and its various corporate fiefdoms. It took the
company’s bankruptcy filing to motivate it to shed Saturn, Hummer, Pontiac, and Saab.
TOYOTA While Ford, GM, and Chrysler were all losing sales even before the recession took hold in
2008, Toyota’s sales were rising. A relentless focus on quality led to rapid growth, but before
long Toyota put sales growth ahead of quality. Senior management became intent on becoming
the global sales leader.27 25 Ibid.

KEL663 AT FORD, TURNAROUND IS JOB ONE The company’s rapid growth “sparked tremendous internal concerns about quality-control
problems,”28 and in late 2009 those fears were realized. Just after Toyota surpassed GM to
become the world’s largest automaker, its hard-earned reputation for quality crumbled when
previously denied problems with sticking gas pedals emerged, leading to numerous recalls. In late
January 2010, the company suspended sales of eight recalled vehicles to address the accelerator
pedal problem. By the end of 2010, the company had recalled 8.5 million cars and trucks for a
host of safety, quality, and reliability problems, including a brake malfunction in its muchheralded Prius hybrid.
In the wake of its problems, the company lengthened product development lead times by
several months to allow more time for testing and reduced the number of engine and key feature
variations to simplify engineering.
While Toyota ended 2010 with a global sales increase of 8 percent, it was the only automaker
to report lower sales in the United States, Toyota’s largest market. The company’s share of the
U.S. market fell to 15.2 percent from 17 percent in 2009.29 Toyota’s U.S. deliveries slipped 0.4
percent compared with overall industry growth of 11.1 percent.30
Toyota’s problems could not have come at a better time for Ford.
CHRYSLER Chrysler had a revolving door not only to its CEO’s office, but to its owner’s office as well.
German-based Daimler-Benz purchased the company in 1998, creating the combined entity
DaimlerChrysler AG. But in 2007 DaimlerChrysler sold Chrysler to the U.S. private equity firm
Cerberus Capital Management. In that same year, as part of Chrysler’s bankruptcy process, Fiat
acquired a stake in the company.
Former Home Depot CEO Robert Nardelli was brought in to run Chrysler in 2007, the same
person who did so much damage to Home Depot and got more than $100 million in severence.
Then came Robert Kidder, who was hired to take the reins after the company came out of
bankruptcy. He was succeeded by Fiat’s CEO, the Italian lawyer-accountant Sergio Marchionne.
The newly configured company planned to sell Fiats through Chrysler’s dealer network,
while using its fuel-efficient engine technology to help Chrysler gain market share.
SUPPLIERS Mulally realized that many of the industry’s suppliers were struggling to stay in business; a
number of them were approaching bankruptcy. Without parts, Ford was out of business as well.
Under the direction of Tony Brown, Ford vice president of global purchasing, crossfunctional teams were set up to monitor parts manufacturers. Human relations could assign Ford
operating employees to suppliers, Ford treasury could help with loans, and the legal department

AT FORD, TURNAROUND IS JOB ONE KEL663 could help with contract issues.31 Much of the work had to be secret, especially if a supplier was
to be abandoned after a model run ended. That supplier had to survive until Ford no longer
needed parts from it. Some Steps Backward and Then Some Bold Steps Forward
Between 2006 and 2008 Ford lost more than $30 billion, just as the skeptics had argued when
Mulally was hired. It took a while for an automaker’s changes, such as the design and launch of
new models, to impact the company’s performance.
The light at the end of the tunnel started to appear in June 2007 when Ford made its way into
the top ten of J. D. Power & Associates’ annual Initial Quality Study, a measure of customer
complaints in the first ninety days of vehicle ownership. In summer 2009 Ford earned its highest
quality rankings ever, beating Toyota and Honda for the first time.32 And in June 2010 Ford broke
into the top five.
Meanwhile, Toyota fell all the way to twenty-first place in 2010, its lowest ranking since the
survey was launched in 1987; its rapid fall resulted from its numerous safety-related recalls.
Ford also won Motor Trend magazine’s 2010 Car of the Year and Truck of the Year awards
for its Fusion Hybrid and Transit Connect, respectively. Ford’s quality, style, and fuel-economy
improvements caught the eye of more than just industry watchers. They translated into strong
sales, with Ford’s market share gaining 1.9 percentage points from the end of 2008 to summer
2010, climbing to a respectable 17.3 percent.
Automobile Magazine named Mulally its 2010 Man of the Year, describing him as “living
proof that a single, extraordinary leader with vision and determination really can make all the
difference in an organization.”33 31 Bryce G. Hoffman, “Inside Ford’s Fight to Avoid Disaster,” Wall Street Journal, March 9, 2012.
