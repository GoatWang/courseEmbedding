                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch Rates AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust 2015-3 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Rates AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust 2015-3
    





August 13, 2015 12:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to AmeriCredit Automobile 
      Receivables Trust 2015-3 (2015-3):
    

      --$230,000,000 Class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$199,740,000 Class A-2-A notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$199,730,000 Class A-2-B notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$225,130,000 Class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$92,070,000 Class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$114,280,000 Class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$112,390,000 Class D notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Consistent Credit Quality: The 2015-3 pool displays consistent credit 
      quality relative to recent pools based on the weighted average (WA) Fair 
      Isaac Corp. (FICO) score and internal credit tiers. Extended term 
      contracts (over 60-month loan terms) continue to account for the 
      majority of the pool at 92%. New vehicles total 48% of the pool, 
      consistent with prior AMCAR transactions.
    

      Consistent Credit Enhancement (CE): The cash flow distribution is a 
      sequential-pay structure. Initial hard CE is consistent with recent 
      transactions. The reserve is 2.00% (nondeclining), and initial 
      overcollateralization (OC) is 5.50% growing to 14.50% target of the 
      outstanding pool balance (less the required reserve amount for the 
      distributing period). Excess spread has decreased to approximately 8% 
      per annum.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses on GM Financial's 
      managed portfolio and securitizations are stable and relatively low, 
      supported by the gradual economic recovery and stable used vehicle 
      values. The cumulative base case loss proxy for this pool is 11.10%.
    

      Solid Corporate Health: Fitch rates GM and GM Financial Company Inc., 
      'BBB-'/Outlook Stable. The recent corporate upgrade reflects the ongoing 
      fundamental improvement in the company's core business over the past 
      several years.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: AFSI demonstrates 
      adequate abilities as originator, underwriter, and servicer, as 
      evidenced by historical portfolio and securitization performance. Fitch 
      deems AFSI capable of adequately servicing 2015-3.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of GM Financial would not impair the 
      timeliness of payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to each class of 
      AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust 2015-3 to increased losses over 
      the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that each class of 
      notes displays some sensitivity to increased defaults and losses, with 
      some classes showing potential downgrades of up to one rating categories 
      under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. Some classes of 
      notes could experience downgrades of more than two rating categories 
      under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from 
      Deliotte & Touche LLP. The third-party due diligence provided was on 
      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation with respect to 200 sample loan contracts all selected 
      randomly and 20 automobile loan characteristics. Fitch considered this 
      information in its analysis and the findings did not have any impact on 
      our analysis. A copy of the ASB Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch 
      in connection with this transaction may be obtained through the link 
      contained on the bottom of the related rating action commentary.

      the asset class as detailed in Fitch's June 12, 2015 special report, 
      'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in the Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions'.

      Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to AmeriCredit Automobile 
      Receivables Trust 2015-3 (2015-3):
    

      --$230,000,000 Class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$199,740,000 Class A-2-A notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$199,730,000 Class A-2-B notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$225,130,000 Class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$92,070,000 Class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$114,280,000 Class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$112,390,000 Class D notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Consistent Credit Quality: The 2015-3 pool displays consistent credit 
      quality relative to recent pools based on the weighted average (WA) Fair 
      Isaac Corp. (FICO) score and internal credit tiers. Extended term 
      contracts (over 60-month loan terms) continue to account for the 
      majority of the pool at 92%. New vehicles total 48% of the pool, 
      consistent with prior AMCAR transactions.
    

      Consistent Credit Enhancement (CE): The cash flow distribution is a 
      sequential-pay structure. Initial hard CE is consistent with recent 
      transactions. The reserve is 2.00% (nondeclining), and initial 
      overcollateralization (OC) is 5.50% growing to 14.50% target of the 
      outstanding pool balance (less the required reserve amount for the 
      distributing period). Excess spread has decreased to approximately 8% 
      per annum.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses on GM Financial's 
      managed portfolio and securitizations are stable and relatively low, 
      supported by the gradual economic recovery and stable used vehicle 
      values. The cumulative base case loss proxy for this pool is 11.10%.
    

      Solid Corporate Health: Fitch rates GM and GM Financial Company Inc., 
      'BBB-'/Outlook Stable. The recent corporate upgrade reflects the ongoing 
      fundamental improvement in the company's core business over the past 
      several years.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: AFSI demonstrates 
      adequate abilities as originator, underwriter, and servicer, as 
      evidenced by historical portfolio and securitization performance. Fitch 
      deems AFSI capable of adequately servicing 2015-3.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of GM Financial would not impair the 
      timeliness of payments on the securities.

(FICO) score of 576 and internal credit scores. Obligors with FICOs greater than 600 represent over 30% of the pool, up from AMCAR transactions issued prior to 2016.Increased Extended-Term Contracts: 60+ month contracts total 92.5% of the pool, consistent with recent transactions. 73-75 month contracts total 3.6%, up slightly from 2016-3. Performance data for these contracts are limited due to lack of seasoning. However, GMF offered the 73-75 month loans in this pool to obligors with stronger credit metrics. Given this fact and the small concentration in the pool, Fitch did not apply an additional stress to these loans.Sufficient Credit Enhancement: Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) is consistent with 2016-3, totalling 35.20%, 27.95%, 18.95% and 10.10% for classes A, B, C and D, respectively. Excess spread is slightly higher than 2016-3 due to the higher WA APR of the pool.Stable Performance: Losses on GMF's managed portfolio and securitizations have been stable and relatively low, supported by the currently stable economy and healthy used vehicle values. Contrary to other nonprime lenders, recent vintage performance has not exhibited any notable weakness, with losses remaining stable for the 2013-2015 vintages to date. The cumulative net loss proxy for 2016-4 is 11.10%, down from 11.35% in 2016-3.Improving Corporate Health: Fitch rates GM and GMF 'BBB-' with a Positive Rating Outlook. The recent affirmation and Rating Outlook revision to Positive reflect the ongoing fundamental improvement in the company's core business over the past several years.Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: AFSI demonstrates adequate abilities as originator, underwriter and servicer as evidenced by historical portfolio and securitization performance. Fitch deems AFSI capable of adequately servicing the transaction.Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of GMF would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities.RATING SENSITIVITIESUnanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case. This in turn could result in Fitch taking negative rating actions on the notes.Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust 2016-4 to increased credit losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the transaction displays some sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses. This shows a potential downgrade of two categories under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario, especially for the subordinate bonds. The notes could experience downgrades of three or more rating categories, potentially leading to distressed ratings (below 'Bsf'), or possibly default, under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10Fitch was provided with Form ABS Due Diligence-15E (Form 15E) as prepared by Deloitte and Touche, LLP. The third-party due diligence described in Form 15E focused on comparing or recomputing certain information with respect to 225 loans from the statistical data file. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the findings did not have an impact on our analysis/conclusions. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of this rating action commentary.REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMSA description of the transaction's representations, warranties and enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering document and which relate to the underlying asset pool is available by accessing the appendix referenced under 'Related Research' below. The appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es to those Fitch considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special Report titled 'Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions,' dated May 31, 2016.Read MoreAdditional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.Applicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 01 Sep 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/886006Criteria for Interest Rate Stresses in Structured Finance Transactions and Covered Bonds (pub. 17 May 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/879815Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/883130Rating Criteria for U.S. Auto Loan ABS (pub. 21 Mar 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/878723Related ResearchAmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust 2016-4 - Appendixhttps://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/888279Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1013070ABS Due Diligence Form 15E 1https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf15E_frame.cfm?pr_id=1013070&flm_nm=15e_1013070_1.pdfSolicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1013070Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/regulatoryALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

Telephone: 1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.

Fitch Expects to Rate AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust 2016-4; Issues Presale
Tweet


Print



      Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings and Rating 
      Outlooks to the AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust 2016-4 (AMCAR 
      2016-4) as follows:
    

      --$164,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$363,000,000 classes A-2-A/B notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$199,880,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$78,890,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$97,930,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$96,300,000 class D notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      Fitch does not expect to rate the class E notes.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Consistent Credit Quality: The 2016-4 pool displays consistent credit 
      quality relative to recent pools based on the weighted average (WA) Fair 
      Isaac Corp. (FICO) score of 576 and internal credit scores. Obligors 
      with FICOs greater than 600 represent over 30% of the pool, up from 
      AMCAR transactions issued prior to 2016.
    

      Increased Extended-Term Contracts: 60+ month contracts total 92.4% of 
      the pool, consistent with recent transactions. 73-75 month contracts 
      total 3.3%, up slightly from 2016-3.
    

      Performance data for these contracts are limited due to lack of 
      seasoning. However, GMF offered the 73-75 month loans in this pool to 
      obligors with stronger credit metrics. Given this fact and the small 
      concentration in the pool, Fitch did not apply an additional stress to 
      these loans.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement: Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) is 
      consistent with 2016-3, totaling 35.20%, 27.95%, 18.95% and 10.10% for 
      classes A, B, C and D, respectively. Excess spread is expected to be 
      slightly higher than 2016-3 due to the higher WA annual percentage rate 
      (APR) of the pool.
    

      Stable Performance: Losses on GMF's managed portfolio and 
      securitizations have been stable and relatively low, supported by the 
      currently stable economy and healthy used vehicle values. Contrary to 
      other nonprime lenders, recent vintage performance has not exhibited any 
      notable weakness, with losses remaining stable for the 2013-2015 
      vintages to date. The cumulative net loss proxy for 2016-4 is 11.10%, 
      down from 11.35% in 2016-3.
    

      Improving Corporate Health: Fitch rates GM and GMF 'BBB-' with a 
      Positive Rating Outlook. The recent affirmation and Rating Outlook 
      revision to Positive reflect the ongoing fundamental improvement in the 
      company's core business over the past several years.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: AFSI demonstrates 
      adequate abilities as originator, underwriter and servicer as evidenced 
      by historical portfolio and securitization performance. Fitch deems AFSI 
      capable of adequately servicing the transaction.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of GMF would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This in turn could result in Fitch taking negative rating actions 
      on the notes.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to AmeriCredit 
      Automobile Receivables Trust 2016-4 to increased credit losses over the 
      life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the transaction 
      displays some sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses. This 
      shows a potential downgrade of two categories under Fitch's moderate 
      (1.5x base case loss) scenario, especially for the subordinate bonds. 
      The notes could experience downgrades of three or more rating 
      categories, potentially leading to distressed ratings (below 'Bsf'), or 
      possibly default, under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      Fitch was provided with Form ABS Due Diligence-15E ("Form 15E") as 
      prepared by Deloitte and Touche, LLP. The third-party due diligence 
      described in Form 15E focused on comparing or recomputing certain 
      information with respect to 225 loans from the statistical data file. 
      Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the findings did 
      not have an impact on our analysis/conclusions. A copy of the ABS Due 
      Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction 
      may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of this rating 
      action commentary.
    

      REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS
    

      A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and 
      enforcement mechanisms ("RW&Es") that are disclosed in the offering 
      document and which relate to the underlying asset pool is available by 
      accessing the appendix referenced under "Related Research" below. The 
      appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es to those Fitch 
      considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special Report 
      titled 'Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions,' dated May 31, 2016.

      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may
