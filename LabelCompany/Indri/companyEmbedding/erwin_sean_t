By using data models to define and deploy your enterprise data standards, you’ll realize more consistency and higher quality in data management.






 New White Paper! 




Learn why data is the driving force for business success in our digital age, including why enterprise and process architects should care.










erwin DM Standard Edition
erwin DM is available in three different editions to meet specific customer needs. erwin DM Standard Edition is our flagship data modeling solution for creating and deploying visual data models for hybrid data infrastructures. Users automatically generate data models with a simple, graphical display to visualize a wide range of enterprise data sources. Increase quality and efficiency with reusable standards, including model templates, domains, automation macros, naming standards and datatype standards. 










erwin DM Workgroup Edition
erwin DM Workgroup Edition offers the same functionality as erwin DM Standard Edition, plus a centralized model management repository, collaborative modeling with conflict resolution, and change management with audit capabilities. It is ideal for teams with multiple members who are working on models simultaneously and/or that need change management functionality.











erwin DM Navigator Edition
erwin DM Navigator Edition provides read-only access to erwin data models and metadata. It provides discovery, visualization and analysis capabilities for various roles within the organization who need to view specific information but don’t need to create or change data models.











Extracting Data from ERP, CRM and Other Enterprise Apps
ERP, CRM and other enterprise systems are complex and use proprietary formats difficult to integrate with other data sources. erwin Safyr Option for ERP extracts and converts data from these systems for accurate modeling and analysis with erwin DM. With this tool, you also can consolidate duplicate systems and reduce license costs in response to M&A activity or general cost-cutting.

Frequently Asked Questions


How is erwin DM Workgroup Edition different from erwin DM Standard Edition?

erwin DM Workgroup Edition has the same functionality as erwin DM Standard Edition, plus collaborative modeling support and change management and audit capabilities. If you’re not sure which edition is right for you, ask yourself: 
- Do you need support for multiple data modelers to simultaneously access your data models? If yes, then erwin DM Workgroup Edition is the best fit. 
- Do you need change management and audit capabilities? If yes, then choose erwin DM Workgroup Edition.

Do I need to buy an erwin license for each database platform that I support?

No, you don’t need to buy a new erwin license for each database environment that you support. erwin DM supports all database environments, which makes it very cost-effective. You can also use erwin DM to change a database target for an existing database, and it will swap the underlying metadata into a new environment – again, no additional erwin DM license is required to do this.

Does erwin DM only support traditional relational databases?

No, erwin DM supports any type of database including relational, cloud, big data and NoSQL. This is part of our Any2 approach, meaning we support any data, whether it’s structured or unstructured, anywhere it’s stored. And you only need one erwin DM license to support all these environments and to create conceptual, logical, physical or dimensional models – so it’s cost-effective.

I need to give a wide range of stakeholders access to our data models. How can I do that easily?

erwin Web Portal is a Web-based collaboration platform for sharing your data models and metadata with technical and business users. It works with the erwin DM products to support collaboration across your organization.

I’m concerned about data governance and making sure our data is trustworthy.  How can I ensure our data assets are consistent and of the highest quality?

erwin Data Governance helps you build better data governance through enterprise standards, including naming standards, data type standards, model templates and more. 
It works with the erwin DM products to support your enterprise data governance program.

Which ERP, CRM and other enterprise applications does erwin Safyr Option for ERP support?

erwin Safyr Option for ERP supports data model creation and metadata management for these applications out of the box:
- SAP
- SAP Business Warehouse (BW)*
- SAP S/4HANA
- Microsoft Dynamics AZ 2012
- Salesforce
- Oracle E-Business Suite
- Oracle PeopleSoft Enterprise applications
- Oracle J.D. Edwards EnterpriseOne
- Oracle Siebel

If your application isn’t on this list, we can analyze it to determine if it can be supported using a services-based approach.

erwin DM Standard Edition
erwin DM is available in three different editions to meet specific customer needs. erwin DM Standard Edition is our flagship data modeling solution for creating and deploying visual data models for hybrid data infrastructures. Users automatically generate data models with a simple, graphical display to visualize a wide range of enterprise data sources. Increase quality and efficiency with reusable standards, including model templates, domains, automation macros, naming standards and datatype standards. 










erwin DM Workgroup Edition
erwin DM Workgroup Edition offers the same functionality as erwin DM Standard Edition, plus a centralized model management repository, collaborative modeling with conflict resolution, and change management with audit capabilities. It is ideal for teams with multiple members who are working on models simultaneously and/or that need change management functionality.

Frequently Asked Questions


How is erwin DM Workgroup Edition different from erwin DM Standard Edition?

erwin DM Workgroup Edition has the same functionality as erwin DM Standard Edition, plus collaborative modeling support and change management and audit capabilities. If you’re not sure which edition is right for you, ask yourself: 
- Do you need support for multiple data modelers to simultaneously access your data models? If yes, then erwin DM Workgroup Edition is the best fit. 
- Do you need change management and audit capabilities? If yes, then choose erwin DM Workgroup Edition.

Do I need to buy an erwin license for each database platform that I support?

No, you don’t need to buy a new erwin license for each database environment that you support. erwin DM supports all database environments, which makes it very cost-effective. You can also use erwin DM to change a database target for an existing database, and it will swap the underlying metadata into a new environment – again, no additional erwin DM license is required to do this.

Does erwin DM only support traditional relational databases?

No, erwin DM supports any type of database including relational, cloud, big data and NoSQL. This is part of our Any2 approach, meaning we support any data, whether it’s structured or unstructured, anywhere it’s stored. And you only need one erwin DM license to support all these environments and to create conceptual, logical, physical or dimensional models – so it’s cost-effective.

I need to give a wide range of stakeholders access to our data models. How can I do that easily?

erwin Web Portal is a Web-based collaboration platform for sharing your data models and metadata with technical and business users. It works with the erwin DM products to support collaboration across your organization.

I’m concerned about data governance and making sure our data is trustworthy.  How can I ensure our data assets are consistent and of the highest quality?

erwin Data Governance helps you build better data governance through enterprise standards, including naming standards, data type standards, model templates and more. 
It works with the erwin DM products to support your enterprise data governance program.

Which ERP, CRM and other enterprise applications does erwin Safyr Option for ERP support?

erwin Safyr Option for ERP supports data model creation and metadata management for these applications out of the box:
- SAP
- SAP Business Warehouse (BW)*
- SAP S/4HANA
- Microsoft Dynamics AZ 2012
- Salesforce
- Oracle E-Business Suite
- Oracle PeopleSoft Enterprise applications
- Oracle J.D. Edwards EnterpriseOne
- Oracle Siebel

If your application isn’t on this list, we can analyze it to determine if it can be supported using a services-based approach.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
