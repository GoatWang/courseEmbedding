Terms of Use


By accessing this web site, you confirm your agreement with and understanding of the following conditions of use without limitation or qualification. Please read these conditions carefully before using this web site. This web site is offered to you conditioned on your acceptance without modification of the terms, conditions, and notices contained herein. Your use of this web site constitutes your agreement to all such terms, conditions, and notices. GoldenTree Asset Management LP ("GoldenTree") reserves the right to, and may at any time, change the terms, conditions and notices under which this web site is offered. You are bound by any such revisions and should therefore periodically visit this page to review the then current terms and conditions to which you are bound. References to GoldenTree shall be deemed to include GoldenTree Asset Management LP and any of its affiliated entities.
Assets Under Management
Total assets, with respect to the structured product portfolios, such as CLOs, include the effects of leverage and available capital to invest. With respect to managed funds and accounts that have “private equity” type terms, assets under management include investors’ committed capital until such time as the applicable investment period has terminated.
No Offer of Securities
The material on this web site does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, advisory services or any securities or any interests in investment funds managed by GoldenTree. Offerings of securities are made only by prospectus or private offering memoranda by persons who are registered, or not required to be registered as broker-dealers or agents in the particular jurisdiction. Such offerings are made, and such investment advisory services are offered, only to persons who are "accredited investors" as defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Responses to any inquiry which may involve rendering of personalized investment advice for compensation effecting or attempting to effect transactions in securities will not be made absent compliance with state broker-dealer, investment advisor, broker-dealer agent or investment advisor representative registration requirements, or applicable exemptions or exclusions from such requirements. This web site is not intended for distribution to or use by any person in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to local law or regulation. GoldenTree makes no representations or warranties that the content of this web site is applicable or appropriate for use in locations outside of the United States of America.
Limitation of Liability
While GoldenTree uses reasonable efforts to include accurate and up to date information on this web site, errors or omissions sometimes occur. All information and content on this web site is furnished "as is" and GoldenTree makes no warranties or representations as to the accuracy of this web site, and makes no other warranty of any kind, implied or expressed. Under no circumstances shall GoldenTree nor any party or person involved in creating, producing, or delivering the web site be liable for any direct, incidental, consequential, indirect, or punitive damages that result from the use of, or the inability to use, the materials on this web site, even if a GoldenTree authorized representative has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
GoldenTree also assumes no responsibility, and shall not be liable for, any damages to, or viruses that may infect, your computer equipment or other property on account of your access to, use of, or browsing in the web site or your downloading of any materials, data, text, images, video, or audio from this web site.
Performance Data
Any performance data quoted on this web site represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. The value of an investment may fall as well as rise. Investor principal is not guaranteed, and investors may not receive the full amount of their principal at the time of redemption if asset values have fallen. Investors should understand that performance results will be reduced by investment advisory fees and other expenses which may be incurred in connection with the account.
GoldenTree defines a distressed asset as an investment in the debt or equity of an issuer that, for reasons that may include operational, financial or market-related stress, has seen its value decline to a level that in its analysis was materially below the fundamental value of the asset.  For debt investments this typically includes securities trading at 75 cents on the dollar or below.
A structured product is a securitization of financial debt instruments ranging from high yield bank loans, student loans, commercial real estate, residential mortgages, auto loans, credit card receivables, trust preferred notes, emerging market debt.

FOR UK RESIDENTS ONLY
The information on this website is issued in the United Kingdom by GoldenTree Asset Management UK LLP (“we”, “us” and “our”). GoldenTree Asset Management UK LLP is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom (the “FCA”).

This website may make reference to a number of other GoldenTree entities, including Golden Tree Asset Management, L.P (“Other Entities”).  Activities carried on by, and the services provided by, Other Entities are not authorised or regulated by the FCA.
Some or all of the information on this website may be a financial promotion for the purposes of the Handbook of Rules and Guidance issued by the FCA (the “FCA Rules”).  Where such information relates to one or more Funds, it is exempt from the restriction in section 238(1) of the FSMA on the communication of an invitation or inducement to participate in a collective investment scheme, on the basis that this document is issued by us only to and/or is directed by us only at persons who are categorised as either professional clients or eligible counterparties (within the meaning of the FCA Rules) in respect of interests in the relevant Fund(s).  The investments and investment services to which the information on this website relates are not available to other persons and such other persons should, therefore, not act or rely on it.  In particular, any investment or service to which the information on this website may related is not intended for retail clients and will not be made available to retail clients.

Commitment to the UK Stewardship Code
Under Rule 2.2.3R of the FCA's Conduct of Business Sourcebook, GoldenTree Asset Management UK LLP (the "Firm") is required to include on this website a disclosure about the nature of its commitment to the UK Financial Reporting Council's Stewardship Code (the "Code") or, where it does not commit to the Code, its alternative investment strategy. The Code is a voluntary code and sets out a number of principles relating to engagement by investors with UK equity issuers. Investors that commit to the Code can either comply with it in full or choose not to comply with aspects of the Code, in which case they are required to explain their non compliance.
GoldenTree Asset Management UK LLP is an absolute return investor focusing on multiple investment strategies with an emphasis on high yield credit. While the Firm may invest in global equities, including UK equities, it is not a significant element in its investment strategies. While the Code is relevant to some aspects of the Firm's trading, and the Firm generally supports the objectives that underlie the Code, GoldenTree Asset Management UK LLP has chosen not to commit to the Code. The Firm invests in a variety of asset classes and in a variety of jurisdictions across Europe. The approach of the Firm in relation to engagement with issuers and their management are determined globally, on a group wide basis. The Firm, along with its U.S. affiliate, takes a global approach to engagement with issuers and their management in all of the jurisdictions in which it invests and, consequently, does not consider it appropriate to commit to any particular voluntary code of practice relating to any individual jurisdiction.

Under Rule 2.2.3R of the FCA's Conduct of Business Sourcebook, GoldenTree Asset Management UK LLP (the "Firm") is required to include on this website a disclosure about the nature of its commitment to the UK Financial Reporting Council's Stewardship Code (the "Code") or, where it does not commit to the Code, its alternative investment strategy. The Code is a voluntary code and sets out a number of principles relating to engagement by investors with UK equity issuers. Investors that commit to the Code can either comply with it in full or choose not to comply with aspects of the Code, in which case they are required to explain their non compliance.
GoldenTree Asset Management UK LLP is an absolute return investor focusing on multiple investment strategies with an emphasis on high yield credit. While the Firm may invest in global equities, including UK equities, it is not a significant element in its investment strategies. While the Code is relevant to some aspects of the Firm's trading, and the Firm generally supports the objectives that underlie the Code, GoldenTree Asset Management UK LLP has chosen not to commit to the Code. The Firm invests in a variety of asset classes and in a variety of jurisdictions across Europe. The approach of the Firm in relation to engagement with issuers and their management are determined globally, on a group wide basis. The Firm, along with its U.S. affiliate, takes a global approach to engagement with issuers and their management in all of the jurisdictions in which it invests and, consequently, does not consider it appropriate to commit to any particular voluntary code of practice relating to any individual jurisdiction.

Assets Under Management
Total assets, with respect to the structured product portfolios, such as CLOs, include the effects of leverage and available capital to invest.

GoldenTree defines a distressed asset as an investment in the debt or equity of an issuer that, for reasons that may include operational, financial or market-related stress, has seen its value decline to a level that in its analysis was materially below the fundamental value of the asset.

It is the responsibility of all persons under whose control or into whose possession the materials on this website come, to inform themselves about and to ensure observance of all applicable provisions of the FSMA in respect of anything done in relation to the Funds referenced herein, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.
For EEA Residents
In relation to member states of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) that have implemented the EU Directive on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (Directive (2011/61/EU)) (“AIFMD”), interests in the funds whose details appear on this website will only be offered or sold to investors in any such member state to the extent that the relevant fund: (i) is permitted to be marketed into the relevant member state pursuant to Article 42 of the AIFMD (as implemented into applicable local law); or (ii) where any marketing, offer and sale of interests of the fund occurs exclusively at the initiative of the relevant investor.
Commitment to the UK Stewardship Code
Under Rule 2.2.3R of the FCA's Conduct of Business Sourcebook, GoldenTree Asset Management UK LLP (the "Firm") is required to include on this website a disclosure about the nature of its commitment to the UK Financial Reporting Council's Stewardship Code (the "Code") or, where it does not commit to the Code, its alternative investment strategy. The Code is a voluntary code and sets out a number of principles relating to engagement by investors with UK equity issuers. Investors that commit to the Code can either comply with it in full or choose not to comply with aspects of the Code, in which case they are required to explain their non compliance.
GoldenTree Asset Management UK LLP is an absolute return investor focusing on multiple investment strategies with an emphasis on high yield credit. While the Firm may invest in global equities, including UK equities, it is not a significant element in its investment strategies. While the Code is relevant to some aspects of the Firm's trading, and the Firm generally supports the objectives that underlie the Code, GoldenTree Asset Management UK LLP has chosen not to commit to the Code. The Firm invests in a variety of asset classes and in a variety of jurisdictions across Europe. The approach of the Firm in relation to engagement with issuers and their management are determined globally, on a group wide basis. The Firm, along with its U.S. affiliate, takes a global approach to engagement with issuers and their management in all of the jurisdictions in which it invests and, consequently, does not consider it appropriate to commit to any particular voluntary code of practice relating to any individual jurisdiction.

References to GoldenTree shall be deemed to include GoldenTree Asset Management LP and any of its affiliated entities.
Assets Under Management
Total assets, with respect to the structured product portfolios, such as CLOs, include the effects of leverage and available capital to invest. With respect to managed funds and accounts that have “private equity” type terms, assets under management include investors’ committed capital until such time as the applicable investment period has terminated.

GoldenTree defines a distressed asset as an investment in the debt or equity of an issuer that, for reasons that may include operational, financial or market-related stress, has seen its value decline to a level that in its analysis was materially below the fundamental value of the asset.  For debt investments this typically includes securities trading at 75 cents on the dollar or below.

FOR UK RESIDENTS ONLY  The information on this website is issued in the United Kingdom by GoldenTree Asset Management UK LLP (“we”, “us” and “our”). GoldenTree Asset Management UK LLP is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom (the “FCA”). The funds whose details are featured on the website (the “Funds”) are unregulated collective investment schemes for the purposes of the UK Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (“FSMA”). This website may make reference to a number of other GoldenTree entities, including Golden Tree Asset Management, L.P (“Other Entities”). Activities carried on by, and the services provided by, Other Entities are not authorised or regulated by the FCA.
Some or all of the information on this website may be a financial promotion for the purposes of the Handbook of Rules and Guidance issued by the FCA (the “FCA Rules”). Where such information relates to one or more Funds, it is exempt from the restriction in section 238(1) of the FSMA on the communication of an invitation or inducement to participate in a collective investment scheme, on the basis that this document is issued by us only to and/or is directed by us only at persons who are categorised as either professional clients or eligible counterparties (within the meaning of the FCA Rules) in respect of interests in the relevant Fund(s). The investments and investment services to which the information on this website relates are not available to other persons and such other persons should, therefore, not act or rely on it. In particular, any investment or service to which the information on this website may related is not intended for retail clients and will not be made available to retail clients.
Investments in hedge funds such as the Funds are speculative and involve a high degree of risk. Investors could lose their entire investment.

Commitment to the UK Stewardship Code  Under Rule 2.2.3R of the FCA's Conduct of Business Sourcebook, GoldenTree Asset Management UK LLP (the "Firm") is required to include on this website a disclosure about the nature of its commitment to the UK Financial Reporting Council's Stewardship Code (the "Code") or, where it does not commit to the Code, its alternative investment strategy. The Code is a voluntary code and sets out a number of principles relating to engagement by investors with UK equity issuers. Investors that commit to the Code can either comply with it in full or choose not to comply with aspects of the Code, in which case they are required to explain their non compliance.
GoldenTree Asset Management UK LLP is an absolute return investor focusing on multiple investment strategies with an emphasis on high yield credit. While the Firm may invest in global equities, including UK equities, it is not a significant element in its investment strategies. While the Code is relevant to some aspects of the Firm's trading, and the Firm generally supports the objectives that underlie the Code, GoldenTree Asset Management UK LLP has chosen not to commit to the Code. The Firm invests in a variety of asset classes and in a variety of jurisdictions across Europe. The approach of the Firm in relation to engagement with issuers and their management are determined globally, on a group wide basis. The Firm, along with its U.S. affiliate, takes a global approach to engagement with issuers and their management in all of the jurisdictions in which it invests and, consequently, does not consider it appropriate to commit to any particular voluntary code of practice relating to any individual jurisdiction  Inquiries  Inquiries concerning use of GoldenTree's trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, icons copyrights or other intellectual property, or other inquiries regarding the terms and conditions of this web site should be addressed to GoldenTree Asset Management LP, Legal Department, 300 Park Avenue, 20th Floor, New York, NY 10022.
