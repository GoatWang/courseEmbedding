What Client’s Say



Laurus Office is the most efficient tool I’ve ever worked with… My team and I couldn’t do our job without Laurus
             Office. And it keeps getting better and better. I’ve tried other tools and they just don’t work as well. This is organized,
             logical, easy to use. We’ve even had lenders compliment our package – ‘Your file is so clean and organized, we’ve never seen ones this neat.’
             Tech support is awesome. I’ve never had a question that wasn’t answered with one email or phone call!

Linda WeathersOwner, SA Short Sale Services CA




I have been involved with hundreds of successful short sales over the last 10 years and this software is amazing! There is not a better system on the market today.

Iean Finley, Real Estate Broker,,Illinois




The first time I saw Laurus Office I knew it was a gamechanger. Laurus Office is making the business of short
							sale negotiation - for negotiation sake, highly profitable. Unlike the multitude of platforms I've used
							before, Laurus' vast flexibility and smart integration offer true time savings by reducing manual steps and
							advancing communication between parties to a whole new level.

Brandon Robinson, 
           Loss Mitigation Professionals, LLC




This is by far the most advanced, fully functional real estate management software on the market for today and the future.

Jeffrey W. Wolff, 
           Illinois Distressed Property Solutions (IDPS,LLC) Hoffman Estates, IL




Laurus Office has been a driving factor for my financial success and mental stability in the hectic world of short
							sales. The software program has helped me to organize over 11 million dollars in short sale files, and
							has brought $5,000,000 worth of closings in only a few short months.

Kathy Gentner, 
           Short Sale Negotiator, Right Side Up, LLC




The Laurus back office is a life saver! …I have been a loyal customer of Short Sale Builder for over a year
             now, and when I saw and experienced the new Laurus Office, it just blew me away. The customer support is
             fantastic, the interface is intuitive and the flexibility is amazing! I recommend it to everyone involved 
             in the Short Sale or Negotiating arena.
Blake CoryOwner, CEO CB International Realty

Lifestyle — Continuing, they describe what the gay lifestyle is really like.
Conversion — How they surrendered to Jesus Christ
Healing — Finally, these former homosexuals describe breakthrough moments in their ongoing healing process.
