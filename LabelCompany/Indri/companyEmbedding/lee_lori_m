hanginggardenstories:Offeringsby Lori M. LeeKirin rowed them out onto the lake one morning. Dawn perched at the lip of the eastern hills, diffused by the mist that plumed in silver curls against the prow. Saereen shivered and rubbed her arms, but she was smiling as well. Her hair was damp against her neck.“It’s magical,” she breathed as sunlight transformed the water from blue ink to dappled flame.“I thought you’d like it.” This won him a shy glance and a smile that promised of more dawns to come.He’d met Saereen only three weeks ago, the day after his family moved into the village of Wingha. A year ago, his mother had passed through Wingha on her way to the capital and fallen in love with the trees. While exploring his new home, he’d heard Saereen humming and found her in a meadow, weaving crowns from hollyhock and coltsfoot, marigolds and fronds. On her own dark brown hair sat a wreath of yarrow and roses and feverfew. Kirin did not believe in the elemental spirits, but he’d been tempted that day, watching sunbeams dance at her brow.He rowed them farther out. Her delighted exclamations were a sweet companion to the lapping of the water against the boat. Kirin decided he could never tire of that sound.They were not in love. Affection and longing, however, had snared Kirin by the heart. He could grow to love her, deeply, passionately, given time.The storm gave no warning. It descended in a shock of stinging wind and spearing rain. The lake transformed into a tempest, flinging their little boat on vicious waves. Kirin tried to direct them toward the shore, but the water tore the oars from his grip and, with a violent heave, flipped the boat.Kirin and Saereen tumbled into the frothing black.#Saereen had grown up in Wingha, as had her parents before her and their parents before them. Their cottage sat at the feet of a forest known as the Giant’s Palace. The forest was older than the kingdom, with trees the girth of houses and so tall, it was said you could touch the sky if anyone had ever dared to climb them.No one dared. The forest marked a border not found on any map. The Giant’s Palace was home to the spirits of the elements, those of earthen magic. None who’d grown in its shadow would dare to trespass.Except, that is, for a two-year-old Saereen who’d slipped her mother’s watchful eye and waddled into the trees. There, she giggled as she tapped the caps of mushrooms larger than her fists and tilted her head to peer at miniature elementals crouched beneath saucers of russet lichen. Overhead, lights spun in frantic circles at the human child who’d wandered into forbidden spaces.She tripped a half dozen times over the uneven ground, but the mossy carpet was always there to cushion her dimpled knees and tender palms. The elementals watched. Curious. Cautious. Until her feet passed from vivid green to dirt damp with rot and paused before the only dead tree in the whole of the Giant’s Palace. It was a ragged thing, the bark gray and flaking.Saereen ran from it, afraid. At length, she was corralled by tree keepers, six-legged elementals with bark for skin and thistles for hair, and ushered her into the Evening Hall.There, the trees bore lichen of scarlet and coral, and the aisles were scattered with golden leaves. Fruit trees stood in clusters, branches drooping under their abundance. Servants not much bigger than Saereen carried silver platters laden with peaches, cantaloupe, and apricots down the aisle to the figure who sat at its end.The queen of the Giant’s Palace sat on a throne hewn from the wood of elm and oak and dragon’s blood. She wore a crown of brambles, ornamented by flowers that were a jewel-bright sapphire. Saereen was too young to understand her importance. She saw only a shining figure in a beautiful gown of agrimony and elderberry lace. She walked right up to the queen’s throne, lifted her chubby arms, and demanded, “Up.”Then and there, the queen claimed Saereen as her own.  Keep reading

typeworship:Calligraphy Stools. I love to see type or lettering is used as decoration, simply for its own beauty but even more so when it’s functional. I’ve previously written about Type Tables, Concept Furniture and Type Architecture, and now, another inventive blend of form and function, Calligraphy Stools.The above works are by Beirut based designer, Iyad Naja. Most recently he produced the calligraphy stools (the top five images above) for for Dubai design week, last month. The decorative top half is created from abstracted calligraphic forms that have been sculpted into a continuous ring. These have been cast into three types of metal and interwoven with a concrete base. There’s several other script inspired pieces over on Facebook.

BIO
,   
Short VersionLori is the author of Gates of Thread and Stone and The Infinite. She has a borderline obsessive fascination with unicorns, is fond of talking in capslock, and loves to write about magic, manipulation, and family. She lives in Wisconsin with her husband, kids, and a friendly pitbull.Long VersionLori was born in the mountains of Laos where her family relocated to a Thailand refugee camp for a few years and then moved permanently to the United States when she was three. She can’t remember any of it, and uses this excuse to insist she was raised by invisible flying unicorns. Like thestrals but less morbid.  She’s been writing since the third grade although quality has hopefully improved. Her first novel was a Mary Sue fantasy romance she wrote when she was a preteen. It contained many things preteens probably should not have been writing about. She blames her older sisters.  Other (random or otherwise) things about Lori:  • She doesn’t know her real birth date. Her legal one was given to her in the refugee camp. Apparently, the mountain villages don’t keep birth records. This means she is allowed to lie about her age. *cheers*  • She has two older sisters who embody the words fierce and fabulous.  • She is married to a social worker who fancies himself a comedian. She has no idea how this happened.  • She has a degree in Creative Writing.  • She loves unicorns. In the Zombies vs. Unicorns debate, unicorns obviously prevail.  • Her favorite category to read and write is Young Adult. Some might tell you it’s because she is mentally ten, but do not listen to them. Ten is obviously Middle Grade. If anything, she’s mentally fifteen.  • She has dreamed about being an author since she was eight.  ♥

Lori is an avid writer, reader, artist, and lover of unicorns. She should probably spend less time on the internet (but she won't). She has a borderline obsessive fascination with unicorns, is fond of talking in capslock, and loves to write about magic, manipulation, and family. She lives in Wisconsin with her husband, kids, and a friendly pitbull.

If you asked me what superpower I'd want, it would probably be time control :) But Gates of Thread and Stone doesn't necessarily have time TRAVEL. There is manipulation of time, and travel is certainly a possibility, but there are restrictions to what Kai is capable of doing and rules that she can't violate ;)(less)

      “I missed you every hour. And you know what the worst part was? It caught me completely by surprise. I'd catch myself just walking around to find you, not for any reason, just out of habit, because I'd seen something that I wanted to tell you about or because I wanted to hear your voice. And then I'd realize that you weren't there anymore, and every time, every single time, it was like having the wind knocked out of me. I've risked my life for you. I've walked half the length of Ravka for you, and I'd do it again and again and again just to be with you, just to starve with you and freeze with you and hear you complain about hard cheese every day. So don't tell me why we don't belong together," he said fiercely.”

The loss of any library at any time is a tragedy but this disaster was a blow to civilization itself.  (End of nerdish rant)Lori M. Lee 分享了 Kate Quinn 的帖子 · 4月10日 · This is so great XDKate Quinn 上传了 2 张新照片。 · 4月10日 · If I ever get a sad-sack nut-case letter like this, I hope I can reply  with as much style and wit as Scott Lynch does here, when he answers a reader who compla...ins (spelling his) about the black female pirate in Lynch's fantasy pirate novels: "Real sea pirates could not be controlled by women, they were vicous rapits and murderers and I am sorry to say it was a man’s world. It is unrealistic wish fulfilment for you and your readers to have so many female pirates."  Ok. Let's leave aside for the moment that nothing is unrealistic or impossible in a fantasy novel whose world-building is thorough.  Let's also leave aside the sheer level of fantastic in Lynch's reply, including "Shit yes, Zamira Drakasha, leaping across the gap between burning ships with twin sabers in hand to kick in some fucking heads and sail off into the sunset with her toddlers in her arms and a hold full of plundered goods, is a wish-fulfillment fantasy from hell. I offer her up on a silver platter with a fucking bow on top; I hope she amuses and delights. In my fictional world, opportunities for butt-kicking do not cease merely because one isn’t a beautiful teenager or a muscle-wrapped font of testosterone. My fictional universe . . . includes “SBF, 41, nonsmoker, 2 children, buccaneer of no fixed abode, seeks unescorted merchant for light boarding, heavy plunder.” Leaving all that aside for a moment, let's go to "Real sea pirates could not be controlled by women, they were vicous rapits and murderers and I am sorry to say it was a man’s world." I won't argue about the criminal records and probable temperament of many historical pirates, and I won't argue that it was a man's world, but really, no real sea pirates were ever controlled by a woman? I wonder what Madame Ching had to say about that. She's regarded as possibly the most successful pirate commander of all time, with thousands bowing to her rule. The only way China got her out of their hair was to offer her a luxurious retirement and widespread pardons. And of course Anne Bonny, Mary Read, and Grania O'Malley would also beg to differ with this singular assessment of ladies on the high seas.  Of course, Dear Reader with his ham-fisted spelling would probably flutter his soft little hands and protest that such women are outliers, that overall it's still unrealistic wish fulfillment to write about female pirates because overall they weren't the norm. Well, so the fuck what? Don't we write fiction about what is outlying, what is extraordinary, what bucks the trend--because it's more interesting that the norm? Because it makes a better story? Besides, which, you chinless comma-splicing ferret, it was a FANTASY NOVEL.  To read the whole marvelous exchange: http://fuckyeahscifiwomenofcolour.tumblr.com/…/author-scott… 展开Lori M.

Description

                    The walls of Ninurta keep its citizens safe.

Kai always believed the only danger to the city came from within. Now, with a rebel force threatening the fragile government, the walls have become more of a prison than ever.

To make matters worse, as Avan explores his new identity as an Infinite, Kai struggles to remind him what it means to be human. And she fears her brother, Reev, is involved with the rebels. With the two people she cares about most on opposite sides of a brewing war, Kai will do whatever it takes to bring peace. But she's lost her power to manipulate the threads of time, and she learns that a civil war might be the beginning of something far worse that will crumble not only Ninurta's walls but also the entire city.

In this thrilling sequel to Gates of Thread and Stone, Kai must decide how much of her humanity she's willing to lose to protect the only family she's ever known.show more

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/25/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

A must for every man’s arsenal: a few reliable pairs of jeans that have a classic look with a modern flair and a great fit. Lee jeans for men provide high-quality pants for anyone looking to add denim durability and unbeatable style to their everyday look. Keep loose and stay comfortable with the freeing forms of relaxed or bootcut jeans. More of a traditionalist? Stick with what you know and look great in a pair of straight or slim fit pants. Take advantage of extra pocket space with a trusty set of carpenter jeans. Too hot for long pants? Get the same quality you’re used to with a bit less length. From cargo shorts to flat-front shorts—and denim to khaki, Lee shorts give you an attractive summer style and a great way to stay cool. Whether you’re shopping for weekday work attire or weekend casual, our Lee jeans and pants will give you a classic look for a lot less.
