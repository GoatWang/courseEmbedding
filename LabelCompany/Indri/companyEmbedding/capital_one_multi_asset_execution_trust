For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Announcement: Moody's: No rating impact on Capital One's card ABS following amendment to pooling and servicing agreement






                    Global Credit Research - 27 Jan 2017
                









New York, January 27, 2017 -- Moody's Investors Service announced today that the execution of the First 
Amendment to the Amended and Restated Pooling and Servicing Agreement 
related to Capital One Multi-asset Execution Trust on 27 January 
2017 would not, in and of itself and at this time, result 
in a downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to any class of outstanding 
notes issued by the Capital One Multi-asset Execution Trust.




The amendment adds provisions to the pooling and servicing agreement that 
outline the process by which Capital One Funding, LLC, as 
transferor, will measure and assess compliance with the Dodd-Frank 
credit risk retention requirements. Specifically, the amendment 
obligates the transferor to measure the transferor's interest at 
the end of each month and determine whether or not it is sufficient to 
satisfy the risk retention requirements. If at any measurement 
date Capital One Bank (USA) fails satisfy the risk retention requirements, 
it will be deemed to be in compliance with the risk retention requirements 
if the transferor cures the failure by the end of the following month. 





Because the amendment has no negative credit impact, Moody's has 
determined that the execution of the amendment, in and of itself 
and at this time, will not result in the downgrade or withdrawal 
of the ratings currently assigned to any class of outstanding notes issued 
by the trust. However, Moody's opinion addresses only the 
credit impact associated with the amendment, and Moody's is not 
expressing any opinion as to whether the amendment has, or could 
have, other non-credit related effects that may have a detrimental 
impact on the interests of noteholders and/or counterparties.






This publication does not announce a credit rating action. For 
any credit ratings referenced in this publication, please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com 
for the most updated credit rating action information and rating history.

To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability for any direct or compensatory losses or damages caused to any person or entity, including but not limited to by any negligence (but excluding fraud, willful misconduct or any other type of liability that, for the avoidance of doubt, by law cannot be excluded) on the part of, or any contingency within or beyond the control of, MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers, arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information. NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH RATING OR OTHER OPINION OR INFORMATION IS GIVEN OR MADE BY MOODY’S IN ANY FORM OR MANNER WHATSOEVER. Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

Announcement: Moody's: No rating impact on Capital One's card ABS following amendments to transaction documents






                    Global Credit Research - 18 Mar 2016
                









New York, March 18, 2016 -- Moody's announced today that the execution of the amendments to the below 
mentioned documents related to Capital One Multi-asset Execution 
Trust on 17 March 2016 would not, in and of itself and at this time, 
result in a downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to any class 
of outstanding notes issued by the Capital One Multi-asset Execution 
Trust:




• Amended and Restated Pooling and Servicing Agreement;




• Amended and Restated Indenture;




• Amended and Restated Indenture Supplement;




• Amended and Restated Series 2007-CC Supplement;




• Second Amendment to the Amended and Receivables Purchase Agreement;




The amendments, each of which are credit neutral or marginally credit 
positive, incorporated several changes meant to bring the program 
in compliance with the SEC's Regulation AB II. The changes 
include the creation of investor communications procedures and enhanced 
rep and warrant breach review and dispute resolution mechanics. 





Following the amendments, if an investor makes a request to the 
servicer or transferor, in writing, to communicate with another 
investor, the servicer or transferor, as applicable, 
must include the request to communicate in the distribution report for 
the month that the request occurred. In addition, the pooling 
and servicing agreement now contains a two step test that will trigger 
a rep and warrant breach review by a third party. The two steps 
of the test are a) a delinquency test, which is triggered if the 
three month average 60+ day delinquency rate exceeds the delinquency 
trigger rate, and b) a majority of investors vote in favor of having 
the review take place. The investor vote will only take place if 
at least 5% of investors submit a petition within 90 days of the 
delinquency trigger breach. The pooling and servicing agreement 
also now contains specific procedures that govern the resolution of disputes 
concerning breaches of reps and warrants, which allows for a party 
requesting a repurchase to select either mediation or arbitration to resolve 
the dispute.




Because the amendments have either no or a positive credit impact, 
Moody's has determined that the execution of the amendments, in 
and of itself and at this time, will not result in the downgrade 
or withdrawal of the ratings currently assigned to any class of outstanding 
notes issued by the trust. However, Moody's opinion addresses 
only the credit impact associated with the amendments, and Moody's 
is not expressing any opinion as to whether the amendments have, 
or could have, other non-credit related effects that may 
have a detrimental impact on the interests of noteholders and/or counterparties.






This publication does not announce a credit rating action. For

MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable).

Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

                    Global Credit Research - 25 Aug 2015
                







$850 million securities rated


New York, August 25, 2015 -- Moody's Investors Service has assigned a definitive Aaa (sf) rating to 
the Class A(2015-6) Card series Notes to be issued by the Capital 
One Multi-asset Execution Trust, sponsored by Capital One 
Bank (USA), National Association (CapOne).




Moody's rating action is as follows:




Issuer: COMET - Capital One Multi-asset Execution 
Trust




$850,000,000 Cl. A (15-6), Definitive 
Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)




RATING RATIONALE 




The rating is based on the quality of the underlying credit card receivables, 
the expertise of CapOne as servicer, the transaction's legal and 
structural protections including early amortization trigger events, 
the credit enhancement provided by subordinate notes, and the likelihood 
of the sponsor becoming insolvent and shutting down its credit card portfolio. 
Moody's assesses this likelihood from the sponsor's counterparty risk 
assessment (CR assessment).




The COMET Class A(2015-6) Card series Notes have a floating rate 
coupon of one-month LIBOR plus 0.37%, an expected 
maturity date of 15 August 2017, and a legal maturity date of 15 
June 2020. Moody's rating addresses the likelihood of interest 
payments being made when due and the return of principal by the legal 
maturity date.




The assets of COMET consist of a collateral certificate (Series 2002-CC) 
issued by the Capital One Master Trust (the Master Trust) representing 
an undivided interest in the receivables, originated and serviced 
by CapOne, which the Master Trust holds. CapOne's long-term 
deposit ratings are A1 stable/long-term senior unsecured Baa1 stable, 
long-term CR assessment A2(cr), short-term deposits 
P-1, and BCA a3.




Summary of Analytical Outputs




Moody's Aaa LGSD and the Aaa CE are 37.6% and 16.2% 
respectively for this transaction. The Aaa LGSD reflects Moody's 
expectation of the trust's performance following a sponsor default and 
portfolio shutdown. The Aaa CE reflects the level of credit enhancement 
consistent with a Aaa (sf) rating by haircutting the Aaa LGSD based on 
the CR assessment of the sponsor.




Moody's expects performance in the range of 3.0% - 
4.0% for charge-offs, 21.0% - 
24.0% for yield and 25.5% - 28.5% 
for the principal payment rate.




Moody's performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's 
forward-looking view of the likely range of performance over the 
medium term. From time to time, Moody's may, if warranted, 
change these expectations. Performance that falls outside the given 
range may indicate that the collateral's credit quality is stronger or 
weaker than Moody's had anticipated when the related securities were rated. 
Even so, a deviation from the expected range will not necessarily 
result in a rating action nor does performance within expectations preclude 
such actions. The decision to take (or not take) a rating action 
is dependent on an assessment of a range of factors including, but 
not exclusively, the performance metrics.




Methodology Underlying the Rating Action:




The principal methodology used in this rating was "Moody's Approach 
to Rating Credit Card Receivables-Backed Securities" published 
in June 2015. Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




Factors that would lead to a downgrade of the rating:




Moody's could downgrade the rating of the Class A(2015-6) Card 
series Notes if our expectation of the trust's performance following a 
sponsor default and portfolio shutdown (i.e., Aaa 
LGSD) deteriorates materially, specifically, if the charge-off 
rate rises or the payment rate or yield falls. An increase in Moody's 
assessment of the likelihood of either of the sponsors shutting down its 
credit card portfolio, generally reflected from a downgrade in either 
of the sponsors' CR assessment, could also lead to a downgrade to 
the rating of the Class A(2015-6) Card series Notes. 




Loss and Cash Flow Analysis :




In rating this transaction, Moody's uses a cash flow model to determine 
the collateral losses in a maximum stress scenario. As a second 
step, Moody's haircuts such collateral losses based on the sponsor's 
credit quality. Finally, Moody's compares note available 
credit enhancement with the adjusted collateral losses, taking into 
account loss allocation and other structural features, to derive 
the expected loss for each rated instrument. 




Stress Scenarios: 




Moody's quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios that 
stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into account 
the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES 




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.

MOODY’S DEFINES CREDIT RISK AS THE RISK THAT AN ENTITY MAY NOT MEET ITS CONTRACTUAL, FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AS THEY COME DUE AND ANY ESTIMATED FINANCIAL LOSS IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT. CREDIT RATINGS DO NOT ADDRESS ANY OTHER RISK, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: LIQUIDITY RISK, MARKET VALUE RISK, OR PRICE VOLATILITY.

NEITHER CREDIT RATINGS NOR MOODY’S PUBLICATIONS COMMENT ON THE SUITABILITY OF AN INVESTMENT FOR ANY PARTICULAR INVESTOR. MOODY’S ISSUES ITS CREDIT RATINGS AND PUBLISHES MOODY’S PUBLICATIONS WITH THE EXPECTATION AND UNDERSTANDING THAT EACH INVESTOR WILL, WITH DUE CARE, MAKE ITS OWN STUDY AND EVALUATION OF EACH SECURITY THAT IS UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR PURCHASE, HOLDING, OR SALE. MOODY’S CREDIT RATINGS AND MOODY’S PUBLICATIONS ARE NOT INTENDED FOR USE BY RETAIL INVESTORS AND IT WOULD BE RECKLESS AND INAPPROPRIATE FOR RETAIL INVESTORS TO USE MOODY’S CREDIT RATINGS OR MOODY’S PUBLICATIONS WHEN MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION. IF IN DOUBT YOU SHOULD CONTACT YOUR FINANCIAL OR OTHER PROFESSIONAL ADVISER. ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS PROTECTED BY LAW, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, COPYRIGHT LAW, AND NONE OF SUCH INFORMATION MAY BE COPIED OR OTHERWISE REPRODUCED, REPACKAGED, FURTHER TRANSMITTED, TRANSFERRED, DISSEMINATED, REDISTRIBUTED OR RESOLD, OR STORED FOR SUBSEQUENT USE FOR ANY SUCH PURPOSE, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, IN ANY FORM OR MANNER OR BY ANY MEANS WHATSOEVER, BY ANY PERSON WITHOUT MOODY’S PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT. All information contained herein is obtained by MOODY’S from sources believed by it to be accurate and reliable. Because of the possibility of human or mechanical error as well as other factors, however, all information contained herein is provided “AS IS” without warranty of any kind. MOODY'S adopts all necessary measures so that the information it uses in assigning a credit rating is of sufficient quality and from sources MOODY'S considers to be reliable including, when appropriate, independent third-party sources. However, MOODY’S is not an auditor and cannot in every instance independently verify or validate information received in the rating process or in preparing the Moody’s publications. To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability to any person or entity for any indirect, special, consequential, or incidental losses or damages whatsoever arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information, even if MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers is advised in advance of the possibility of such losses or damages, including but not limited to: (a) any loss of present or prospective profits or (b) any loss or damage arising where the relevant financial instrument is not the subject of a particular credit rating assigned by MOODY’S. To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability for any direct or compensatory losses or damages caused to any person or entity, including but not limited to by any negligence (but excluding fraud, willful misconduct or any other type of liability that, for the avoidance of doubt, by law cannot be excluded) on the part of, or any contingency within or beyond the control of, MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers, arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information. NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH RATING OR OTHER OPINION OR INFORMATION IS GIVEN OR MADE BY MOODY’S IN ANY FORM OR MANNER WHATSOEVER. Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
