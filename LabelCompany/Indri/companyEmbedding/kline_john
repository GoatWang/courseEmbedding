Kline's Dairy Bar

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Kline’s Dairy Bar is a small ice cream shop with four locations in Virginia. It was established in 1943 in Downtown Harrisonburg in the Kline’s family home. After the death of John Kline, the owner, it was bought out and expanded to three other locations. It uses an old fashioned way of production called continuous freeze instead of the newer and more popular soft serve method. This means that there is less air added into the ice cream as it freezes, making for a denser product more like old-fashioned frozen custard. Since this means of production takes more time, the shops only make three flavors a week. They update their customers on the flavors using their website and their Twitter account.

History[edit]
John Kline asked for the help from his father, Grover Kline, in 1943 to help him start Kline’s Frozen Custard. They first started selling their product in their home, having customers come up to a window in their house. John then married Bess, a woman who worked across the street at the dry cleaners. Bess worked the window for years, getting to know the customers and becoming the face of the shop.[1] When John Kline died in 1974, Bess sold the business to a man named Sam Fletcher. Bess continued to work under Sam Fletcher until he sold it to Mike Arehart in 1979. Bess Kline stayed a part of the team to teach Mike Arehart the ropes.[1] Mike owns the two locations in Harrisonburg and has remained loyal to the beliefs of the business throughout the years. “Arehart carries on a tradition of premium ice cream that began in 1943 when Bess and John Kline first opened their ice cream shop”.[2] Mike’s sister Kim Arehart returned from college in 1979 wanting to work in the business. She brought Kline’s to a new location, Staunton Virginia, in 1997. Then again in 2008 she expanded to add a new store in Waynesboro Virginia. Mike Arehart still owns the two locations in Harrisonburg while Kim owns the two other locations in Virginia.[1] Both have decided to stay with the original style of production. Kim explains that this old fashioned production is what sets them apart: "I couldn't turn my back on the Kline's tradition," she said Thursday. "This is our niche, we understand it, and we've gotten very good at it.”[3]
Production[edit]
The continuous freeze method of producing ice cream is nearly obsolete along the east coast. “Though popular in some parts of the Midwest, particularly Milwaukee, the custard-style confection -- also known as continuous freeze ice cream -- is a rarity in Virginia and most of the United States.“[3] This continuous freeze method means that the ice cream is frozen and mixed at the same time with little air added during this process. The more popular soft-serve method of production churns the ice cream then adds a substantial amount of air while it is being frozen. The soft serve method allows for larger batches to be made at one time and produces a lighter, air filled ice cream. Bigger ice cream chains such as Dairy Queen use this soft serve method. The original owners of Dairy Queen teamed up to create a new freezer that was larger and could hold much more of the product. “The basic principle behind this new freezer concept was to scrape frozen mix from the inside of a drum resembling the barrel of a batch brine freezer, and pump air into the mix as it was frozen.”[4] Because Kline's does not use this method, they make smaller batches and cannot work as efficiently as the chain businesses. Kline’s product is denser since there is less air added into the mixture. “It also means more milk, fruit and flavoring in every cup or cone.” [2] Each batch of continuous freeze is “a process that only takes about two minutes from start to finish”. But since it does not make as much as the conventional soft serve method, it takes much longer to make the same amount through this method. With continuous freeze, very little air is added as the machines slowly push out the final product, making only about 10 gallons an hour.[2] Despite the time and effort it takes to use this method, Kline's makes their ice cream fresh everyday. In order to make up for the time of production, they only make three flavors every week and have a rather rushed atmosphere. Kline’s makes their ice cream fresh every morning to sell throughout the day.
Flavors[edit]
Because Kline’s makes their ice cream every morning and it takes so long to make each flavor, they have one special flavor a week. They always make chocolate and vanilla and rotate in this special flavor. This creates a way for them to compete with the faster chain ice cream sellers.[5] They choose not to mix flavors but to keep these three simple flavors, milkshakes, and sundaes. “Arehart said the menu is streamlined and designed to serve as many people as fast as it can.” [2] They choose the special flavor of the week from 12 regulars including peanut butter, black raspberry, and Oreo. They put up the flavor of the week on their website and their Twitter page as well as having a sign outside to let the customers know. This fast pace and simple menu continues through their service. Costumers walk up to a service window, similar to the one in John Kline’s family home in 1943, and order. They are served quickly in order to keep the line moving. Costumers then can choose to sit on near by benches or tables.
Hog Wild[edit]
When Kim Arehart expanded to open Kline’s in Staunton, Virginia, she also opened Hog Wild BBQ in 1997.[1] This Staunton location is the only location whose menu offers more than ice cream. The Staunton menu offers Carolina style barbecue, hot dogs, burgers, and other sides.They are available to cater for up to 200 people.[6] It has made its name in Staunton by selling BBQ by the pound at affordable prices. "Hog Wild BBQ sells take-home BBQ by the pound... in either Southwestern and Carolina Vinegar Pepper styles."[7]

Kline’s Dairy Bar is a small ice cream shop with four locations in Virginia. It was established in 1943 in Downtown Harrisonburg in the Kline’s family home. After the death of John Kline, the owner, it was bought out and expanded to three other locations. It uses an old fashioned way of production called continuous freeze instead of the newer and more popular soft serve method. This means that there is less air added into the ice cream as it freezes, making for a denser product more like old-fashioned frozen custard. Since this means of production takes more time, the shops only make three flavors a week. They update their customers on the flavors using their website and their Twitter account.

History[edit]
John Kline asked for the help from his father, Grover Kline, in 1943 to help him start Kline’s Frozen Custard. They first started selling their product in their home, having customers come up to a window in their house. John then married Bess, a woman who worked across the street at the dry cleaners. Bess worked the window for years, getting to know the customers and becoming the face of the shop.[1] When John Kline died in 1974, Bess sold the business to a man named Sam Fletcher. Bess continued to work under Sam Fletcher until he sold it to Mike Arehart in 1979. Bess Kline stayed a part of the team to teach Mike Arehart the ropes.[1] Mike owns the two locations in Harrisonburg and has remained loyal to the beliefs of the business throughout the years. “Arehart carries on a tradition of premium ice cream that began in 1943 when Bess and John Kline first opened their ice cream shop”.[2] Mike’s sister Kim Arehart returned from college in 1979 wanting to work in the business. She brought Kline’s to a new location, Staunton Virginia, in 1997. Then again in 2008 she expanded to add a new store in Waynesboro Virginia. Mike Arehart still owns the two locations in Harrisonburg while Kim owns the two other locations in Virginia.[1] Both have decided to stay with the original style of production. Kim explains that this old fashioned production is what sets them apart: "I couldn't turn my back on the Kline's tradition," she said Thursday. "This is our niche, we understand it, and we've gotten very good at it.”[3]
Production[edit]
The continuous freeze method of producing ice cream is nearly obsolete along the east coast. “Though popular in some parts of the Midwest, particularly Milwaukee, the custard-style confection -- also known as continuous freeze ice cream -- is a rarity in Virginia and most of the United States.“[3] This continuous freeze method means that the ice cream is frozen and mixed at the same time with little air added during this process. The more popular soft-serve method of production churns the ice cream then adds a substantial amount of air while it is being frozen. The soft serve method allows for larger batches to be made at one time and produces a lighter, air filled ice cream. Bigger ice cream chains such as Dairy Queen use this soft serve method.

The original owners of Dairy Queen teamed up to create a new freezer that was larger and could hold much more of the product. “The basic principle behind this new freezer concept was to scrape frozen mix from the inside of a drum resembling the barrel of a batch brine freezer, and pump air into the mix as it was frozen.”[4] Because Kline's does not use this method, they make smaller batches and cannot work as efficiently as the chain businesses. Kline’s product is denser since there is less air added into the mixture. “It also means more milk, fruit and flavoring in every cup or cone.” [2] Each batch of continuous freeze is “a process that only takes about two minutes from start to finish”. But since it does not make as much as the conventional soft serve method, it takes much longer to make the same amount through this method. With continuous freeze, very little air is added as the machines slowly push out the final product, making only about 10 gallons an hour.[2] Despite the time and effort it takes to use this method, Kline's makes their ice cream fresh everyday. In order to make up for the time of production, they only make three flavors every week and have a rather rushed atmosphere. Kline’s makes their ice cream fresh every morning to sell throughout the day.
Flavors[edit]
Because Kline’s makes their ice cream every morning and it takes so long to make each flavor, they have one special flavor a week. They always make chocolate and vanilla and rotate in this special flavor. This creates a way for them to compete with the faster chain ice cream sellers.[5] They choose not to mix flavors but to keep these three simple flavors, milkshakes, and sundaes. “Arehart said the menu is streamlined and designed to serve as many people as fast as it can.” [2] They choose the special flavor of the week from 12 regulars including peanut butter, black raspberry, and Oreo. They put up the flavor of the week on their website and their Twitter page as well as having a sign outside to let the customers know. This fast pace and simple menu continues through their service. Costumers walk up to a service window, similar to the one in John Kline’s family home in 1943, and order. They are served quickly in order to keep the line moving. Costumers then can choose to sit on near by benches or tables.
Hog Wild[edit]
When Kim Arehart expanded to open Kline’s in Staunton, Virginia, she also opened Hog Wild BBQ in 1997.[1] This Staunton location is the only location whose menu offers more than ice cream. The Staunton menu offers Carolina style barbecue, hot dogs, burgers, and other sides.They are available to cater for up to 200 people.[6] It has made its name in Staunton by selling BBQ by the pound at affordable prices. "Hog Wild BBQ sells take-home BBQ by the pound... in either Southwestern and Carolina Vinegar Pepper styles."[7]

Are we winning? Are we losing?" You can watch my full questioning here.103全部帖子Congressman John Kline · 2016年8月19日 · Vicky and I are saddened to hear of the passing of General John Vessey, a great Minnesotan and great leader of our Armed Forces. This is a loss to America, and we will miss him. General Vessey’s family is in our prayers.Congressman John Kline · 2016年7月14日 · One year ago today the President asked us to join him in his gamble with Iran, a nation that repeatedly has called the U.S. the ‘Great Satan.’ The President’s deal with Iran removed permanent sanctions and provided billions of dollars in relief for the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism, but over the past 12 months the administration has failed to hold Iran accountable for its dangerous and illicit behavior. Instead, the President is allowing the Iranian regime to retain a path to a nuclear weapon while providing them a windfall of new money to support terrorism around the globe.   I supported the Iran Accountability Act which passed Congress today that would apply sanctions on Iran for its terrorism activity, ballistic missile tests, and human rights abuses.全部帖子Congressman John Kline · 2016年7月13日 · Earlier today I helped lead a bipartisan conference committee to help finalize the national defense bill. As a 25-year veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, I'm pleased to help ensure Washington keeps its promises with our troops and veterans. Also included in the national defense bill is legislation I authored to ensure military commanders have much needed flexibility for our troops to fight Islamist extremists in Afghanistan and the region.Congressman John Kline · 2016年7月1日 · On Monday, July 4th, we celebrate 240 years of American independence, marking the Continental Congress' adoption of the Declaration of Independence. Vicky and I would like to wish you a safe and happy Independence Day!Congressman John Kline · 2016年6月27日 · This summer, House Republicans continue to release our bold new agenda that would restore a confident America. Last week, I helped introduce new commonsense health care reforms to ensure our health care system is accessible, affordable, and puts the American people first. Our plan includes several proposals to expand coverage, lower health care costs, and promote a healthy workforce, including reforms that will protect employee wellness programs, allow small businesses to band together, and ensure employers have the flexibility to meet their workers’ needs.Congressman John Kline · 2016年6月24日 · This week, I was pleased to host Lakeville North graduate Lindsay Hardwick, who won my annual Congressional Artistic Discovery Competition with her painting which innovatively used instant coffee as a medium. Lindsay attended a ribbon-cutting ceremony in Washington, and I enjoyed visiting with her during her stay as well as showing her where the winning painting is displayed in the U.S. Capitol.Congressman John Kline · 2016年6月14日 · Sunday's attack in Orlando is a stark reminder that we are at war with Islamist extremists and we must be vigilant against homegrown terrorism. About an hour ago, I spoke with Chad Hartman on WCCO radio about this. You can listen here: http://kline.house.gov/…/congressman_john_kline_-_chad_hart…Congressman John Kline · 2016年6月14日 · Happy Flag Day! If you would like to order a U.S. flag from my office, please use the flag order form on my website (link below) to calculate the price and shipping costs. You will have the option to request the flags purchased to be flown over the U.S. Capitol. Order form: http://kline.house.gov/constituent-services/flagrequests.htmCongressman John Kline · 2016年6月6日 · In 2009, I had the honor of visiting the Normandy American Cemetery, which sits atop a bluff overlooking Omaha Beach and the English Channel from which U.S. troops launched the June 6, 1944 D-Day invasion. I was humbled to help lay a wreath in honor of those American service members who gave their lives to make possible the liberation of Europe in World War II. The ceremony at Normandy was especially moving and personal to me. My father, 1st Lieutenant John Kline, U.S. Army, landed on Omaha Beach on D-Plus 1. Thankfully, he survived the Battle of Normandy, but many of his friends did not. I know he would have been moved to tears at the sight of the thousands of white markers – row after row. I know he loved, admired, and thanked those fallen comrades.Congressman John Kline · 2016年5月27日 · This Monday - Memorial Day - we remember and recognize those who gave their lives to defend our freedom. Let us not forget to pay tribute to those true American heroes to whom we owe so much. Please join me and so many other Minnesotans on Monday who will pause to honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice. Vicky and I wish you a safe Memorial Day weekend!Congressman John Kline · 2016年5月24日 · It was extremely disappointing to learn of VA Secretary Robert McDonald's comments yesterday where he compared waits for health care at the VA to lines at Disneyland. Waiting in a line to ride Space Mountain is not comparable to a veteran waiting for health care she was promised. In a meeting with Sec. McDonald earlier this year in Minneapolis, I expressed to the secretary that time was not on his side and that sweeping reform needs to happen now. We must restore faith that our veterans will receive the health care they earned, but Secretary McDonald's comments are very concerning.VA Secretary McDonald Compares Health-Care Lines to DisneyRepublicans are criticizing Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert McDonald after he compared wait times to receive VA health care to the hours people wait for rides at Disney theme parks. McDonald has told reporters on Monday that the VA should not use wait times as a measure of success because...abcnews.go.comCongressman John Kline 上传了 5 张新照片。 · 2016年5月24日 · Congratulations to Lakeville North High School senior Lindsay Hardwick, who won my annual Congressional Artistic Discovery competition with her instant coffee painting, "Stephen."

"Lost But Never Found" Honor. mention - Malia Wellens' "A Distant Memory" 展开+2Congressman John Kline 上传了 3 张新照片。 · 2016年5月19日 · The process creates few soundbites and garners fewer headlines, but I take seriously my role in helping draft the national defense bill. Last evening, the House passed the National Defense Authorization Act, the annual budgetary blueprint for the Pentagon. This is the 14th and - since I'll be retiring at the end of this Congress - my final national defense bill that I helped author. I was pleased my provision to ensure military commanders have much needed flexibility for our troops to fight Islamist extremists in Afghanistan and the region was included in the final legislation that passed with strong bipartisan support. More here: http://kline.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx…Congressman John Kline · 2016年5月18日 · Our law enforcement play a vital role in keeping our communities safe and the south metro is blessed with men and women dedicated to duty and the public safety of Minnesotans.  This week – National Police Week – our nation honors the heroes in blue fighting to keep our country safe. As a 25-year veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, I have devoted much of my efforts in Congress to ensuring we keep faith with our veterans, troops, and their families. But I also want to publicly highlight the efforts of our local police officers and offer sincere gratitude for all they do to keep families and communities safe in Minnesota and across the country.Congressman John Kline · 2016年5月11日 · For generations, hotdish has brought Minnesotans together for good food and fellowship. Earlier today Sen. Franken hosted his annual Minnesota Congressional Delegation Hotdish Competition. For a few minutes over lunch, I participated in the friendly competition. Congratulations to all of the participants as we showcased some of our great state’s homegrown and home-cooked recipes. Congressman Tim Walz won this year's cook-off with his "Turkey Taco Tot Hotdish." Check out the recipes: http://www.franken.senate.gov/…/docu…/2016HotdishRecipes.pdfCongressman John Kline · 2016年4月29日 · Our nation is facing a growing opioid epidemic that is destroying communities, families, and lives, and some of the most vulnerable children and families are suffering its worst consequences. Yesterday, I chaired a committee meeting to review bipartisan legislation (H.R. 4843 - the Infant Plan of Safe Care Improvement Act) that is part of a much broader effort to address the national opioid crisis. The bill will strengthen protections not only for infants exposed to illegal drugs before birth, but for all children in need of help and care. We have taken an important step to address a real need, and I look forward to advancing these reforms in the weeks ahead.The most vulnerable victims of America’s opioid epidemicBabies born dependent on drugs are being released to parents unable to care for them, and Reuters found 110 examples of children who died as a result.reuters.com更多
