    Buy PDF History »The surname Conlin was first found in  Munster, where they held a  family seat from very ancient times.Conlin Spelling VariationsConlin Spelling VariationsThe scribes who created documents long before either the Gaelic or English language resembled their standardized versions of today recorded words as they sounded. Consequently, in the Middle Ages the names of many people were recorded under different spellings each time they were written down. Research on the Conlin family name revealed numerous  spelling variations, including Conlan, Conlin, Conlon, Connelen, Connelon, Connelan, O'Connelen, O'Conlan, O'Conlin, Connellon, Connellan and many more.Conlin Early HistoryConlin Early HistoryThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Conlin research.

Many of these Irish immigrated to British North America or the United States in the hopes of gaining their own tract of farmland. This pattern of migration grew steadily until the 1840s when the  Great Potato Famine caused a great exodus of immigrants to North America. These immigrants differed from their predecessors in that they were desperately fleeing the disease and starvation that plagued their homeland, and many were entirely destitute when they arrived in North America. Although these penniless immigrants were not warmly welcomed when they arrived, they were critical to the rapid development of the United States and what would become known as Canada. Many went to populate the western frontiers and others provided the cheap labor the new manufacturing sector and the building of bridges, roads, railways, and canals required. A thorough examination of immigration and passenger lists has revealed some of the earliest people to arrive in North America with name Conlin or one of its variants: Conlin Settlers in United States in the 19th CenturyPatrick Conlin, aged 22, who arrived in Washington County, Pennsylvania in 1820 [1]CITATION[CLOSE]Filby, P.

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.

Connal or Connall is claimed to be a pet name for a sprout or little sprout; a term of affection or endearment.Conlin Early OriginsPDF Coat of Arms+ Extended History
    Buy PDF History »The surname Conlin was first found in  Munster, where they held a  family seat from very ancient times.Conlin Spelling VariationsConlin Spelling VariationsThe scribes who created documents long before either the Gaelic or English language resembled their standardized versions of today recorded words as they sounded. Consequently, in the Middle Ages the names of many people were recorded under different spellings each time they were written down. Research on the Conlin family name revealed numerous  spelling variations, including Conlan, Conlin, Conlon, Connelen, Connelon, Connelan, O'Connelen, O'Conlan, O'Conlin, Connellon, Connellan and many more.Conlin Early HistoryConlin Early HistoryThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Conlin research. Another 235 words (17 lines of text) covering the years 1172, 1247, 1260, 1492, 1508, 1620, and 1695 are included under the topic Early Conlin History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.Conlin Early Notables (pre 1700)Conlin Early Notables (pre 1700)Another 27 words (2 lines of text) are included under the topic Early Conlin Notables in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.The Great MigrationThe Great MigrationIrish immigrants began to leave the English-controlled  Ireland in sizable numbers during the late 18th century. Many of these Irish immigrated to British North America or the United States in the hopes of gaining their own tract of farmland. This pattern of migration grew steadily until the 1840s when the  Great Potato Famine caused a great exodus of immigrants to North America. These immigrants differed from their predecessors in that they were desperately fleeing the disease and starvation that plagued their homeland, and many were entirely destitute when they arrived in North America. Although these penniless immigrants were not warmly welcomed when they arrived, they were critical to the rapid development of the United States and what would become known as Canada. Many went to populate the western frontiers and others provided the cheap labor the new manufacturing sector and the building of bridges, roads, railways, and canals required. A thorough examination of immigration and passenger lists has revealed some of the earliest people to arrive in North America with name Conlin or one of its variants: Conlin Settlers in United States in the 19th CenturyPatrick Conlin, aged 22, who arrived in Washington County, Pennsylvania in 1820 [1]CITATION[CLOSE]Filby, P.

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto. Motto: Inter UtrumqueMotto Translation: Between the two.Conlin Family Crest ProductsConlin Family Crest ProductsPopular ProductsArmorial History With Coat of ArmsCoat of Arms & Surname History PackageFamily Crest Image (jpg) Heritage Series - 300 DPIKey-chainCoffee MugArmorial History with FrameFramed Surname History and Coat of ArmsMost Popular Family Crest Products Conlin Armorial History With Coat of ArmsConlin Coat of Arms & Surname History PackageConlin Family Crest Image (jpg) Heritage SeriesConlin Coat of Arms/Family Crest Key-chainConlin Coat of Arms/Family Crest Coffee MugConlin Armorial History with FrameConlin Framed Surname History and Coat of ArmsSee AlsoSee AlsoFamily Crests:  the Heraldic ArtistFamily Crests:  TimelineFamily Crests: ElementsFamily Crests and Genealogy:  how they relateLeinsterMunsterSpelling variationsFamily seatGreat Potato FamineIrelandNew South WalesFind us on FacebookCitationsCitations^ Filby, P.
