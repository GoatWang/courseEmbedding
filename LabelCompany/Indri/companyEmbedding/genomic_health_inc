                    Oncotype DX for Prostate Cancer
                










Oncotype DX for Prostate Cancer | Genomic Health, Inc.

Addressing a Significant Unmet Need in Men’s Health
The Oncotype DX prostate cancer test was developed to help men newly diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer to make the most informed treatment decision for their individual disease, including active surveillance.  The vast majority of men currently diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer undergo surgery or radiation treatment, although there is only a three percent chance that their disease will become life-threatening. In response to this issue, Genomic Health’s biopsy-based, multi-gene test has been clinically validated to predict aggressive cancer at the time of diagnosis, helping to identify those men who need immediate surgery or radiation therapy versus those who can confidently choose active surveillance. Using minimal tumor tissue from the original needle biopsy, the test builds on traditional clinical and pathologic factors to provide additional, clinically relevant insight into the underlying tumor biology of an individual patient before the prostate is removed. The result is a more precise and accurate assessment of risk, which helps more men avoid the lifelong complications associated with treatments they do not need, while directing aggressive therapy to those men who require immediate treatment.

With 14 prostate cancer studies, including more than 2,000 patients, we have developed and validated the only genomic test to assess the aggressiveness of prostate cancer and predict both near- and long-term outcomes to enable more precise patient risk stratification and better informed treatment decisions, giving physicians the confidence to place many low- to intermediate-risk patients on active surveillance.  It also helps physicians identify those patients who might be missed by conventional measures and who may benefit from more aggressive treatment. 

The Oncotype DX prostate cancer test is now covered for qualified patients by Medicare in the United States, giving nearly 60,000 prostate cancer patients the opportunity to personalize their cancer treatment.
