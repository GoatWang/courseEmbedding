Background and History

Berkshire Partners was formed in the mid-1980s with the goal of investing in growth companies and working closely with their management teams to realize the full potential of each business.  For over 30 years, we have worked together to pursue this goal.  Since our founding, we have built a culture of shared governance and collective decision-making that we view as distinctive in our industry.  This philosophy of collaboration has been a key element in our ability to attract and retain professionals who bring relevant experience and perspectives to our firm. As a firm, we have made over 115 investments in companies, beginning in 1984 with our investment in Carlin Foods.  Over the years, we have established deep knowledge and relationships in industries such as consumer products and retail, business services, industrials, transportation and communications.  Our investment mandate has been flexible throughout, allowing us to create value in many ways, from helping to build a leading wireless tower provider like Crown Castle and privatizing railroad systems in the United Kingdom through English, Welsh & Scottish Rail, to supporting significant growth in the cosmetics industry with Bare Escentuals.  While we are more likely to seek investments in our core areas of expertise, we remain opportunistic and regularly consider investments in a variety of sectors.We believe that alignment of interests is essential in fostering a constructive relationship with each company in our portfolio and with our investors.  In both cases, the fact that individuals at Berkshire comprise the firm’s largest investor group makes our commitment to work together with management, and on behalf of our investors, very clear.  By producing strong results at our portfolio companies, we help our management partners, our investors and ourselves achieve success.  Furthermore, we are grateful to have investors, who support long-term equity value creation, which enables us to maintain our focus on building enduring value within each company.For our first 20 years, we focused solely on investing through our private equity funds.  In 2007, we expanded our activities by launching Stockbridge, our fund that invests in marketable securities.  We saw this new initiative as a way of leveraging the skills, relationships and—we hope—wisdom that we have accumulated in the private equity world, while creating another opportunity to provide value to our investors. Today, Stockbridge has over $2.5 billion under management with leading institutions and select individuals investing alongside our team.  We take pride in the collaborative culture we have built across our firm.  Our investment process continues to be one based upon analytical rigor and consensus-based decision-making.  Within private equity, we actively engage with our portfolio companies to identify key strategic priorities and implement necessary operational improvements.  Stockbridge similarly values the wisdom of the team and the importance of deep research and has devoted considerable resources behind this goal. We draw on strong analytical skills of the collective team, our wealth of contacts built over 30 years as well as experience derived from investing over multiple economic cycles to support the management teams of the companies in which we have invested.  Together, we work hard to position our companies for long-term success.

Berkshire Partners LLC Key Developments

NEC Reportedly Considers Buying Civica For £900 million
Jul 13 17
NEC Corporation (TSE:6701) is looking at buying Civica Group Limited for £900 million and has hired advisors to work on an offer, Sky News reported. NEC lines up £900m bid for Civica. An auction of Civica, which began several weeks ago, has drawn initial offers from a trio of private equity firms: BC Partners, Berkshire Partners LLC and Partners Group Holding AG (SWX:PGHN), according to an industry source. It was unclear on July 13, 2017 how serious NEC's interest in Civica was, although it is said to have hired advisers to work on an offer. OMERS Private Equity hired Goldman Sachs to explore a potential sale of Civica earlier this year after noting premium valuations being paid for other companies in the sector. NEC could not be reached for comment on July 13, 2017.

ESP employs over 1,200 engineers, technicians and consultants with experience in IT services, military acquisition, logistics and program management; nearly all ESP employees have security clearances.
ESP’s founder James E. Hoffman, Jr. will retain a significant ownership position in the company and will remain Chief Executive Officer. 





Berkshire Managing Director Lawrence S. Hamelsky commented, “We are impressed by ESP’s exceptional track record of performance, deep customer relationships and strong culture. ESP is well-positioned to continue providing critical services to the C4ISR community while expanding its service offering and customer base. Berkshire is proud to partner with and support Jim and his team in this exciting chapter of growth.”
ESP Founder and Chief Executive Officer James E. Hoffman, Jr. said, “Berkshire’s history of working with founder-led management teams and cultural fit with ESP make it the ideal partner to help take ESP to its full potential.”
Berkshire Partners has a successful track record of investing in services companies and companies with an exposure to government customers. Prior transactions include TransDigm, a designer, producer and supplier of commercial and military aircraft components; AmSafe, a leading manufacturer of safety and securement equipment for the aviation, military and specialty vehicle markets; and Bartlett Nuclear, a provider of radiation protection support personnel and decontamination services to the Department of Energy and broader U.S. nuclear industry.
The Chertoff Group and the Avascent Group served as strategic advisors to Berkshire in support of this transaction.

Berkshire Partners to Invest in Grocery Outlet

Berkshire Partners LLC, a Boston-based private equity firm, yesterday signed a definitive agreement to make an equity investment in Grocery Outlet, Inc., an extreme-value grocery retailer with over 135 stores in the western United States. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
Headquartered in Berkeley, Calif., Grocery Outlet is a third-generation, family-owned business founded in 1946 by Jim Read, which offers brand-name products at up to 60 percent below traditional retailers’ prices by purchasing discounted surplus inventory directly from over 2,500 grocery manufacturers. Co-CEOs MacGregor Read and Eric Lindberg lead the company, and local independent operators manage its stores.
“We believe Grocery Outlet has a unique operating model that offers customers tremendous values on brand names they trust in a friendly, high-quality shopping environment,” said Chris Hadley, managing director of Berkshire Partners. “Over the past few years, Grocery Outlet has successfully invested in broadening its product offering, improving its marketing efforts and opening new stores. We believe the company is very well positioned for future growth.”
Grocery Outlet chairman Peter Read expressed the opinion that the deal would “develop future opportunities for our company.”
Berkshire Partners has a strong track record of investing in value retailers. Prior transactions include National Vision, an operator of value-oriented vision centers; Party City, a retailer of party goods; and Savers, a retailer of secondhand merchandise.
Grocery Outlet operates over 135 locations in Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.
Berkshire Partners has invested in mid-sized companies since the mid-1980s through seven investment funds with aggregate capital commitments of approximately $6.5 billion. It seeks transactions in which it can invest $50 million to $500 million of equity capital, and has developed specific industry experience in several areas, including retailing, consumer products, manufacturing, transportation, energy, business services and communications.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
