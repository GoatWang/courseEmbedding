                                              Developing a Low Cost Process to Make Graphene
                                             


Graphene � the Miracle Material
Graphene, a sheet of pure carbon that is only one atom thick, is flexible, transparent, impermeable to moisture, stronger than diamonds and more conductive than gold. Experts believe graphene to be the miracle material that will enable revolutionary applications such as bendable touch screen displays, rapid charge batteries, super-capacitors, low cost solar cells, extreme high-speed semiconductors, biosensors, as well as water purification.
While the incredible properties of graphene make it worthy of its "miracle material" label, the quest to actually produce and use graphene in commercial applications is full of challenges. Using simple adhesive tape to lift flakes of graphene from graphite, University of Manchester researchers Geim and Novoselov were awarded the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics for their pioneering isolation and characterization of graphene.
However, to unleash its full potential for commercial applications, a more highly controlled and efficient way to produce high quality graphene is needed. Many laboratories around the world have produced graphene sheets in very small sizes, such as centimeter squares. While there are advancements in creating large sheets, they are not yet at commercial scale.
A Flexible CVD Graphene Process
Carbon Sciences is developing an innovative flexible chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process that will rapidly produce commercial size sheets of graphene with the ability for in-situ fine-tuning of application-specific electrical and materials properties.
Unlike the "lifting" of naturally occurring graphene sheets from graphite, a CVD process can chemically synthesize graphene sheets using raw materials such as methane (CH4), the primary component of readily available and abundant natural gas. In a CVD process, carbon atoms are broken off of methane molecules and then reassembled into a pristine sheet of honeycomb graphene lattice. CVD machines are commercially available and are proven platforms for the high-speed production of materials for the electronics industry. A graphene specific CVD process would have process and catalyst innovations specifically designed for graphene.
Some of the key features under development and benefits:


Features
Benefits


 Multi-Layer Growth 
 A sheet of graphene is one atom thick. Therefore, it cannot be simply picked off the shelf and used at an industrial scale. Our CVD process will produce multiple layers of graphene along with layers of other materials to form a monolithic composite, which could be used for applications such as touch screen displays.



In-Situ Doping 
 As an integrated graphene fabrication process, we can "dope" the graphene with intentional impurities to modulate its electrical and materials properties. For example, studies have shown that nitrogen-doped graphene exhibits excellent electrochemical performance and is ideally suited for applications such as fuel cells, metal-air batteries and biosensors.



Tunable Sheet Resistance
 Different applications have different sheet resistance requirements. For example, touch screens, smart windows and flexible LCDs need a sheet resistance of approximately 200-500 Ohms/sq, while OLED displays and solar cells require less than 50 Ohms/sq. Our process will produce graphene with tunable sheet resistance using novel doping techniques and controlled multi-layer graphene growth.



Tunable Bandgap
 Semiconductors are the foundation of all digital electronics. One of the key requirements of a semiconductor is the ability to turn on and off its electron flow, through the modulation of its bandgap. Unfortunately, single sheet graphene has no bandgap and electrons flow through it at light speed. However, it is known that bilayer graphene (2 layers) exhibits bandgap under very specific (Bernal or AB) stacking order. Through the precise and controlled features of our CVD process, we expect to achieve precise and specific stacking order of graphene sheets to produce tunable bandgaps for various semiconductor applications, such as high-speed graphene transistors and circuits.



Research and Development Program
Carbon Sciences is currently funding a sponsored research project with the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) to develop this flexible CVD graphene process.

Carbon Sciences is a public corporation based in Santa Barbara. The company was founded in 2006 and incorporated as Zingerang, Inc. Originally, the company was involved in mobile communication, but has since switched to developing CO2 to fuel technology. Calcium Carbonate, CaCO3, was briefly looked at as another end product of CO2 recycling.[3] On April 2, 2007 the name was changed to Carbon Sciences Inc.[1] Their process differs from other projects in that it does not utilize high pressure or high temperature. This would be a significant advantage when trying to scale the technology up to commercial production.[4]

Technology[edit]
Byron Elton, the CEO and President of Carbon Sciences, explained in a report with Newsweek that they are in the developmental stages of a carbon recycling technology that involves capturing the greenhouse gas, CO2, and transforming it into gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel, methanol, propane, and butane. The main process involves taking the oxygen molecules out of water and carbon dioxide in a biocatalytic process. The remaining carbon monoxide and hydrogen are then combined to make basic hydrocarbons using the Fischer–Tropsch process. These hydrocarbons are then transformed into a variety of fuels. In the early stages of the technology the process required pure carbon dioxide and pure water. However, updates to the technology will allow it to be placed at the output of a large emitter, such as a power plant, where many other elements and compounds are present.[5][6][7] Their catalyst was developed in partnership with the University of Saskatchewan. If the methane is obtained from a landfill, the process would completely utilize recycled compounds.[8] The end product would be much cleaner than natural fuels because it would not contain smog-causing air pollutants.
An application has been sent in for funding from the Department of Energy under the category 'Innovative Concepts for Beneficial Uses of CO2' and a patent application has been submitted to the United States Patent and Trademark Office.[5] Similar technology is also being developed at the Sandia National Laboratories and at a joint venture between UOP LLC and the University of Southern California.[9] Robert Boyce, an editor for the New York Times, challenged the wisdom of carbon capture asserting that is an energy-intensive process and "unlike natural gas, carbon dioxide is a worthless waste product."[10] Elton responded with a letter that was published in both the print and online versions of the newspaper. In the letter he states "The problem with C.C.S. is not the C.C. (carbon capture), but the S. (storage). C.C.R., on the other hand (carbon capture and recycling), is a terrific bet on carbon." He also added "Our CO2-based technology is a radical departure from conventional GTL processes. We anticipate we will significantly reduce capital costs and be CO2 negative, two major current challenges."[11] After Carbon Sciences announced successful testing of their catalyst, Ariel Schwartz pointed out that until the project can be tested outside of a lab setting it is still a big "if".[12]

                                              Developing a Low Cost Process to Make Graphene
                                             


Graphene � the Miracle Material
Graphene, a sheet of pure carbon that is only one atom thick, is flexible, transparent, impermeable to moisture, stronger than diamonds and more conductive than gold. Experts believe graphene to be the miracle material that will enable revolutionary applications such as bendable touch screen displays, rapid charge batteries, super-capacitors, low cost solar cells, extreme high-speed semiconductors, biosensors, as well as water purification.
While the incredible properties of graphene make it worthy of its "miracle material" label, the quest to actually produce and use graphene in commercial applications is full of challenges. Using simple adhesive tape to lift flakes of graphene from graphite, University of Manchester researchers Geim and Novoselov were awarded the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics for their pioneering isolation and characterization of graphene.
However, to unleash its full potential for commercial applications, a more highly controlled and efficient way to produce high quality graphene is needed. Many laboratories around the world have produced graphene sheets in very small sizes, such as centimeter squares. While there are advancements in creating large sheets, they are not yet at commercial scale.
A Flexible CVD Graphene Process
Carbon Sciences is developing an innovative flexible chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process that will rapidly produce commercial size sheets of graphene with the ability for in-situ fine-tuning of application-specific electrical and materials properties.
Unlike the "lifting" of naturally occurring graphene sheets from graphite, a CVD process can chemically synthesize graphene sheets using raw materials such as methane (CH4), the primary component of readily available and abundant natural gas. In a CVD process, carbon atoms are broken off of methane molecules and then reassembled into a pristine sheet of honeycomb graphene lattice. CVD machines are commercially available and are proven platforms for the high-speed production of materials for the electronics industry. A graphene specific CVD process would have process and catalyst innovations specifically designed for graphene.
Some of the key features under development and benefits:


Features
Benefits


 Multi-Layer Growth 
 A sheet of graphene is one atom thick. Therefore, it cannot be simply picked off the shelf and used at an industrial scale. Our CVD process will produce multiple layers of graphene along with layers of other materials to form a monolithic composite, which could be used for applications such as touch screen displays.



In-Situ Doping 
 As an integrated graphene fabrication process, we can "dope" the graphene with intentional impurities to modulate its electrical and materials properties. For example, studies have shown that nitrogen-doped graphene exhibits excellent electrochemical performance and is ideally suited for applications such as fuel cells, metal-air batteries and biosensors.



Tunable Sheet Resistance
 Different applications have different sheet resistance requirements. For example, touch screens, smart windows and flexible LCDs need a sheet resistance of approximately 200-500 Ohms/sq, while OLED displays and solar cells require less than 50 Ohms/sq. Our process will produce graphene with tunable sheet resistance using novel doping techniques and controlled multi-layer graphene growth.



Tunable Bandgap
 Semiconductors are the foundation of all digital electronics. One of the key requirements of a semiconductor is the ability to turn on and off its electron flow, through the modulation of its bandgap. Unfortunately, single sheet graphene has no bandgap and electrons flow through it at light speed. However, it is known that bilayer graphene (2 layers) exhibits bandgap under very specific (Bernal or AB) stacking order. Through the precise and controlled features of our CVD process, we expect to achieve precise and specific stacking order of graphene sheets to produce tunable bandgaps for various semiconductor applications, such as high-speed graphene transistors and circuits.



Research and Development Program
Carbon Sciences is currently funding a sponsored research project with the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) to develop this flexible CVD graphene process.

Siliana Chanel-Gaspard


“Bodybuilding.com is a great source of knowledge! You can read about almost everything you need to know about training and nutrition, but just as importantly, it’s also a community, so you’re never alone.”


Andrew Chilson


“After following my own program and getting used to working out again, I followed Kris Gethin’s 12-Week Muscle-Building Trainer and Jim Stoppani’s Shortcut to Shred. Both were rough but I loved them.”


Samantha Bowman


“I began my journey by logging in to Bodybuilding.com and setting that first goal. Both Arnold’s Blueprint and LiveFit were there to guide me.”


Louis Sheppard


“Everything changed when I was on Bodybuilding.com and I saw the guy. Same exact height, same weight, everything—he was me. That’s what I was looking for.”
