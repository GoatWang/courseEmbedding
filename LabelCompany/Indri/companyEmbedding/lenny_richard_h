Private Equity | Revolving Door 
Former Hershey Chief Joins Friedman Fleischer & Lowe


				By Evelyn M. Rusli			
May 16, 2011 8:41 am
May 16, 2011 8:41 am




The Hershey CompanyRichard H. Lenny
Richard H. Lenny, the former chief executive and chairman of Hershey, has joined the private equity firm Friedman Fleischer & Lowe as an operating partner.
Mr. Lenny, a graduate of Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, was the chief executive of Hershey for six years. Before that, he was the former president of the Nabisco Biscuit Company and the former president of Pillsbury North America. He also spent nearly two decades at Kraft Foods, where he worked in marketing and sales.
“Following a 30-year career at top-tier consumer goods companies, the idea of working in private equity was intriguing given the opportunity to work across a wide array of consumer businesses,” Mr. Lenny said in an e-mail to DealBook.
At Friedman Fleischer & Lowe, Mr. Lenny will advise the private equity firm’s portfolio companies and help make new investments in the consumer retail space. The company’s previous investments include the mattress maker Temper-Pedic International and Discovery Foods. Its current portfolio includes Church’s Chicken, a fast food chain with more than 1,600 restaurants in nearly two dozen countries.
Revolving DoorView all posts
According to Mr. Lenny, the ongoing disruption in the consumer products industry has created a favorable environment for private equity players, especially those in the middle-market category, like Friedman Fleischer & Lowe. He says large-scale consumer product companies looking to grow rapidly will “be looking to potentially divest businesses that are no longer strategically aligned.” 
In addition, “family-owned businesses, in order to effectively compete, will look towards a firm such as F.F.L. for both operating capabilities and financial resources,” he said. Friedman Fleischer & Lowe will most likely focus on categories like health and wellness, sweet and salty snacks, and products related to ethnic foods, he added.
Mr. Lenny is a current board member of the McDonald’s Corporation, ConAgra Foods and Discover Financial.
