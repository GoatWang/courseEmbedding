        CASIN is an inhibitor of Cdc42 GTPase, a small GTPase of the Rho-subfamily that plays important roles in cytoskeleton organization, cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and vesicle trafficking. CASIN generated a rejuvenated phenotype of Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), reversing the aging-related and polarity phenotype of aged HSCs to that of young HSCs in vivo..
