(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The discussion and analysis presented below provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with ("item 8:Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"), which contains our financial statements.  The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements were made. The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those made, projected or implied in the forward-looking statements. We believe the assumptions underlying the financial statements are reasonable. However, our financial statements included herein may not necessarily reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the future.  BUSINESS OVERVIEW  Atlas America Public #9 LTD.("we", "us", or "the Partnership") is a Pennsylvania limited partnership and formed on July 27, 2000 with Atlas Resources, LLC serving as its managing general partner and operator ("Atlas Resources" or "MGP"). Atlas Resources is an indirect subsidiary of Atlas Resources Partners, L.P. ("ARP")

 We have drilled and currently operate wells located in Pennsylvania and Ohio. We have no employees and rely on our MGP for management, which in turn, relies on its ultimate parent company, Atlas Energy ("Atlas Energy")

                                         for administrative services.  The following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. Our operating cash flows are generated from our wells, which primarily produce natural gas, but also some oil. Our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated or third-party gas gathering systems. Our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production. We pay our MGP, as operator, a monthly well supervision fee, which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as:  - Well tending, routine maintenance and adjustment;  - Reading meters, recording production, pumping, maintaining appropriate books and records; and  - Preparation of reports for us and government agencies.  The well supervision fees, however, do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment, materials, and brine disposal. If these expenses are incurred, we pay cost for third-party services, materials, and a competitive charge for service performed directly by our MGP or its affiliates. Also, beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production, our MGP, as operator, may retain $200 per month per well to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well. As of December 31, 2013, our MGP had not withheld any funds for this purpose. The MGP is currently evaluating its right to exercise this option based on several factors such as commodity prices, the natural decline in well production, and current future plugging services and costs.  MARKETS AND COMPETITION  The availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us, and the price obtained, depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production, imports of foreign natural gas and oil, political instability or terrorist acts in oil and gas producing countries and regions, market demand, competition from other energy sources, the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce, other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity, availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities. Our MGP is responsible for selling our production. During 2013 and 2012, we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil. Product availability and price are the principal means of competing in selling natural gas and oil production. While it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry, we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry.  Natural Gas. We market the majority of our natural gas production to gas marketers directly or to third party plant operators who process and market our gas. The sales price of natural gas produced is a function of the market in the area and typically tied to a regional index. The pricing indices for the Appalachian Basin are Dominion South Point, Tennessee Gas Pipeline, and Transco Leidy Line.  We do not hold firm transportation obligations on any pipeline that requires payment of transportation fees regardless of natural gas production volumes. As is customary in certain of our other operating areas, we occasionally commit a predictable portion of monthly production to the purchaser in order to maintain a gathering agreement.  Crude Oil. Crude oil produced from our wells flows directly into leasehold storage tanks where it is picked up by an oil company or a common carrier acting for an oil company. The crude oil is typically sold at the prevailing spot market price for each region, less appropriate trucking charges. We do not have delivery commitments for fixed and determinable quantities of crude oil in any future periods under existing contracts or agreements.  For the year ended December 31, 2013, Chevron Natural Gas, Hess Corporation, EnergyMark, LLC, and Castleton Commodities Merchant Trading, LLC, accounted for approximately 34%, 13%, 11% and 11% of our total natural gas and oil production revenues, respectively, with no other single customer accounting for more than 10% for this period.  GENERAL TRENDS AND OUTLOOK  We expect our business to be affected by the following key trends. Our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results.  The areas in which we operate are experiencing a significant increase in natural gas and oil and production related to new and increased drilling for deeper natural gas formations and the implementation of new exploration and production techniques, including horizontal and multiple fracturing techniques. The increase in the supply of natural gas has put a downward pressure on domestic natural gas prices. While we anticipate continued high levels of exploration and production activities over the long-term in the areas in which we operate, fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new natural gas and oil reserves.  Our future production, cash flow, and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders, including the MGP, depend on our success in producing our current reserves efficiently. We face the challenge of natural production declines and volatile natural gas and oil prices. As initial reservoir pressures are depleted, natural gas production from particular wells decreases.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  GAS AND OIL PRODUCTION: The following table sets forth information related to our production revenues, volumes, sales prices, production costs and depletion during the periods indicated:   Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Production revenues (in thousands): Gas $ 682 $ 530 Oil 93 83 Total $ 775 $ 613 Production volumes: Gas (mcf/day) 492 480 Oil (bbls/day) 3 2 Total (mcfe/day) 510 492 Average sales price: (1) Gas (per mcf) (2) $ 4.08 $ 3.56 Oil (per bbl) $ 93.42 $ 95.43 Production costs: As a percent of revenues 61 % 79 % Per mcfe $ 2.55 $ 2.68 Depletion per mcfe $ 2.58 $ 1.87  (1) Average sales prices represent accrual basis pricing after reversing the effect of previously recognized gains resulting from prior period impairment charges.  (2) Average gas prices are calculated by including in total revenue derivative gains previously recognized into income in connection with prior period impairment charges and dividing by the total volume for the period. Previously recognized derivative gains were $51,100 and $94,800 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  Natural Gas Revenues. Our natural gas revenues were $682,300 and $529,900 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, an increase of $152,400 (29%). The $152,400 increase in natural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the prior year was attributable to a $140,000 increase in natural gas prices after the effect of financial hedges, which were driven by market conditions and a $12,400 increase in production volumes. Our production volumes increased to 492 mcf per day for the year ended December 31, 2013 from 480 mcf per day for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of 12 mcf per day (3%). The price we receive for our natural gas is primarily a result of the index driven agreements (See Item 1 "Business-Contractual Revenue Arrangements"). Thus, the price we receive for our natural gas may vary significantly each month as the underlying index changes in response to market conditions.  Oil Revenues. We drill wells primarily to produce natural gas, rather than oil, but some wells have limited oil production. Our oil revenues were $92,800 and $82,600 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, an increase of $10,200 (12%). The $10,200 increase in oil revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the prior year was attributable to a $12,200 increase in production volumes, partially offset by a $2,000 decrease in oil prices after the effect of financial hedges. Our production volumes increased to 3 bbls per day for the year ended December 31, 2013 from 2 bbls per day for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of 1 bbl per day (50%).  Costs and Expenses. Production expenses were $473,400 and $485,100 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, a decrease of $11,700 (2%). This decrease was primarily due to a combination of a decrease in water disposal charges and supervision fees. The lower disposal costs were due to a decrease in the amount of water produced.  Depletion of our oil and gas properties as a percentage of oil and gas revenues was 62% and 55% for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. These percentage changes were directly attributable to changes in revenues, oil and gas reserve quantities, product prices, production volumes and changes in the cost basis of oil and gas properties.  General and administrative expenses were $123,600 and $126,100 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, a decrease of $2,500 (2%). These expenses include third-party costs for services as well as the monthly administrative fees charged by our MGP and vary from period to period due to the timing of the costs and services provided to us.  There was no impairment of oil and gas properties for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Annually, we compare the carrying value of our proved developed oil and gas producing properties to their estimated fair market value. To the extent our carrying value exceeds the estimated fair market value, an impairment charge is recognized. As a result of this assessment, no impairment charge was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. This charge is based on reserve quantities, future market prices and our carrying value. We cannot provide any assurance that similar charges may or may not be taken in future periods.  Liquidity and Capital Resources. Cash provided by operating activities increased $106,200 for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $240,800 as compared to $134,600 for the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was due to an increase in net earnings before depletion, asset impairment, and accretion of $176,800 and an increase in the change in accrued liabilities of $15,000, partially offset by a decrease in the change accounts receivable trade-affiliate of $42,500 and; a decrease in a non-cash loss on derivative value of $43,100, fir the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012.  Cash provided by investing activities was $300 and $500 during the years ended December 31, 2013, and 2012, respectively, resulting from the sale of tangible equipment.  Cash used in financing activities increased $1,300 to $199,600 for the year ended December 31, 2013, from $198,300 for the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was due to an increase in cash distributions to partners.  Our MGP may withhold funds for future plugging and abandonment costs. The MGP is currently evaluating its right to exercise this option based on several factors such as commodity prices, the natural decline in well production, and current future plugging services and costs. Through December 31, 2013, our MGP had not withheld any funds for this purpose. Any additional funds, if required, will be obtained from production revenues or borrowings from our MGP or its affiliates, which are not contractually committed to make loans to us. The amount that we may borrow may not at any time exceed 5% of our total subscriptions, and we will not borrow from third-parties.  We are generally limited to the amount of funds generated by the cash flow from our operations, which we believe is adequate to fund future operations and distributions to our partners. Historically, there has been no need to borrow funds from our MGP to fund operations.  Asset Impairment  There were no asset impairments recognized for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.  ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION  Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the release of regulated materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection or human health or safety (see "Item 1:  Environmental laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last 25 years, and we anticipate that there will be continuing changes. Trends in environmental regulation include increased reporting obligations and placing more restrictions and limitations on activities, such as emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, generation and disposal of wastes, including wastes that may have naturally occurring radioactivity, and use, storage and handling of chemical substances that may impact human health, the environment and/or endangered species. Other increasingly stringent environmental restrictions and limitations have resulted in increased operating costs for us and other similar businesses throughout the United States. It is possible that the costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations may continue to increase. We will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and to plan accordingly, but there can be no assurance that we will identify and properly anticipate each such change, or that our efforts will prevent material costs, if any, from rising.  CHANGES IN PRICES AND INFLATION  Our revenues and the value of our assets have been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas and oil market prices. Natural gas and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict.  Inflation affects the operating expenses of our operations. Inflationary trends may occur if commodity prices were to increase, since such an increase may cause the demand for energy equipment and services to increase, thereby increasing the costs of acquiring or obtaining such equipment and services. While we anticipate that inflation will affect our future operating costs, we cannot predict the timing or amounts of any such effects.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of actual revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results may differ from the estimates on which our financial statements are prepared at any given point of time. Changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include revenue and expense accruals, depletion and amortization, asset impairment, fair value of derivative instruments, and the probability of forecasted transactions. We summarize our significant accounting policies within our financial statements included in ("item 8:Financial Statements") included in this report. The critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified are discussed below.  Depletion and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  Long-Lived Assets. The cost of natural gas and oil properties, less estimated salvage value, is generally depleted on the units-of-production method.  Natural gas and oil properties are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. A long-lived asset is considered to be impaired when the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than its carrying amount. The undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are based upon our estimates that rely on various assumptions, including natural gas and oil prices, production and operating expenses. Any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. As discussed in General Trends and Outlook within this section, recent increases in natural gas drilling have driven an increase in the supply of natural gas and put a downward pressure on domestic prices. Further declines in natural gas prices may result in additional impairment charges in future periods.  There was no impairment of proved gas and oil properties recorded by us for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The estimate of fair value of these gas and oil properties was impacted by, among other factors, the deterioration of natural gas prices at the date of measurement.  Events or changes in circumstances that would indicate the need for impairment testing include, among other factors: operating losses; unused capacity; market value declines; technological developments resulting in obsolescence; changes in demand for products manufactured by others utilizing our services or for our products; changes in competition and competitive practices; uncertainties associated with the United States and world economies; changes in the expected level of environmental capital, operating or remediation expenditures; and changes in governmental regulations or actions.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  We have established a hierarchy to measure our financial instruments at fair value which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The hierarchy defines three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:  Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical, unrestricted assets and liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.  Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset and liability or can be corroborated with observable market data for substantially the entire contractual term of the asset or liability.  Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that reflect the entity's own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in the pricing of the asset or liability and are consequently not based on market activity but rather through particular valuation techniques.  We use a fair value methodology to value the assets and liabilities for our outstanding derivative contracts. Our commodity hedges are calculated based on observable market data related to the change in price of the underlying commodity and are therefore defined as Level 2 fair value measurements.  Liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include our asset retirement obligations ("ARO") that are defined as Level  Reserve Estimates  Our estimates of proved natural gas and oil reserves and future net revenues from them are based upon reserve analyses that rely upon various assumptions, including those required by the SEC, as to natural gas and oil prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures and availability of funds. The accuracy of these reserve estimates is a function of many factors including the following: the quality and quantity of available data, the interpretation of that data, the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions, and the judgments of the individuals preparing the estimates. We engaged Wright and Company, Inc., an independent third-party reserve engineer, to prepare a report of our proved reserves (see "item 2:Properties").  Any significant variance in the assumptions utilized in the calculation of our reserve estimates could materially affect the estimated quantity of our reserves. As a result, our estimates of proved natural gas and oil reserves are inherently imprecise. Actual future production, natural gas and oil prices, revenues, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas and oil reserves may vary substantially from our estimates or estimates contained in the reserve reports and may affect our ability to pay distributions. In addition, our proved reserves may be subject to downward or upward revision based upon production history, prevailing natural gas and oil prices, mechanical difficulties, governmental regulation and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our reserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows impact the calculation of impairment and depletion of oil and gas properties. Generally, an increase or decrease in reserves without a corresponding change in capitalized costs will have a corresponding inverse impact to depletion expense.  Asset Retirement Obligations  We recognize and estimate the liability for the plugging and abandonment of our gas and oil wells. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset.  The estimated liability is based on our historical experience in plugging and abandoning wells, estimated remaining lives of those wells based on reserve estimates, external estimates as to the cost to plug and abandon the wells in the future and federal and state regulatory requirements. The liability is discounted using our MGP's assumed credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. Revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in estimates of plugging and abandonment costs or remaining lives of the wells, or if federal or state regulators enact new plugging and abandonment requirements. We have no assets legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations. Except for our gas and oil properties, we believe that there are no other material retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets.  Working Interest  Our Partnership Agreement establishes that revenues and expenses will be allocated to our MGP and limited partners based on their ratio of capital contributions to total contributions ("working interest"). Our MGP is also provided an additional working interest of 7% as provided in the Partnership Agreement. Due to the time necessary to complete drilling operations and accumulate all drilling costs, estimated working interest percentage ownership rates are utilized to allocate revenues and expense until the wells are completely drilled and turned on-line into production. Once the wells are completed, the final working interest ownership of the partners is determined and any previously allocated revenues based on the estimated working interest percentage ownership are adjusted to conform to the final working interest percentage ownership.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED)  Forward-Looking Statements  When used in this Form 10-Q, the words "believes", "anticipates," "expects" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from the results stated or implied in this document. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to forward-looking statements which we may make to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Form 10-Q or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.  This Management's Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with our Financial Statements and the Notes to our Financial Statements.  General  Atlas America Public #9 LTD. ("we", "us", or the "Partnership") is a Pennsylvania limited partnership, formed on July 27, 2000 with Atlas Resources, LLC serving as its Managing General Partner and Operator ("Atlas Resources" or "MGP"). Atlas Resources is an indirect subsidiary of Atlas Resource Partners, L.P. ("ARP") 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    ARP, -1.08%
 We have drilled and currently operate wells located in Pennsylvania and Ohio. We have no employees and rely on our MGP for management, which in turn, relies on its parent company, Atlas Energy L.P. ("Atlas Energy"), for administrative services.  Our operating cash flows are generated from our wells, which produce natural gas and oil. Our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated and or third-party gas gathering systems. We do not plan to sell any of our wells and intend to produce them until they are depleted or become uneconomical to produce, at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold. We expect that no other wells will be drilled and no additional funds will be required for drilling.  Overview  The following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. Our operating cash flows are generated from our wells, which produce primarily natural gas, but also some oil. Our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated and or third-party gas gathering systems. Our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production. We pay our MGP, as operator, a monthly well supervision fee, which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as:  · well tending, routine maintenance and adjustment;  · reading meters, recording production, pumping, maintaining appropriate books and records; and  · preparation of reports for us and government agencies.  The well supervision fees, however, do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment, materials, and brine disposal. If these expenses are incurred, we pay cost for third-party services, materials, and a competitive charge for services performed directly by our MGP or its affiliates. Also, beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production, our MGP, as operator, may retain $200 per month, per well to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well. As of June 30, 2013, our MGP had not withheld any funds for this purpose.  Markets and Competition  The availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us, and the price obtained, depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production, imports of foreign natural gas and oil, political instability or terrorist acts in oil and gas producing countries and regions, market demand, competition from other energy sources, the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce, other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity, availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities. Our MGP is responsible for selling our production. During 2013 and 2012, we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil. Product availability and price are the principal means of competition in selling natural gas and oil production. While it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry, we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry.  Results of Operations  The following table sets forth information relating to our production revenues, volumes, sales prices, production costs, and depletion during the periods indicated:   Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2013 2012 2013 2012 Production revenues (in thousands): $ $ $ $ Gas........................................................................... 194 109 359 233 Oil............................................................................... 29 32 65 47 $ $ $ $ Total.......................................................................... 223 141 424 280 Production volumes: Gas (mcf/day) (1).......................................... 498 502 505 467 Oil (bbl/day) (1)................................................ 4 4 4 3 Total (mcfe/day) (1)...................................... 522 526 529 485 Average sales prices: (2) $ $ $ $ Gas (per mcf) (1) (3).................................. 4.60 2.96 4.23 3.35 $ $ $ $ Oil (per bbl) (1)................................................. 90.93 100.15 91.76 100.18 Production costs: As a percent of revenues....................... 55% 88% 58% 86% $ $ $ $ Per mcfe (1)....................................................... 2.61 2.61 2.57 2.76 $ $ $ $ Depletion per mcfe........................................ 3.20 1.42 3.19 1.42 ___________  (1) "Mcf" represents thousand cubic feet, "mcfe" represents thousand cubic feet equivalent and "bbl" represents barrels. Bbl is converted to mcfe using the ratio of six mcfs to one bbl.  (2) Average sales prices represent accrual basis pricing after adjusting for the effect of previously recognized gains resulting from prior period impairment charges.  (3) Average gas prices are calculated by including in total revenue derivative gains previously recognized into income in connection with prior period impairment charges and dividing by the total volume for the period. Previously recognized derivative gains were $14,600 and $25,800 for the three months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Previously recognized derivative gains were $28,800 and $51,200 for the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  Natural Gas Revenues. Our natural gas revenues were $193,800 and $109,500 for the three months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, an increase of $84,300 (77%). The $84,300 increase in natural gas revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2013 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $85,100 increase in our natural gas sales prices after the effect of financial hedges, which was driven by market conditions, partially offset by a $800 decrease in production volumes. Our production volumes decreased to 498 mcf per day for the three months ended June 30, 2013 from 502 mcf per day for the three months ended June 30, 2012, a decrease of 4 mcf per day (1%). The overall decrease in natural gas production volumes for the three months ended June 30, 2013 as compared to the prior year similar period resulted primarily from the normal decline inherent in the life of a well.  Our natural gas revenues were $358,600 and $233,100 for the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, an increase of $125,500 (54%). The $125,500 increase in natural gas revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2013 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $107,500 increase in our natural gas sales prices after the effect of financial hedges, which was driven by market conditions, and a $18,000 increase in production volumes. Our production volumes increased to 505 mcf per day for the six months ended June 30, 2013 from 467 mcf per day for the six months ended June 30, 2012, an increase of 38 mcf per day (8%). The overall increase in natural gas production volumes for the six months ended June 30, 2013 as compared to the prior year similar period due to an increase in available pipeline capacity.  Oil Revenues. We drill wells primarily to produce natural gas, rather than oil, but some wells have limited oil production. Our oil revenues were $29,200 and $31,900 for the three months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, a decrease of $2,700 (8%). The $2,700 decrease in oil revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2013 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $2,900 decrease in oil prices after the effect of financial hedges, partially offset by a $200 increase in production volumes. Our production volumes increased to 3.54 bbls per day for the three months ended June 30, 2013 from 3.51 bbls per day for the three months ended June 30, 2012, an increase of .03 bbls per day (1%).  Our oil revenues were $64,800 and $47,200 for the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, an increase of $17,600 (37%). The $17,600 increase in oil revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2013 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $23,600 increase in production volumes, partially offset by a $6,000 decrease in oil prices after the effect of financial hedges. Our production volumes increased to 3.9 bbls per day for the six months ended June 30, 2013 from 2.59 bbls per day for the six months ended June 30, 2012, an increase of 1.31 bbls per day (51%).  Costs and Expenses. Production expenses were $123,300 and $124,300 for the three months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, a decrease of $1,000 (1%). Production expenses were $245,600 and $242,200 for the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, an increase of $3,400 (1%). The change in production costs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 is mostly due to an increase in transportation costs offset by a decrease in repairs and maintenance.  Depletion of oil and gas properties as a percentage of oil and gas revenues was 68% and 48% for the three months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and 72% and 44% for the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. These percentage changes are directly attributable to changes in revenues, oil and gas reserve quantities, product prices and production volumes and changes in the depletable cost basis of oil and gas properties.  General and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 were $29,000 and $27,500, respectively, an increase of $1,500 (5%). For the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 these expenses were $63,700 and $63,600, respectively, an increase of $100. These expenses include third-party costs for services as well as the monthly administrative fees charged by our MGP. The increase for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 are primarily due to third-party costs as compared to the prior year similar period.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Cash provided by operating activities decreased $8,000 in the six months ended June 30, 2013 to $109,400 as compared to $117,400 for the six months ended June 30, 2012. This decrease was due to a decrease in the change in accrued liabilities of $4,500, a decrease in a net non-cash loss on hedge instruments of $22,300, and a decrease in the change in accounts receivable trade-affiliate of $120,800. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in net earnings before depletion and accretion of $139,600 for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2012.  Cash provided by investing activities was $300 and $500 for the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, from the proceeds from the sale of tangible equipment.  Cash used in financing activities decreased $75,300 during the six months ended June 30, 2013 to $82,600 from $157,900 for the six months ended June 30, 2012. This decrease was due to a decrease in cash distributions to partners.  Our MGP may withhold funds for future plugging and abandonment costs. Any additional funds, if required, will be obtained from production revenues or borrowings from our MGP or its affiliates, which are not contractually committed to make loans to us. The amount that we may borrow may not at any time exceed 5% of our total subscriptions and we will not borrow from third-parties.  The Partnership is generally limited to the amount of funds generated by the cash flows from our operations, which we believe is adequate to fund future operations and distributions to our partners. Historically, there has been no need to borrow funds from our MGP to fund operations.  Critical Accounting Policies  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to our asset retirement obligations, depletion and certain accrued receivables and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of significant accounting policies we have adopted and followed in the preparation of our financial statements is included within "Notes to Financial Statements" in Part I, Item 1, "Financial Statements" in this quarterly report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.
