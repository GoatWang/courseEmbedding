Vice president, Information Technology
Align Technology Inc.
Residence: Fremont
Education: Master’s, computer applications, National Institute of Technology, Trichy India
Year joined this company: 2003
Your biggest impact/success at Align Technology: Building a strong team of technologists with good business acumen who get stuff done and thrive in an environment of shared responsibility of business outcomes. Together, we have created the next-generation architecture for consumer and customer engagement through a cloud platform that allows for experimentation and fast learning, as well as an enterprise platform with a mix of on-premise, SaaS and cloud solutions for global scalability and security. Underlying this is a data architecture that allows for predictive analytics and machine learning to improve product performance and consumer conversion.

How do you strike a balance between information sharing and information security? Information sharing and security is a fine balance between who needs what, when and where. Finding that balance is a mix of individual responsibility, role access and privileges, and technology.




 


The single biggest issue standing in the way of you as a CIO in achieving your objectives: As we grow, we need to stay agile and keep it simple. This can be a challenge when you factor in global expansion, resistance to change and rapid pace of technology advancements. However, through the strong team we have built, we know we can overcome these obstacles.
What keeps you up at night? In this field, only the paranoid survive. As we transform the dental industry from using old analog approach to straightening teeth with metal braces, to using digital technology like the Invisalign system for a better smile and the iTero system for digital impressions, I am constantly thinking about how we stay ahead with the right team capabilities, business processes and technologies to remove barriers to adoption.
Your can’t-do-without technology or gadget: The Internet.
