Bruce Michael Alberts (born April 14, 1938 in Chicago, Illinois) is an American biochemist and the Chancellor’s Leadership Chair in Biochemistry and Biophysics for Science and Education at the University of California, San Francisco.[3] He has done important work studying the protein complexes which enable chromosome replication when living cells divide. He is known as an original author of the "canonical, influential, and best-selling scientific textbook" Molecular Biology of the Cell,[4] and as Editor-in-Chief of Science magazine.[5][6]
Alberts was the president of the National Academy of Sciences from 1993 to 2005.[4] He is known for his work in forming science public policy, and has served as United States Science Envoy to Pakistan and Indonesia.[2][7] He has stated that "Science education should be about learning to think and solve problems like a scientist—insisting, for all citizens, that statements be evaluated using evidence and logic the way scientists evaluate statements."[8]

Education[edit]
After graduating from New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois,[9] Alberts attended Harvard College, as a pre-medicine major.[4][10] Bored by assigned laboratory "cooking classes", he petitioned to skip the physical chemistry laboratory requirement and instead was allowed to work with his tutor Jacques Fresco, in Paul M. Doty's laboratory. The summer's research led to the publication of two successful papers on mismatch errors in the helical structures of DNA and RNA,[11][12] and Alberts decided to continue on in biophysics.[4] He graduated with his A.B. in biochemical sciences, summa cum laude, in 1960.[4]
Alberts then worked with Paul M. Doty on an "enormously ambitious" thesis on DNA replication, attempting to solve the genetic code using nearest neighbor analysis of DNA polymerase.[9][10] After failing his first oral examination in spring 1965, he completed his Ph.D. research in fall 1965.[2][9][13] His doctorate in biophysics was published by Harvard University in 1966.[1] Alberts credits his initial failure with teaching him much more than his successes.[9] "That was a very important learning experience for me. I had decided that experimental strategy was everything in science, and nobody had ever told me anything about this."[2]
Career[edit]
After graduating, Alberts went to the Institut de Biologie Moleculaire[14] at the University of Geneva as a postdoctoral fellow, and worked with Richard H. Epstein on genes involved in DNA replication of phage T4. Epstein and his students had shown that there were at least seven different proteins needed for replication of T4 DNA. Alberts decided to do something that no one else was doing, and developed a DNA column for the purification of proteins that bound to DNA.[2] This enabled him to purify T4 Bacteriophage Gene 32.[15]
In 1966, Alberts joined the Department of Biochemical Sciences at Princeton University as an Assistant Professor. In 1971, he became an Associate Professor and in 1973 a full Professor, holding the Damon Pfeiffer Professorship in life sciences from 1975-1976.[14][16][17] At Princeton, he continued to work in the area of protein biochemistry, reconstituting systems.[2]
In 1976, Alberts accepted a position as professor and vice-chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco.[16] Also in 1976, he and his students were able to add all seven proteins to double-stranded DNA in an appropriate magnesium concentration to make DNA. More years of research were spent understanding the reactions involved. Another important step in understanding DNA synthesis was realizing that leading strand DNA polymerase and lagging strand DNA polymerase were coupled.[2][18]
Alberts was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1978.[16][19] From 1981 to 1985 Alberts held the American Cancer Society Research Professorship, a title granted for life as of 1980.[14] From 1985 to 1990, he was Chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco. From 1990-1993 he again held the American Cancer Society Research Professorship.[16]
Science and education[edit]
Alberts served as the President of the National Academy of Sciences for two terms from 1993 until 2005.[14][20]
Alberts has long been committed to the improvement of science education, dedicating much of his time to educational projects such as City Science, a program seeking to improve science teaching in San Francisco elementary schools.[4] He has served on the advisory board of the National Science Resources Center, a joint project of the National Academy of Sciences and the Smithsonian Institution working with teachers, scientists, and school systems to improve teaching of science as well as on the National Academy of Sciences' National Committee on Science Education Standards and Assessment. He has published important National Academies reports: the National Science Education Standards (NSES; NRC, 1996), intended to change the way that science is taught K-12, and Inquiry and the National Science Education Standards (NRC, 2000)[20]
The Bruce Alberts Award for Excellence in Science Education is given in his name to those who have made outstanding contributions in science education.[21]
He has served in different capacities on a number of advisory and editorial boards, including as chair of the Commission on Life Sciences, National Research Council.[4] Prior to his election as President of the National Academy of Sciences in 1995 he was president-elect of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.[18] From 2007-2008 he served as president of the American Society for Cell Biology.[22]
He served as a trustee of the Carnegie Corporation of New York from 2000 to 2009.[23][24] He and others have critiqued the biomedical research system, pointing out what they consider "systemic flaws"[25] and have created the Rescuing Biomedical Research organization, to "collect and organize input for solutions"[26] to the problems identified by themselves[25] and others.[27]
Alberts was Editor-in-Chief of the American Association for the Advancement of Science's flagship publication, Science for five years from 2008-2013.[28] He is one of the founding editors of the journal Cell Biology Education.[20]
International work[edit]
From 2000-2009, Alberts was the Co-chair of the InterAcademy Council, an advisory institution in Amsterdam governed by the presidents of fifteen science academies from around the world, and a member of the Science Initiative Group board.[29]
In his June 4, 2009 speech at Cairo University, US President Barack Obama announced a new Science Envoy program as part of a "new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world." In January 2010, Bruce Alberts, Ahmed Zewail, and Elias Zerhouni became the first US science envoys to Islam, visiting Muslim-majority countries from North Africa to Southeast Asia.[30]

Bruce Michael Alberts (born April 14, 1938 in Chicago, Illinois) is an American biochemist and the Chancellor’s Leadership Chair in Biochemistry and Biophysics for Science and Education at the University of California, San Francisco.[3] He has done important work studying the protein complexes which enable chromosome replication when living cells divide. He is known as an original author of the "canonical, influential, and best-selling scientific textbook" Molecular Biology of the Cell,[4] and as Editor-in-Chief of Science magazine.[5][6]
Alberts was the president of the National Academy of Sciences from 1993 to 2005.[4] He is known for his work in forming science public policy, and has served as United States Science Envoy to Pakistan and Indonesia.[2][7] He has stated that "Science education should be about learning to think and solve problems like a scientist—insisting, for all citizens, that statements be evaluated using evidence and logic the way scientists evaluate statements."[8]

Education[edit]
After graduating from New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois,[9] Alberts attended Harvard College, as a pre-medicine major.[4][10] Bored by assigned laboratory "cooking classes", he petitioned to skip the physical chemistry laboratory requirement and instead was allowed to work with his tutor Jacques Fresco, in Paul M. Doty's laboratory. The summer's research led to the publication of two successful papers on mismatch errors in the helical structures of DNA and RNA,[11][12] and Alberts decided to continue on in biophysics.[4] He graduated with his A.B. in biochemical sciences, summa cum laude, in 1960.[4]
Alberts then worked with Paul M. Doty on an "enormously ambitious" thesis on DNA replication, attempting to solve the genetic code using nearest neighbor analysis of DNA polymerase.[9][10] After failing his first oral examination in spring 1965, he completed his Ph.D. research in fall 1965.[2][9][13] His doctorate in biophysics was published by Harvard University in 1966.[1] Alberts credits his initial failure with teaching him much more than his successes.[9] "That was a very important learning experience for me. I had decided that experimental strategy was everything in science, and nobody had ever told me anything about this."[2]
Career[edit]
After graduating, Alberts went to the Institut de Biologie Moleculaire[14] at the University of Geneva as a postdoctoral fellow, and worked with Richard H. Epstein on genes involved in DNA replication of phage T4. Epstein and his students had shown that there were at least seven different proteins needed for replication of T4 DNA. Alberts decided to do something that no one else was doing, and developed a DNA column for the purification of proteins that bound to DNA.[2] This enabled him to purify T4 Bacteriophage Gene 32.[15]
In 1966, Alberts joined the Department of Biochemical Sciences at Princeton University as an Assistant Professor. In 1971, he became an Associate Professor and in 1973 a full Professor, holding the Damon Pfeiffer Professorship in life sciences from 1975-1976.[14][16][17] At Princeton, he continued to work in the area of protein biochemistry, reconstituting systems.[2]
In 1976, Alberts accepted a position as professor and vice-chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco.[16] Also in 1976, he and his students were able to add all seven proteins to double-stranded DNA in an appropriate magnesium concentration to make DNA. More years of research were spent understanding the reactions involved. Another important step in understanding DNA synthesis was realizing that leading strand DNA polymerase and lagging strand DNA polymerase were coupled.[2][18]
Alberts was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1978.[16][19] From 1981 to 1985 Alberts held the American Cancer Society Research Professorship, a title granted for life as of 1980.[14] From 1985 to 1990, he was Chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco. From 1990-1993 he again held the American Cancer Society Research Professorship.[16]
Science and education[edit]
Alberts served as the President of the National Academy of Sciences for two terms from 1993 until 2005.[14][20]
Alberts has long been committed to the improvement of science education, dedicating much of his time to educational projects such as City Science, a program seeking to improve science teaching in San Francisco elementary schools.[4] He has served on the advisory board of the National Science Resources Center, a joint project of the National Academy of Sciences and the Smithsonian Institution working with teachers, scientists, and school systems to improve teaching of science as well as on the National Academy of Sciences' National Committee on Science Education Standards and Assessment. He has published important National Academies reports: the National Science Education Standards (NSES; NRC, 1996), intended to change the way that science is taught K-12, and Inquiry and the National Science Education Standards (NRC, 2000)[20]
The Bruce Alberts Award for Excellence in Science Education is given in his name to those who have made outstanding contributions in science education.[21]
He has served in different capacities on a number of advisory and editorial boards, including as chair of the Commission on Life Sciences, National Research Council.[4] Prior to his election as President of the National Academy of Sciences in 1995 he was president-elect of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.[18] From 2007-2008 he served as president of the American Society for Cell Biology.[22]
He served as a trustee of the Carnegie Corporation of New York from 2000 to 2009.[23][24] He and others have critiqued the biomedical research system, pointing out what they consider "systemic flaws"[25] and have created the Rescuing Biomedical Research organization, to "collect and organize input for solutions"[26] to the problems identified by themselves[25] and others.[27]
Alberts was Editor-in-Chief of the American Association for the Advancement of Science's flagship publication, Science for five years from 2008-2013.[28] He is one of the founding editors of the journal Cell Biology Education.[20]
International work[edit]
From 2000-2009, Alberts was the Co-chair of the InterAcademy Council, an advisory institution in Amsterdam governed by the presidents of fifteen science academies from around the world, and a member of the Science Initiative Group board.[29]
In his June 4, 2009 speech at Cairo University, US President Barack Obama announced a new Science Envoy program as part of a "new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world." In January 2010, Bruce Alberts, Ahmed Zewail, and Elias Zerhouni became the first US science envoys to Islam, visiting Muslim-majority countries from North Africa to Southeast Asia.[30]

Bruce Michael Alberts (born April 14, 1938 in Chicago, Illinois) is an American biochemist and the Chancellor’s Leadership Chair in Biochemistry and Biophysics for Science and Education at the University of California, San Francisco.[3] He has done important work studying the protein complexes which enable chromosome replication when living cells divide. He is known as an original author of the "canonical, influential, and best-selling scientific textbook" Molecular Biology of the Cell,[4] and as Editor-in-Chief of Science magazine.[5][6]
Alberts was the president of the National Academy of Sciences from 1993 to 2005.[4] He is known for his work in forming science public policy, and has served as United States Science Envoy to Pakistan and Indonesia.[2][7] He has stated that "Science education should be about learning to think and solve problems like a scientist—insisting, for all citizens, that statements be evaluated using evidence and logic the way scientists evaluate statements."[8]

Education[edit]
After graduating from New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois,[9] Alberts attended Harvard College, as a pre-medicine major.[4][10] Bored by assigned laboratory "cooking classes", he petitioned to skip the physical chemistry laboratory requirement and instead was allowed to work with his tutor Jacques Fresco, in Paul M. Doty's laboratory. The summer's research led to the publication of two successful papers on mismatch errors in the helical structures of DNA and RNA,[11][12] and Alberts decided to continue on in biophysics.[4] He graduated with his A.B. in biochemical sciences, summa cum laude, in 1960.[4]
Alberts then worked with Paul M. Doty on an "enormously ambitious" thesis on DNA replication, attempting to solve the genetic code using nearest neighbor analysis of DNA polymerase.[9][10] After failing his first oral examination in spring 1965, he completed his Ph.D. research in fall 1965.[2][9][13] His doctorate in biophysics was published by Harvard University in 1966.[1] Alberts credits his initial failure with teaching him much more than his successes.[9] "That was a very important learning experience for me. I had decided that experimental strategy was everything in science, and nobody had ever told me anything about this."[2]
Career[edit]
After graduating, Alberts went to the Institut de Biologie Moleculaire[14] at the University of Geneva as a postdoctoral fellow, and worked with Richard H. Epstein on genes involved in DNA replication of phage T4. Epstein and his students had shown that there were at least seven different proteins needed for replication of T4 DNA. Alberts decided to do something that no one else was doing, and developed a DNA column for the purification of proteins that bound to DNA.[2] This enabled him to purify T4 Bacteriophage Gene 32.[15]
In 1966, Alberts joined the Department of Biochemical Sciences at Princeton University as an Assistant Professor. In 1971, he became an Associate Professor and in 1973 a full Professor, holding the Damon Pfeiffer Professorship in life sciences from 1975-1976.[14][16][17] At Princeton, he continued to work in the area of protein biochemistry, reconstituting systems.[2]
In 1976, Alberts accepted a position as professor and vice-chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco.[16] Also in 1976, he and his students were able to add all seven proteins to double-stranded DNA in an appropriate magnesium concentration to make DNA. More years of research were spent understanding the reactions involved. Another important step in understanding DNA synthesis was realizing that leading strand DNA polymerase and lagging strand DNA polymerase were coupled.[2][18]
Alberts was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1978.[16][19] From 1981 to 1985 Alberts held the American Cancer Society Research Professorship, a title granted for life as of 1980.[14] From 1985 to 1990, he was Chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco. From 1990-1993 he again held the American Cancer Society Research Professorship.[16]
Science and education[edit]
Alberts served as the President of the National Academy of Sciences for two terms from 1993 until 2005.[14][20]
Alberts has long been committed to the improvement of science education, dedicating much of his time to educational projects such as City Science, a program seeking to improve science teaching in San Francisco elementary schools.[4] He has served on the advisory board of the National Science Resources Center, a joint project of the National Academy of Sciences and the Smithsonian Institution working with teachers, scientists, and school systems to improve teaching of science as well as on the National Academy of Sciences' National Committee on Science Education Standards and Assessment. He has published important National Academies reports: the National Science Education Standards (NSES; NRC, 1996), intended to change the way that science is taught K-12, and Inquiry and the National Science Education Standards (NRC, 2000)[20]
The Bruce Alberts Award for Excellence in Science Education is given in his name to those who have made outstanding contributions in science education.[21]
He has served in different capacities on a number of advisory and editorial boards, including as chair of the Commission on Life Sciences, National Research Council.[4] Prior to his election as President of the National Academy of Sciences in 1995 he was president-elect of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.[18] From 2007-2008 he served as president of the American Society for Cell Biology.[22]
He served as a trustee of the Carnegie Corporation of New York from 2000 to 2009.[23][24] He and others have critiqued the biomedical research system, pointing out what they consider "systemic flaws"[25] and have created the Rescuing Biomedical Research organization, to "collect and organize input for solutions"[26] to the problems identified by themselves[25] and others.[27]
Alberts was Editor-in-Chief of the American Association for the Advancement of Science's flagship publication, Science for five years from 2008-2013.[28] He is one of the founding editors of the journal Cell Biology Education.[20]
International work[edit]
From 2000-2009, Alberts was the Co-chair of the InterAcademy Council, an advisory institution in Amsterdam governed by the presidents of fifteen science academies from around the world, and a member of the Science Initiative Group board.[29]
In his June 4, 2009 speech at Cairo University, US President Barack Obama announced a new Science Envoy program as part of a "new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world." In January 2010, Bruce Alberts, Ahmed Zewail, and Elias Zerhouni became the first US science envoys to Islam, visiting Muslim-majority countries from North Africa to Southeast Asia.[30]

Bruce Michael Alberts (born April 14, 1938 in Chicago, Illinois) is an American biochemist and the Chancellor’s Leadership Chair in Biochemistry and Biophysics for Science and Education at the University of California, San Francisco.[3] He has done important work studying the protein complexes which enable chromosome replication when living cells divide. He is known as an original author of the "canonical, influential, and best-selling scientific textbook" Molecular Biology of the Cell,[4] and as Editor-in-Chief of Science magazine.[5][6]
Alberts was the president of the National Academy of Sciences from 1993 to 2005.[4] He is known for his work in forming science public policy, and has served as United States Science Envoy to Pakistan and Indonesia.[2][7] He has stated that "Science education should be about learning to think and solve problems like a scientist—insisting, for all citizens, that statements be evaluated using evidence and logic the way scientists evaluate statements."[8]

Education[edit]
After graduating from New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois,[9] Alberts attended Harvard College, as a pre-medicine major.[4][10] Bored by assigned laboratory "cooking classes", he petitioned to skip the physical chemistry laboratory requirement and instead was allowed to work with his tutor Jacques Fresco, in Paul M. Doty's laboratory. The summer's research led to the publication of two successful papers on mismatch errors in the helical structures of DNA and RNA,[11][12] and Alberts decided to continue on in biophysics.[4] He graduated with his A.B. in biochemical sciences, summa cum laude, in 1960.[4]
Alberts then worked with Paul M. Doty on an "enormously ambitious" thesis on DNA replication, attempting to solve the genetic code using nearest neighbor analysis of DNA polymerase.[9][10] After failing his first oral examination in spring 1965, he completed his Ph.D. research in fall 1965.[2][9][13] His doctorate in biophysics was published by Harvard University in 1966.[1] Alberts credits his initial failure with teaching him much more than his successes.[9] "That was a very important learning experience for me. I had decided that experimental strategy was everything in science, and nobody had ever told me anything about this."[2]
Career[edit]
After graduating, Alberts went to the Institut de Biologie Moleculaire[14] at the University of Geneva as a postdoctoral fellow, and worked with Richard H. Epstein on genes involved in DNA replication of phage T4. Epstein and his students had shown that there were at least seven different proteins needed for replication of T4 DNA. Alberts decided to do something that no one else was doing, and developed a DNA column for the purification of proteins that bound to DNA.[2] This enabled him to purify T4 Bacteriophage Gene 32.[15]
In 1966, Alberts joined the Department of Biochemical Sciences at Princeton University as an Assistant Professor. In 1971, he became an Associate Professor and in 1973 a full Professor, holding the Damon Pfeiffer Professorship in life sciences from 1975-1976.[14][16][17] At Princeton, he continued to work in the area of protein biochemistry, reconstituting systems.[2]
In 1976, Alberts accepted a position as professor and vice-chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco.[16] Also in 1976, he and his students were able to add all seven proteins to double-stranded DNA in an appropriate magnesium concentration to make DNA. More years of research were spent understanding the reactions involved. Another important step in understanding DNA synthesis was realizing that leading strand DNA polymerase and lagging strand DNA polymerase were coupled.[2][18]
Alberts was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1978.[16][19] From 1981 to 1985 Alberts held the American Cancer Society Research Professorship, a title granted for life as of 1980.[14] From 1985 to 1990, he was Chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco. From 1990-1993 he again held the American Cancer Society Research Professorship.[16]
Science and education[edit]
Alberts served as the President of the National Academy of Sciences for two terms from 1993 until 2005.[14][20]
Alberts has long been committed to the improvement of science education, dedicating much of his time to educational projects such as City Science, a program seeking to improve science teaching in San Francisco elementary schools.[4] He has served on the advisory board of the National Science Resources Center, a joint project of the National Academy of Sciences and the Smithsonian Institution working with teachers, scientists, and school systems to improve teaching of science as well as on the National Academy of Sciences' National Committee on Science Education Standards and Assessment. He has published important National Academies reports: the National Science Education Standards (NSES; NRC, 1996), intended to change the way that science is taught K-12, and Inquiry and the National Science Education Standards (NRC, 2000)[20]
The Bruce Alberts Award for Excellence in Science Education is given in his name to those who have made outstanding contributions in science education.[21]
He has served in different capacities on a number of advisory and editorial boards, including as chair of the Commission on Life Sciences, National Research Council.[4] Prior to his election as President of the National Academy of Sciences in 1995 he was president-elect of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.[18] From 2007-2008 he served as president of the American Society for Cell Biology.[22]
He served as a trustee of the Carnegie Corporation of New York from 2000 to 2009.[23][24] He and others have critiqued the biomedical research system, pointing out what they consider "systemic flaws"[25] and have created the Rescuing Biomedical Research organization, to "collect and organize input for solutions"[26] to the problems identified by themselves[25] and others.[27]
Alberts was Editor-in-Chief of the American Association for the Advancement of Science's flagship publication, Science for five years from 2008-2013.[28] He is one of the founding editors of the journal Cell Biology Education.[20]
International work[edit]
From 2000-2009, Alberts was the Co-chair of the InterAcademy Council, an advisory institution in Amsterdam governed by the presidents of fifteen science academies from around the world, and a member of the Science Initiative Group board.[29]
In his June 4, 2009 speech at Cairo University, US President Barack Obama announced a new Science Envoy program as part of a "new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world." In January 2010, Bruce Alberts, Ahmed Zewail, and Elias Zerhouni became the first US science envoys to Islam, visiting Muslim-majority countries from North Africa to Southeast Asia.[30]

Bruce Michael Alberts (born April 14, 1938 in Chicago, Illinois) is an American biochemist and the Chancellor’s Leadership Chair in Biochemistry and Biophysics for Science and Education at the University of California, San Francisco.[3] He has done important work studying the protein complexes which enable chromosome replication when living cells divide. He is known as an original author of the "canonical, influential, and best-selling scientific textbook" Molecular Biology of the Cell,[4] and as Editor-in-Chief of Science magazine.[5][6]
Alberts was the president of the National Academy of Sciences from 1993 to 2005.[4] He is known for his work in forming science public policy, and has served as United States Science Envoy to Pakistan and Indonesia.[2][7] He has stated that "Science education should be about learning to think and solve problems like a scientist—insisting, for all citizens, that statements be evaluated using evidence and logic the way scientists evaluate statements."[8]

Education[edit]
After graduating from New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois,[9] Alberts attended Harvard College, as a pre-medicine major.[4][10] Bored by assigned laboratory "cooking classes", he petitioned to skip the physical chemistry laboratory requirement and instead was allowed to work with his tutor Jacques Fresco, in Paul M. Doty's laboratory. The summer's research led to the publication of two successful papers on mismatch errors in the helical structures of DNA and RNA,[11][12] and Alberts decided to continue on in biophysics.[4] He graduated with his A.B. in biochemical sciences, summa cum laude, in 1960.[4]
Alberts then worked with Paul M. Doty on an "enormously ambitious" thesis on DNA replication, attempting to solve the genetic code using nearest neighbor analysis of DNA polymerase.[9][10] After failing his first oral examination in spring 1965, he completed his Ph.D. research in fall 1965.[2][9][13] His doctorate in biophysics was published by Harvard University in 1966.[1] Alberts credits his initial failure with teaching him much more than his successes.[9] "That was a very important learning experience for me. I had decided that experimental strategy was everything in science, and nobody had ever told me anything about this."[2]
Career[edit]
After graduating, Alberts went to the Institut de Biologie Moleculaire[14] at the University of Geneva as a postdoctoral fellow, and worked with Richard H. Epstein on genes involved in DNA replication of phage T4. Epstein and his students had shown that there were at least seven different proteins needed for replication of T4 DNA. Alberts decided to do something that no one else was doing, and developed a DNA column for the purification of proteins that bound to DNA.[2] This enabled him to purify T4 Bacteriophage Gene 32.[15]
In 1966, Alberts joined the Department of Biochemical Sciences at Princeton University as an Assistant Professor. In 1971, he became an Associate Professor and in 1973 a full Professor, holding the Damon Pfeiffer Professorship in life sciences from 1975-1976.[14][16][17] At Princeton, he continued to work in the area of protein biochemistry, reconstituting systems.[2]
In 1976, Alberts accepted a position as professor and vice-chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco.[16] Also in 1976, he and his students were able to add all seven proteins to double-stranded DNA in an appropriate magnesium concentration to make DNA. More years of research were spent understanding the reactions involved. Another important step in understanding DNA synthesis was realizing that leading strand DNA polymerase and lagging strand DNA polymerase were coupled.[2][18]
Alberts was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1978.[16][19] From 1981 to 1985 Alberts held the American Cancer Society Research Professorship, a title granted for life as of 1980.[14] From 1985 to 1990, he was Chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco. From 1990-1993 he again held the American Cancer Society Research Professorship.[16]
Science and education[edit]
Alberts served as the President of the National Academy of Sciences for two terms from 1993 until 2005.[14][20]
Alberts has long been committed to the improvement of science education, dedicating much of his time to educational projects such as City Science, a program seeking to improve science teaching in San Francisco elementary schools.[4] He has served on the advisory board of the National Science Resources Center, a joint project of the National Academy of Sciences and the Smithsonian Institution working with teachers, scientists, and school systems to improve teaching of science as well as on the National Academy of Sciences' National Committee on Science Education Standards and Assessment. He has published important National Academies reports: the National Science Education Standards (NSES; NRC, 1996), intended to change the way that science is taught K-12, and Inquiry and the National Science Education Standards (NRC, 2000)[20]
The Bruce Alberts Award for Excellence in Science Education is given in his name to those who have made outstanding contributions in science education.[21]
He has served in different capacities on a number of advisory and editorial boards, including as chair of the Commission on Life Sciences, National Research Council.[4] Prior to his election as President of the National Academy of Sciences in 1995 he was president-elect of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.[18] From 2007-2008 he served as president of the American Society for Cell Biology.[22]
He served as a trustee of the Carnegie Corporation of New York from 2000 to 2009.[23][24] He and others have critiqued the biomedical research system, pointing out what they consider "systemic flaws"[25] and have created the Rescuing Biomedical Research organization, to "collect and organize input for solutions"[26] to the problems identified by themselves[25] and others.[27]
Alberts was Editor-in-Chief of the American Association for the Advancement of Science's flagship publication, Science for five years from 2008-2013.[28] He is one of the founding editors of the journal Cell Biology Education.[20]
International work[edit]
From 2000-2009, Alberts was the Co-chair of the InterAcademy Council, an advisory institution in Amsterdam governed by the presidents of fifteen science academies from around the world, and a member of the Science Initiative Group board.[29]
In his June 4, 2009 speech at Cairo University, US President Barack Obama announced a new Science Envoy program as part of a "new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world." In January 2010, Bruce Alberts, Ahmed Zewail, and Elias Zerhouni became the first US science envoys to Islam, visiting Muslim-majority countries from North Africa to Southeast Asia.[30]

Synopsis
About this title




Essential Cell Biology provides an accessible introduction to the fundamental concepts of cell biology. Its lively writing and exceptional illustrations make it the ideal textbook for a first course in cell and molecular biology. The text and figures are easy-to-follow, accurate, clear, and engaging for the introductory student. Molecular detail has been kept to a minimum in order to provide the reader with a cohesive, conceptual framework of the basic science that underlies our current understanding of biology.  The Third Edition is thoroughly updated scientifically, yet maintains the academic level and size of the previous edition. The book is accompanied by a Media DVD-ROM with over 130 animations and videos, all the figures from the book, and a new self-test quizzing feature for students.
"synopsis" may belong to another edition of this title.

Review:
                                                    'College and university professors who have used the previous editions of ECB will be pleased with the new edition.  The format and organization are retained but have been infused with fresh images and updated material.  It’s as if a trusted old friend has come back from an extended vacation with a bright new look and a refreshed attitude.  The reader is at once comfortable with and excited by the changes. New users of the textbook will find it accessible and approachable at the professorial and student levels....I highly recommend it to all CBE-Life Sciences Education readers who are also classroom educators.'CBE-Life Sciences Education, Fall 2009  'This attractive, accessible, visually oriented text covers the fundamentals of cell biology required to understand biomedical and broader issues that affect students' lives.' SciTech Book News, August 2009 Praise of the Second Edition: 'This book fills a critical niche in the pedagogical process of introducing cell biology and does an excellent job in reaching its objective.'The Quarterly Review of Biology, Volume 79 '...an excellent example of designing a textbook for undergraduates and non-biology majors. It is clear, well illustrated, conversational in tone and enjoyable to read and browse through.'E-Streams 'The second edition retains all the beauty of the first, and it serves as an editorial model -- a guide that shows us how serious authors prepare a new version of a serious book. ...What makes for a great science education is not the amassing of facts but the understanding of concepts, processes and syntheses, and the realization that all our information about nature must be subject to testing and revision. That is the kind of educational experience that students can acquire from the second edition of Essential Cell Biology.' The Textbook Letter

SAMPLE
CHAPTER 5
DNA AND CHROMOSOMES

The Structure and Function of DNA
5-1 Using terms from the list below, fill in the blanks in the following brief description of the experiment with Streptococcus pneumoniae that identified which biological molecule carries heritable genetic information. Some terms may be used more than once.
Cell-free extracts from S-strain cells of S. pneumoniae were fractionated to __________________ DNA, RNA, protein, and other cell components. Each fraction was then mixed with __________________ cells of S. pneumoniae. Its ability to change these into cells with __________________ properties resembling the __________________ cells was tested by injecting the mixture into mice. Only the fraction containing __________________ was able to __________________ the __________________ cells to __________________ (or __________________ ) cells that could kill mice.
carbohydrate lipid R-strain

(a) 1880s
(b) 1920s
(c) 1940s

(a) motion
(b) color
(c) shape

5-11 For a better understanding of DNA structure, it helps to be able to compare physical characteristics evident from a side view of double-stranded DNA with those of individual base pairs.
A. Use brackets to designate the major and minor grooves on Figure Q5-11A and shade in the surface that will be exposed in the major grove in Figure Q5-11B.
B. If base pairs were aligned and stacked directly on top of each other, the major and minor grooves would be linear depressions all along the DNA. Explain why this is not the actual conformation of a DNA molecule.

Figure Q5-14
A. Which are purines and which are pyrimidines?
B. Which bases pair with each other in double-stranded DNA?
5-15 Using the structures in Figure Q5-15 as a guide, sketch the hydrogen bonds between the base pairs in DNA. Hint: The bases in the figure are all drawn with the –NH– that attaches to the sugar at the bottom of the structure.
5-16 Because hydrogen bonds hold the two strands of a DNA molecule together, the strands can be separated without breaking any covalent bonds. Every unique DNA molecule “melts” at a different temperature. In this context, Tm, melting temperature, is the point at which two strands separate, or become denatured. Order the DNA sequences listed below according to relative melting temperatures (from lowest Tm to highest Tm). Assume that they all begin as stable double-stranded DNA molecules. Explain your answer.
A. GGCGCACC
B. TATTGTCT
C. GACTCCTG
D. CTAACTGG
5-17 Indicate whether the following statements are true or false. If a statement is false, explain why it is false.
A. Each strand of DNA contains all the information needed to create a new double-stranded DNA molecule with the same sequence information.
B. All functional DNA sequences inside a cell code for protein products.
C. Gene expression is the process of duplicating genes during DNA replication.
D. Gene sequences correspond exactly to the respective protein sequences produced from them.
5-18 The complete set of information found in a given organism’s DNA is called its ____________.
(a) genetic code
(b) coding sequence
(c) gene
(d) genome
5-19 The manner in which a gene sequence is related to its respective protein sequence is referred to as the _________ code.
(a) protein
(b) genetic
(c) translational
(d) expression
5-20 Given the sequence of one strand of a DNA helix as
5′-GCATTCGTGGGTAG-3′,
give the sequence of the complementary strand and label the 5′ and 3′ ends.
5-21 When double-stranded DNA is heated, the two strands separate into single strands in a process called melting or denaturation. The temperature at which half of the duplex DNA molecules are intact and half have melted is defined as the Tm.
A. Do you think Tm is a constant, or can it depend on other small molecules in the solution? Do you think high salt concentrations increase, decrease, or have no effect on Tm?
B. Under standard conditions, the expected melting temperature in degrees Celsius can be calculated from the equation Tm = 59.9 + 0.41 [%(G + C)] – [675/length of duplex]. Does the Tm increase or decrease if there are more G + C (and thus fewer A + T) base pairs? Does the Tm increase or decrease as the length of DNA increases? Why?
C. Calculate the predicted Tm for a stretch of double helix that is 100 nucleotides long and contains 50% G + C content.
5-22 Consider the structure of the DNA double helix.
A. You and a friend want to split a double-stranded DNA molecule so you each have half. Is it better to cut the length of DNA in half so each person has a shorter length, or to separate the strands and each take one strand? Explain.
B. In the original 1953 publication describing the discovery of the structure of DNA, Watson and Crick wrote, “It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairings we have postulated immediately suggest a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material.” What did they mean?
5-23 A. In principle, what would be the minimum number of consecutive nucleotides necessary to correspond to a single amino acid to produce a workable genetic code? Assume that each amino acid is encoded by the same number of nucleotides. Explain your reasoning.
B. On average, how often would the nucleotide sequence CGATTG be expected to occur in a DNA strand 4000 bases long? Explain your reasoning.
The Structure of Eucaryotic Chromosomes
5-24 For each of the following sentences, fill in the blanks with the best word or phrase selected from the list below. Not all words or phrases will be used; each word or phrase should be used only once.
In eucaryotic __________________, DNA is complexed with proteins to form __________________. The paternal and maternal copies of human Chromosome 1 are __________________, whereas the paternal copy of Chromosome 1 and the maternal copy of Chromosome 3 are __________________. Cytogeneticists can determine large-scale chromosomal abnormalities by looking at a patient’s __________________. Fluorescent molecules can be used to paint a chromosome by a technique that employs DNA __________________, and thereby to identify each chromosome by microscopy.
bands extended kinetochore
chromatin homologous nonhomologous
chromosomes hybridization
condensation karyotype
5-25 A. Define a gene.
B. Consider two different species of yeast that have similar genome sizes. Is it likely that they contain the same number of genes? A similar number of chromosomes?
C. Figure 5-15 in the textbook shows the G + C content and genes found along a single chromosome. Is there any relationship between the G + C content and the locations of genes?
5-26 The human genome has enough DNA to stretch more than 2 m. However, this DNA is not contained in a single molecule; it is divided into linear segments and packaged into structures called chromosomes. What is the total number of chromosomes found in each of the somatic cells in your body?
(a) 22
(b) 23
(c) 44
(d) 46
5-27 The number of cells in an average-sized adult human is on the order of 1014. Use this information, and the estimate that the length of DNA contained in each cell is 2 m, to do the following calculations (look up the necessary distances and show your working):
A. Over how many miles would the total DNA from the average human stretch?
B. How many times would the total DNA from the average human wrap around the planet Earth at the Equator?
C. How many times would the total DNA from the average human stretch from Earth to the Sun and back?
D. How many times would the total DNA from the average human stretch from the Earth to Pluto and back?
5-28 The process of sorting human chromosomes pairs by size and morphology is called karyotyping. A modern method employed for karyotyping is called chromosome painting. How are individual chromosomes “painted”?
(a) with a laser
(b) using fluorescent antibodies
(c) using fluorescent DNA molecules
(d) using green fluorescent protein
5-29 The human genome comprises 23 pairs of chromosomes found in nearly every cell in the body. Answer the quantitative questions below by choosing one of the numbers in the following list:
23 69 >200
46 92 >109
A. How many centromeres are in each cell? What is the main function of the centromere?
B. How many telomeres are in each cell? What is their main function?
C. How many replication origins are in each cell? What is their main function?
5-30 Explain the differences between chromosome painting and the older, more traditional method of staining chromosomes being prepared for karyotyping. Highlight the way in which each method identifies chromosomes by the unique sequences they contain.
5-31 Indicate whether the following statements are true or false. If a statement is false, explain why it is false.
A. Comparing the relative number of chromosome pairs is a good way to determine whether two species are closely related.
B. Chromosomes exist at different levels of condensation, depending on the stage of the cell cycle.
C. Eucaryotic chromosomes contain many different sites where DNA replication can be initiated.
D. The telomere is a specialized DNA sequence where microtubules from the mitotic spindle attach to the chromosome so that duplicate copies move to opposite ends of the dividing cell.
5-32 For each of the following sentences, fill in the blanks with the best word or phrase selected from the list below. Not all words or phrases will be used; each word or phrase should be used only once.
Each chromosome is a single molecule of __________________ whose extraordinarily long length can be compacted by as much as __________________-fold during __________________ and tenfold more during __________________. This is accomplished by binding to __________________ that help package the DNA in an orderly manner so it can fit in the small space delimited by the __________________. The structure of the DNA–protein complex, called __________________, is highly __________________ over time.

(c) looping of the 30 nm fiber
(d) packing of loops to form interphase chromosomes
5-44 Evidence suggests that the replication of DNA packaged into heterochromatin occurs later than the replication of other chromosomal DNA. What is the simplest possible explanation for this phenomenon?
The Regulation of Chromosome Structure
5-45 Although the chromatin structure of interphase and mitotic chromosomes is very compact, DNA-binding proteins and protein complexes must be able to gain access to the DNA molecule. Chromatin-remodeling complexes provide this access by __________________.
(a) recruiting other enzymes
(b) modifying the N-terminal tails of core histones
(c) using the energy of ATP hydrolysis to move nucleosomes
(d) denaturing the DNA by interfering with hydrogen-bonding between base pairs
5-46 You are studying a newly identified chromatin-remodeling complex, which you call NICRC. You decide to run an in vitro experiment to characterize the activity of the purified complex. Your molecular toolbox includes: (1) a 400-base-pair DNA molecule that has a single recognition site for the restriction endonuclease EcoRI, an enzyme that cleaves internal sites on double-stranded DNA (dsDNA); (2) purified EcoRI enzyme; (3) purified DNase I, a DNA endonuclease that will cleave dsDNA at nonspecific sites if they are exposed; and (4) core octamer histones. You are able to assemble core nucleosomes on this DNA template and test for NICRC activity. Figure Q5-46A illustrates the DNA template used and indicates both the location of the EcoRI cleavage site and the size of the DNA fragments that are produced when it cuts. Figure Q5-46B illustrates how the DNA molecules in your experiment looked after separation according to size by using gel electrophoresis. Your experiment had a total of six samples, each of which was treated according to the legend below the gel. The sizes of the DNA fragments observed are indicated on the left side of the gel.
Figure Q5-46
A Explain the results in lanes 1–4 and why it is important to have this information before you begin to test your remodeling complex.
B. What can you conclude about your purified remodeling complex from the results in lanes 5 and 6?
5-47 The N-terminal tail of histone H3 can be extensively modified, and depending on the number, location, and combination of these modifications, these changes may promote the formation of heterochromatin. What is the result of heterochromatin formation?
(a) increase in gene expression
(b) gene silencing
(c) recruitment of remodeling complexes
(d) displacement of histone H1
5-48 Methylation and acetylation are common changes made to histone H3, and the specific combination of these changes is sometimes referred to as the “histone code.” Which of the following patterns will probably lead to gene silencing?
(a) lysine 9 methylation
(b) lysine 4 methylation and lysine 9 acetylation
(c) lysine 14 acetylation
(d) lysine 9 acetylation and lysine 14 acetylation
5-49 When there is a well-established segment of heterochromatin on an interphase chromosome, there is usually a special barrier sequence that prevents the heterochromatin from expanding along the entire chromosome. Gene A, which is normally expressed, has been moved by DNA recombination near an area of heterochromatin. None of the daughter cells produced after this recombination event express gene A, even though its DNA sequence is unchanged. What is this the best way to describe what has happened to the function of gene A in these cells?
(a) barrier destruction
(b) heterochromatization
(c) epigenetic inheritance
(d) euchromatin depletion
5-50 Your friend is working in a lab to study how yeast cells adapt to growth on different carbon sources. He grew half of his cells in the presence of glucose and the other half in the presence of galactose. Then he harvested the cells and isolated their DNA with a gentle procedure that leaves nucleosomes and some higher-order chromatin structures intact. He treated the DNA briefly with a low concentration of M-nuclease, a special enzyme that easily degrades protein-free stretches of DNA. After removing all the proteins, he separated the resulting DNA on the basis of length. Finally, he used a procedure to visualize only those DNA fragments from a region near a particular gene called Sweetie or another gene called Salty. The separated DNA fragments are shown in Figure Q5-50. Each vertical column, called a lane, is from a different sample. DNA spots near the top of the figure represent DNA molecules that are longer than those near the bottom. Darker spots contain more DNA than fainter spots. The lanes are as follows:
1. “marker” containing known DNA fragments of indicated lengths
2. cells grown in glucose, DNA visualized near Sweetie gene
3. cells grown in galactose, DNA visualized near Sweetie gene
4. cells grown in glucose, DNA visualized near Salty gene
5. cells grown in galactose, DNA visualized near Salty gene
Figure Q5-50
A. The lowest spot (as observed in lanes 2, 4, and 5) has a length of about 150 nucleotides. Can you propose what it is and how it arose?
B. What are the spots with longer lengths? Why is there a ladder of spots?
C. Notice the faint spots and extensive smearing in lane 3, suggesting the DNA could be cut almost anywhere near the Sweetie gene after growth of the cells in galactose. This was not observed in the other lanes. What probably happened to the DNA to change the pattern between lanes 2 and 3?
D. What kinds of enzyme might have been involved in changing the chromatin structure between lanes 2 lane 3?
E. Do you think that gene expression of Sweetie is higher, lower, or the same in galactose compared to glucose? What about Salty?
Answers
5-1 Cell-free extracts from S-strain cells of S. pneumoniae were fractionated to purify DNA, RNA, protein, and other cell components. Each fraction was then mixed with R-strain cells of S. pneumoniae. Its ability to change these into cells with pathogenic properties resembling the S-strain cells was tested by injecting the mixture into mice. Only the fraction containing DNA was able to transform the R-strain cells to pathogenic (or S-strain) cells that could kill mice.

5-5 A. False. DNA is double-stranded. It is actually is made of two polymers that are complementary in sequence.
B. True.
C. False. There are four different nucleotides that are used to make a DNA polymer: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. A fifth nucleotide, uracil, is found exclusively in RNA molecules, replacing thymine nucleotides in the DNA sequence.
D. False. Nucleotides are linked covalently through phosphodiester bonds. Hydrogen-bonding between nucleotides from opposite strands holds the DNA molecule together.

5-7 (d)

5-10 (a)
5-11 See figure A5-11 below.
Figure A5-11
B. The DNA base pairs are rotated with respect to each other. For a double-stranded DNA molecule with 10 base pairs, a full 360° rotation has occurred. This is referred to as one turn of the helix, and it can be seen in the alignment of the A-T base pair at the bottom with the G-C base pair at the top.
5-12 (c)
5-13 See Figure A5-13.
Figure A5-13
5-14 A. Adenine and guanine are purines; cytosine and thymine are pyrimidines.
B. Cytosine pairs with guanine and adenine with thymine.
5-15 See Figure A5-15.
Figure A5-15
5-16 The order in which the DNA molecules would denature as the temperature increases is:
1—B; 2—D; 3—C; 4—A
All the DNA molecules are the same length, so only the A + T and G + C content determine their relative Tm. Molecules with higher G + C content will be more stable than molecules with a high A + T content. This is because there are three hydrogen bonds between each G-C base pair but only two between each A-T base pair. More energy (heat) is required to disrupt a larger number of hydrogen bonds.
5-17 A. True.
B. False. Some sequences encode only RNA molecules, some bind to specific regulatory proteins, and others are sites where specific chrosomosomal protein structures are built (for example, centromeric and telomeric DNA).
C. False. Gene expression is the process of going from gene sequence to RNA sequence, to protein sequence.
D. False. This statement is false for two reasons. First, genes often contain intron sequences. Second, genes always contain nucleotides flanking the protein-coding sequences that are required for the regulation of transcription and translation.
5-18 (d)
5-19 (b)
5-20 5′-CTACCCACGAATGC-3′.
5-21 A. Tm depends on the identity and concentration of other molecules in the solution. High salt concentrations are more effective at shielding the two negatively charged phosphate-sugar backbones in the double helix from each other, so the two strands repel each other less strongly. Thus, a high salt concentration stabilizes the duplex and increases the melting temperature.
B. The Tm increases as the proportion of G + C bases increases and as the length increases. The thermal energy required for melting depends on how many hydrogen bonds between the strands must be broken. Each G-C base pair contributes three hydrogen bonds, whereas an A-T base pair contributes only two.
C. Inserting values into the equation in part B gives Tm = 59.9 + (0.41 × 50) – (675/100) = 73.65°C, which is about twice the normal temperature of the human body and nearly too hot to touch.
5-22 A. It is better to separate the strands and each take a single strand, because all of the information found in the original molecule is preserved in a full-length single strand but not in a half-length double-stranded molecule.
B. Watson and Crick meant that the complementary base pairing of the strands allows a single strand to contain all of the information necessary to direct the synthesis of a new complementary strand.
5-23 A. Because there are 20 amino acids used in proteins, each amino acid would have to be encoded by a minimum of three nucleotides. For example, a code of two consecutive nucleotides could specify a maximum of 16 (42) different amino acids, excluding stop and start signals. A code of three consecutive nucleotides has 64 (43) different members and thus can easily accommodate the 20 amino acids plus a signal to stop protein synthesis.
B. Because 46 (= 4096) different sequences of six nucleotides can occur in DNA, any given sequence of six nucleotides would be expected to occur on average once in a DNA strand 4000 bases long, assuming a random distribution of sequences.
5-24 In eucaryotic chromosomes, DNA is complexed with proteins to form chromatin. The paternal and maternal copies of human Chromosome 1 are homologous, whereas the paternal copy of Chromosome 1 and the maternal copy of Chromosome 3 are nonhomologous. Cytogeneticists can determine large-scale chromosomal abnormalities by looking at a patient’s karyotype. Fluorescent molecules can be used to paint a chromosome by a technique that employs DNA hybridization, and thereby to identify each chromosome by microscopy.
5-25 A. A gene is a segment of DNA that stores the information required to specify the particular sequence found in a protein (or, in some cases, the sequence of a structural or catalytic RNA).
B. A similar genome size indicates relatively little about the number of genes and virtually nothing about the number of chromosomes. For example, the commonly studied yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Sp) are separated by roughly 400 million years of evolution, and both have a genome of 14 million base pairs. Yet Sc has 6500 genes packaged into 16 chromosomes and Sp has 4800 genes in 3 chromosomes.
C. Regions of the chromosome with a high density of genes tend to have about 50% G + C, whereas those with few genes tend to have a lower G + C content. This is generally true in most organisms.
5-26 (d)
5-27 A. 2 × 1014 m = 124,274,238,447 miles.
B. The Earth’s circumference at the Equator is 7,926 miles. The length of DNA from the average human body could wrap around the Earth 15,678,759 times.
C. The average distance from the Earth to the Sun is 93,000,000 miles. So, the round-trip distance is 186,000,000 miles. The length of DNA from the average human body could stretch from the Earth to the Sun and back 668 times.
D. The distance from the Earth to Pluto is, on average, about 39 × 93,000,000 miles. The length of DNA from the average human body could stretch from the Earth to Pluto and back 36 times.
5-28 (c)
5-29 A. There are 46 centromeres per cell, one on each chromosome. The centromeres have a key role in the distribution of chromosomes to daughter cells during mitosis.
B. There are 92 telomeres per cell, two on each chromosome. Telomeres serve to protect the ends of chromosomes and to enable complete replication of the DNA of each chromosome all the way to its tips.
C. There are far more than 200 replication origins in a human cell, probably about 10,000. These DNA sequences direct the initiation of DNA synthesis needed to replicate chromosomes.
5-30 Chromosome painting relies on the specificity of DNA complementarity. Because unique sequences for each chromosome are known, short DNA molecules matching a set of these sites can be designed for each chromosome. Each set is labeled with a specific combination of fluorescent dyes and then allowed to hybridize (form base pairs) with the two homologous chromosomes that contain the unique sequences being targeted.
Giemsa stain is a nonfluorescent dye that has a high affinity for DNA, and specifically accumulates in regions that are rich in A-T nucleotide pairs. This dye produces a pattern of dark and light bands, which differ for each chromosome on the basis of the distribution of A-T-rich regions.
5-31 A. False. There are several examples of closely related species that have a drastically different number of chromosome pairs. Two related species of deer—Chinese and Indian muntjac—have 23 and 3, respectively.
B. True.
C. True.
D. False. The telomere is a specialized DNA sequence, but not for the attachment of spindle microtubules. Telomeres form special caps that stabilize the ends of linear chromosomes.
5-32 Each chromosome is a single molecule of DNA whose extraordinarily long length can be compacted by as much as 1000-fold during interphase and tenfold more during mitosis. This is accomplished by binding to proteins that help package the DNA in an orderly manner so it can fit in the small space delimited by the nuclear envelope. The structure of the DNA–protein complex, called chromatin, is highly dynamic over time.
5-33 (a)
5-34 (b)
5-35 (a)
5-36 (b)
5-37 A. Nucleosomes are present in eucaryotic chromosomes, but not in procaryotic chromosomes.
B. A nucleosome contains two molecules each of histones H2A and H2B, as well as histones H3 and H4.
C. A nucleosome core particle contains a core of histone with DNA wrapped around it approximately twice.
D. Nucleosomes are aided in their formation by the high proportion of basic amino acids in histone proteins.
E. Nucleosome formation compacts DNA into approximately one-third of its original length.
5-38 (a)
5-39 (c)
5-40 Interphase chromosomes contain both darkly staining heterochromatin and more lightly staining euchromatin. Genes that are being transcribed are thought to be packaged in a less condensed type of euchromatin. Nucleosome core particles are separated from each other by stretches of linker DNA. A string of nucleosomes coils up with the help of histone H1 to form the more compact structure of the 30 nm fiber. A zigzag model describes the structure of the 30 nm fiber. The 30 nm chromatin fiber is further compacted by the formation of loops that emanate from a central axis.
5-41 (d)
5-42 (c)
5-43 (b)
5-44 The DNA double helix in heterochromatin may be so tightly packed and condensed that it is inaccessible to the proteins that bind replication origins, including the DNA replication machinery. It may take extra time to remodel the chromatin to make it more accessible to the proteins required to initiate and perform DNA replication.
5-45 (c)
5-46 A. Sample 1 confirms the location of the EcoRI restriction site and shows what those fragments should look like when separated on the gel. The cleavage is the readout that will tell us whether the remodeling complex is working. Sample 2 demonstrates that DNA that is not assembled into nucleosomes can be cut into many small fragments by DNAseI. That is why we do not see discrete bands. Sample 3 demonstrates that when nucleosomes are assembled on the DNA, DNase I cuts only in one place, presumably in the linker region between two assembled nucleosomes. Sample 4 demonstrates that EcoRI cannot access its cleavage site when nucleosomes are assembled over it.
B. Sample 5 demonstrates that our purified complex is working. It must be moving the nucleosomes, providing access to EcoRI, such that it can now cleave at its restriction site, which was not possible in the absence of NICRC. Sample 6 shows that NICRC will function only if ATP is available as an energy source for the remodeling process.
5-47 (b)
5-48 (a)
5-49 (c)
5-50 A. The lowest spot represents DNA of a length similar to that of the segment of DNA found in a nucleosome core particle. Partial digestion with an enzyme such as M-nuclease causes breaks in the DNA backbone primarily within the linker DNA or other DNA segments not bound tightly to histones. Thus, this band probably comprises the DNA bound tightly to a single histone octamer and it arose by cutting the linker DNA outside a single nucleosome core particle.
B. The ladder of bands with longer lengths probably corresponds to stretches of DNA associated with increasing numbers of nucleosomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on). In support of this proposal, adjacent bands differ in size by roughly 200 nucleotides, which is the length of DNA found in a nucleosome core particle plus neighboring linker DNA. This interpretation must mean that the M-nuclease digestion did not go to completion, because if all non-nucleosomal DNA were digested completely, the samples would contain only the 150-base-pair fragment.
C. Given the ability of M-nuclease to cut anywhere near Sweetie after growth in galactose, it seems that the DNA is no longer protected from digestion by binding to histones. Perhaps the wrapping of DNA within the nucleosomes has been loosened considerably. This change in the nucleosomes must be specific to the Sweetie gene, because it is not seen at the Salty gene or throughout the genome.
D. The main candidates for enzymes that catalyzed the nucleosome alterations near Sweetie are chromatin-remodeling complexes and enzymes that covalently modify histone tails with methyl, acetyl, or phosphate groups.
E. As the chromatin seems to have been loosened near Sweetie, it seems likely that Sweetie gene expression is increased when cells are grown in galactose rather than glucose, whereas Salty gene expression is likely to be the same under the two conditions. Perhaps the Sweetie gene contains instructions for a protein that is required for cells to metabolize galactose but not glucose.

About the Book

Book SummaryFor nearly a quarter century Molecular Biology of the Cell has been the leading cell biology textbook. This tradition continues with the new Fifth Edition, which has been completely revised and updated to describe our current, rapidly advancing understanding of cell biology. To list but a few examples, a large amount of new material is presented on epigenetics; stem cells; RNAi; comparative genomics; the latest cancer therapies; apoptosis (now its own separate chapter); and cell cycle control and the mechanics of M phase (now integrated into one chapter).

The hallmark features of Molecular Biology of the Cell have been retained, such as its consistent and comprehensive art program, clear concept headings, and succinct section summaries. Additionally, in response to extensive feedback from readers, the Fifth Edition now includes several new features.

It is now more portable. Chapters 1-20 are printed and Chapters 21-25, covering multicellular systems, are provided as PDF files on the free Media DVD-ROM which accompanies the book.* And for the first time, Molecular Biology of the Cell now contains end-of-chapter questions. These problems, written by John Wilson and Tim Hunt, emphasize a quantitative approach and the art of reasoning from experiments, and they will help students review and extend their knowledge derived from reading the textbook. The Media DVD-ROM, which is packaged with every copy of the book, contains PowerPoint® presentations with all of the figures, tables and micrographs from the text (available as JPEGs too). Also included is the Media Player, which plays over 125 movies—animations, videos, and molecular models—all with voice-over narration. A new reader-friendly feature is the integration of media codes throughout the text that link directly to relevant videos and animations. The Media DVD-ROM holds the multicellular systems chapters (21-25) of the text as well.

By skillfully extracting the fundamental concepts from this enormous and ever-growing field, the authors tell the story of cell biology, and thereby create a coherent framework through which readers may approach and enjoy this subject that is so central to all of biology.
* There is also a reference edition of Molecular Biology of the Cell, Fifth Edition (ISBN 978-0-8153-4111-6) that contains Chapters 1-25 entirely in printed format.

Dr. Bruce Alberts
Bruce Alberts in his office at UCSF Mission Bay, October 2014 by Christopher Reiger. (Click on the image to view and download a high res version.)

A prominent biochemist with a strong commitment to the improvement of science and mathematics education, Bruce Alberts, was awarded the National Medal of Science by President Barack Obama in 2014 and the 2016 Lasker-Koshland Special Achievement Award in Medical Science. Dr. Alberts served as Editor-in-Chief of Science (2009-2013) and as one of the first three United States Science Envoys (2009-2011). He is now the Chancellor’s Leadership Chair in Biochemistry and Biophysics for Science and Education at the University of California, San Francisco, to which he returned after serving two six-year terms as the president of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).
During his tenure at the NAS, Alberts was instrumental in developing the landmark National Science Education Standards that have been implemented in school systems nationwide. The type of “science as inquiry” teaching we need, says Alberts, emphasizes “logical, hands-on problem solving, and it insists on having evidence for claims that can be confirmed by others. It requires work in cooperative groups, where those with different types of talents can discover them – developing self confidence and an ability to communicate effectively with others.”
Alberts is also noted as one of the original authors of The Molecular Biology of the Cell, a preeminent textbook in the field soon to be in its sixth edition. For the period 2000 to 2009, he served as the co-chair of the InterAcademy Council, a new organization in Amsterdam governed by the presidents of 15 national academies of sciences and established to provide scientific advice to the world.
Committed in his international work to the promotion of the “creativity, openness and tolerance that are inherent to science,” Alberts believes that “scientists all around the world must now band together to help create more rational, scientifically-based societies that find dogmatism intolerable.”
Widely recognized for his work in the fields of biochemistry and molecular biology, Alberts has earned many honors and awards, including 16 honorary degrees. He currently serves on the advisory boards of more than 25 non-profit institutions, including the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.

CHAPTER 4
DNA, Chromosomes, and Genomes
Molecular Biology of the Cell, Fifth Edition

Questions
4-1 Figure Q4-1 shows a hypothetical alignment of nucleotide sequences from two organisms. The bottom panel shows an alignment of large chromosomal regions, with black blocks representing DNA stretches of at least 500 nucleotides for which there is a corresponding sequence somewhere in the other organism’s genome. Gray lines connect the pairs of corresponding sequences found in this alignment region. The top panel shows a magnified view of one region, approximately the length of an average gene. Here, each vertical gray line represents a stretch of six nucleotides in which five of the six are identical between the two species. Annotate the top panel of the figure to indicate likely locations of exons, introns, and regulatory sequences; annotate the bottom panel to show regions of synteny.
Figure Q4-1
4-2 The dynamics of nucleosomes can be studied in a test tube by mixing histone proteins with short pieces of DNA to form a single nucleosome on each DNA molecule. When a dye molecule is covalently linked to one end of the DNA and a complementary dye molecule is linked to a histone protein, the proximity of the two dyes can be measured. Such measurements, combined with other experiments, suggested that nucleosomes alternated between two states, one fully wrapped (W) and the second partly unwrapped (U). The equilibrium constant between these two states, Keq = [U]/[W], depends on the concentration of salt in the test tube. At the salt concentration found in cells, the Keq was between 0.02 and 0.1.
A. About what percentage of the time is a given nucleosome partly unwrapped at this salt concentration? Explain.
B. Will increasing the salt concentration increase or decrease the Keq? Explain.
4-3 When placed on an agar slab and incubated at 30°C for 2 days, a single yeast cell proliferates into a colony with a diameter of 2 mm containing 108 yeast cells. If the cell has a functional Ade2 gene (Ade2+), the colony will be white; if Ade2 is non-functional (Ade2–), the colony will be red. You take a strain with a mutant Ade2– at the regular chromosomal position (red colonies) and insert a second, functional Ade2+ gene near the telomere. You find that the colonies are a mixture of red and white patches or sectors. Figure Q4-3 shows some colonies; the black regions represent the red sectors.
A. Explain what happened to the Ade2+ gene near the telomere in the red cells and in the white cells. What is the term for this phenomenon?
B. You take single cells from the white sectors and allow them to form new colonies. You do the same with cells from the red sectors. Predict the color of the colonies. Explain.
C. You measure acetylation of the N-termini of histones H3 and H4 that are located near the telomeric Ade2+. Do you expect more or less acetylation in the red cells than in the white cells?
D. You look for mutants that give only white colonies. You find mutations in three genes: Rap1, which encodes a protein that binds specific short DNA sequences near the telomere; Sir2, which encodes a histone deacetlyase; and Sir4, which encodes a protein that binds Rap1, Sir2, and deacetylated N-termini of histones H3 and H4. Propose a series of events in which these proteins act together to turn a white cell into a red cell.
Figure Q4-3
4-4 You want to examine where within the cell a protein called Tip resides. To do this, you make a DNA construct containing regulatory sequences (RS) that control gene expression, the protein-coding region of the Tip gene, and a sequence that codes for green fluorescent protein (GFP). The expressed fusion protein includes the Tip protein covalently linked at one end to Gfp, and therefore you can visualize the subcellular location of Tip by viewing green fluorescence with a microscope. You transfect mouse cells with the RS-Tip-GFP construct and find cells in which the constructs have been inserted in the genome at random. You look at 10 colonies, each arising from an independent insertion, and find that some colonies contain cells that all have high levels of fluorescence, whereas other colonies have only cells with moderate or low levels. Two colonies even have a mixture of cells, some with high levels of fluorescence and others with low levels.
A. Explain the observed differences between colonies and for each observed colony behavior.
B. Propose an improved version of your RS-Tip-GFP construct that might make the colonies more uniform. List the order of sequences in the improved construct.
4-5 You want to investigate the substructure of an intact interphase nucleus. To do this, you fix cells and isolate their nuclei. You add fluorescent antibodies that bind specifically to particular proteins, and then observe fluorescence with a microscope. A nucleus is represented in Figure Q4-5. Which of the proteins listed below do you expect to be concentrated in a subnuclear region? Indicate on the figure where you expect those proteins to localize. Proteins: HP1, histone H3 acetylated on lysine 9, histone H3 methylated on lysine 9, histone H1, and condensin.
Figure Q4-5
4-6 Gene duplication is widely believed to be a major mechanism for generating genetic novelty and increased biological complexity.
A. How does a pseudogene arise?
B. Identify the simplest kind of experiment to begin characterizing the divergence of a pair of functional genes that arose from an ancient duplication event, and describe what results are expected.
C. Because of the availability of whole-genome DNA sequences and whole-genome gene expression measurements, researchers classify each gene as a member of a duplicated set or a singleton and then evaluate whether there is a difference between expression patterns of the two classes. Which class contains a larger proportion of genes whose expression differs between strains of an organism? Which class contains a larger proportion of genes whose expression differs between different stages in embryogenesis? Explain.
4-7 A hypothetical phylogenetic tree is shown in Figure Q4-7. Use this tree to answer the following questions.
A. How many years ago did species M and N diverge from their last common ancestor?
B. How much nucleotide divergence is there on average between M and N?
C. Are M and N more or less closely related to each other than P and S?
D. In looking for functionally important nucleotide sequences, is it more informative to compare the genome sequences of M and N or those of M and Q? Explain.
Figure Q4-7
4-8 Consider a gene with a particular function. Mutation X and mutation Y separately cause defects in the function of the encoded protein. Yet a gene containing both mutations X and Y encodes a protein that works even better than the original protein. The odds that a single mutational event will generate both mutations X and Y are exceedingly small. Explain a simple way in which an organism with a mutant gene containing both mutations X and Y could arise during evolution.
Answers
4-1
Figure A4-1
4-2
A. The percentage of the time is 2–10%. An equilibrium constant between 0.02 and 0.1 means that at a given instant 2–10% of the nucleosomes are partly unwrapped. Because the question said that each nucleosome alternates between the two states, the previous sentence can be transformed to say that a single nucleosome spends 2–10% of the time in a partly unwrapped state.
B. Increase. A higher salt concentration will disrupt the nucleosomes, because they are held together largely by ionic interactions between the positively charged histone proteins and the negatively charged DNA. This will lead to more unwrapped nucleosomes and fewer wrapped nucleosomes, which will increase the Keq.

Li G, Widom J (2004) Nucleosomes facilitate their own invasion. Nat.Struct. Mol. Biol. 11, 763–769.
4-3
A. In the white cells, the inserted Ade2+ gene is expressed and the Ade2 protein is made. In the red cells, the inserted Ade2+ gene has undergone gene silencing, probably as a result of spreading of heterochromatin from the telomere. This is called position-effect variegation.
B. The cells from both colors of sectors will generate new colonies that are also sectored. Colonies from red cells may tend to have more red than white; colonies from white cells may have more white than red. The Ade2+ gene in white cells is probably packaged in euchromatin, and in red cells in heterochromatin. The chromatin state of a genomic locus is often directly inherited during the process of DNA replication, causing a phenomenon called epigenetic inheritance, so red (white) cells will tend to make more red (white) cells. But with position-effect variegation there is a certain low frequency of switching of chromatin from a repressed to an expressed state, and vice versa, so red (white) cells can become white (red).
C. More histone acetylation will occur near the telomeric Ade2+ in the cells that actively express the gene; that is, in the white cells. Expressed regions of the genome are enriched in acetylated histones.
D. A white cell is turned into a red cell by spreading of heterochromatin from the telomere to the Ade2+ inserted nearby. The spreading might happen as follows: (1) Rap1 binds a site in the telomeric region, (2) Sir4 binds to Rap1 and recruits Sir2, (3) Sir2 deacetylates histones near Rap1, (4) more Sir4 binds to the deacetylated histones and recruits more Sir2, (5) Sir2 deacetylates more histones farther from the Rap1-binding site, (6) repeat steps 4 and 5 for many cycles in a chain reaction until the deacetylation reaches the Ade2+ gene. Deacetylated histones are components of heterochromatin, and they may recruit other histone-modifying enzymes, histone-binding proteins, and chromatin-remodeling complexes.
4-4
A. The differences between the colonies probably arise from position effects. The construct might have inserted near sequence elements and chromatin structures that enhance gene expression (high fluorescence), have no effect on gene expression (high or moderate fluorescence), repress gene expression (low fluorescence), or spread heterochromatin into the inserted construct (variable fluorescence). The colonies with mixed populations of cells probably contain the construct inserted near heterochromatin, which spreads into the construct in some cells but not others.
B. The construct might confer more uniform gene expression, independently of where it inserted in the genome, if it contained barrier sequences. Barrier sequences, like HS4 from the chicken beta-globin locus, normally separate an active chromatin domain from a silenced chromatin domain. Barrier sequences (BSs) can insulate a DNA construct from position effects if they flank the important sequences on both sides. An improved construct containing BS-RS-Tip-GFP-BS might yield more uniform expression among and within the colonies.
4-5 See Figure A4-5. Methylated histone H3 and HP1 are associated with silenced or heterochromatic regions of chromatin. Acetylated histone H3 is associated with actively expressed regions of chromatin. Histone H1 and condensin are not indicated in the figure because histone H1 is everywhere and condensin is only localized to chromosomes in mitosis, not in interphase.
Figure A4-5
4-6
A. Creation of a pseudogene starts when a gene is duplicated. Next, a random mutation inactivates or impairs one of the copies. It is unlikely that the mutation has detrimental consequences for the cell or the organism, because there is a second fully functional copy. The mutated copy may continue to accumulate additional mutations without detrimental consequences, and it may lose all functionality and perhaps even lose the ability to be expressed. A non-functional gene is called a pseudogene.
B. The simplest kind of experiment is a comparison of the expression patterns of the duplicated genes. After duplication, genes commonly diverge in their expression pattern. The expectation, then, is that the mRNA and the proteins encoded by the duplicated genes will be observed at different developmental stages or in different tissues or cell types (or at different stages of the cell-division cycle or in different subcellular compartments).
C. The answer to both questions is duplicated genes, not singletons. Genes that are part of a duplicated or expanded set are more likely to exhibit more narrowly specialized expression. Duplicated genes that diverge are more likely to survive through evolutionary time, because there will be detrimental consequences for loss of each gene. One simple way to diverge, such that both copies of a pair will be required, is for random mutations of regulatory regions to generate differences in when and where each gene is turned on.
4-7 A. M and N diverged 8 million years ago.
B. There is an average of 1.6% nucleotide substitution in M compared with N (follow the path connecting the two species, which is twice the distance between each one and their common ancestor).
C. More. However, they show roughly the same degree of relatedness. The sequence divergence between M and N is about 1.6%, whereas that between P and S is about 2.0%. M and N diverged 8 million years ago, whereas P and S diverged 10 million years ago.
D. It is more informative to compare species that are separated by a greater evolutionary distance; comparing M and Q, which diverged 20 million years ago, will therefore be better able to identify sequences likely to be important for function. Closely related species share many sequences by chance because insufficient time has passed for neutral mutations to accumulate.
4-8 The simplest way to evolve the new gene is by duplication and divergence. If the gene is duplicated, then the cell or lineage can maintain one functional, intact copy of the original gene and can thus tolerate a disabling mutation in the second copy. The second copy can initially be modified by the X or Y mutation that impairs its function. At some later time, many generations later, the gene with the single mutation can acquire the additional mutation to yield the doubly mutant X+Y gene with the new or improved function.

About the Book

Book SummaryEssential Cell Biology provides a readily accessible introduction to the central concepts of cell biology, and its lively, clear writing and exceptional illustrations make it the ideal textbook for a first course in both cell and molecular biology. The text and figures are easy-to-follow, accurate, clear, and engaging for the introductory student. Molecular detail has been kept to a minimum in order to provide the reader with a cohesive conceptual framework for the basic science that underlies our current understanding of all of biology, including the biomedical sciences.
The Fourth Edition has been thoroughly revised, and covers the latest developments in this fast-moving field, yet retains the academic level and length of the previous edition. The book is accompanied by a rich package of online student and instructor resources, including over 130 narrated movies, an expanded and updated Question Bank. 
Essential Cell Biology, Fourth Edition is additionally supported by the Garland Science Learning System. This homework platform is designed to evaluate and improve student performance and allows instructors to select assignments on specific topics and review the performance of the entire class, as well as individual students, via the instructor dashboard. Students receive immediate feedback on their mastery of the topics, and will be better prepared for lectures and classroom discussions. The user-friendly system provides a convenient way to engage students while assessing progress. Performance data can be used to tailor classroom discussion, activities, and lectures to address students’ needs precisely and efficiently. For more information and sample material, visit http://garlandscience.rocketmix.com/.

Features

NEW IN THE FOURTH EDITION
• Comprehensive scientific update of the entire text and figures in the book.• New material on regulatory RNAs, epigenetics, induced pluripotent stem cells, cell suicide and reprogramming, the human genome, and our surprising inheritance from Neanderthals. • Based on extensive student feedback, improved discussion and new figures of photosynthesis, metabolism, and DNA repair.• Updated coverage of many exciting, new experimental techniques including RNAi, optogenetics, the applications of new DNA sequencing technologies, and the use of mutant organisms to probe the defects underlying human disease.• Medically relevant topics include new sections on culturing human cells for clinical work, autism and iPS cells, peroxisomes and disease, cancer changes in key regulatory pathways, as well as expanded coverage of amyloid proteins and their role in Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s diseases, the use of genome sequencing to identify the rare mutations that predispose us to disease, and much more.• New and enhanced student self-assessments available online.
HALLMARK FEATURES• The authors are known worldwide for their research, teaching, writing, and leadership in science and science education.• The text reflects the accuracy, authority, and currency of the renowned Molecular Biology of the Cell, yet it is written at an introductory level.• Concept headings descriptively introduce each section.• The updated art program emphasizes central concepts without unnecessary detail.• "How We Know" sections in every chapter introduce experimental science by explaining both the methods and scientific findings of classical and current experiments.• Provocative questions are interspersed throughout the text and at the end of each chapter to test students' understanding and stimulate curiosity (all questions answered in the back of the book).• Panels concisely review basic science, principles, pathways, as well as other topics.• Key terms in text listed at the end of each chapter.• "Essential Concepts" provide a review of each chapter.• Contains a detailed, illustrated glossary.


Reviews

PRAISE FOR THE PREVIOUS EDITION“Enthralls the reader….Core concepts are explained from first principles in a manner that is lucid and unambiguous....That the authors have assembled a seminal cell biology textbook cannot be disputed….really ought to be an intrinsic part of every bioscience undergraduate’s essential reading.”- The Biochemist
"…the language and terminology used by the authors remain focused at a level appropriate to and accessible by undergraduate students….New users of the textbook will find it accessible and approachable….The instructor resources remain a valuable addition….I highly recommend it to all.”- CBE-Life Sciences Education 
"This attractive, accessible, visually oriented text covers the fundamentals of cell biology required to understand biomedical and broader issues that affect students' lives."- SciTech Book News
“Essential Cell Biology, fourth edition, provides an up-to-date introduction to the fundamental concepts of cell biology as well as rapidly growing fields such as stem cell biology, development, and cancer....This book is ideal for students taking an introductory cell or molecular biology course, yet is also suitable for individuals looking to simply refresh their understanding of some of the basics of cell biology....Students will gain a broad understanding of biological processes from the latest edition of Essential Cell Biology, which will also help them as they advance to more specialized topics of biology and biomedical research.” –Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine

Molecular Biology of the Cell 5th Edition – Bruce Alberts
CHAPTER 1
Cells and Genomes
Questions
1-1 Your friend studies the SARS virus and tells you that the SARS virus packages its genetic material as a positive-strand single-stranded RNA. A positive-strand RNA is an RNA molecule that can serve as a translatable template to produce protein. Given what you know about the production of nucleic acids in cells, would you expect that the positive-strand RNA molecule could be used as a template to produce other positive-strand RNA molecules, or would you expect that another nucleic acid intermediary would have to be produced first? Explain.
1-2 You are interested in studying HIV. On reading the literature, you learn that the genetic information for the HIV virus is a single-stranded RNA molecule. Given what you know about the properties of nucleic acids, would you expect the ratios of purines to pyrimidine bases in the HIV viral RNA to be the same as the ratio found in the hereditary information of all living cells? Explain.
1-3 You have two computer files, one containing the complete Escherichia coli (bacterial) genomic sequence and the other containing the complete Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) genomic sequence. A new student in the lab made a mistake and renamed the files “A” and “B.” However, you do know that file A is 1125 kilobytes while file B is 30.5 megabytes in size. Without opening the file and examining the sequence, can you predict which file is more likely to contain the genomic sequence for E. coli and which file contains the genomic sequence for Drosophila? Explain.
1-4 You have two tubes. Tube 1 contains the DNA encoding the genome of a human being and tube 2 contains the DNA encoding the genome of a lithotrophic archaean that lives adjacent to a deep-sea hydrothermal vent that has an average temperature of 115°C (note that normal human body temperature is 37°C). You lend your tubes to a chemist friend, who loses the label on your tubes. However, he was able to determine the percentage molar ratios of As and Ts in these tubes, and finds that the DNA in tube 1 is composed of 59% As and Ts while the DNA in tube 2 is composed of 48% As and Ts. Which tube contains the human DNA and which tube contains the archaean DNA? Explain.
1-5 The adult human intestine contains hundreds of species of bacteria, and these bacteria often have specialized niches within the intestine. Members of the Bacteriodetes genus are common members of the intestinal flora, and the genomes of several species within this genus have been sequenced, including a species (B. dulcis) that is particularly capable of digesting plant polysaccharides. When the sequences of the Bacteriodetes species were compared, it was found that orthologous genes had between 60 to 80% amino acid identity between species. B. dulcis was found to have a set of genes encoding enzymes important for polysaccharide degradation that did not exist in the other species. Interestingly, sequence comparisons of these polysaccharide-degrading genes suggested that the closest relatives of these genes were in archaea and not in bacteria. Provide two possible explanations for how this set of genes could have arisen.
1-6 It is now generally accepted that mitochondria and chloroplasts originated as free-living bacteria that were engulfed by an ancestral eucaryotic cell. However, it is also known that the mitochondrial DNA and the chloroplast DNA lack genes for many essential functions. This means that, were the mitochondria or the chloroplast to “escape” the modern day eucaryotic cell, the mitochondria or the chloroplasts could not survive on their own. Explain what has happened that allows the mitochondria and chloroplasts to survive in the host cell, even though they lack the DNA encoding essential genes in their DNA.
1-7 Your friend obtained the sequence of an mRNA that encodes a gene important for tooth formation in cheetahs. Since she knows that the Us in an mRNA sequence were encoded by corresponding Ts in the DNA, she changes the Us in the mRNA to Ts and uses this nucleotide sequence to search the published genomic sequence of humans for a homologous gene. Her database search identifies a region of human DNA that has 35% identity with the cheetah nucleotide sequence (meaning, if you line up the two nucleotide sequences, 35% of the corresponding bases are exactly the same). However, when she showed this human DNA region to her boss, her boss took a quick look and told her that her search had not identified a homologous gene and that there was a better way to conduct her search. She has not yet taken cell biology, and turns to you for help. Given your knowledge of how a cell encodes and uses genetic information, devise a better strategy for using this nucleotide sequence to identify the homologous gene in humans.
1-8 Explain what an amphipathic molecule is and why in an aqueous solution a bilayer of amphipathic molecules self-aggregates to form a vesicle that contains water, whereas a monolayer of amphipathic molecules self-aggregates into a sphere that excludes water.
CHAPTER 2
Cell Chemistry and Biosynthesis
Questions
2-1 A major goal of interplanetary research is to find evidence of water on other planets, in the search for extraterrestrial life. All known life requires water.
A. Describe three properties of water that make it uniquely suited for life. In one or two sentences, describe each property and a consequence of that property for cells or organisms.
B. Both C–H bonds and O–H bonds have special properties that make life possible. What is the most notable difference between a C–H bond and an O–H bond? Why is this difference important? Is an N–H bond more like an O–H bond or a C–H bond?
C. In the search for interplanetary life, scientists are designing detection methods for an unmanned rover that can be used to identify five kinds of biomolecules. Name four of these five critical biomolecules.
2-2 Your friend learns about Avogadro’s number and thinks it is so huge that there may not even be a mole of living cells on Earth. You have recently heard that there are about 50 trillion (50 ´ 1012) human cells in each adult human body, so you bet your friend $5 that there is more than a mole of cells on Earth. Once you learn that each human contains more bacterial cells (in the digestive system) than human cells, you are sure that you have won the bet. In the year 2000, the human population surpassed 6 billion (6 ´ 109). What calculation can you show your friend to convince him you are right?
2-3 Your friend challenges you to a bet. He says that cola is so sweet that the sugar molecules in cola are more crowded than people packed into a 747 airplane. After an uncomfortable cross-country airplane trip, you think this cannot be true. Cola has 39 grams of sugar in 240 ml (0.9 M sugar). A person is roughly 2 ´ 1026 times larger than a sugar molecule, so scaling a person down to the size of a sugar molecule would correspondingly scale down the cabin volume of a 747 from about a million liters to 4 ´ 10-21 liters. The maximum capacity of a 747 is 568 people. Which is more crowded, the sugar molecules in soda or the passengers on a 747? What is the molarity of people on a 747, using the scaling described?
2-4 The yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae is commonly used to brew beer and leaven bread (the Latin words of the species name mean “sugar fungus” and “beer”). In making bread and beer, the yeast converts sugars to carbon dioxide, which forms bubbles that cause dough to rise, and ethanol, which gives beer its alcoholic punch. From the facts about sugar metabolism, you can explain to your friends how the alcohol and carbon dioxide arise. In glycolysis, a glucose molecule is converted into two pyruvate molecules (see Figure Q2-4).
A. Yeast can grow in the presence or absence of oxygen (aerobically or anaerobically, respectively). Does glycolysis oxidize glucose? Can cells growing anaerobically perform glycolysis? Explain.
B. Pyruvate can be converted to acetyl CoA or ethanol. Acetyl CoA then enters the citric acid cycle; ethanol is not metabolized further. Use chemical formulas to show what happens to the three carbon molecules in pyruvate in each case when both reactions are complete (drawn as in Figure Q2-4).
C. Is more ethanol made if yeast grows aerobically or anaerobically? Is more CO2 made if yeast grows aerobically or anaerobically? Explain.
D. Bread yeast strains have been optimized for their task. What do you think would happen if you brewed beer using bread yeast?
E. Some yeast (called rho–) have defective mitochondria, unlike the functional wild-type rho+ yeast. A friend gave you a rho– strain and a rho+ strain, but forgot to label the strains. What carbon source would you use to determine the identities of the strains? Name a carbon source that will allow both strains to grow and one that will allow only one to grow (and indicate which will grow).
Figure Q2-4
2-5 Lysine and glutamate are amino acids that are often positively and negatively charged, respectively, in proteins in the cell.
A. The neutral forms are shown in Figure Q2-5. Write the charged forms of the amino acids.
B. Consider a protein that has eight lysines and five glutamates, and no other potentially charged amino acids. What will be the net charge on the protein when it is dissolved in a solution at pH 3? At pH 7? At pH 13?
C. Histidine is usually neutral at high pH and charged at low pH when incorporated in a protein. Its pKa is about 6.5. Roughly what percentage of histidines will be charged in a solution at pH 6.5? At pH 5.5? At pH 8.5?
Figure Q2-5
2-6 Consider the reaction X ® Y in a cell at 37°C. At equilibrium, the concentrations of X and Y are 80 mM and 16 mM, respectively.
DG° = –0.616 ln Keq
DG = DG° + 0.616 ln [Y]/[X]
The natural log of a number z will be negative when z < 1, positive when z > 1, and 0 when z = 1.
A. What is the value of Keq for this reaction?
B. Is the standard free-energy change of this reaction positive or negative? Is the reaction X ® Y an energetically favorable or unfavorable reaction under standard conditions?
C. Imagine circumstances in which the concentration of X is 1000 mM and Y is 1 mM. Is a net conversion of X to Y favorable? For a given X molecule, will it be converted to a Y molecule quickly? Explain.
D. Consider 20 mM of Y added to a test tube with 80 mM of X that contains a radioactive atom to allow tracing of the individual atoms. The mixture is incubated for 2 hours before separating Y from X and measuring the radioactivity of Y. Does the information provided allow you to determine whether the Y molecules contain any radioactivity? If the reaction also contained an enzyme that catalyzes the interconversion of X and Y, would the Y molecules be radioactive? Explain.
E. Imagine starting conditions in which the reaction X ® Y is unfavorable, yet the cell needs to produce more Y. Describe two ways in which this may be accomplished.
2-7 Many critical molecules in cells are polymers. Which is more disordered, a polymer or a collection of monomers? On the basis of your answer, is the DG° of a condensation reaction positive, negative, or zero? What about the DG° of a hydrolysis reaction? Is a condensation or a hydrolysis reaction usually coupled to a reaction involving ATP or another activated carrier molecule?
2-8 The energetic trajectory of a series of reactions in a catabolic pathway can be plotted on a graph like that in Figure Q2-8. The graph shows a hypothetical pathway similar to glycolysis, in which the catabolic intermediates are designated A, B, C, etc. The energetic contributions of activated carrier molecules have been omitted from this energy plot. Which reaction is most likely to occur without an enzyme? Which reaction is most likely to be catalyzed by an enzyme that simultaneously uses ATP as a substrate? Which reaction is most likely to be catalyzed by an enzyme that simultaneously uses ADP as a substrate and produces ATP? Which reaction can most readily be driven by a subsequent reaction that acts as a siphon on the product? For each of the four answers, explain your reasoning.
Figure Q2-8
CHAPTER 3
Proteins
Questions
3-1 The table lists the average strengths of noncovalent bonds.
Table Q3-1
Protein Lock binds to protein Key in a reaction with G° = –14 kcal/mol. When these proteins bind, 350 Å2 of the surface of Lock is closely apposed to the same area on the surface of Key, so that water is excluded.
A. Estimate how much of the binding energy the van der Waals interactions contribute. (For this calculation, assume that an average atom has a surface area of 7 Å2.)
B. If hydrogen bonds contribute the remaining binding energy between amino acids, estimate how many hydrogen bonds form between Lock and Key. Does it depend on whether the hydrogen-bonded amino acids occur within the buried surface or elsewhere in the proteins? Explain.
3-2 Consider a protein X that is known to exist in two slightly different conformations, called X1 and X2. Proteins A, B, and C are ligands that can bind to protein X. The sites on X required for binding to A, B, and C are located in different regions of the protein. On the basis of experimental evidence of protein–protein complexes, you devise the hypothetical binding reaction scheme shown in Figure Q3-2. According to the hypothesis, which pairs of binding sites on X exhibit negative coupling (negative linkage)? Which pairs exhibit positive coupling (positive linkage)? Does the addition of a high concentration of protein A increase or decrease the affinity of X for B? Of X for C?
Figure Q3-2
3-3 You are working in a laboratory trying to understand how cells change shape in response to treatment with a particular chemical. On treatment, normal wild-type cells convert from a flattened irregular shape to a rounded, nearly spherical shape. Previously, another student in the laborator identified a mutant that remained flat after treatment. The gene that encodes the normal protein is called Flat1 and the mutant gene is designated flat1–. To identify additional genes responsible for this behavior, you mutagenize flat1– cells and look for those that can respond normally to stimulation. You identify cells that contain a “suppressor” mutation in a second gene, called supr1–, that restores the wild-type behavior to cells with the flat1– mutation. Further genetic manipulation and DNA sequencing reveals the data shown in the table below.
Initially, you are surprised to find that cells containing a mutation in supr1– and a normal copy of Flat1 have the same mutant behavior as cells containing only a flat1– mutation. However, when you examine the nature of the amino acids that are changed in the mutants, you instantly suggest a hypothesis to account for the observations. What is your hypothesis? What biochemical experiment with purified proteins will test your hypothesis? What biochemical results would support the hypothesis?
Table Q3-3
3-4 The Src protein kinase is composed of several domains that interact to control the behavior of the protein. Figure Q3-4 (A and B) shows the structure of the repressed conformation of Src. In 1979, long before the x-ray crystal structure of Src was known, scientists used a technique called partial proteolysis to explore the structure of Src. Treatment with small amounts of the V8 protease cleaved Src at a single location to generate two protein fragments. The addition of more V8 protease caused further cleavage of one of the fragments, but in both cases kinase activity was maintained. Figure Q3-4C shows a protein gel from this experiment. The proteolytic fragments are detected by their radioactivity because the Src protein contained radioactive atoms; in some reactions Src was radiolabelled throughout its length (“all”) and in others the radiolabel was only at the N-terminal end (“end”).
A. Indicate on the ribbon diagram where you think cleavage first occurs to generate the 34 kD and 26 kD fragments. Circle and label the regions corresponding to each fragment.
B. Which fragment contains the kinase domain? On the basis of the regulation of Src explained in the textbook, would you have expected this fragment to be active as a kinase, as observed? If so, do you expect the kinase activity be greater than, the same as, or less than that of the intact protein? Explain.
C. Dephosphorylation, mutation, or deletion of a particular tyrosine residue in the C-terminal tail of the protein leads to increased activity of the kinase and promotes cancerous transformation of cells. Do you expect the proteolytic fragment containing the kinase domain to be regulated strongly by phosphorylation of the key tyrosine in the C-terminal tail? Explain.
Figure Q3-4
3-5 Antibodies raised against proteins of interest are useful tools for biomedical research, because they allow the visualization or isolation of individual proteins from a complex mixture of different proteins. A Western blot (WB) is one method of visualizing proteins: all proteins are extracted from cells, the proteins are denatured and separated by size using electrophoresis through a gel, and the protein of interest is detected by binding to an antibody that is linked to a fluorescent or luminescent molecule.
Immunofluorescence (IF) provides a way to visualize a particular protein within a cell using microscopy: the cell is “fixed” (killed and preserved intact), flooded with an antibody that binds a protein of interest, and washed free of unbound antibody. Because the antibody is also bound to a fluorescent molecule, the subcellular location and intensity of the fluorescence indicates the location and concentration of the protein of interest.
Unfortunately, many antibodies that work well for WB are not useful for IF. Consider an antibody that yields an intense signal located at the expected position on a WB. When the WB is performed with cells lacking the protein of interest, the intense signal is absent but there remain a few faint signals from non-specific proteins of the wrong size. Yet this antibody is not useful for IF because in IF the wild-type cells and the cells lacking the protein of interest look the same. Suggest two possible explanations for the observation that the antibody is more specific in a WB than in an IF experiment; note that at least five explanations are possible.
3-6 Immunoprecipitation (IP) is commonly used in biomedical research to examine whether proteins interact physically with each other. You perform an IP procedure to determine if a protein called Elm interacts with proteins called Oak and Red. First, you link an Elm-specific antibody to small beads that settle out of solution readily. Second, you grind up cells, extract the soluble proteins, add the beads, and incubate for 2 hours. Third, you centrifuge the mixture to separate the beads from the unbound proteins. Fourth, you wash the beads three times to remove weakly bound proteins; to do this, you add a large volume of buffer to the beads, incubate for 5 minutes, then remove the buffer. Finally, you add detergent to the beads to denature and dissociate all proteins before separating them on a gel and revealing them with additional specific antibodies. Because you do not have antibodies against Oak and Red, you genetically engineer cells in which both of these proteins are fused to a small protein handle or tag called HA, for which you purchase specific antibodies. Your gel is shown in Figure Q3-6.
A. Your lab partner Chris looks at your gel and says that you have evidence that Elm binds directly to Oak and to Red. Do you agree? Is there a plausible alternative interpretation of your data?
B. Chris says that your data demonstrate that Elm, Oak, and Red form a three-protein complex. Do you agree? Explain.
C. Assume that you have solid evidence that Elm binds directly to Oak and it also binds directly to Red. Chris says that Elm has higher affinity for Red (has a lower Kd) than it has for Oak. Do you agree? Explain, with reference to an equation for Kd.
Figure Q3-6
3-7 By computational analysis of genome sequences, you discover a new protein family with members from many different eucaryotic and procaryotic organisms, but nothing is known about the functions of these proteins. You suspect that these proteins may share a previously unknown protein fold and thus you wish to determine the x-ray crystal structure of a member of this family. Because the most challenging steps in structural determination are the production of very pure, concentrated protein and the formation of crystals in which protein molecules pack closely together in a uniform conformation, you need to choose carefully which member of the family to use for structural experiments. You decide to use a procaryotic protein, because it is easier to get large amounts of protein. You narrow the choice to family members from the model organism E. coli, the pathogenic (disease-causing) organism Yersinia pestis, the thermophilic (heat loving) organism Thermus aquaticus, and the halophilic (salt loving) organism Haloquadratum walsbyi. You will overexpress one of these proteins in E. coli from recombinant DNA. Which one is likely to be easier to purify and to be more energetically stable and conformationally uniform under the crystallization conditions? Explain.
3-8 Members of the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) family are essential for many responses to the extracellular environment. A MAPK becomes active after it becomes phosphorylated by a second kinase. These MAPKs contain a “docking site” distant from the active site that binds to conserved 10–15 amino acid “docking motifs” found in a variety of proteins (see Figure Q3-8). Docking motifs are found in proteins that bind MAPKs (scaffold proteins), proteins that are substrates of MAPKs, proteins that activate MAPKs by phosphorylating them (MAPK kinases), and proteins that inactivate MAPKs by dephosphorylating them (phosphatases). The kinetic properties of a particular MAPK were measured with a small peptide substrate that contains only the preferred phosphorylation site. The Km is 300 nM and the kcat is 20/sec. Do you expect the kcat for the natural protein substrate to be higher or lower than that for the peptide substrate? What about the Km? Explain, with reference to the reaction shown in panel A below:
Figure Q3-8
CHAPTER 4
DNA, Chromosomes, and Genomes
Questions
4-1 Figure Q4-1 shows a hypothetical alignment of nucleotide sequences from two organisms. The bottom panel shows an alignment of large chromosomal regions, with black blocks representing DNA stretches of at least 500 nucleotides for which there is a corresponding sequence somewhere in the other organism’s genome. Gray lines connect the pairs of corresponding sequences found in this alignment region. The top panel shows a magnified view of one region, approximately the length of an average gene. Here, each vertical gray line represents a stretch of six nucleotides in which five of the six are identical between the two species. Annotate the top panel of the figure to indicate likely locations of exons, introns, and regulatory sequences; annotate the bottom panel to show regions of synteny.
Figure Q4-1
4-2 The dynamics of nucleosomes can be studied in a test tube by mixing histone proteins with short pieces of DNA to form a single nucleosome on each DNA molecule. When a dye molecule is covalently linked to one end of the DNA and a complementary dye molecule is linked to a histone protein, the proximity of the two dyes can be measured. Such measurements, combined with other experiments, suggested that nucleosomes alternated between two states, one fully wrapped (W) and the second partly unwrapped (U). The equilibrium constant between these two states, Keq = [U]/[W], depends on the concentration of salt in the test tube. At the salt concentration found in cells, the Keq was between 0.02 and 0.1.
A. About what percentage of the time is a given nucleosome partly unwrapped at this salt concentration? Explain.
B. Will increasing the salt concentration increase or decrease the Keq? Explain.
4-3 When placed on an agar slab and incubated at 30°C for 2 days, a single yeast cell proliferates into a colony with a diameter of 2 mm containing 108 yeast cells. If the cell has a functional Ade2 gene (Ade2+), the colony will be white; if Ade2 is non-functional (Ade2–), the colony will be red. You take a strain with a mutant Ade2– at the regular chromosomal position (red colonies) and insert a second, functional Ade2+ gene near the telomere. You find that the colonies are a mixture of red and white patches or sectors. Figure Q4-3 shows some colonies; the black regions represent the red sectors.
A. Explain what happened to the Ade2+ gene near the telomere in the red cells and in the white cells. What is the term for this phenomenon?
B. You take single cells from the white sectors and allow them to form new colonies. You do the same with cells from the red sectors. Predict the color of the colonies. Explain.
C. You measure acetylation of the N-termini of histones H3 and H4 that are located near the telomeric Ade2+. Do you expect more or less acetylation in the red cells than in the white cells?
D. You look for mutants that give only white colonies. You find mutations in three genes: Rap1, which encodes a protein that binds specific short DNA sequences near the telomere; Sir2, which encodes a histone deacetlyase; and Sir4, which encodes a protein that binds Rap1, Sir2, and deacetylated N-termini of histones H3 and H4. Propose a series of events in which these proteins act together to turn a white cell into a red cell.
Figure Q4-3
4-4 You want to examine where within the cell a protein called Tip resides. To do this, you make a DNA construct containing regulatory sequences (RS) that control gene expression, the protein-coding region of the Tip gene, and a sequence that codes for green fluorescent protein (GFP). The expressed fusion protein includes the Tip protein covalently linked at one end to Gfp, and therefore you can visualize the subcellular location of Tip by viewing green fluorescence with a microscope. You transfect mouse cells with the RS-Tip-GFP construct and find cells in which the constructs have been inserted in the genome at random. You look at 10 colonies, each arising from an independent insertion, and find that some colonies contain cells that all have high levels of fluorescence, whereas other colonies have only cells with moderate or low levels. Two colonies even have a mixture of cells, some with high levels of fluorescence and others with low levels.
A. Explain the observed differences between colonies and for each observed colony behavior.
B. Propose an improved version of your RS-Tip-GFP construct that might make the colonies more uniform. List the order of sequences in the improved construct.
4-5 You want to investigate the substructure of an intact interphase nucleus. To do this, you fix cells and isolate their nuclei. You add fluorescent antibodies that bind specifically to particular proteins, and then observe fluorescence with a microscope. A nucleus is represented in Figure Q4-5. Which of the proteins listed below do you expect to be concentrated in a subnuclear region? Indicate on the figure where you expect those proteins to localize. Proteins: HP1, histone H3 acetylated on lysine 9, histone H3 methylated on lysine 9, histone H1, and condensin.

4-6 Gene duplication is widely believed to be a major mechanism for generating genetic novelty and increased biological complexity.
A. How does a pseudogene arise?
B. Identify the simplest kind of experiment to begin characterizing the divergence of a pair of functional genes that arose from an ancient duplication event, and describe what results are expected.
C. Because of the availability of whole-genome DNA sequences and whole-genome gene expression measurements, researchers classify each gene as a member of a duplicated set or a singleton and then evaluate whether there is a difference between expression patterns of the two classes. Which class contains a larger proportion of genes whose expression differs between strains of an organism? Which class contains a larger proportion of genes whose expression differs between different stages in embryogenesis? Explain.
4-7 A hypothetical phylogenetic tree is shown in Figure Q4-7. Use this tree to answer the following questions.
A. How many years ago did species M and N diverge from their last common ancestor?
B. How much nucleotide divergence is there on average between M and N?
C. Are M and N more or less closely related to each other than P and S?
D. In looking for functionally important nucleotide sequences, is it more informative to compare the genome sequences of M and N or those of M and Q? Explain.
Figure Q4-7
4-8 Consider a gene with a particular function. Mutation X and mutation Y separately cause defects in the function of the encoded protein. Yet a gene containing both mutations X and Y encodes a protein that works even better than the original protein. The odds that a single mutational event will generate both mutations X and Y are exceedingly small. Explain a simple way in which an organism with a mutant gene containing both mutations X and Y could arise during evolution.

A. The percentage of the time is 2–10%. An equilibrium constant between 0.02 and 0.1 means that at a given instant 2–10% of the nucleosomes are partly unwrapped. Because the question said that each nucleosome alternates between the two states, the previous sentence can be transformed to say that a single nucleosome spends 2–10% of the time in a partly unwrapped state.
B. Increase. A higher salt concentration will disrupt the nucleosomes, because they are held together largely by ionic interactions between the positively charged histone proteins and the negatively charged DNA. This will lead to more unwrapped nucleosomes and fewer wrapped nucleosomes, which will increase the Keq.

A. In the white cells, the inserted Ade2+ gene is expressed and the Ade2 protein is made. In the red cells, the inserted Ade2+ gene has undergone gene silencing, probably as a result of spreading of heterochromatin from the telomere. This is called position-effect variegation.
B. The cells from both colors of sectors will generate new colonies that are also sectored. Colonies from red cells may tend to have more red than white; colonies from white cells may have more white than red. The Ade2+ gene in white cells is probably packaged in euchromatin, and in red cells in heterochromatin. The chromatin state of a genomic locus is often directly inherited during the process of DNA replication, causing a phenomenon called epigenetic inheritance, so red (white) cells will tend to make more red (white) cells. But with position-effect variegation there is a certain low frequency of switching of chromatin from a repressed to an expressed state, and vice versa, so red (white) cells can become white (red).
C. More histone acetylation will occur near the telomeric Ade2+ in the cells that actively express the gene; that is, in the white cells. Expressed regions of the genome are enriched in acetylated histones.
D. A white cell is turned into a red cell by spreading of heterochromatin from the telomere to the Ade2+ inserted nearby. The spreading might happen as follows: (1) Rap1 binds a site in the telomeric region, (2) Sir4 binds to Rap1 and recruits Sir2, (3) Sir2 deacetylates histones near Rap1, (4) more Sir4 binds to the deacetylated histones and recruits more Sir2, (5) Sir2 deacetylates more histones farther from the Rap1-binding site, (6) repeat steps 4 and 5 for many cycles in a chain reaction until the deacetylation reaches the Ade2+ gene. Deacetylated histones are components of heterochromatin, and they may recruit other histone-modifying enzymes, histone-binding proteins, and chromatin-remodeling complexes.
4-4
A. The differences between the colonies probably arise from position effects. The construct might have inserted near sequence elements and chromatin structures that enhance gene expression (high fluorescence), have no effect on gene expression (high or moderate fluorescence), repress gene expression (low fluorescence), or spread heterochromatin into the inserted construct (variable fluorescence). The colonies with mixed populations of cells probably contain the construct inserted near heterochromatin, which spreads into the construct in some cells but not others.
B. The construct might confer more uniform gene expression, independently of where it inserted in the genome, if it contained barrier sequences. Barrier sequences, like HS4 from the chicken beta-globin locus, normally separate an active chromatin domain from a silenced chromatin domain. Barrier sequences (BSs) can insulate a DNA construct from position effects if they flank the important sequences on both sides. An improved construct containing BS-RS-Tip-GFP-BS might yield more uniform expression among and within the colonies.
4-5 See Figure A4-5. Methylated histone H3 and HP1 are associated with silenced or heterochromatic regions of chromatin. Acetylated histone H3 is associated with actively expressed regions of chromatin. Histone H1 and condensin are not indicated in the figure because histone H1 is everywhere and condensin is only localized to chromosomes in mitosis, not in interphase.

A. Creation of a pseudogene starts when a gene is duplicated. Next, a random mutation inactivates or impairs one of the copies. It is unlikely that the mutation has detrimental consequences for the cell or the organism, because there is a second fully functional copy. The mutated copy may continue to accumulate additional mutations without detrimental consequences, and it may lose all functionality and perhaps even lose the ability to be expressed. A non-functional gene is called a pseudogene.
B. The simplest kind of experiment is a comparison of the expression patterns of the duplicated genes. After duplication, genes commonly diverge in their expression pattern. The expectation, then, is that the mRNA and the proteins encoded by the duplicated genes will be observed at different developmental stages or in different tissues or cell types (or at different stages of the cell-division cycle or in different subcellular compartments).
C. The answer to both questions is duplicated genes, not singletons. Genes that are part of a duplicated or expanded set are more likely to exhibit more narrowly specialized expression. Duplicated genes that diverge are more likely to survive through evolutionary time, because there will be detrimental consequences for loss of each gene. One simple way to diverge, such that both copies of a pair will be required, is for random mutations of regulatory regions to generate differences in when and where each gene is turned on.
4-7 A. M and N diverged 8 million years ago.
B. There is an average of 1.6% nucleotide substitution in M compared with N (follow the path connecting the two species, which is twice the distance between each one and their common ancestor).
C. More. However, they show roughly the same degree of relatedness. The sequence divergence between M and N is about 1.6%, whereas that between P and S is about 2.0%. M and N diverged 8 million years ago, whereas P and S diverged 10 million years ago.
D. It is more informative to compare species that are separated by a greater evolutionary distance; comparing M and Q, which diverged 20 million years ago, will therefore be better able to identify sequences likely to be important for function. Closely related species share many sequences by chance because insufficient time has passed for neutral mutations to accumulate.
4-8 The simplest way to evolve the new gene is by duplication and divergence. If the gene is duplicated, then the cell or lineage can maintain one functional, intact copy of the original gene and can thus tolerate a disabling mutation in the second copy. The second copy can initially be modified by the X or Y mutation that impairs its function. At some later time, many generations later, the gene with the single mutation can acquire the additional mutation to yield the doubly mutant X+Y gene with the new or improved function.
CHAPTER 5
DNA, Replication, Repair, and Recombination
Questions
5-1 The mutation rate is about 1 mutation per 109 nucleotides per cell division in most organisms, from E. coli bacteria through nematode worms up to humans. You aspire to develop an improved superorganism with a reduced mutation rate. Through a clever genetic screen, you isolate a mutant strain of E. coli that suffers only about 1 mutation per 1012 nucleotides per cell division. You imagine that this superorganism will have superior survival and proliferation properties, and might take over the world. A colleague suggests you do the following experiment: Put a gene encoding yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) in the original strain and a gene encoding cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) in the mutant strain. Start with a single cell from each strain and allow those cells to proliferate under optimal conditions for a month. Then mix equal numbers of cells from each strain together so that 50% of the cells are yellow and 50% are cyan, and split the mixture into two parts. Culture “Mix 1” in rich growth medium for four weeks, diluting the cells and adding fresh medium every two days. Culture “Mix 2” in a similar way, except add excess salt during the first week, add copper during the second week, grow at an elevated temperature during the third week, and reduce the nutrients in the medium during the fourth week. Finally, examine the ratio of yellow to cyan cells in the mixes. You find that 55% of the cells in Mix 1 are cyan, but only 40% of the cells in Mix 2 are cyan. Explain these observations. Suggest a reason why the mutation rate is 10-9 in all wild-type organisms tested.
5-2 A pregnant mouse is exposed to high levels of a chemical. Many of the mice in her litter are deformed, but when they are interbred with each other, all their offspring are normal. For each of the statements below, explain why it is a likely or an unlikely explanation of the observations.
A. The mother mouse’s germ cells were mutated.
B. In the deformed mice, germ cells but not somatic cells were mutated.
C. The toxic chemical affects development but is not mutagenic.
D. In the deformed mice, somatic cells but not germ cells were mutated.
5-3 Imagine that you join a laboratory that has established a technique for examining DNA replication in a cellular extract. To the cellular protein extract, you simply add nucleotides, a small amount of radiolabeled 32P-dGTP to aid visualization of the synthesized DNA, and a 4000-base-pair linear double-stranded DNA molecule that contains an origin of replication in the middle. After allowing the reaction to proceed for 30 minutes at 30°C, you boil the mixture to denature the proteins and the DNA strands, separate the components on an acrylamide gel, and detect the radiolabeled DNA products. This complete reaction is shown in lane 2 on the gel in Figure Q5-3.
A. You perform the assay by yourself for the first time late on a Friday night, and no one else is in lab. The tube labeled “nucleotide mixture” has only enough for a single reaction, but you find a tube with a label that reads “dATP, dTTP, dGTP, dCTP” and you use this in a second reaction. You find the first reaction looks like lane 2 and the second reaction looks like lane 3. Why was no DNA synthesized in the second reaction?
B. Your lab partner has recently isolated several mutant strains that can replicate their DNA and proliferate normally at 30°C but exhibit no DNA replication when grown at 40°C. He calls these mutants tsr1 through tsr4, for Temperature Sensitive Replication. The wild-type strain replicates efficiently at both temperatures. You believe that you can use the biochemical assay of cell extracts to identify which genes are defective in the new mutants. First you grow wild-type cells and tsr1 cells at 40°C, make the extracts, incubate the DNA replication reaction at 40°C, and detect the products on a gel. You observe the pattern shown in lanes 4 and 5. You are so excited by the results, you run to your lab partner and tell him that you know what enzyme is defective. He is delighted by your results but says that there are two different enzymes that can account for your results. What are they?
C. Heartened by your initial success in narrowing down the identity of the defective genes in the new mutants, you test the mutants called tsr2, tsr3, and tsr4. You find they all give the pattern shown in lane 6: they fail to make detectable DNA products. Name two of the several proteins that, when defective, might yield the pattern in lane 6.
D. To explore these mutants further, you mix the extracts together. You find that tsr2 plus tsr3 gives a wild-type pattern shown in lane 7, but tsr2 plus tsr4 still gives the mutant pattern in lane 8. What is the simplest explanation for these results?
Figure Q5-3
5-4 Strand-directed mismatch repair occurs soon after the passage of a replication fork to repair mismatched base pairs and preferentially restore the original sequence. How does the repair system know which is the original sequence and which is the new, mutated sequence? To identify the newly synthesized strand, procaryotes take advantage of the transient absence of methylation. Eucaryotes cannot use hemimethylation as a clue and instead use single-stranded DNA nicks to identify the newly synthesized strand. Consider a 1 kb stretch of double-stranded DNA before replication, with its “top” strand and “bottom” strand. To convince yourself that replication generates a new “bottom” strand and a new “top” strand that both contain nicks (transiently), draw a replication bubble that started in the middle of the DNA and extends almost to the edge. Show the origin of replication, the replication fork(s), the leading and lagging strands, and the 5’ and 3’ ends of all DNA fragments.
5-5 Yeast cells that are heterozygous for the ADE2 gene are useful for following the distribution of alleles after meiosis. The meiotic products in yeast are called spores, and are analogous to sperm and eggs. All four spores derived from meiosis in a single cell are packaged together as a tetrad, and they can be separated under the microscope and deposited at specific locations on an agar pad. When the agar pad is placed on appropriate medium in a Petri dish, a colony of cells grows from each spore. Colonies that have wild-type ADE2 are white and those that have mutant ade2 are red. Most tetrads give two white and two red colonies, as would be expected from simple Mendelian genetics.
A. Sometimes a tetrad yields three white and one red spore colony, or vice versa. What is the name for the phenomenon that causes this pattern, and how does it arise?
B. When certain yeast mutants are sent through meiosis, a few of the spore colonies exhibit sectoring. A sectored colony has about half red cells and half white cells. Consider all of the enzymatic steps in homologous recombination. What part of homologous recombination is defective in these “PMS” (for Post-Meiotic Segregation) mutants?
C. Mutations in human homologs of the yeast PMS genes contribute to the development of some cancers, as a result of their effects on mitotic DNA replication. Why do you think this is?
5-6 Chromosomal DNA sequences are maintained and replicated with such high fidelity that the sequence of the human genome is changed by only about three nucleotides each time a cell divides. You mention this astonishing fact to your grandfather, who has just read an article in the newspaper about human genetics. He exclaims that this seems to be a very high mutation rate because changing the function of three proteins every time a cell divides should quickly lead to a defective individual. Explain the mistake in your grandfather’s reasoning.
5-7 The bacterium E. coli replicates its genome in about 20 minutes under ideal growth conditions. Surprisingly, the fruit fly Drosophila can replicate its genome in only 3 minutes. How can this be? For each statement below, indicate whether it is true and whether it can explain the difference in the duration of replication.
A. The Drosophila genome is smaller than the E. coli genome.
B. Eucaryotic DNA polymerase synthesizes DNA at a much faster rate than procaryotic DNA polymerase.
C. The nuclear membrane keeps the Drosophila DNA concentrated in one place in the cell.
D. Drosophila DNA contains more origins of replication than E. coli DNA.
E. Eucaryotes have more than one kind of DNA polymerase.
5-8 Some retrotransposons and retroviruses integrate preferentially into regions of the chromosome that are (a) packaged in euchromatin and (b) located outside the regions of genes that encode the amino acid sequences of proteins. Why might these mobile genetic elements have evolved this strategy?
CHAPTER 6
How Cells Read the Genome: From DNA to Protein
Questions
6-1 Consider an RNA molecule that forms part of an RNP. On the basis of an alignment of the nucleotide sequence of this RNA from several species and a computer algorithm that predicts secondary structure in RNA molecules, you hypothesize that the RNA folds and forms conventional base-pair interactions as shown in Figure Q6-1. To test this structural hypothesis, you make many mutated forms of the RNA that contain one or two base changes. You test to see whether each mutant RNA is functional or defective. For example, your results lead you to conclude that the G indicated by the arrow pairs with the C as shown. Describe a set of three mutants and explain the phenotypes that would support your conclusion.
Figure Q6-1
6-2 Cells have several mechanisms to prevent the production and accumulation of truncated protein fragments. To illustrate why these fragments can be deleterious, consider a transcriptional activator protein called Groovy that binds to an enhancer element upstream of the Zippy gene. Groovy has a DNA-binding domain at its N-terminus and a domain that binds a histone-modifying enzyme at its C-terminus.
A. If a cell makes substantial amounts of an N-terminal fragment of Groovy, containing the DNA-binding domain, what is likely to happen to transcription of the Zippy gene?
B. If, in addition to the N-terminal fragment of Groovy, a cell also makes an equal amount of the full-length protein, what is likely to happen to transcription of the Zippy gene?
C. Consider two cell lines or strains that each have a fully functional allele of the Groovy gene on one copy of chromosome 3. On the second copy of chromosome 3, strain 1 lacks a second Groovy allele whereas strain 2 contains the Groovy allele that codes for the N-terminal fragment described in part A. If strain 1 and strain 2 have different amounts of Zippy mRNA, which do you expect to have more Zippy mRNA? Explain.
D. Strain 3 encodes the same N-terminal Groovy fragment as strain 2, except that the gene in strain 2 contains a deletion of some Groovy coding sequence and strain 3 has a single base-pair change that converts a lysine codon (AAA) to a stop codon (UAA). You find that strain 3 produces the same amount of Zippy mRNA as strain 1. Can you explain why?
6-3 More than 90% of mammalian genes encode proteins and fewer than 10% produce RNA as their final product.
A. Your friend says this means that most RNA in cells is mRNA, not rRNA. Do you agree? Explain.
B. You want to separate the mRNA from other RNA molecules, taking advantage of the ability of RNA to hybridize to a complementary DNA strand. Describe a strategy to purify mRNA from other RNAs.
6-4 Consider a pre-mRNA that is 12,700 nucleotides long and contains seven 100-base exons separated by 2000-base introns. It seems like an overwhelming task for the splicing machinery to find the exons buried in the intron sequences and to splice them properly, without skipping any exons. Explain how this is accomplished.
6-5 Alignment of the nucleotide sequences of orthologous genes from different organisms can suggest which amino acids are important for the function of a protein. Consider the alignment of cDNA sequences shown in Figure Q6-5A, taken from the middle of a gene that has been highly conserved during evolution. Can you deduce the reading frame of this segment of cDNA? (You can consult the genetic code provided in Figure Q6-5B.
Figure Q6-5
6-6 You measure the stability of your favorite protein kinase and find that half of the protein is degraded every 10 minutes. You suspect that your protein is subjected to ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, so you partly purify the protein, run a gel, transfer to a membrane, and probe with an antibody against ubiquitin. You do not detect any ubiquitin attached to your protein, even though control experiments demonstrate that your protein is present on the membrane and the anti-ubiquitin antibody successfully detects another ubiquitylated protein.
A. Does this mean that your protein is not ubiquitylated? Explain.
B. Your advisor suggests that you perform additional experiments to block ubiquitin-mediated degradation and then see whether your protein is ubiquitylated under these conditions. Describe one way to accomplish this task.
6-7 For quality control in protein translation, there are two time delays in the correct positioning of incoming charged tRNAs on the ribosome. The first is a delay in the hydrolysis of GTP by EF-Tu after it brings a charged tRNA to the ribosome. The second is a delay before the amino acid carried by the tRNA moves into position at the active site of the ribosome. Both of these delays are longer for an incorrect tRNA than for a correct one. But what if one of these delays were the same length of time for correct and incorrect tRNAs? Consider whether a fixed delay can still increase accuracy.
A. Assume that the affinity of binding between the mRNA–ribosome complex and the tRNAs in question are described by Kd values of 0.3 M and 3 M. Which Kd is for the correct tRNA?
B. Recall that Kd = koff/kon. In general, kon values do not change as much as koff values. Assume that kon is 1 M–1 sec–1 for both correct and incorrect tRNA binding to the mRNA–ribosome complex. Calculate the koff for the correct and incorrect tRNAs. What do you expect will happen during a delay of 1 second?
6-8 You want to purify large amounts of a human tumor suppressor protein called Tusup for biochemical studies. The easiest and cheapest way to achieve this is to place the Tusup gene in an expression plasmid in the bacteria E. coli.
A. Unfortunately, you find that the bacteria produce only a small amount of Tusup. Even worse, they produce far more N-terminal fragments than full-length Tusup proteins. Your advisor notes that your protein has many arginine codons and this may cause a problem. You peruse the literature on codon usage in bacterial and human genes and discover that human genes have a bias for the various arginine codons that differs from that of E. coli genes, as shown in Table Q6-8. Why might this different codon usage limit the production of full-length Tusup protein? How might you remedy the problem?
B. The remedy you proposed in A worked wonderfully, so the bacteria express large amounts of full-length Tusup protein. However, you find that the protein is insoluble because it is misfolded and aggregated inside the bacterial cells. What proteins could you overexpress in E. coli to help the overexpressed Tusup proteins fold and to prevent their aggregation?

7-1 Figure Q7-1 shows a DNA double helix and its nucleotide sequence.
A. Indicate the major groove and the minor groove.
B. A homodimeric helix–turn–helix protein binds to a DNA fragment containing this sequence. Its preferred half-site is AACAC. Show where the two recognition helices in the protein contact the DNA.
C. Are protein–DNA contacts primarily in the major or the minor groove of DNA? What parts of the nucleotides contact the amino acid side chains of the protein to provide most sequence specificity? What kind of bond is primarily responsible for specific protein–DNA interactions?
D. If 5 base pairs are inserted in the middle of a binding site for a dimeric helix–turn–helix protein, binding is abolished. If 10 base pairs are inserted, binding is sometimes preserved, albeit with lowered affinity. Explain these observations.

B. You suspect you know which DNA-binding protein recognizes the first site in the sequence shown. Describe an experiment to determine whether your hunch is correct.
Figure Q7-2
7-3 The Sweetie gene is not expressed during normal growth conditions, but is expressed after treatment of cells with sucrose. In principle, the gene could be turned on by production or activation of a transcriptional activator (positive control) or by inactivation or depletion of a transcriptional repressor (negative control). One way to distinguish between these alternatives is to isolate and characterize mutants in which Sweetie is expressed in the absence of sucrose. Three possible mutants are described below. Explain whether each mutant supports positive or negative control.
A. A single base-pair change located 800 base pairs upstream (5’) of the Sweetie coding region.
B. A mutation in a coding region distinct from Sweetie that, when present in both copies of the chromosome in a diploid cell, causes expression of Sweetie in the absence of sucrose. However, when a diploid cell has the mutant gene on one chromosome and a normal copy on the other chromosome, Sweetie is expressed normally. (This is a recessive mutation.)
C. A mutation in a coding region distinct from Sweetie that causes expression of Sweetie in the absence of sucrose, even when a diploid cell has one normal copy of the gene and one mutant copy. (This is a dominant mutation.)
7-4 Protein–protein interactions for four hypothetical regulatory proteins are shown in a table below. Each protein binds a specific DNA sequence and regulates gene expression.

A. Does this circuit include examples of positive feedback, negative feedback, or feedforward? If so, label and draw a box around the relevant subcircuit. Briefly describe the components involved and the effect of the subcircuit on the levels of activated components.

7-8 The Foofoo gene normally causes one breed of rabbits to have dark brown fur. When Foofoo function is abolished, the rabbits are white. If you replace the 3¢ UTR of Foofoo with the 3¢UTR from another gene, the resulting rabbits are light brown. Describe three mechanisms that might cause this outcome.

Manipulating Proteins, DNA, and RNA
Questions
8-1 You have accidentally torn the labels off two tubes, each containing a different plasmid, and now do not know which plasmid is in which tube. Fortunately, you have restriction maps for both plasmids, shown in Figure Q8-1. You have the opportunity to test just one sample from one of your tubes. You have equipment for agarose gel electrophoresis, a standard set of DNA size markers, and the necessary restriction enzymes.
A. Outline briefly the series of steps you would perform to determine which plasmid is in which tube.
B. Which restriction enzyme or combination of restriction enzymes would you use in this experiment?
Figure Q8-1
8-2 You have sequenced a short piece of DNA and produced the gel shown below:
A. What is the sequence of the DNA, starting from the 5¢ end?
B. If you know that this sequence is from the middle of a protein-coding cDNA clone, what amino acid sequence can you deduce from this sequence?
Figure Q8-2
8-3 Figure Q8-3 shows the recognition sequences for the restriction enzymes SalI, XhoI, PstI, and SmaI and a plasmid with the sites of cleavage for these enzymes marked.
A. Consider all possible digestion reactions with one or two restriction enzymes. After which of the digestions can the plasmid form into a circle again simply by treatment with DNA ligase? Assume that after digestion any small pieces of DNA are removed, and it is only the larger portion of plasmid that you are trying to restore to its circular state.
B. After which of the possible digestions can the plasmid be restored to a circle by first adding DNA polymerase and the four deoxynucleotides, then treating with DNA ligase? Again assume that you are trying to form the larger portion of plasmid into a circle again.
Figure Q8-3
8-4 You have an oligonucleotide probe that hybridizes to part of gene A from a eucaryotic cell. You can use this probe to isolate a corresponding plasmid from a DNA library harbored by a collection of bacteria. Will a cDNA library or a genomic DNA library be more appropriate for the following applications? Explain.
A. You want to study the promoter of a gene A.
B. Gene A encodes a tRNA and you wish to isolate a piece of DNA containing the full-length sequence of the tRNA.
C. You discover that gene A is alternatively spliced and you want to see which predicted alternative splice products are actually produced in a cell.
D. You want to find both gene A and the genes located near gene A on the chromosome.
E. You want to express gene A in bacteria to produce lots of protein A.
F. You want to perform a phylogenetic comparison to find amino acid sequences important for the function of gene A.
8-5 You want to make an antibody against a C. elegans nematode protein that the DNA shown in Figure Q8-5A encodes. To do this, you will clone the coding sequence into a bacterial expression plasmid, overexpress the protein, purify it, and inject it into a mouse to stimulate the production of antibodies against the protein.
A. You use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification to amplify the DNA corresponding to the 1800 base pairs of coding sequence; this coding sequence lies between the two flanking sequence shown in Figure Q8-5A. You will then insert the PCR product into the BamHI site of the expression plasmid shown in Figure Q8-5B. Is it best to use genomic DNA or cDNA as template in the PCR reaction? What are the sequences of the two oligonucleotide primers that will allow you to amplify the DNA by PCR and insert it into the BamHI site? (Remember to indicate the 5¢ and 3¢ ends of the primers.)
B. Briefly describe the series of enzymatic treatments you will use to create the expression plasmid before transferring it into bacterial cells.
C. Once the correct new expression plasmid is in bacterial cells, you induce high levels of expression of your nematode protein. Briefly describe the series of steps you will perform to go from the cells containing high levels of protein to partly purified protein.
D. Several weeks after you inject a mouse with your purified protein, you sample its blood serum, which contains antibodies. You know from in situ hybridizations that the mRNA corresponding to your protein is found in gonad cells but not in gut cells. To test whether the mouse has made antibodies against your protein, you isolate protein from gonad cells and from gut cells and perform a Western blot (also known as an immunoblot) with the mouse serum and a fluorescent second antibody that binds mouse antibodies. Your result is shown in Figure Q8-5C. Did the mouse make antibodies against your protein? Does the serum specifically recognize only one nematode protein? (Illustrate your written answers by labeling the blot.) What might you do next if you wanted to use antibodies from this mouse to determine the subcellular location of your protein in fixed cells?
Figure Q8-5
8-6 Current technologies allow much more facile manipulation and analysis of nucleic acids than proteins. For example, it is straightforward to generate and purify thousands of different DNA molecules for a DNA microarray, but difficult to make an analogous protein microarray. This may reflect fundamental differences between the two kinds of polymers. Colloquially, we might say that DNA double helices are all the same, but each protein has its own personality.
A. Compare how the shape of a DNA double helix or protein molecule depends on the sequence of monomers.
B. Compare the means used to detect a specific DNA molecule in a complex mixture of other DNAs with that used to detect a specific protein in a complex protein mixture.
C. Briefly compare the means used to make many copies of a DNA or protein molecule for biochemical experiments.
D. Can you unambiguously predict an amino acid sequence from a cDNA sequence? Can you unambiguously predict a cDNA sequence from an amino acid sequence? Explain.
8-7 You are working in a laboratory, trying to identify how the nematode worm C. elegans senses and moves toward specific “attractant” chemicals. You examine an electronic database that compiles mRNA expression profiles of all nematode genes measured by DNA microarray hybridization experiments, and find that an unknown gene is transcribed coordinately with several genes known to be involved in the attractant response. You name this gene Unk1 and set out to learn what it does.
A. Without doing a single experiment at the lab bench, how can you learn more about what the Unk1 protein might be doing? How might this influence your choice of experiments with Unk1?
B. You decide to use reverse genetics to learn more about the function of the Unk1 gene. What is the simplest first experiment to do, considering that you are working with nematodes?
C. You decide to look for proteins that bind to Unk1, which may provide important clues to its function. Briefly describe an approach to find binding partners.
D. You decide to determine where and when Unk1 is expressed within the animal, to learn more about how it causes the observed phenotypes. Describe an approach to monitor spatiotemporal dynamics of Unk1 expression.
8-8 Human babies use the lactase enzyme to metabolize the milk sugar lactose. Most human adults are lactose-intolerant because this gene is normally turned off in adults. However, many adults of European descent still express lactase. This lactase-persistence trait is tightly linked to a SNP called C/T-13910 located near the lactase gene. Examination of many SNPs flanking the lactase gene provided evidence that lactase persistence has been subject to very strong positive selective pressure and became prevalent relatively recently, about 7500 years ago, which is roughly coincident with the time that dairy farming arose in northern Europe.
A. Much of the supporting genomic evidence comes from the sizes of haplotype blocks. Are the haplotype blocks surrounding the lactase gene in lactase-persistent individuals bigger or smaller than the average blocks found throughout the genome, or of average size? Are the corresponding haplotype blocks in lactose-intolerant individuals bigger, smaller, or average?
B. Does the C/T-13910 SNP cause the lactase-persistence trait?
C. Name an experimental technique that can determine if an unknown adult is lactose-intolerant or lactase-persistent.
D. Is lactase persistence likely to be a dominant trait or a recessive trait?
CHAPTER 9
Visualizing Cells
Questions
9-1 Your friend has joined a lab that has a light microscope connected to a computer imaging system. A 30-inch monitor is attached to the computer. Your friend claims that because he can now enlarge all images obtained using the light microscope on the large monitor, that he will be able to use the light microscope to resolve objects that are separated by less than 0.1 µm. Is he right?
9-2 Your friend, Sue, has joined a lab on campus that uses green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a tool to localize globular proteins to specific compartments in the cell. Sue creates a fusion protein by fusing GFP to her protein of interest, examines the fusion protein’s localization in the cell, and finds that it is localized to the plasma membrane. However, your friend, Bob, points out that the theoretical limit of resolution for a light microscope is just under 0.2 µm and most globular proteins are in the 10 nm (0.01 µm) size range and that lipid bilayers are about 5 nm (0.005 µm) thick. Given that what Bob says is true, explain why Sue can see her globular protein localized at the plasma membrane.
9-3 Figure Q9-3 shows the path of light through a compound microscope to your eye.
If you were to insert a magnifying lens between the light source and the condenser, would you increase the magnification of the image? Explain.
Figure Q9-3
9-4 Differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy uses the phase differences that occur as light passes through a cell to generate an image that looks somewhat three-dimensional. The micrographs in Figure Q9-4 demonstrate the difference between a bright-field image (on top) and one imaged using DIC (on bottom).
Figure Q9-4
Do the three-dimensional images obtained using DIC represent the actual geometry of the cell? Explain your answer.
9-5 Figure Q9-5 illustrates the optical system of a fluorescence microscope.
Figure Q9-5
Your friend has discovered a new fluorescent protein that has a peak absorption at 513 nm and a peak emission at 535 nm. She has found eight filters and installed them on a microscope down the hall, to create four filter sets on it with the following properties.
Set A. Filter 1: passes wavelengths between 525 and 545 nm;
Filter 2: passes wavelengths between 490 and 520 nm.
Set B. Filter 1: passes all wavelengths above 530 nm;
Filter 2: passes wavelengths between 525 and 545 nm.
Set C. Filter 1: passes wavelengths between 490 and 520 nm;
Filter 2: passes wavelengths between 525 and 545 nm.
Set D. Filter 1: passes all wavelengths above 530 nm;
Filter 2: passes all wavelengths above 500 nm.
Would any of these filter sets be appropriate for your friend’s new fluorescent protein, and if so, which one? Explain your answer.
9-6 A confocal microscope is similar to an epifluorescence microscope, except that a laser is the light source and two pinholes (labeled A and B on Figure Q9-6) are used.
Figure Q9-6
Unfortunately, somebody has stolen the confocal pinhole that lies between the dichroic mirror and the detector. You decide to do go ahead and use the microscope, despite the theft. How will the missing pinhole affect your imaging?
9-7 You are interested in studying the function of two proteins that you believe are important for cell signaling, called SigA and SigB. Both SigA and SigB are found in the nucleus and are 95% identical at the amino acid level. You are excited about the FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching) technique you have learned about in class. Thus, you create a cell line that contains SigA fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) and a separate cell line strain that contains SigB fused to GFP, and use these cell lines to perform FRAP experiments. The results you obtain are diagrammed in Figure Q9-7 (the grey color represents the GFP signal).
Figure Q9-7
From these results, is SigA or SigB more likely to be imported into the nucleus more quickly? Explain.
9-8 The subcellular localization of a specific protein can be determined by electron microscopy if an antibody that recognizes a specific protein is coupled to a gold particle and this antibody is applied to the sample. Explain why the use of a gold particle is preferable to an aluminum particle.
CHAPTER 10
Questions
10-1 You are interested in studying the composition of lipid bilayers and how they are maintained. You discover two uncharacterized phospholipids, which you call PLX and PLZ. You decide to characterize the behavior of PLX and PLZ by labeling the head group of each phospholipid. This label is stable when the lipid resides in the membrane’s outer leaflet but unstable when the lipid resides in the membrane’s inner leaflet. You incorporate labeled versions of PLX and PLZ into either the inside or the outside of the cell, and monitor the change in signal intensity of these lipids in the plasma membrane. Your data are presented in the graphs in Figure Q10-1.
Figure Q10-1
A. Where in the plasma membrane are PLX and PLZ normally located?
B. Are there flippases in the cell for either of these phospholipids? Why?
10-2 You are interested in studying lipid rafts. You have devised a method to create an artificial lipid bilayer that contains small patches of lipids that are straighter and longer than those found in the rest of the bilayer. How would you expect the fluidity of these small patches to compare with the rest of the lipid bilayer? Explain.
10-3 It is thought that excess lipids in the cell are packaged into lipid droplets in the endoplasmic reticulum. Explain why lipid droplets are surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer and not a phospholipid bilayer, like other vesicles that bud from the endoplasmic reticulum.
10-4 Your friend has isolated plasma membranes and reassembled the membranes into small vesicles. Using fluorescently labeled lectin, he sees that some of his vesicles are fluorescently labeled and some are not. Recall that lectin binds to carbohydrates. Furthermore, his labeled lectin cannot permeate membranes.
A. Which population of vesicles has a surface similar to that of the cell? Why?
B. How do you explain the other population of vesicles?
10-5 Your friend is working on a protein that he calls p125, because of its molecular mass. He knows that p125 is a transmembrane protein with three membrane-spanning domains. It has been previously reported that p125 interacts with three proteins called p175, p80, and p50 (again, on the basis of their apparent sizes on an SDS polyacrylamide gel). These four proteins are thought to exist as a protein complex in the cell. To determine how these proteins interact with the membrane, you perform a set of experiments in which you first lyse the cells and save some of your lysate, which you run in the input lane (labeled “I” in Figure Q10-5). The lysate is then subjected to a low-speed centrifugation so that you separate out the membrane fraction (which ends up in the pellet, “P”) from the cytoplasm (which is in the supernatant, “S”). You then wash the pellet from the first extraction with a high-salt wash that does not disrupt the lipid bilayer, and save a little bit to run on the gel. After the high-salt wash, you centrifuge the pellet again. Your results are illustrated on the gel in Figure Q10-5. From these data, explain the nature of the association of these proteins with cellular membranes.
Figure Q10-5
10-6 Examine the two hydropathy plots in Figure Q10-6.
Figure Q10-6
A. Which is a plot of a protein that contains -helices that cross the membrane?
B. For the protein containing a transmembrane domain, how many transmembrane domains would you predict there are? Why?
C. The plots in Figure Q10-6 were created with a “window size” of 19. In creating a hydropathy plot, a value is assigned to an amino acid based on how hydrophobic it is deemed to be. The window size determines the number of amino acids over which a hydrophobicity value is averaged. Once a hydrophobicity value is calculated for a particular window, a hydrophobicity value is then calculated starting at the next amino acid for the next window. Explain why a “window size” of 19 is more useful for calculating a hydrophobicity plot for examining transmembrane proteins as opposed to a smaller “window size” such as 5.
10-7 Is the following sentence true or false? Explain.
Peptide bonds are polar and thus must be covalently modified before proteins can be inserted into the membrane.
10-8 Your friend is examining the mobility of transmembrane proteins using FRAP.
A. Explain what FRAP stands for and how it is performed.
B. Figure Q10-8A and B depicts two typical graphs your friend has obtained from her FRAP studies. Which of these graphs would best represent the following types of proteins? Explain your reasoning.
(1) A transmembrane protein that is tethered to the extracellular matrix.
(2) A transmembrane protein that is highly mobile in the membrane.
C. Your friend has also obtained a third graph from her experiments, shown in Figure Q10-8C. Explain how you might get a reading such as this from a FRAP experiment examining transmembrane proteins.

CHAPTER 11
Membrane Transport of Small Molecules and the Electrical Properties of Membranes
Questions
11-1 Is the following statement true or false? Explain your answer.
O2 is bigger than Mg2+ and thus will diffuse more slowly across a lipid bilayer.
11-2 You have isolated a bacterial transporter that transports Mg2+ and Ca2+ in opposite directions. You produce lipid vesicles that contain this Mg2+–Ca2+ pump as the sole membrane protein. The Mg2+–Ca2+ pumps are oriented such that Mg2+ is pumped into the vesicle while Ca2+ is pumped out. Each pump transports one Mg2+ ion into the vesicle and one Ca2+ ion out of the vesicle during each pumping cycle and ATP hydrolysis powers this transport, as illustrated in Figure Q11-2.
Figure Q11-2
A. Predict what would happen if the solution inside the vesicles contained 75 mM Mg2+ and 75 mM Ca2+ ions, while the solution outside the vesicles contained 75 mM Mg2+ and 75 mM Ca2+ ions as well as 1 mM ATP, and you had a 10,000 fold excess of fluid outside the vesicles compared with the volume inside the vesicles. Specifically, be sure to state whether you think there would be net movement of ions and if so, how the concentrations of the Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions inside and outside the bilayer would change. In addition, be sure to state whether you would be creating an electrical gradient, a chemical gradient, or both.
B. Explain how long the pump will run.
11-3 Your friend works for a biotech company, where they have come up with a top- secret drug they hope will cure a hereditary kidney disease. He refuses to tell you anything about this drug, except to give you a peek at their data (see Figure Q11-3) regarding the kinetics of uptake of this drug into kidney cells. He thinks his data support the idea that a protein is required for the uptake of his drug; his supervisor thinks his data show that this drug simply diffuses into the cell. From what you have learned in cell biology, who is right: your friend or his supervisor? Explain your answer.
Figure Q11-3
11-4 To determine the crystal structure of bacterial lactose permease, a mutation that changed cysteine 154 to glycine was engineered. This mutation locked the protein into a particular conformation, so that the transporter was inward-facing such that its sugar-binding domain faced the cytoplasmic portion of the cell. Explain why using this C154G mutant made it more feasible to determine the structure of lactose permease.
11-5 Your friend works in a lab that is interested in the properties of an amino acid transporter called TspZ. The lab has recently isolated two compounds that bind directly to and act as inhibitors of TspZ; these inhibitors have been named Inh41 and Inh42. Both Inh41 and Inh42 seem to reduce amino acid transport 10-fold when added to cells individually. To characterize how Inh41 works, your friend has discovered that Inh41 does not affect the ability of TspZ to bind amino acid, but instead seems to decrease the rate at which TspZ is able to change its conformation. Another graduate student in the lab has been working on how Inh42 affects TspZ and has determined that Inh42 acts in a manner consistent with its being a competitive inhibitor of TspZ. Given this information, would you predict that adding Inh41 and Inh42 together to cells would have a greater effect, a smaller effect, or no effect on TspZ transport compared with the addition of only one of these inhibitors onto cells? Explain.
11-6 Recall that the Nernst equation is
.
For univalent ions at 20°C, the equation reduces to
.
A. Given the knowledge that if x > 1 then logx is a positive number; if x < 1 then logx is negative, and given the intracellular and extracellular concentrations for the ions listed in Table Q11-6 for the neuron in question, indicate whether the equilibrium potential is positive or negative for the K+ and Na+ ions in this particular cell.
Table Q11-6
B. If you were to add a drug that causes the chloride channels on this neuron to open, would this make it easier, harder, or not affect the cell’s ability to fire an action potential? Explain your answer.
11-7 You are interested in understanding how the neuromuscular junction works.
The normal voltage-gated Na+ channel has the characteristics depicted by the solid line in Figure Q11-7. You decide to replace this channel with a mutant voltage-gated Na+ channel with the characteristics depicted by the dotted line.
Do you predict that the cell containing the mutant Na+ channel will require more, less, or the same amount or acetylcholine to be released from the nerve terminal to stimulate muscle contraction? Explain your answer.
Figure Q11-7
11-8 A neuron can receive inputs from many different presynaptic cells and needs to integrate information about the excitatory postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) and inhibitory PSPs it is receiving. Different types of K+ channels are required to ensure that the frequency of action potentials reflects the magnitude of the combined PSPs. If a normal cell produces a pattern of membrane depolarization following the combined PSPs illustrated in Figure Q11-8, how would a drug that reduces the activity of the delayed K+ channels alter the pattern of membrane depolarization? Explain.
Figure Q11-8
CHAPTER 12
Intracellular Compartments and Protein Sorting
Questions
12-1 You are studying a protein that normally resides in the plasma membrane. The organization of this protein is depicted in Figure Q12-1, where the gray boxes labeled A, B, and C represent transmembrane regions and the segments labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4 represent the portions of the protein between the transmembrane regions.
Figure Q12-1
If you also know that segments 2 and 4 contain N-linked oligosaccharides, draw the topology of the protein as it is inserted in the plasma membrane. Be sure to label the cytoplasmic and extracellular face of your membrane and the N-terminus and C-terminus of your protein.
12-2 If you replace the normal Ran protein in the cell with a Ran protein that has an amino acid change locking Ran in a GDP-bound state, how will this affect nuclear import and export?
12-3 Your friend is interested in targeting green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the ER. He decides to create a modified version of GFP that he calls GFP-ER by adding the ER retention signal (as described in Table 12-3 of the textbook) Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu to the C-terminus of GFP. He sees that GFP-ER is expressed in cells and that GFP-ER is four amino acids longer than the unmodified GFP. However, to his surprise, even though GFP-ER contains an ER retention signal, it is in the cytoplasm of the cell, just like the unmodified GFP. He comes to you for help in fixing this problem. What do you suggest he should do?
12-4 The graduate student from the lab next door comes to you in a panic. She had received three different yeast strains from a lab in Japan, and in the process of transferring these strains to plates she mixed them up. She knows that she received three strains:
(A) one defective in the SAM complex,
(B) one defective in both the TOM complex and the TIM23 complex, and
(C) one defective in the signal peptidase that exists in the mitochondrial matrix.
Fortunately, you have antibodies against Cox4, a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase. Cox4 normally resides in the mitochondrial matrix and is encoded by a nuclear gene. You conduct some experiments in which you fractionate wild-type cells and the three unknown strains, and then, for each strain, subject the cytoplasmic fraction and the mitochondrial fraction to electrophoresis on an SDS gel. Your results are depicted in Figure Q12-4, in which C indicates the cytoplasmic fraction and M the mitochondrial fraction.
Figure Q12-4
From these results, identify which strain contains which mutation, and explain your answers.
12-5 Your friend shows you her data. She has been analyzing a protein to determine which parts of the protein are responsible for its localization. She has created various deletion mutations in her protein and examined its localization, under normal conditions and also in the presence of leptomycin B, an inhibitor of the nuclear export machinery. Her data are depicted in Figure Q12-5.
Figure Q12-5
From her data, answer the following questions:
A. Where do you think the nuclear localization signal (NLS) is located? Explain.
B. Where do you think the nuclear export signal (NES) is located? Explain.
12-6 Your friend sends you two tubes of protein. One tube contains a protein, Crg1, that contains a nuclear export signal. The other tube contains the nuclear export receptor, Xpo1, for Crg1. You are excited to have received these proteins, because you are interested in the biochemistry of nuclear export. You try to get Crg1 to bind Xpo1 but do not succeed. You complain to your lab partner about how your friend sent you bad reagents. However, your lab partner has just taken a cell biology class, and gently reminds you to try one more experiment before you call your friend. What does your labmate suggest?
12-7 The thylakoid space in chloroplasts contains proteins important for photosynthesis. Your friend is interested in understanding how proteins get to the thylakoid space, and is examining the import of the PC protein, a protein that is encoded by the nucleus and normally resides in the thylakoid space of the chloroplast. He has defined a 60 amino acid sequence at the N-terminus of the PC protein that is necessary and sufficient for import into the chloroplast: this 60 amino acid sequence can direct the import of GFP into the chloroplast and the deletion of these 60 amino acids on PC makes the PC protein localize to the cytoplasm. Furthermore, all 60 amino acids seem to be required, because tests using fewer than the 60 amino acids do not show these properties. Excited about these results, your friend takes the intact PC protein and changes residues 55–60 by replacing the each of the original amino acids with the amino acid alanine, and calls this mutation PC-ala. He decides to express PC-ala in cells, expecting it to be cytoplasmic. To his surprise, this protein still goes to the chloroplast, but it does not enter the thylakoid space. From your understanding of transport to the thylakoid space, suggest a hypothesis to explain why your friend’s mutants specifically disrupt this transport.
12-8 State whether the following proteins are being translated on ribosomes attached to the ER, and explain your answer.
A. A protein that resides in the chloroplast.
B. A protein that resides in an endosome.
C. A protein that will be secreted into the extracellular space.
D. A nuclear protein.
E. A protein linked to the plasma membrane by a GPI anchor.
F. A protein that resides between the inner and outer nuclear membranes.
CHAPTER 13
Intracellular Vesicular Traffic
Questions
13-1 You have a protein that has two transmembrane domains. The spacing of the transmembrane domains is shown as gray boxes in Figure Q13-1. The C-terminal domain of this protein is cytoplasmic.
Figure Q13-1
A. Is the N-terminal domain of the protein cytoplasmic or extracellular? Why?
B. Draw the topology of this protein in a transport vesicle as it transits from the Golgi to the plasma membrane.
C. Your friend discovers that this protein is glycosylated. Which portion of this protein is most likely to be glycosylated? Explain.
13-2 Your friend is studying a secreted protein called Inp1. Inp1 is produced as a precursor form called pro-Inp1. The maturation of Inp1 requires that a short N-terminal segment be cleaved. Your friend has raised two sets of antibodies that he calls Pro and C-Inp1. Pro antibodies specifically bind to the peptide removed by cleavage during maturation. C-Inp1 antibodies were raised using the C-terminal half of Inp1 as the antigen. Your friend wanted to use these antibodies to determine where within the secretory pathway propeptide cleavage occurs. He collected three different cellular fractions that contain ER, cis Golgi, and trans Golgi. He was about to assay these fractions with his Pro antibody and his Inp1 antibody when he realized that the labels had come off his cellular fractions in the freezer. He comes to you for sympathy, but you tell him to stop whining, run the fractions, and also probe the fractions with anti-COPII and anti-clathrin antibodies you have in your lab. He comes to you with his results, which are summarized in Table Q13-2.
Table Q13-2
From these results, can you determine in which compartment Inp1 is likely to be processed into the mature form? Explain.
13-3 Two graduate students down the hall, Mary and Jenny, are having an argument. Mary has purified a novel protein she is calling ECM1. Mary hypothesizes that ECM1 is an extracellular matrix protein because it seems to be soluble and is glycosylated. Jenny has tested the protein and found it to be N-glycosylated with a mannose 6-phosphate added to the N-linked oligosaccharide. Jenny claims that her findings should convince Mary that ECM1 is unlikely to be an extracellular matrix protein. Whom do you agree with and why?
13-4 Your friend is studying a protein of 343 amino acids localized to secretory vesicles. She wants to define the regions of the protein responsible for its localization to this particular class of vesicles. She creates a series of deletion constructs in which she deletes different amino acid segments from the protein. She expresses each of her proteins in cells and monitors the proteins’ localizations within the cell, obtaining the data depicted in Figure Q13-4.
Figure Q13-4
A. From these data, where do you predict the localization sequence is for this protein?
B. If your friend made a protein that lacked only those sequences you defined in part A and if she expressed this protein in cells, where would you predict that it would end up? Explain.
13-5 The lab you work in studies a protein called PER that you believe normally resides in the ER and is involved in detecting misfolded proteins in the ER. You have made an antibody that recognizes the PER protein and perform some electron microscopy studies in collaboration with a new postdoc who is highly trained in this technique. The new postdoc comes to you in a panic with his latest results. Not only does he see PER localizing to the ER, he also sees PER in some transport vesicles and some weak Golgi staining. Your adviser overhears this conversation and tells him not to worry and that he should check to see whether those transport vesicles will react with an antibody against COPI that you have in the lab. Explain what you think your adviser was thinking about when she suggested this experiment.
13-6 Your friend has just joined a lab studying a phospholipase that normally resides in the lysosome. You have recently developed an assay to study the activity of cytoplasmic phospholipase C in vitro. Because your friend would like to develop an in vitro assay for his phospholipase, he asks you for the protocol you use for your assay. He is particularly interested in the buffers you use. Why you should advise your friend not to use your protocol?
13-7 Your friend is trying to create an in vitro system for studying the formation of COPII vesicles. He finds that to get efficient vesicle budding from artificial membranes, he needs to add the coat proteins, the Sar1 GTP-binding protein, the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Sar1, and GMP-PNP (a nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP) to synthetic membranes; his experiment will not work in the presence of GTP. Explain why your friend needs to add GMP-PMP instead of GTP.
13-8 Your friend comes to you confused. She has been working on a protein that she thinks is rapidly degraded when cells are given serum. She has been assaying this degradation by using Western blot analysis. Furthermore, she has also seen that her protein is ubiquitylated, because antibodies that recognize ubiquitin will recognize her protein after serum treatment. She expected to isolate her protein from a cytoplasmic fraction because the proteosome is in the cytoplasm, but when she fractionated cells she found that her protein was found in a membrane fraction. In which cellular compartment do you think your friend’s protein is located? Explain.
CHAPTER 14
Energy Conversion: Mitochondria and Chloroplasts
Questions
14-1 You want to study the biochemical properties of the respiratory enzyme complexes required for oxidative phosphorylation. Your initial goal is to measure proton pumping by the NADH dehydrogenase complex. You mix purified NADH dehydrogenase complex with phospholipids and a pH indicator dye that changes color at acidic pH, and you follow a protocol for making liposomes. After verifying that the protein complex was incorporated into liposomes, you add NADH and incubate at 37°C. You are dismayed to observe no color change in the pH indicator dye.
A. One labmate says the result is not surprising, because you forgot to add a key component. What is this key component? Explain why it is important.
B. Another labmate suggests that the failure to observe a pH change occurred because protein complexes are inserted in the lipid bilayer in both possible orientations. Do you agree that this might prevent the establishment of a pH gradient in your experiment?
14-2 Consider a redox reaction between molecules A and B. Molecule A has a redox potential of –100 mV and molecule B has a redox potential of +100 mV. For the transfer of electrons from A to B, is the DG° positive or negative or zero? Under what conditions will the reverse reaction, transfer of electrons from B to A, occur?
14-3 Which of the following reactions have a large enough free-energy change to enable it to be used, in principle, to provide the energy needed to synthesize one molecule of ATP from ADP and Pi under standard conditions? See Table Q14-3. Recall that DG°¢ = –n ´ F ´ DE¢0 (where F is a constant, 0.023, and n is the number of electrons transferred) and that DE¢0 = E¢0 (acceptor) – E¢0 (donor). For the ATP synthesis reaction, DG°¢ is –7.3 kcal/mol, which corresponds to DG°¢/F = 313 mV.
(a) The reduction of a molecule of pyruvate by NADH.
(b) The reduction of a molecule of cytochrome b by NADH.
(c) The reduction of a molecule of cytochrome b by reduced ubiquinone.
(d) The oxidation of a molecule of reduced ubiquinone by cytochrome c.
(e) The oxidation of cytochrome c by oxygen.
Table Q14-3
14-4 Consider what will happen to a cell if an H+ ionophore causes a partial dissipation of the electrochemical gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane, reducing the gradient from 200 mV to 100 mV.
A. Will oxygen consumption increase or decrease? Will proton pumping increase or decrease? Explain.
B. Will the ratio of ATP to ADP increase or decrease? Explain.
C. Will the G for the ATP synthesis reaction increase or decrease or remain the same? Explain.
14-5 Both chloroplasts and mitochondria use electron transport chains to convert the energy from high-energy electrons into a form of potential energy, an electrochemical gradient across an internal membrane. This potential energy is then converted into chemical energy in the form of a high-energy phosphate bond in ATP via a so-called proton-motive force: the highly favorable thermodynamic release of energy as protons flow down the gradient across this internal membrane. In both organelles, ATP synthase harnesses the energy released by the proton flow to form ATP from ADP and Pi.
A. What is the source of high-energy electrons for chloroplasts? What is the source of high-energy electrons for mitochondria?
B. What is the name of the membrane in each organelle in which the electron transport chain and the ATP synthase reside?
C. For each organelle, what is the name of the space into which the protons are pumped to generate the proton-motive force?
D. The proton-motive force in both organelles is about 180 mV. In both organelles, the compartment where ATP is synthesized is maintained at pH 7.5. The pH difference, a measure of the difference in proton concentration between the two sides of the membrane, is 3.0 in chloroplasts and 0.3–0.5 in mitochondria. Why must the pH difference be kept so small in mitochondria? Given the small pH difference, how can the proton-motive force be so high in mitochondria?
14-6 Below is a picture of the Z scheme of noncyclic photophosphorylation (Figure Q14-6). Superimposed on this, in gray shading, is the reaction loop involved in cyclic photophosphorylation.
A. What chemical reactions do the squiggly vertical lines designate?
B. What products of noncyclic photophosphorylation do the so-called dark reactions require? What products of cyclic photophosphorylation do the dark reactions require? Indicate on the figure where these products are made.
C. Why does the chloroplast need cyclic photophosphorylation?
Figure Q14-6
14-7 You discover a mutant yeast strain that cannot grow when provided with pyruvate as its sole carbohydrate, although it grows normally when given glucose as a carbon energy source; you call this the Pyr– trait. Wild-type yeast can grow well using either carbon source; you designate this the Pyr+ trait. You suspect that the mutant yeast have defective mitochondria.
A. Why is mitochondrial function critical for growing on pyruvate?
B. You want to determine whether the mutation responsible for the Pyr– trait is carried in the nuclear or mitochondrial genome. Your experiment is to mate Pyr– haploid cells to Pyr+ haploid cells and examine segregation of the trait in the progeny. After mating, the hybrid diploid cells can grow on pyruvate (Pyr+). You send these diploid cells through meiosis and examine the four haploid cells generated from a single diploid cell. If the mutation is in mitochrondrial DNA, will the four haploid cells probably be all Pyr–, all Pyr+, or a combination? What if the mutation is in nuclear DNA?
C. Consider a hereditary human disease that involves mitochondrial dysfunction. Jane has the disease and she marries Joe, who does not have the disease. They have two sons and two daughters, who all have the disease. Each of the four children grows up, marries a spouse without the disease, and has a son and a daughter. What is the most likely condition (diseased or not) of Jane’s eight grandchildren if the mutation responsible for the disease is in mitochondrial DNA? What if it is in nuclear DNA?
14-8 Consider the following statement. “When a chlorophyll molecule within an antenna complex absorbs a photon of sunlight, one of its electrons jumps up to a high-energy state. This excited electron is then transferred directly to the photochemical reaction center to initiate the electron transport chain.” Identify and explain the two errors in the second sentence of the statement. In your answer, refer to the properties of resonance energy transfer.
CHAPTER 15
Mechanisms of Cell Communication
Questions
15-1 Your friend is trying to understand how the hormone cortisol affects kidney, liver, and bone cells by examining a set of cell lines derived from kidney cells, liver cells, and bone cells. She gets the following result when she examines her cell lines for expression of the cortisol receptor on a Western blot depicted in Figure Q15-1A.
Unfortunately, after she performs this experiment, she mixes up her cell lines and is not sure which line comes from which cells. She labels the cell lines A, B, and C and then examines the activity of a cortisol-responsive reporter gene’s expression in the presence and absence of cortisol and collects the data depicted in Figure Q15-1B.
Figure Q15-1
A. Which cell line do you think is the bone cell line? Explain.
B. Provide a possible explanation for why cell line B and cell line C could show differences in their cortisol response.
15-2 You are interested in the function of a protein, Mtm1, that has a PH domain, an SH3 domain, and a PTB domain. Mtm1 functions downstream of the insulin receptor and binds to this receptor in an insulin-dependent fashion via its PTB domain. You create mutant forms of Mtm1 that delete the various protein domains. You find that these mutations do not seem to affect the protein level or folding of Mtm1. You examine the localization of Mtm1 and your results are summarized in Table Q15-2.
Table Q15-2
In Table Q15-2, the  symbol indicates that the following protein domain is deleted. For example, mtm1PH indicates an Mtm1 protein that lacks the PH domain; mtm1PHSH3 indicates an mtm1 protein that lacks both the PH domain and the SH3 domain.
Given what you know about these three protein domains and the data above, explain the role of the PH, PTB, and SH3 domains in localizing the Mtm1 protein.
15-3 You are studying a cell line that responds to a peptide ligand called Fge1 by activating a MAP kinase pathway. In these cells, activation of the MAP kinase pathway ultimately leads to phosphorylation of a transcription factor, Goh1, and the transcription of several genes, including the Suf1 gene. You treat cells with Fge1 and measure Suf1 mRNA production and are very excited to see that cells seem to respond to Fge1 in a graded fashion such that an increasing concentration of Fge1 seems to increase Suf1 mRNA production, as illustrated in Figure Q15-3.
Figure Q15-3
You also raise an antibody that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated form of Goh1. Using this antibody for immunofluorescence studies, you examine the phosphorylation state of Goh1 in cells that have been treated with varying concentrations of Fge1. You see that cells seem to either stain with the antibody or not, with no difference in the intensity of staining between the cells that stain. Furthermore, the percentage of cells that stain seems to vary with Fge1 concentration, as seen in Table Q15-3.
Table Q15-3
Are your immunofluorescence results more consistent with the possibility that phosphorylated Goh1 increases progressively in individual cells as the concentration of Fge1 increases, or are they more consistent with the possibility that individual cells respond in an all-or-nothing fashion? Propose an explanation for how cells respond to Fge1 that is consistent with both your observations.
15-4 You are interested in cell size regulation and discover that signaling through a GPCR is important in controlling cell size in rat white blood cells. The G protein downstream of this receptor activates adenylyl cyclase, which ultimately leads to the activation of PKA. You find that cells that lack the GPCR are 15% smaller than normal cells, whereas cells that express a mutant, constitutively activated version of PKA are 15% larger than normal cells. Furthermore, the normal blood cells become smaller when treated with cholera toxin, which has been shown to inhibit certain subclasses of the subunit of the G protein. Given these results, explain what you predict would happen to the cell’s size (bigger, smaller, or no change) if cells were treated in the following fashion.
A. You add pertussis toxin.
B. You inhibit the RGS protein that normally works on the subunit of the G protein involved in this pathway.
C. You add a drug that increases the activity of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase.
D. You add a drug that inhibits adenylyl cyclase.
E. You mutate the cAMP-binding sites in the regulatory subunits of PKA, so that the PKA binds more tightly to cAMP.
15-5 Calmodulin, a protein found in all eucaryotic cells, mediates many of the cell changes that occur in response to changes in Ca2+ levels. Calmodulin does not seem to have any enzymatic activity. Explain how calmodulin is nonetheless able to mediate calcium-dependent changes in the cell.
15-6 The olfactory receptor neurons in frogs resemble those of mammals, in that they express olfactory receptors that are coupled to a G protein. When the G protein is activated, it activates an adenylyl cyclase to produce cAMP, which then opens cyclic-AMP gated cation channels in the plasma membrane. The opening of these channels depolarizes the membrane, leading to the production of an action potential. Your friend is interested in why neurons stop responding to an odor after prolonged exposure to it, a process called adaptation. He has conducted experiments examining the depolarization of the olfactory receptor neuron, the binding of odorant to the receptor, the activation of the G protein, the levels of cAMP in the cell, and the phosphorylation of adenylyl cyclase. His results are summarized in Table Q15-6.
Table Q15-6
From these results, what step in the odor transduction pathway is altered to elicit adaptation? Propose a possible molecular mechanism to explain why olfactory neurons no longer respond to an odor after prolonged exposure to it.
15-7 The inappropriate expression of a metabotropic glutamate receptor (called Grm1) in melanocytes causes melanomas. Grm1 is normally expressed in neurons and not in melanocytes, but ectopic expression of Grm1 in mouse melanocytes is sufficient on its own to induce melanoma development. Interestingly, the effects of Grm1 activity in melanoma cells depends on Ras activity. Your friend works in a pharmaceutical company that develops anti-cancer drugs. She offers to collaborate with you to study new cures for melanoma. You discuss the use of a drug that her company has developed that stimulates Ras-GAP activity. Your friend tells you that this drug has been tested as a possible treatment for several cancers but has failed. Recent work indicates that those cancers have a hyperactive mutant form of Ras, which is locked into a GTP-bound active state. This mutant form of Ras is resistant to Ras-GAP GTPase stimulation. Explain why your friend’s drug may be worth testing on patients with Grm1-expressing melanoma cells, even though it has not worked on some other cancer cells.
15-8 Explain how the Notch protein can both bind to the Delta ligand at the cell surface and also interact with the DNA-binding protein Rbpsuh in the nucleus.
CHAPTER 16
The Cytoskeleton
Questions
16-1 Actin-binding proteins can modify the properties of actin. You purify an actin-binding protein called Abp. You examine the effect of Abp on actin polymerization by measuring the kinetics of in vitro actin filament formation, in which pure actin is added in the presence and the absence of purified Abp protein. You obtain the results shown in Figure Q16-1.
Figure Q16-1
Further experiments show that Abp binds to the side of actin filaments and preferentially binds to ADP-containing actin filaments. Propose a possible molecular mechanism consistent with the data above.
16-2 You have discovered a new cytoskeletal polymer that resembles actin in an archaean; you call the subunit for this polymer AALP (for archaea actin-like protein). AALP binds to ATP and can catalyze the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP. As with actin, this hydrolysis occurs more quickly when AALP is in a filament and most of the free AALP is bound to ATP. You measure the rate of AALP filament growth in vitro at the plus (more quickly growing) end and at the minus (more slowly growing) end and obtain the graph diagrammed in Figure Q16-2.
Figure Q16-2
A. What is the critical concentration for the plus end?
B. What is the critical concentration for the minus end?
C. Under what conditions would you expect to see treadmilling occur?
16-3 Your friend has been examining the assembly of -tubulin dimers into microtubules. She has been performing in vitro polymerization experiments in the presence of a single centrosome and finds that she can grow microtubules readily, even at concentrations of less than 5 µM -tubulin dimers. She has repeated this experiment several times, varying the concentrations of -tubulin dimers and finds that at 25 µM -tubulin dimers, she can create about 50 microtubules per centrosome. However, when she doubles the concentration of -tubulin dimers, she does not seem to be able to create many more than 50 microtubules per centrosome.
A. Given that the critical concentration for microtubules is 15 µM, explain why she can grow microtubules at 5 µM.
B. Can you explain why she seems to have reached a limit as to how many microtubules she can polymerize?
16-4 Your friend works in a lab that examines microtubules. He decides to grow some microtubules using GMPCPP-bound -tubulin dimers. GMPCPP is analog of GTP that cannot be hydrolyzed to GDP.
A. Will he observe dynamic instability in his GMPCPP-bound microtubules? Explain.
B. Next, he decides to add GTP-bound -tubulin dimers to his preformed GMPCPP-bound microtubules. To these new microtubules he adds a fluorescently labeled microtubule-binding protein, MBP, and he sees three different patterns of protein binding.
(1) Microtubules that are labeled along the center only.
(2) Microtubules that are labeled along the center and at the very tip.
(3) Microtubules that are labeled all along their length.
The percentages of microtubules falling into each category are diagrammed in Figure Q16-4.
Figure Q16-4
Where, on a normal microtubule, would you expect MBP to bind? Explain.
16-5 You have purified a protein, MT1, that binds only to GTP-bound tubulin. You proceed to fuse MT1 to GFP and find that the fusion of GFP to MT1 does not disrupt MT1 function in any way (good news!). You use a different dye to label the microtubules in red so that you can visualize MT1-GFP and the microtubules at the same time. (Note that the red dye does not affect the microtubule’s properties.)
A. If you were to polymerize some red-labeled microtubules in a dish, would you expect MT1-GFP to be associated with one or both ends of a microtubule, with the middle of the microtubule, or be evenly distributed throughout the microtubule? Explain.
B. You examine the red microtubules and MT1-GFP in a cell in interphase. Do you think that you will see MT1-GFP associating with all microtubules? Explain.
C. If you were to take time-lapse images in which you visualize only MT1-GFP (and not microtubules), what would you expect to see? Describe what you think would happen to MT1-GFP over time with respect to its localization inside of this cell.
16-6 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is associated with abnormal assembly of neurofilaments, and overexpression of either NF-L or NF-H (two neurofilament proteins) in transgenic mice can lead to an ALS-like disease. The simultaneous overexpression of NF-L, however, reverses the pathologies caused by overexpression of NF-H, and vice versa. Given what you know about neurofilaments, explain this finding.
16-7 The movement of molecular motors depends on the conformational changes that the proteins undergo as they proceed through the cycle of nucleotide binding, hydrolysis, and release.
A. Muscle contraction uses large amounts of ATP. What are the two main uses of ATP during muscle contraction?
B. If you were to add a nonhydrolyzable form of ATP to myosin, at what point would you block its movement? How is this similar to or different from adding a nonhydrolyzable form of ATP to kinesin?
16-8 Constitutive activation of the GTPase Cdc42 leads to a different set of actin rearrangements from those brought about by constitutive activation of the GTPase Rho. It is now known that WASp proteins are targets of Cdc42, whereas formins are targets of Rho1. Both WASp and formins promote actin polymerization. Explain why the activation of these two different types of actin polymerization-enhancing molecules could lead to differences in the actin cytoskeleton.
CHAPTER 17
The Cell Cycle
Questions
17-1 You want to study the cell cycle in fish embryo cells, in which the cell cycle length is about 30 min. You examine the amount of M-cyclin in these cells and see that it varies over the cell cycle. Your friend works in a pharmaceutical company where they are making drugs that block the cell cycle. She gives you some of their secret drug, called MI575, and you add it to cells, examine M-cyclin, and get the results shown in Figure Q17-1.
Figure Q17-1
A. From these data, would you predict that cells treated with MI575 are arrested in the cell cycle at various stages (G1, S, G2, or M), or do you predict that cells will be blocked at a particular stage? If you think cells will be blocked at a particular stage, describe the stage at which you think the cells would be blocked.
B. From the data, propose a simple molecular explanation for how MI575 acts to block the cell cycle.
17-2 You have isolated a strain of mutant fission yeast that divides normally at 30°C but arrests in the cell cycle before M phase at 37°C. These mutant yeast cells are not defective in the production of M–Cdk, because you have isolated the mitotic cyclin and mitotic Cdk from these mutant yeast and find that both proteins are normal and can form an M–Cdk complex at both temperatures. Which of the following types of mutations could be responsible for the behavior of this strain of yeast? Explain.
A. Inactivation of an enzyme that ubiquitylates M–cyclin.
B. Inactivation of the Wee1 kinase.
C. Inactivation of the CAK kinase.
D. The continuous production of a phosphatase that removes all phosphate groups from the M–Cdk.
17-3 Your friend works in a lab that studies origin licensing. He is particularly interested in the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) and has isolated a temperature-sensitive yeast mutant that does not seem to assemble the pre-RC at the origins of replication. However, he has gotten into an argument with a new student in the lab. The student thinks that this yeast mutant will arrest in late mitosis or early G1, because that is when the pre-RC is normally assembled. Your friend disagrees. Who is right, and why?
17-4 You have identified a drug, ID555, that causes M–Cdk protein levels to remain high in the cell. You have two favorite models for how ID555 works.
Model 1: ID555 activates a transcription factor that stimulates the genes encoding M–cyclin and M–Cdk, so that excess M–Cdk protein is produced.
Model 2: ID555 inhibits the activity of the Cdc20–APC/C complex that normally targets M–Cdk for destruction.
Your friend works in a lab with many fancy microscopes and offers to examine cells that are treated with drug. She sees that cells treated with ID555 assemble a mitotic spindle and their chromosomes seem to align at the metaphase plate. However, the chromosome segregation seen during normal anaphase does not occur. Does this new information cause you to favor model 1 or model 2? Explain.
17-5 Your friend comes to you in a panic. He was purifying extracts from interphase cells as well as mitotic cells. Unfortunately, the labels came off his tubes and he cannot tell which extract is from which cells. You do an experiment in which you add a small amount of each extract to fluorescent microtubules you have polymerized in vitro, and then use video microscopy to follow the behavior of individual microtubules in the reaction over time. Your results are shown in the graphs in Figure Q17-5.
Figure Q17-5
Which extract do you think is from mitotic cells and which from interphase cells? Why?
17-6 You have just read a paper that the addition of caffeine to cells disrupts the DNA damage checkpoint and you would like to understand why. By searching for proteins that bind to caffeine, you isolate a protein, Caf1. You believe that Caf1 is involved in the DNA damage checkpoint because when you delete Caf1 from yeast cells and add a drug that causes DNA damage, the cells fail to arrest in the cell cycle.
You give your Caf1-deleted cells to an undergraduate in the laboratory and ask him to take care of the strain for you while you take the weekend off to celebrate your finding. Upon your return, you find the poor undergraduate in tears. He explains that he thinks that he messed up the Caf1 mutant strain while you were gone because after growing Caf1 and wild-type cells in rich media and examining them during mitosis, Caf1 mutants looked the same the same as wild-type cells. Are you concerned about the undergraduate student’s findings? Why?
17-7 Chromosomes are attached to microtubules via the kinetochore. Given the organization of the mitotic spindle, chromosomes should be attached to the plus ends of the kinetochore microtubules. Your friend is interested in studying the protein collar in the kinetochore that is thought to bind to the growing end of a microtubule. He conducts the following experiment. First, he creates stable microtubules in the presence of GMPCPP, a non-hydrolyzable analogue of GTP. Next, he adds GTP-tubulin to the GMPCPP microtubules. Finally, he adds the kinetochore protein collar to the microtubules to see where they bind. He finds a large proportion of the protein collars binding to the middle of microtubules and very few binding to the ends of the microtubules. Is this finding inconsistent with this protein being part of the kinetochore? Explain.
17-8 Multicellular animals have some mechanism to control cell mass that we do not understand; for example, salamanders of different ploidies are the same size such that a haploid, a diploid, and a pentaploid organism are about the same size. However, a yeast cell differs in size according to ploidy, such that a diploid yeast cell is about half the size of a tetraploid yeast cell. Given these observations, explain why yeast and salamanders are not so different.
CHAPTER 18
Apoptosis
Questions
18-1 You are working in a laboratory investigating the effects of new chemicals called X and Y that kill cells. To test whether X and Y cause necrosis or apoptosis, you briefly treat cultured cells with each chemical and perform several assays.
A. First, you examine the chromosomal DNA. You isolate DNA from cells, label 5¢ ends with radioactive ATP by using polynucleotide kinase, run the DNA on a gel, and detect radiolabeled fragments. Your results are shown in Figure Q18-1A. The lane from the untreated control cells is labeled U. Does X cause apoptosis? What about Y? Explain the origin of the ladder in the Y lane.
B. Second, you examine the subcellular localization of cytochrome c using immunofluorescence microscopy. Unfortunately, during sample preparation you mixed up the samples. Assign a likely identity (U, X, or Y) to the samples labeled 1, 2, and 3 in Figure Q18-1B.
C. Third, without making the cells permeable in any way, you stain them with Annexin V linked to a green fluorophore, which binds phosphatidylserine, and propidium iodide, which fluoresces red when it binds DNA. Neither of these compounds can travel across intact plasma membranes. Again during sample preparation you mixed up the samples. Assign a likely identity to the samples in Figure Q18-1C. Annexin V staining is shown as \\ hatching, propidium iodide staining is shown as // hatching, and staining with both in the same region appears as crosshatching.
Figure Q18-1
18-2 You want to find out why apoptosis fails to occur in several cell lines derived from tumors. To identify differences between the tumor cell lines (T1, T2, and T3) and a control cell line (C) that might prevent tumor cells from undergoing normal apoptosis, you isolate proteins from cells that have (+) or have not (–) been treated to induce apoptosis. You load the protein samples on gels and perform immunoblotting with antibodies against proteins involved in apoptosis. Confusingly, several proteins have altered levels or altered apparent sizes in the tumor cell lines, as shown in Figure Q18-2. Suggest a hypothesis for each tumor cell line to explain its apoptosis defect and the immunoblots.
Figure Q18-2
18-3 In patients with autoimmune diseases, the adaptive immune system recognizes some normal cells or proteins as though they were foreign. Defects in the regulated apoptosis and clearance of cells are thought to cause or exacerbate some autoimmune diseases.
A. Explain briefly which cells normally undergo apoptosis and can cause autoimmune disease if they survive inappropriately.
B. Explain briefly why a defect in clearance or engulfment of apoptotic bodies might lead to autoimmune disease.
18-4 Cancer cells often exhibit abnormal regulation of the apoptotic program. Mutations that prevent the normal regulation of apoptosis not only contribute to carcinogenesis but also affect the response to anticancer therapies.
A. Describe briefly why a defect in apoptosis is an important step in the transformation of a normal cell into a cancer cell.
B. Describe briefly how a defect in apoptosis will affect the response to anticancer therapies.
C. Identify a protein whose overexpression in a cancer cell might inhibit apoptosis.
D. Identify a protein whose elimination or underexpression in a cancer cell might inhibit apoptosis.
18-5 Effector procaspases acquire high proteolytic activity only after they have been cleaved by active initiator caspases. In contrast, purified initiator procaspases can cleave themselves, and this autocatalytic cleavage stimulates their activity only modestly. Biochemical reconstitution experiments demonstrated that high activity of the initiator caspase-8 and caspase-9 required their incorporation into the DISC or apoptosome, respectively. Each of these procaspases has an adaptor domain (which enables it to assemble with other proteins), a prodomain, a low-affinity dimerization domain, and a catalytic domain. The catalytic domains of these caspases are identical at only 34% of the amino acids. Two competing models for the activation of caspase-9 have been proposed. In the allosteric model, Apaf-1 proteins in the apoptosome specifically interact with the catalytic domains of caspase-9 proteins, thereby triggering a transition to a catalytically active conformation. In the dimerization model, Apaf-1 proteins simply increase the local concentration of caspase-9 by binding several adaptor domains simultaneously, thereby promoting dimerization and coincident activation of caspase-9. To distinguish between these models, you make a hybrid protein containing part of caspase-9 and part of caspase-8, as shown in Figure Q18-5. You test whether this hybrid protein can be activated by Fas ligand or cytochrome c. What do you expect if the allosteric model is correct? What do you expect if the dimerization model is correct?
Figure Q18-5
18-6 Several mutational changes to proteins involved in apoptosis are listed below. For each, indicate whether you expect it to have a dominant-negative phenotype. In other words, do you expect it to cause a defect in apoptosis even in cells that also contain the normal protein?
A. Deletion of death domain of Fas death receptor.
B. Mutational change to Fas ligand that prevents its oligomerization.
C. Deletion of the death effector domain of FADD.
D. Deletion of the death effector domain of procaspase-8.
E. Deletion of the CARD domain of Apaf-1.
F. Mutation of the catalytic cysteine of caspase-8 to serine.
G. Mutational change to Bax that prevents its oligomerization with itself and with Bak.
H. Mutational change to IAP that increases its affinity for caspases.
18-7 A genetic pathway map of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis is shown in Figure Q18-7, with empty boxes instead of protein names. Fill in the boxes with the following proteins: caspase-9, Bcl-2, anti-IAP protein, Apaf-1, cytochrome c, executioner caspase, BH3-only protein, IAP protein, BH123 protein. A ® symbol indicates activation; –| indicates inhibition.
Figure Q18-7
18-8 You are investigating how the number of nerve cells is regulated in a specific tissue of your favorite experimental organism. You isolate a mutant that contains almost none of these nerve cells in the adult animal, and you hypothesize that in this mutant the nerve cells are either not made or do not connect to their target cells and therefore fail to get the survival signals they need. You are surprised by the results of a developmental time course that you perform. You find that in the mutant more of the nerve cells are made than in controls, and they all connect correctly to their target cells. But then, at later times, nearly all of the nerve cells undergo apoptosis. What could be the explanation?
CHAPTER 19
Cell Junctions, Cell Adhesion, and the Extracellular Matrix
Molecular Biology of the Cell, Fifth Edition
Questions
19-1 Your two friends are having an argument. Henry, who works in a lab studying signal transduction, claims that ligand–receptor interactions are higher affinity interactions than those between two cadherin molecules. In contrast, Oliver, who works in a lab studying the cell junctions, claims that the interactions between two cadherin molecules must be stronger, because epithelial tissues can be extremely difficult to pull apart and anchoring junctions are joined by forces that are much stronger than the usually transient interactions of a ligand and a receptor. Who is correct and why?
19-2 Sam, the undergraduate working with you in your lab, has just asked for help. You and Sam are investigating the role of the -catenin protein at adherens junctions. Your adviser has asked you to clone the -catenin gene by PCR. When Sam took the PCR clone you produced and sequenced it, he found a mutation that would change a conserved arginine to a methionine. When Sam ran the -catenin protein through some web-based protein domain-finding algorithms, he found that this arginine was a conserved residue in a predicted nuclear-localization signal (NLS) and thus figured it did not matter that much because the -catenin at adherens junctions must be a cytoplasmic protein. To Sam’s dismay, your adviser was horrified at this news. Explain why a protein localized at an adherens junction might need an NLS.
19-3 You have purified a large complex of proteins that are at the presynaptic membranes of some neurons that you believe contribute to cold tolerance in Drosophila. You have purified six different proteins from this complex that you name Cld1 to Cld6. You discover that Cld6 is a transmembrane protein that seems to interact physically with Cld4 and none of the other Cld proteins. You create mutations in each of the genes that encode these proteins and examine the localization of the other “cold” proteins in each mutant background and get the results shown in Table Q19-3.
Table Q19-3
Which of the six Cld proteins is the best candidate for a scaffolding molecule? Explain.
19-4 You are interested in epithelial tissue formation and work in a lab studying Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. MDCK cells spontaneously form hollow epithelial vesicles. Staining these vesicles with an anti-actin antibody demonstrates the existence of apical microvilli near the central cavity of the vesicle. A new postdoctoral fellow in the lab comes to you in a panic. You had given her some dissociated MDCK cells that have been cultured as single cells in a collagen matrix. Because the cells did not look obviously polarized to her, she stained the dissociated MDCK cells to visualize the microvilli and she does not see any signs of polarized microvilli localization in these cells. Explain why you are confident that you did not give her the wrong cell line, and suggest a better experiment that will allow her to test whether the cells you gave her are MDCK cells.
19-5 You are interested in integrin activation and perform mutagenesis studies on integrin. You find a mutant form of integrin which you call int-act, because the int-act mutation causes the extracellular domain to exist always in an unfolded state regardless of the presence or absence of ligand. When you determine the sequence of int-act, you find that the mutation is in the intracellular domain of integrin. Explain how this intracellular mutation could affect the conformation of the extracellular domain of integrin.
19-6 Your friend, who is an engineering major, is interested in the mechanical properties of extracellular matrix and wants to study how secreted collagen molecules assemble into a collagen fiber. As part of his studies, he has been trying to speed up the rate at which cells can produce the collagen protein and is considering reducing the size of the propeptide that is attached to the collagen chain such that it contains only the ER targeting sequence as well as the site for cleavage of the propeptide. To his surprise, this modification causes collagen to be degraded inside the cell. Can you explain why?
19-7 You are interested in studying the extracellular matrix and its interaction with cell signaling and have isolated a new signaling molecule important for whisker cell proliferation in mice that you call WGF. You decide to test whether the heparan sulfate chains of proteoglycans are required for WGF signaling by creating several lines of transgenic mice. You create one line of mice that does not produce any WGF and one line of mice that cannot add any heparan sulfate chains onto proteoglycans. You find that wgf– mice and Heparan sulfate– mice both lack whiskers, whereas wild-type mice have whiskers.
A. Explain whether this is consistent with a role for proteoglycans in WGF signaling.
You decide to carry out further experiments by creating transgenic mice that overexpress WGF. Using mouse genetics, you create mice that overexpress WGF but lack heparan sulfate. You see that some normal-looking whiskers are produced in these animals.
B. Given this new result and the data above, do you think that the fact that these WGF-overexpressing mice can produce normal-looking whiskers is consistent with a role for proteoglycans in WGF signaling? Explain.
19-8 You are working in a lab studying cell wall deposition in plants. You are about to start a set of experiments examining the interactions of microtubules with cellulose synthase, when your friend shows you a set of relatively recent papers that show how the treatment of plant cells with either the microtubule-destabilizing drug oryzalin or the microtubule-stabilizing drug Taxol does not alter the orientation of the cellulose microfibrils deposited during the time of drug treatment. Are these results consistent with the current model of how microtubules are involved in cellulose deposition? Why?
ls.
CHAPTER 20
Cancer
Questions
20-1 Identify the two errors in this statement: “Cells from a benign lung tumor that has metastasized to the liver no longer make any lung-specific proteins.”
20-2 Carcinogenesis requires that a single cell or one of its descendents undergo a series of rare genetic and epigenetic changes that permanently alter the expression of at least five to eight genes. Thus, it is not surprising that many cancer cells assayed in cell culture dishes were found to have a very high rate of mutagenesis.
A. What are three systems that are often defective in cancer cells whose role is to ensure the integrity of the genome?
B. The increased mutation rate speeds cancer progression by increasing the likelihood that a cell will acquire additional properties that contribute to carcinogenesis. Name four of the eight typical properties of cancer cells.
C. UV and ionizing radiation are known to cause cancer because they are mutagens that damage DNA. How, then, are the many anticancer therapies that act by damaging DNA, including ionizing radiation and many drugs, so effective at shrinking tumors?
D. Are these therapies more or less effective on cancer stem cells than cancer transit amplifying cells? Explain.
20-3 You are an epidemiologist trying to understand why the incidence of breast cancer is unusually high in Marin County, California, a community in which large proportions of residents (both women and men) have advanced educational degrees and high-paying jobs.
A. List five critical questions that you must include on a questionnaire given to residents of Marin County and, as a control, to residents of other counties in the USA.
B. Would you expect an elevated incidence of breast cancer to correlate more closely with socioeconomic status or with exposure to industrial chemicals?
20-4 Figure Q20-4 shows a signaling pathway that is turned on inappropriately in many human cancers. The key proteins and their positive or negative influences on each other are shown.
A. Both PTEN and Akt are cancer-critical genes. Which is a tumor suppressor? Which is a proto-oncogene?
B. The pathway contains additional cancer-critical genes. Name a potential proto-oncogene and a potential tumor suppressor in this pathway.
C. Is it likely that more than one of these pathway components will be mutated in a single tumor? Explain.
D. If many tumors were found to contain two mutations in this pathway, what hypothesis would it suggest?
Figure Q20-4
20-5 Loss of a tumor suppressor gene usually promotes cancer only if both copies are defective.
A. If a person inherits two functional copies of the gene, will the frequency of mutation of the second copy be higher or lower than the frequency of mutation of the first copy? Explain by describing the mechanisms by which the gene can be mutated.
B. You determine by immunoblotting that a tumor lacks a specific tumor suppressor protein. Then you sequence the regulatory and coding regions of the corresponding tumor suppressor gene and find that one copy has a premature stop codon near the beginning of the gene and the other copy contains no mutations. What is the most likely mechanism that prevents the production or accumulation of protein from the unmutated copy?
20-6 The p53 gene may be the most important gene preventing human cancer. This gene is mutated in about half of all cancers (and the pathway in which it participates is mutated in essentially all cancers).
A. We can envisage two mechanisms to increase the amount of p53 protein when it is suddenly needed. First, transcription and translation of the p53 gene might be low in the absence of a stimulus and markedly increased after stimulation. Second, transcription and translation of the p53 gene might be high at all times, but the protein amount is normally low as a result of proteolytic degradation; after stimulation, degradation is inhibited and consequently the protein amount increases. The latter mechanism is actually used by cells. Suggest the most important advantage of this mechanism.
B. List two of the four major classes of stimuli that evoke increased p53 amounts in normal human cells.
C. A defect in p53 increases the likelihood of amplification of proto-oncogenes and loss of tumor suppressor genes. Describe the two ways in which p53 normally works to prevent these outcomes. Describe the sequence of steps that can lead to these outcomes in the absence of p53.
20-7 Common side effects of anticancer chemotherapy include nausea, diarrhea, hair loss, dry skin, anemia, reduced immune system function, and increased frequency of bruising and bleeding.
A. Although many of the best chemotherapy drugs successfully kill most tumor cells, they often cause side effects by killing normal epithelial cells and fail to kill cancer stem cells. How does the mode of action of these drugs cause these two problems?
B. Describe a strategy for developing drugs with fewer side effects.
20-8 You work for a pharmaceutical company that is developing new anticancer drugs. In clinical trials with a new potential treatment for stomach cancer, you find that your drug is effective at eliminating all signs of the cancer in 20% of the patients tested but is completely ineffectual in the remaining 80%. Will you abandon development of the drug on the basis of these results? What data will you collect to inform your decision?

Bruce Michael Alberts (born April 14, 1938 in Chicago, Illinois) is an American biochemist and the Chancellor’s Leadership Chair in Biochemistry and Biophysics for Science and Education at the University of California, San Francisco.[3] He has done important work studying the protein complexes which enable chromosome replication when living cells divide. He is known as an original author of the "canonical, influential, and best-selling scientific textbook" Molecular Biology of the Cell,[4] and as Editor-in-Chief of Science magazine.[5][6]
Alberts was the president of the National Academy of Sciences from 1993 to 2005.[4] He is known for his work in forming science public policy, and has served as United States Science Envoy to Pakistan and Indonesia.[2][7] He has stated that "Science education should be about learning to think and solve problems like a scientist—insisting, for all citizens, that statements be evaluated using evidence and logic the way scientists evaluate statements."[8]

Education[edit]
After graduating from New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois,[9] Alberts attended Harvard College, as a pre-medicine major.[4][10] Bored by assigned laboratory "cooking classes", he petitioned to skip the physical chemistry laboratory requirement and instead was allowed to work with his tutor Jacques Fresco, in Paul M. Doty's laboratory. The summer's research led to the publication of two successful papers on mismatch errors in the helical structures of DNA and RNA,[11][12] and Alberts decided to continue on in biophysics.[4] He graduated with his A.B. in biochemical sciences, summa cum laude, in 1960.[4]
Alberts then worked with Paul M. Doty on an "enormously ambitious" thesis on DNA replication, attempting to solve the genetic code using nearest neighbor analysis of DNA polymerase.[9][10] After failing his first oral examination in spring 1965, he completed his Ph.D. research in fall 1965.[2][9][13] His doctorate in biophysics was published by Harvard University in 1966.[1] Alberts credits his initial failure with teaching him much more than his successes.[9] "That was a very important learning experience for me. I had decided that experimental strategy was everything in science, and nobody had ever told me anything about this."[2]
Career[edit]
After graduating, Alberts went to the Institut de Biologie Moleculaire[14] at the University of Geneva as a postdoctoral fellow, and worked with Richard H. Epstein on genes involved in DNA replication of phage T4. Epstein and his students had shown that there were at least seven different proteins needed for replication of T4 DNA. Alberts decided to do something that no one else was doing, and developed a DNA column for the purification of proteins that bound to DNA.[2] This enabled him to purify T4 Bacteriophage Gene 32.[15]
In 1966, Alberts joined the Department of Biochemical Sciences at Princeton University as an Assistant Professor. In 1971, he became an Associate Professor and in 1973 a full Professor, holding the Damon Pfeiffer Professorship in life sciences from 1975-1976.[14][16][17] At Princeton, he continued to work in the area of protein biochemistry, reconstituting systems.[2]
In 1976, Alberts accepted a position as professor and vice-chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco.[16] Also in 1976, he and his students were able to add all seven proteins to double-stranded DNA in an appropriate magnesium concentration to make DNA. More years of research were spent understanding the reactions involved. Another important step in understanding DNA synthesis was realizing that leading strand DNA polymerase and lagging strand DNA polymerase were coupled.[2][18]
Alberts was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1978.[16][19] From 1981 to 1985 Alberts held the American Cancer Society Research Professorship, a title granted for life as of 1980.[14] From 1985 to 1990, he was Chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco. From 1990-1993 he again held the American Cancer Society Research Professorship.[16]
Science and education[edit]
Alberts served as the President of the National Academy of Sciences for two terms from 1993 until 2005.[14][20]
Alberts has long been committed to the improvement of science education, dedicating much of his time to educational projects such as City Science, a program seeking to improve science teaching in San Francisco elementary schools.[4] He has served on the advisory board of the National Science Resources Center, a joint project of the National Academy of Sciences and the Smithsonian Institution working with teachers, scientists, and school systems to improve teaching of science as well as on the National Academy of Sciences' National Committee on Science Education Standards and Assessment. He has published important National Academies reports: the National Science Education Standards (NSES; NRC, 1996), intended to change the way that science is taught K-12, and Inquiry and the National Science Education Standards (NRC, 2000)[20]
The Bruce Alberts Award for Excellence in Science Education is given in his name to those who have made outstanding contributions in science education.[21]
He has served in different capacities on a number of advisory and editorial boards, including as chair of the Commission on Life Sciences, National Research Council.[4] Prior to his election as President of the National Academy of Sciences in 1995 he was president-elect of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.[18] From 2007-2008 he served as president of the American Society for Cell Biology.[22]
He served as a trustee of the Carnegie Corporation of New York from 2000 to 2009.[23][24] He and others have critiqued the biomedical research system, pointing out what they consider "systemic flaws"[25] and have created the Rescuing Biomedical Research organization, to "collect and organize input for solutions"[26] to the problems identified by themselves[25] and others.[27]
Alberts was Editor-in-Chief of the American Association for the Advancement of Science's flagship publication, Science for five years from 2008-2013.[28] He is one of the founding editors of the journal Cell Biology Education.[20]
International work[edit]
From 2000-2009, Alberts was the Co-chair of the InterAcademy Council, an advisory institution in Amsterdam governed by the presidents of fifteen science academies from around the world, and a member of the Science Initiative Group board.[29]
In his June 4, 2009 speech at Cairo University, US President Barack Obama announced a new Science Envoy program as part of a "new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world." In January 2010, Bruce Alberts, Ahmed Zewail, and Elias Zerhouni became the first US science envoys to Islam, visiting Muslim-majority countries from North Africa to Southeast Asia.[30]

Bruce Michael Alberts (born April 14, 1938 in Chicago, Illinois) is an American biochemist and the Chancellor’s Leadership Chair in Biochemistry and Biophysics for Science and Education at the University of California, San Francisco.[3] He has done important work studying the protein complexes which enable chromosome replication when living cells divide. He is known as an original author of the "canonical, influential, and best-selling scientific textbook" Molecular Biology of the Cell,[4] and as Editor-in-Chief of Science magazine.[5][6]
Alberts was the president of the National Academy of Sciences from 1993 to 2005.[4] He is known for his work in forming science public policy, and has served as United States Science Envoy to Pakistan and Indonesia.[2][7] He has stated that "Science education should be about learning to think and solve problems like a scientist—insisting, for all citizens, that statements be evaluated using evidence and logic the way scientists evaluate statements."[8]

Education[edit]
After graduating from New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois,[9] Alberts attended Harvard College, as a pre-medicine major.[4][10] Bored by assigned laboratory "cooking classes", he petitioned to skip the physical chemistry laboratory requirement and instead was allowed to work with his tutor Jacques Fresco, in Paul M. Doty's laboratory. The summer's research led to the publication of two successful papers on mismatch errors in the helical structures of DNA and RNA,[11][12] and Alberts decided to continue on in biophysics.[4] He graduated with his A.B. in biochemical sciences, summa cum laude, in 1960.[4]
Alberts then worked with Paul M. Doty on an "enormously ambitious" thesis on DNA replication, attempting to solve the genetic code using nearest neighbor analysis of DNA polymerase.[9][10] After failing his first oral examination in spring 1965, he completed his Ph.D. research in fall 1965.[2][9][13] His doctorate in biophysics was published by Harvard University in 1966.[1] Alberts credits his initial failure with teaching him much more than his successes.[9] "That was a very important learning experience for me. I had decided that experimental strategy was everything in science, and nobody had ever told me anything about this."[2]
Career[edit]
After graduating, Alberts went to the Institut de Biologie Moleculaire[14] at the University of Geneva as a postdoctoral fellow, and worked with Richard H. Epstein on genes involved in DNA replication of phage T4. Epstein and his students had shown that there were at least seven different proteins needed for replication of T4 DNA. Alberts decided to do something that no one else was doing, and developed a DNA column for the purification of proteins that bound to DNA.[2] This enabled him to purify T4 Bacteriophage Gene 32.[15]
In 1966, Alberts joined the Department of Biochemical Sciences at Princeton University as an Assistant Professor. In 1971, he became an Associate Professor and in 1973 a full Professor, holding the Damon Pfeiffer Professorship in life sciences from 1975-1976.[14][16][17] At Princeton, he continued to work in the area of protein biochemistry, reconstituting systems.[2]
In 1976, Alberts accepted a position as professor and vice-chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco.[16] Also in 1976, he and his students were able to add all seven proteins to double-stranded DNA in an appropriate magnesium concentration to make DNA. More years of research were spent understanding the reactions involved. Another important step in understanding DNA synthesis was realizing that leading strand DNA polymerase and lagging strand DNA polymerase were coupled.[2][18]
Alberts was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1978.[16][19] From 1981 to 1985 Alberts held the American Cancer Society Research Professorship, a title granted for life as of 1980.[14] From 1985 to 1990, he was Chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco. From 1990-1993 he again held the American Cancer Society Research Professorship.[16]
Science and education[edit]
Alberts served as the President of the National Academy of Sciences for two terms from 1993 until 2005.[14][20]
Alberts has long been committed to the improvement of science education, dedicating much of his time to educational projects such as City Science, a program seeking to improve science teaching in San Francisco elementary schools.[4] He has served on the advisory board of the National Science Resources Center, a joint project of the National Academy of Sciences and the Smithsonian Institution working with teachers, scientists, and school systems to improve teaching of science as well as on the National Academy of Sciences' National Committee on Science Education Standards and Assessment. He has published important National Academies reports: the National Science Education Standards (NSES; NRC, 1996), intended to change the way that science is taught K-12, and Inquiry and the National Science Education Standards (NRC, 2000)[20]
The Bruce Alberts Award for Excellence in Science Education is given in his name to those who have made outstanding contributions in science education.[21]
He has served in different capacities on a number of advisory and editorial boards, including as chair of the Commission on Life Sciences, National Research Council.[4] Prior to his election as President of the National Academy of Sciences in 1995 he was president-elect of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.[18] From 2007-2008 he served as president of the American Society for Cell Biology.[22]
He served as a trustee of the Carnegie Corporation of New York from 2000 to 2009.[23][24] He and others have critiqued the biomedical research system, pointing out what they consider "systemic flaws"[25] and have created the Rescuing Biomedical Research organization, to "collect and organize input for solutions"[26] to the problems identified by themselves[25] and others.[27]
Alberts was Editor-in-Chief of the American Association for the Advancement of Science's flagship publication, Science for five years from 2008-2013.[28] He is one of the founding editors of the journal Cell Biology Education.[20]
International work[edit]
From 2000-2009, Alberts was the Co-chair of the InterAcademy Council, an advisory institution in Amsterdam governed by the presidents of fifteen science academies from around the world, and a member of the Science Initiative Group board.[29]
In his June 4, 2009 speech at Cairo University, US President Barack Obama announced a new Science Envoy program as part of a "new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world." In January 2010, Bruce Alberts, Ahmed Zewail, and Elias Zerhouni became the first US science envoys to Islam, visiting Muslim-majority countries from North Africa to Southeast Asia.[30]

Bruce Michael Alberts (born April 14, 1938 in Chicago, Illinois) is an American biochemist and the Chancellor’s Leadership Chair in Biochemistry and Biophysics for Science and Education at the University of California, San Francisco.[3] He has done important work studying the protein complexes which enable chromosome replication when living cells divide. He is known as an original author of the "canonical, influential, and best-selling scientific textbook" Molecular Biology of the Cell,[4] and as Editor-in-Chief of Science magazine.[5][6]
Alberts was the president of the National Academy of Sciences from 1993 to 2005.[4] He is known for his work in forming science public policy, and has served as United States Science Envoy to Pakistan and Indonesia.[2][7] He has stated that "Science education should be about learning to think and solve problems like a scientist—insisting, for all citizens, that statements be evaluated using evidence and logic the way scientists evaluate statements."[8]

Education[edit]
After graduating from New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois,[9] Alberts attended Harvard College, as a pre-medicine major.[4][10] Bored by assigned laboratory "cooking classes", he petitioned to skip the physical chemistry laboratory requirement and instead was allowed to work with his tutor Jacques Fresco, in Paul M. Doty's laboratory. The summer's research led to the publication of two successful papers on mismatch errors in the helical structures of DNA and RNA,[11][12] and Alberts decided to continue on in biophysics.[4] He graduated with his A.B. in biochemical sciences, summa cum laude, in 1960.[4]
Alberts then worked with Paul M. Doty on an "enormously ambitious" thesis on DNA replication, attempting to solve the genetic code using nearest neighbor analysis of DNA polymerase.[9][10] After failing his first oral examination in spring 1965, he completed his Ph.D. research in fall 1965.[2][9][13] His doctorate in biophysics was published by Harvard University in 1966.[1] Alberts credits his initial failure with teaching him much more than his successes.[9] "That was a very important learning experience for me. I had decided that experimental strategy was everything in science, and nobody had ever told me anything about this."[2]
Career[edit]
After graduating, Alberts went to the Institut de Biologie Moleculaire[14] at the University of Geneva as a postdoctoral fellow, and worked with Richard H. Epstein on genes involved in DNA replication of phage T4. Epstein and his students had shown that there were at least seven different proteins needed for replication of T4 DNA. Alberts decided to do something that no one else was doing, and developed a DNA column for the purification of proteins that bound to DNA.[2] This enabled him to purify T4 Bacteriophage Gene 32.[15]
In 1966, Alberts joined the Department of Biochemical Sciences at Princeton University as an Assistant Professor. In 1971, he became an Associate Professor and in 1973 a full Professor, holding the Damon Pfeiffer Professorship in life sciences from 1975-1976.[14][16][17] At Princeton, he continued to work in the area of protein biochemistry, reconstituting systems.[2]
In 1976, Alberts accepted a position as professor and vice-chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco.[16] Also in 1976, he and his students were able to add all seven proteins to double-stranded DNA in an appropriate magnesium concentration to make DNA. More years of research were spent understanding the reactions involved. Another important step in understanding DNA synthesis was realizing that leading strand DNA polymerase and lagging strand DNA polymerase were coupled.[2][18]
Alberts was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1978.[16][19] From 1981 to 1985 Alberts held the American Cancer Society Research Professorship, a title granted for life as of 1980.[14] From 1985 to 1990, he was Chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco. From 1990-1993 he again held the American Cancer Society Research Professorship.[16]
Science and education[edit]
Alberts served as the President of the National Academy of Sciences for two terms from 1993 until 2005.[14][20]
Alberts has long been committed to the improvement of science education, dedicating much of his time to educational projects such as City Science, a program seeking to improve science teaching in San Francisco elementary schools.[4] He has served on the advisory board of the National Science Resources Center, a joint project of the National Academy of Sciences and the Smithsonian Institution working with teachers, scientists, and school systems to improve teaching of science as well as on the National Academy of Sciences' National Committee on Science Education Standards and Assessment. He has published important National Academies reports: the National Science Education Standards (NSES; NRC, 1996), intended to change the way that science is taught K-12, and Inquiry and the National Science Education Standards (NRC, 2000)[20]
The Bruce Alberts Award for Excellence in Science Education is given in his name to those who have made outstanding contributions in science education.[21]
He has served in different capacities on a number of advisory and editorial boards, including as chair of the Commission on Life Sciences, National Research Council.[4] Prior to his election as President of the National Academy of Sciences in 1995 he was president-elect of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.[18] From 2007-2008 he served as president of the American Society for Cell Biology.[22]
He served as a trustee of the Carnegie Corporation of New York from 2000 to 2009.[23][24] He and others have critiqued the biomedical research system, pointing out what they consider "systemic flaws"[25] and have created the Rescuing Biomedical Research organization, to "collect and organize input for solutions"[26] to the problems identified by themselves[25] and others.[27]
Alberts was Editor-in-Chief of the American Association for the Advancement of Science's flagship publication, Science for five years from 2008-2013.[28] He is one of the founding editors of the journal Cell Biology Education.[20]
International work[edit]
From 2000-2009, Alberts was the Co-chair of the InterAcademy Council, an advisory institution in Amsterdam governed by the presidents of fifteen science academies from around the world, and a member of the Science Initiative Group board.[29]
In his June 4, 2009 speech at Cairo University, US President Barack Obama announced a new Science Envoy program as part of a "new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world." In January 2010, Bruce Alberts, Ahmed Zewail, and Elias Zerhouni became the first US science envoys to Islam, visiting Muslim-majority countries from North Africa to Southeast Asia.[30]

Bruce Michael Alberts (born April 14, 1938 in Chicago, Illinois) is an American biochemist and the Chancellor’s Leadership Chair in Biochemistry and Biophysics for Science and Education at the University of California, San Francisco.[3] He has done important work studying the protein complexes which enable chromosome replication when living cells divide. He is known as an original author of the "canonical, influential, and best-selling scientific textbook" Molecular Biology of the Cell,[4] and as Editor-in-Chief of Science magazine.[5][6]
Alberts was the president of the National Academy of Sciences from 1993 to 2005.[4] He is known for his work in forming science public policy, and has served as United States Science Envoy to Pakistan and Indonesia.[2][7] He has stated that "Science education should be about learning to think and solve problems like a scientist—insisting, for all citizens, that statements be evaluated using evidence and logic the way scientists evaluate statements."[8]

Education[edit]
After graduating from New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois,[9] Alberts attended Harvard College, as a pre-medicine major.[4][10] Bored by assigned laboratory "cooking classes", he petitioned to skip the physical chemistry laboratory requirement and instead was allowed to work with his tutor Jacques Fresco, in Paul M. Doty's laboratory. The summer's research led to the publication of two successful papers on mismatch errors in the helical structures of DNA and RNA,[11][12] and Alberts decided to continue on in biophysics.[4] He graduated with his A.B. in biochemical sciences, summa cum laude, in 1960.[4]
Alberts then worked with Paul M. Doty on an "enormously ambitious" thesis on DNA replication, attempting to solve the genetic code using nearest neighbor analysis of DNA polymerase.[9][10] After failing his first oral examination in spring 1965, he completed his Ph.D. research in fall 1965.[2][9][13] His doctorate in biophysics was published by Harvard University in 1966.[1] Alberts credits his initial failure with teaching him much more than his successes.[9] "That was a very important learning experience for me. I had decided that experimental strategy was everything in science, and nobody had ever told me anything about this."[2]
Career[edit]
After graduating, Alberts went to the Institut de Biologie Moleculaire[14] at the University of Geneva as a postdoctoral fellow, and worked with Richard H. Epstein on genes involved in DNA replication of phage T4. Epstein and his students had shown that there were at least seven different proteins needed for replication of T4 DNA. Alberts decided to do something that no one else was doing, and developed a DNA column for the purification of proteins that bound to DNA.[2] This enabled him to purify T4 Bacteriophage Gene 32.[15]
In 1966, Alberts joined the Department of Biochemical Sciences at Princeton University as an Assistant Professor. In 1971, he became an Associate Professor and in 1973 a full Professor, holding the Damon Pfeiffer Professorship in life sciences from 1975-1976.[14][16][17] At Princeton, he continued to work in the area of protein biochemistry, reconstituting systems.[2]
In 1976, Alberts accepted a position as professor and vice-chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco.[16] Also in 1976, he and his students were able to add all seven proteins to double-stranded DNA in an appropriate magnesium concentration to make DNA. More years of research were spent understanding the reactions involved. Another important step in understanding DNA synthesis was realizing that leading strand DNA polymerase and lagging strand DNA polymerase were coupled.[2][18]
Alberts was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1978.[16][19] From 1981 to 1985 Alberts held the American Cancer Society Research Professorship, a title granted for life as of 1980.[14] From 1985 to 1990, he was Chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco. From 1990-1993 he again held the American Cancer Society Research Professorship.[16]
Science and education[edit]
Alberts served as the President of the National Academy of Sciences for two terms from 1993 until 2005.[14][20]
Alberts has long been committed to the improvement of science education, dedicating much of his time to educational projects such as City Science, a program seeking to improve science teaching in San Francisco elementary schools.[4] He has served on the advisory board of the National Science Resources Center, a joint project of the National Academy of Sciences and the Smithsonian Institution working with teachers, scientists, and school systems to improve teaching of science as well as on the National Academy of Sciences' National Committee on Science Education Standards and Assessment. He has published important National Academies reports: the National Science Education Standards (NSES; NRC, 1996), intended to change the way that science is taught K-12, and Inquiry and the National Science Education Standards (NRC, 2000)[20]
The Bruce Alberts Award for Excellence in Science Education is given in his name to those who have made outstanding contributions in science education.[21]
He has served in different capacities on a number of advisory and editorial boards, including as chair of the Commission on Life Sciences, National Research Council.[4] Prior to his election as President of the National Academy of Sciences in 1995 he was president-elect of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.[18] From 2007-2008 he served as president of the American Society for Cell Biology.[22]
He served as a trustee of the Carnegie Corporation of New York from 2000 to 2009.[23][24] He and others have critiqued the biomedical research system, pointing out what they consider "systemic flaws"[25] and have created the Rescuing Biomedical Research organization, to "collect and organize input for solutions"[26] to the problems identified by themselves[25] and others.[27]
Alberts was Editor-in-Chief of the American Association for the Advancement of Science's flagship publication, Science for five years from 2008-2013.[28] He is one of the founding editors of the journal Cell Biology Education.[20]
International work[edit]
From 2000-2009, Alberts was the Co-chair of the InterAcademy Council, an advisory institution in Amsterdam governed by the presidents of fifteen science academies from around the world, and a member of the Science Initiative Group board.[29]
In his June 4, 2009 speech at Cairo University, US President Barack Obama announced a new Science Envoy program as part of a "new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world." In January 2010, Bruce Alberts, Ahmed Zewail, and Elias Zerhouni became the first US science envoys to Islam, visiting Muslim-majority countries from North Africa to Southeast Asia.[30]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
