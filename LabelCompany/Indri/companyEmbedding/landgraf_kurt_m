Business Board
Kurt M. Landgraf
The Educational Testing Service (ETS) of Princeton, New Jersey is known as a bastion of integrity, and the unrivaled World leader in private educational testing. Thus, it is only fitting that a man of Mr. Landgraf's successes and international reputation was selected to lead an institution of this stature. 
In the year 2000, Mr. Landgraf concluded a remarkable and illustrious career that spanned some 20 years with E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Company (DuPont), when he resigned as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of DuPont Pharmaceuticals Company. At various times he has served as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of DuPont in Wilmington, Delaware. As Chairman of DuPont Europe, Mr. Landgraf had responsibility for the profitability of a varied and stimulating group of DuPont businesses including Biotechnology, Global Life Science, Nutrition Science, Consumer Health and DuPont Pharmaceuticals, for all operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. While the list of important positions held at DuPont is a long one, his service as Chief Financial Officer of DuPont further enhanced his rich experience at the chemical giant. As CFO, Mr. Landgraf was responsible for all financial command, control and support systems, Investor Relations, Mergers and Acquisitions, Corporate Plans, Pension Fund Investment, Purchasing, Information Systems, Continuous Business Improvement, Integrated Process/Systems, and other financial support functions within the $45 billion DuPont Company. Earlier in his tenure at DuPont, Mr. Landgraf also held numerous sales and marketing positions, rounding out a career of unusual breadth, depth, and accomplishment.
A man of Mr. Landgraf's extraordinary capabilities and commitment can be expected to serve his fellow man, and serve he does, with distinction. At one time and another he has been Past President of the GEM Consortium (National Consortium for Graduate Degrees for Minorities in Engineering and Sciences, Inc.), and Previous Chairman of The United Way of Delaware, Delaware Association for Retarded Citizens, Delaware Public Policy Institute, Christiana Care Health Services Inc., Delaware Business/Public Education Council, Board Member of the National Alliance of Business, The National Pharmaceutical Council, Founding Member of the Board of Managers for the Delaware State Manufacturing Association, Vice Chairman of the Delaware Business Manufacturers Alliance of the State Chamber of Commerce. He also was elected to serve as a member of the Board of Trustees of Wagner College, and selected to be a Member of the Rock Institute of Ethics, Pennsylvania State University Board. Not surprisingly, Mr. Landgraf was recipient of The Pennsylvania State University 1996 Distinguished Alumni of the Year, College of Liberal Arts. Mr. Landgraf also has taught various college level courses at Princeton University, Western Michigan University, and Pennsylvania State University, to name a few.
