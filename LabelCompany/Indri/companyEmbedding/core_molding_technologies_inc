Business Overview


      Kevin L. Barnett, President and Chief Executive Officer of Core Molding 
      Technologies, stated, "Consistent with our expectations headed into the 
      third quarter, the cyclical decline in build-rates in the heavy-duty 
      truck market resulted in a reduction of our product sales during the 
      period. Lower demand from customers in the heavy-duty truck market was 
      partially offset by an increase in demand from customers in the marine 
      market. Partially offsetting the reduction in product sales was an 
      increase in tooling sales as we completed several tooling projects 
      related to both new and replacement programs during the quarter. Our 
      gross margin declined during the quarter as a result of higher 
      production costs and an unfavorable revenue mix shift, coupled with 
      lower fixed cost absorption related to lower production levels. We 
      continue to focus on reducing operating costs in response to decreasing 
      sales while maintaining the ability to meet the volatile delivery 
      requirements of our customers. While gross margin declined during the 
      quarter, our year-to-date gross margin of 16.5% is within the norm of 
      our historical levels. We also remain diligent in controlling selling, 
      general and administrative costs, which resulted in third quarter 2016 
      selling, general and administrative expense as a percent of sales 
      remaining roughly in line with the prior year level. Even with the 
      declining product volume, we were able to continue to strengthen our 
      financial position, adding nearly $4 million to our cash balance during 
      the third quarter through free cash flow generation, which positions us 
      well to invest in future growth initiatives."
    

      "We continue to focus on providing our customers with a wide range of 
      material and process solutions and are proud to have recently announced 
      the introduction of our new technology, HydriliteTM. This ultra-low 
      density SMC formulation enables us to offer our customers a lower 
      density material that supports their lightweighting efforts while 
      providing structural durability and a high-quality surface appearance. 
      We expect HydriliteTM to be attractive across our end markets given 
      customers' efforts to lightweight their products," Mr. Barnett added.
    

Outlook


      Mr. Barnett continued, "We anticipate our fourth quarter 2016 sales to 
      be lower relative to 2015 as a result of the continued downturn in 
      activity in the heavy-duty truck market and it is likely that this trend 
      will continue into 2017, albeit to a lesser degree than in the current 
      year. Industry sources currently forecast a decline in North American 
      production of heavy-duty trucks of 30% in 2016, with further weakening 
      of approximately 10% in 2017 before rebounding by nearly 20% in 2018. 
      Our expectation is that our ongoing improvements and cost reduction 
      efforts will catch up to our lower sales levels in 2017, thus 
      stabilizing our gross margins. While fourth quarter product sales are 
      expected to be lower, we anticipate stronger fourth quarter tooling 
      sales than the prior year period as we continue to complete tooling 
      projects for new and replacement programs. Ultimately, we are confident 
      in our ability to profitably manage through this down-cycle as we have 
      with previous downturns over the past 20 years."
    

      "Diversification into new markets, as well as new materials and 
      processes remains an important part of our strategy to mitigate the 
      impact of the inevitable down-cycles in the heavy duty-truck market. We 
      plan to accomplish this both organically, as well as through 
      acquisitions, by utilizing our strong balance sheet and free cash flow. 
      Additionally, the heavy-duty truck market will continue to be a major 
      part of our business and analysts project a strong rebound in this 
      market over the next several years. With our significant position in the 
      truck market, and the progress we are making expanding our end markets 
      and manufacturing capabilities, we remain optimistic in our ability to 
      deliver long-term profitable growth and returns to our shareholders," 
      Mr. Barnett concluded.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
