Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. Announces Unaudited Consolidated Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year Ended April 1, 2017; Provides Financial Guidance for First Quarter and Full Year of Fiscal 2018; Plans to Open Twelve New Stores in 2018
Jun 1 17
Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. announced unaudited consolidated financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended April 1, 2017. Net sales were increased 9.1% to $163.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 (14 weeks), from $149.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 (13 weeks). Net sales increased due primarily to the extra week of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 and contributions from the 12 new stores opened during fiscal year 2017. Sales growth was partially offset by a decrease of 0.9% in consolidated same store sales and the closure of one store in the fourth quarter. Sales at sheplers.com declined in February and March when compared to fiscal year 2016 as a result of disruption from the conversion to a new e-commerce platform, resulting in sales below plan. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $8.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to $5.6 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted income from operations was $9.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, an increase of 20.6%, compared to $7.7 million in the prior-year period. In each case, the increase was driven primarily by the extra week of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, adjusted income from operations excludes a store impairment charge of $1.2 million. Adjusted income from operations in fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 excludes acquisition-related integration costs, loss on disposal of assets and contract termination costs, and the amortization of inventory fair value adjustment. See On a GAAP basis, net income was $2.6 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, compared to $1.0 million or $0.04 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Adjusted net income was $3.3 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, compared to $2.5 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. Income before income taxes was $4,212,000 against $2,041,000 for the same period of last year. 

Net sales for fiscal year 2017 (53 weeks) increased 10.7% to $629.8 million from $569.0 million in fiscal year 2016 (52 weeks). Net sales increased from twelve months of sales contributions from Sheplers (compared to nine months in the prior-year period), additional sales from the 53rd week, the opening of 12 new stores over the last twelve months, and a 0.3% increase in consolidated same store sales. On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $37.8 million, compared to $30.2 million in fiscal year 2016, the increase primarily resulting from the acquisition-related expenses and integration costs in fiscal year 2016 that were not incurred in fiscal year 2017. Adjusted income from operations was $39.0 million in fiscal year 2017, a decrease of 8.6%, compared to $42.7 million in fiscal year 2016. The decrease in adjusted income from operations compared to the prior year’s adjusted income from operations was driven primarily by an increase in adjusted operating expenses related to twelve months of the Sheplers business compared to nine months in the prior-year period and the increase in adjusted operating expenses related to increased sales. In fiscal year 2017, adjusted income from operations excludes a store impairment charge of $1.2 million. Adjusted income from operations in fiscal year 2016 excludes acquisition-related expenses and integration costs, loss on disposal of assets and contract termination costs, and the amortization of inventory fair value adjustment. On a GAAP basis, net income was $14.2 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, compared to $9.9 million, or $0.37 per diluted in the prior-year period. Adjusted net income was $14.9 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, in fiscal year 2017, compared to $18.7 million or $0.69 per diluted share in fiscal year 2016. Income before income taxes was $23,119,000 against $17,311,000 for the same period of last year. Net cash provided by operating activities was $41,151,000 against $32,929,000 for the same period of last year. Purchases of property and equipment were $22,293,000 against $36,127,000 for the same period of last year. Fiscal 2017 capital expenditures totaled at $19 million.

For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018 the company expects to open 12 new stores.

For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018 the company expects flat to slightly positive consolidated same store sales growth; Income from operations between $37.8 million and $40.0 million' Net income of $14.0 million to $15.4 million; and Net income per diluted share of $0.52 to $0.57 based on 27.1 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. The Company estimates that $0.03 of the $0.55 adjusted net income per diluted share in fiscal year 2017 relates to the 53rd week. Therefore, fiscal year 2018 net income per diluted share will compare to $0.52 adjusted net income per diluted share in fiscal year 2017. The company expects capital expenditures to be in the range of $15 million to $17 million with the majority related to investments in stores and in the Wichita DC. The company expects tax rate to be approximately 39% and interest expense to be approximately $15 million. The company expects to generate free cash flow of $14 million to $16 million.

For the fiscal first quarter ending July 1, 2017 the company expects flat consolidated same store sales; Break-even earnings per diluted share.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2017 Financial Results


06-01-2017

Download this Press Release (PDF)


 IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BOOT) today announced its financial
      results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended April 1, 2017.
    

      For the fourth quarter ended April 1, 2017:
    


        Net sales increased 9.1% to $163.0 million;
      

        Consolidated same store sales declined 0.9%;
      

        GAAP net income was $2.6 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared
        to $1.0 million, or $0.04 per diluted share in the prior-year period.
        Adjusted net income was $3.3 million, or $0.12 per diluted share,
        compared to adjusted net income of $2.5 million, or $0.09 per diluted
        share in the prior-year period;
      

        Two new stores were opened.
      


      For the fiscal year ended April 1, 2017:
    


        Net sales increased 10.7% to $629.8 million;
      

        Consolidated same store sales increased 0.3%;
      

        GAAP net income was $14.2 million, or $0.53 per diluted share,
        compared to $9.9 million, or $0.37 per diluted share in the prior-year
        period. Adjusted net income was $14.9 million, or $0.55 per diluted
        share, compared to adjusted net income of $18.7 million, or $0.69 per
        diluted share in the prior-year period;
      

        Twelve new stores were opened and one store was closed, bringing the
        total count at year-end to 219 stores.
      


      Other developments:
    


        Acquired certain assets of Country Outfitter, including the
        countryoutfitter.com domain name, customer list and social media
        assets for $1.8 million of cash and assumed liabilities;
      

        Increased the capacity under the revolving credit facility $10 million
        to $135 million and extended the maturity date for two additional
        years;
      

        Amended the financial covenant under the term loan facility to
        increase the maximum net leverage ratio requirements.
      


      Note: Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP measure. An explanation of the
      computation of this measure and a reconciliation to GAAP net income is
      included below. See also "Non-GAAP Financial Measures."
    

Jim Conroy, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “While we reported
      slightly negative consolidated same store sales for the quarter, we are
      pleased that comparable sales in our physical stores improved on a
      sequential basis, and we were able to achieve 30 basis points of
      improvement in our core merchandise margin. Unfortunately, our fourth
      quarter earnings per share fell short of our expectations due to lower
      than expected retail store sales, unanticipated operating expenses, and
      disruption in sales at sheplers.com arising from the transition of the
      e-commerce site to a new software platform. We are continuing to work to
      improve the site performance and return sheplers.com to positive sales
      growth.”
    

      Mr. Conroy continued, “Looking ahead, we are excited to announce that we
      have further strengthened our position as the leading omni-channel
      western and work wear retailer in the U.S. with the purchase of certain
      assets of countryoutfitter.com, a large pure-play e-commerce retailer
      targeting a younger, female country customer. While more difficult than
      anticipated, we have also completed the transition of sheplers.com to
      our new e-commerce platform which now includes the newly acquired
      countryoutfitter.com. Additionally, we are encouraged that same store
      sales at our physical stores are improving and are positive fiscal
      year-to-date partly driven by a recovery in the oil and gas markets. We
      remain confident that our industry-leading position, advanced
      omni-channel capabilities and ongoing merchandising opportunities will
      allow us to continue to capture market share and drive profitable growth
      over the long-term.”
    

Operating Results for the Fourth Quarter Ended April 1, 2017



        Net sales increased 9.1% to $163.0 million in the fourth quarter of
        fiscal year 2017 (14 weeks), from $149.5 million in the fourth quarter
        of fiscal year 2016 (13 weeks). Net sales increased due primarily to
        the extra week of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 and
        contributions from the 12 new stores opened during fiscal year 2017.
        Sales growth was partially offset by a decrease of 0.9% in
        consolidated same store sales and the closure of one store in the
        fourth quarter. Sales at sheplers.com declined in February and March
        when compared to fiscal year 2016 as a result of disruption from the
        conversion to a new e-commerce platform, resulting in sales below plan.
      

        Gross profit was $49.3 million, or 30.3% of net sales in the fourth
        quarter of fiscal year 2017, compared to gross profit of $42.4
        million, or 28.4% of net sales, in the prior-year period. Gross profit
        increased $5.4 million, or 12.4%, from adjusted gross profit of $43.9
        million, or 29.4% of net sales, in the prior-year period. Gross profit
        increased as a result of additional sales in the 14-week fourth
        quarter in fiscal year 2017, the opening of 12 new stores, and
        improvement in merchandise margin rate. As a percentage of sales,
        consolidated gross profit increased primarily due to merchandise
        margin expansion and occupancy leverage from the 14-week fourth
        quarter. Adjusted gross profit in the prior-year period excludes
        acquisition-related integration costs, contract termination costs and
        the amortization of inventory fair value adjustment. See “Non-GAAP
        Financial Measures.”
      

        On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $8.1 million in the fourth
        quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to $5.6 million in the prior-year
        period. Adjusted income from operations was $9.2 million in the fourth
        quarter of fiscal year 2017, an increase of 20.6%, compared to $7.7
        million in the prior-year period. In each case, the increase was
        driven primarily by the extra week of sales in the fourth quarter of
        fiscal year 2017. Adjusted income from operations was below guidance
        as a result of disruption in sales at sheplers.com during the quarter.
        Also contributing to lower income from operations and adjusted income
        from operations were unanticipated store expenses, repairs and
        maintenance, and outside services primarily related to transitioning
        and operating the newly acquired Country Outfitter e-commerce site. In
        the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, adjusted income from
        operations excludes a store impairment charge of $1.2 million.
        Adjusted income from operations in fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016
        excludes acquisition-related integration costs, loss on disposal of
        assets and contract termination costs, and the amortization of
        inventory fair value adjustment. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”
      

        During the fourth quarter, the Company opened two stores and closed
        one store.
      

        On a GAAP basis, net income was $2.6 million, or $0.10 per diluted
        share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, compared to $1.0
        million or $0.04 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Adjusted
        net income was $3.3 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in the fourth
        quarter of fiscal year 2017, compared to $2.5 million, or $0.09 per
        diluted share, in the prior-year period. See “Non-GAAP Financial
        Measures.”
      


      A reconciliation of adjusted gross profit, adjusted income from
      operations, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted
      share, each a non-GAAP financial measure, to their most directly
      comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the accompanying
      financial data. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures."
    

Operating Results for the Fiscal Year Ended April 1, 2017



        Net sales for fiscal year 2017 (53 weeks) increased 10.7% to $629.8
        million from $569.0 million in fiscal year 2016 (52 weeks). Net sales
        increased from twelve months of sales contributions from Sheplers
        (compared to nine months in the prior-year period), additional sales
        from the 53rd week, the opening of 12 new stores over the
        last twelve months, and a 0.3% increase in consolidated same store
        sales.
      

        Gross profit was $189.9 million, or 30.2% of net sales, compared to
        gross profit of $173.2 million, or 30.4% of net sales, in fiscal year
        2016. Gross profit increased 6.7% compared to adjusted gross profit of
        $178.0 million, or 31.3% of net sales, in the prior-year period. Gross
        profit increased from an entire year of Sheplers in fiscal year 2017,
        additional sales from the 53rd week, and the opening of 12
        new stores. The decline in gross profit rate was driven primarily by
        an increase in store occupancy costs and a decline in merchandise
        margin rate. The decline in merchandise margin rate resulted from an
        increase in lower margin e-commerce sales penetration and twelve
        months of lower margin Sheplers sales compared to nine months in the
        prior-year period. Adjusted gross profit in fiscal year 2016 excludes
        acquisition-related integration costs, contract termination costs and
        the amortization of inventory fair value adjustment. See “Non-GAAP
        Financial Measures.”
      

        On a GAAP basis, income from operations was $37.8 million, compared to
        $30.2 million in fiscal year 2016, the increase primarily resulting
        from the acquisition-related expenses and integration costs in fiscal
        year 2016 that were not incurred in fiscal year 2017. Adjusted income
        from operations was $39.0 million in fiscal year 2017, a decrease of
        8.6%, compared to $42.7 million in fiscal year 2016. The decrease in
        adjusted income from operations compared to the prior year’s adjusted
        income from operations was driven primarily by an increase in adjusted
        operating expenses related to twelve months of the Sheplers business
        compared to nine months in the prior-year period and the increase in
        adjusted operating expenses related to increased sales. In fiscal year
        2017, adjusted income from operations excludes a store impairment
        charge of $1.2 million. Adjusted income from operations in fiscal year
        2016 excludes acquisition-related expenses and integration costs, loss
        on disposal of assets and contract termination costs, and the
        amortization of inventory fair value adjustment. See “Non-GAAP
        Financial Measures.”
      

        The Company opened 12 stores and closed one store, ending the fiscal
        year with 219 stores in 31 states.
      

        On a GAAP basis, net income was $14.2 million, or $0.53 per diluted
        share, compared to $9.9 million, or $0.37 per diluted in the
        prior-year period. Adjusted net income was $14.9 million, or $0.55 per
        diluted share, in fiscal year 2017, compared to $18.7 million or $0.69
        per diluted share in fiscal year 2016.
      


      A reconciliation of adjusted gross profit, adjusted income from
      operations, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted
      share, each a non-GAAP financial measure, to their most directly
      comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the accompanying
      financial data. See also "Non-GAAP Financial Measures."
    

Balance Sheet Highlights as of April 1, 2017



        Cash: $8.0 million


        Inventories: Average inventory per store decreased 5% compared to
        March 26, 2016


        Total net debt: $225.9 million, including $33.3 million outstanding on
        revolving credit facility
      


Fiscal Year 2018 Outlook


      For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018 the Company expects:
    


        To open 12 new stores.
      

        Flat to slightly positive consolidated same store sales growth.
      

        Income from operations between $37.8 million and $40.0 million.
      

        Net income of $14.0 million to $15.4 million.
      

        Net income per diluted share of $0.52 to $0.57 based on 27.1 million
        weighted average diluted shares outstanding. The Company estimates
        that $0.03 of the $0.55 adjusted net income per diluted share in
        fiscal year 2017 relates to the 53rd week. Therefore,
        fiscal year 2018 net income per diluted share will compare to $0.52
        adjusted net income per diluted share in fiscal year 2017.
      


      For the fiscal first quarter ending July 1, 2017 the Company expects:
    


        Flat consolidated same store sales.
      

        Break-even earnings per diluted share based on 27.1 million weighted
        average diluted shares outstanding.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures


      The Company presents adjusted gross profit, adjusted income from
      operations, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted
      share to help the Company describe its operating and financial
      performance. These financial measures are non-GAAP financial measures
      and should not be construed in isolation or as an alternative to actual
      gross profit, actual income from operations, actual net income and
      actual earnings per diluted share and other income or cash flow
      statement data (as presented in the Company’s consolidated financial
      statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
      in the United States, or GAAP), or as a better indicator of operating
      performance or as a measure of liquidity. These non-GAAP financial
      measures, as defined by the Company, may not be comparable to similar
      non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. The Company’s
      management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide
      investors with transparency and help illustrate financial results by
      excluding items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, the
      Company’s core operating results, thereby providing a better baseline
      for analyzing trends in the underlying business. See the table at the
      end of this press release for a reconciliation of adjusted gross profit
      to gross profit, adjusted income from operations to income from
      operations, adjusted net income to net income, and adjusted net income
      per diluted share to net income per diluted share.
    

Forward Looking Statements


      This press release contains forward-looking statements that are subject
      to risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of
      historical fact included in this press release are forward-looking
      statements. Forward-looking statements refer to our current expectations
      and projections relating to, by way of example and without limitation,
      our financial condition, liquidity, profitability, results of
      operations, margins, plans, objectives, strategies, future performance,
      business and industry. You can identify forward-looking statements by
      the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current
      facts. These statements may include words such as "anticipate",
      "estimate", "expect", "project", "plan“, "intend", "believe", “may”,
      “might”, “will”, “could”, “should”, “can have”, “likely”, “outlook” and
      other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any
      discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial
      performance or other events, but not all forward-looking statements
      contain these identifying words. These forward-looking statements are
      based on assumptions that the Company’s management has made in light of
      their industry experience and on their perceptions of historical trends,
      current conditions, expected future developments and other factors they
      believe are appropriate under the circumstances. As you consider this
      press release, you should understand that these statements are not
      guarantees of performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties
      (some of which are beyond the Company’s control) and assumptions. These
      risks, uncertainties and assumptions include, but are not limited to,
      the following: decreases in consumer spending due to declines in
      consumer confidence, local economic conditions or changes in consumer
      preferences and the Company’s ability to effectively execute on its
      growth strategy; the failure to maintain and enhance its strong brand
      image; to compete effectively; to maintain good relationships with its
      key suppliers; and to improve and expand its exclusive product
      offerings. The Company discusses the foregoing risks and other risks in
      greater detail under the heading “Risk factors” in the periodic reports
      filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
      Although the Company believes that these forward-looking statements are
      based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors
      could affect the Company’s actual financial results and cause them to
      differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking
      statements. Because of these factors, the Company cautions that you
      should not place undue reliance on any of these forward-looking
      statements. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it
      is impossible for the Company to predict those events or how they may
      affect the Company. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only
      as of the date on which it is made. Except as required by law, the
      Company does not intend to update or revise the forward-looking
      statements in this press release after the date of this press release.

1 Adjustments to Boot Barn's Adjusted EBITDA as stipulated in
      the 2015 Golub Term Loan and June 2015 Wells Fargo Revolver include
      pre-opening costs, franchise and state taxes, and other miscellaneous
      adjustments.
    

      (a) Represents non-cash compensation expenses related to stock options,
      restricted stock awards and restricted stock units granted to certain of
      our employees and directors.
    

      (b) Represents the non-cash accrual for future award redemptions in
      connection with our customer loyalty program.
    

      (c) Represents certain store integration, remerchandising, inventory
      obsolescence and corporate consolidation costs incurred in connection
      with the integration of Sheplers, which we acquired in June 2015.
      Includes an adjustment to normalize the gross margin impact of sales of
      discontinued inventory from Sheplers, which was sold at a discount or
      written off. The adjustment assumes such inventory was sold at Sheplers'
      normalized margin rate.
    

      (d) Represents the amortization of purchase-accounting adjustments that
      decreased the value of inventory acquired to its fair value.
    

      (e) Represents loss/(gain) on disposal of assets and contract
      termination costs from store closures and unused office and warehouse
      space.
    

      (f) Represents the store impairment charge recorded at three stores in
      order to reduce the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated
      fair values.
