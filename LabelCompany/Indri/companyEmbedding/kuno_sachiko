The Sachiko Kuno and Ryuji Ueno Innovation Professorship 
School of Medicine 
Established in 2014    



SACHIKO KUNO, PhD obtained her PhD in biochemical engineering from Kyoto University, Japan and conducted post-doctoral research at the Technical University of Munich, Germany at a time when there were few women pursuing careers in science. In the mid-1980s, Dr. Kuno and Dr. RYUJI UENO established R-Tech Ueno Ltd. in Japan to commercialize prostones, a class of functional fatty acids whose therapeutic potential was first identified by Dr. Ueno. In leading teams of talented scientists, Drs. Ueno and Kuno unlocked the therapeutic potential of prostones, resulting in more than 650 international patents and the successful launch of Rescula® eye drops, the first bioactive lipid ever used to treat glaucoma in Japan.
Leveraging R-Tech’s success in Japan, Dr. Kuno and Dr. Ueno moved to Bethesda, MD and established the Sucampo Group, an affiliation of companies in the Americas, Asia, and Europe. Dr. Kuno served Sucampo Group as a founding CEO, Chair of the Board, or an advisor until 2012. Sucampo received marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the doctors’ second prostone product, AMITIZA® (lubiprostone), for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation in adults, irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and opioid-induced constipation in adults with chronic non-cancer pain in 2006, 2008 and 2013 respectively. Regulatory approval has also been received in Switzerland, United Kingdom and Japan. Currently, Sucampo and R-Tech Ueno are listed and traded on NASDAQ and Tokyo’s JASDAQ. In 2012, Dr. Kuno, Dr. Ueno, and Dr. Wataru Akahata co-founded VLP Therapeutics.
Dr. Kuno is also a founder and Managing Member of S&R Technology Holdings, LLC, a Bethesda, MD-based holding company founded in 1999. Additionally, in 2000, Dr. Kuno with Dr. Ueno, established the S&R Foundation in Washington, DC for the purposes of supporting talented individuals with high aspirations and great potential in the arts, science, and social entrepreneurship, especially those who are furthering international cultural collaboration.

The first product, Rescula®‚ an anti-glaucoma treatment, was commercialized in Japan in 1994. Rescula® Eye Drops have been sold in more than 45 countries and have treated more than 500,000 patients since its launch. R-Tech Ueno completed its IPO in 2008 and is listed on the Osaka Stock Exchange.
Leveraging the success in Japan, Dr. Ueno, in partnership with Dr. Kuno, established Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to bring his discoveries to the American market. Sucampo, which was founded in 1996 as R-Tech Ueno (USA), Inc., received marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for AMITIZA® (lubiprostone), the second prostone product discovered by Dr. Ueno and developed by the doctors’ talented R&D team, for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation in adults in 2006 and for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation in 2008. Since 2006, Sucampo became a global, emerging pharmaceutical company by establishing its own commercial sales and marketing capacity, filed for an initial public offering, and acquired overseas affiliates in the UK, Japan, and Switzerland with an aim to expand operations and address commercial opportunities of prostone products worldwide. Sucampo is listed and traded on NASDAQ. In March, 2014, Dr. Ueno stepped down as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
In 2012, Dr. Ueno co-founded VLP Therapeutics with Dr. Kuno and Dr. Wataru Akahata, which focuses on using proprietary i-aVLP Technology to introduce the first and best-in-class novel, proprietary targeted antibody and vaccine therapies.

WASHINGTON, April 27, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- S&R Foundation, a non-profit organization that supports talented individuals with high aspirations in the arts, sciences, and social entrepreneurship, is thrilled to announce the 2015 winner of the newly-launched Sachiko Kuno Award for Applied Science, awarded to Dr. Sheila Ohlsson Walker.
Dr. Walker's research at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Arizona State University has focused on the manner in which information from the fields of neurobiology, genetics, epigenetics, and endocrinology can be applied to enhance educational outcomes, promote healthy behavior, reduce rates of chronic disease, and optimize health and learning throughout life. 
"The goal of S&R's Kuno Award is to recognize and support visionaries with deep domain expertise in fields relating to specific 21st century challenges," said Dr. Sachiko Kuno, CEO and President of S&R Foundation. "This award is designed to support the translation of scientific research to a practical and real-world solution. It supports those aiming to achieve measurable social impact, which is certainly the case with Dr. Walker's work."
S&R Foundation's Kuno Award for Applied Science for the social good is an annual award of financial support and other resources designed to support social innovators using scientific research and principles to address a 21st Century problem. The award supports those aiming to achieve measurable social impact, by supporting the translation of scientific research into solutions that can be applied to improve lives. 
The Kuno awardee is provided with $100,000 in funding, and complimentary office space at S&R Foundation's historic Halcyon House in Washington, DC. 
Dr. Walker's project views the fundamental disconnect between the biological sciences, educational practice, policy, and maternal/child health as an unprecedented opportunity. Her venture aims to create a branded web-based information platform, broader and more comprehensive than anything currently in existence, complemented by a variety of targeted training modules. The platform will be grounded in trustworthy, replicated, data driven, cutting-edge research, supported by highly visible strategic partners in academia, government, and business, and designed for all those invested in supporting the development of healthy and happy children.
"We applaud Dr. Walker's vision and commitment, and are proud to support her field-building initiative," said S&R Foundation COO Kate Goodall. "Her passion and ambition, combined with brilliant research, dedicated leadership and the potential for tremendous impact for the social good all underscore her project's selection for the inaugural Kuno Award." 
Dr. Walker's field-building initiative has four major objectives: translation, dissemination, awareness building and outcomes measurement, with an over-arching goal of optimizing education and health for our children and their families.
Overview
S&R Foundation's Sachiko Kuno Award for Applied Science for the social good is an annual award, launched in 2015, of financial support and other resources designed to support social innovators using scientific research and principles to address a 21st Century problem. The award is designed to support the translation of scientific research to a practical and real-world solution. The award supports those aiming to achieve measurable social impact. 
Through the Kuno Award, S&R Foundation will help social ventures secure the additional finance they need to grow, through intervention and support early in their formation. This may be through social investment, government contracts, or grant funding.
S&R will focus resources on providing support that includes a positive, nurturing environment where talented individuals are free to think, work and grow. S&R will also offer early stage financial support, while advanced funding or revenue is sought.
In order to be eligible for S&R Foundation's Kuno Award, applicants must be at early or mid-career, and possess a PhD in a relevant field. The project must be the original idea of the applicant, or the applicant's team.
Eligible projects must be in the start-up phase. To be considered start-up, the project may not have been organized, or may have been in operation for up to, but no longer than, to two years. S&R Foundation will look for leveraged solutions that create lasting positive change, and game-changing ideas that create better opportunities and outcomes for the future.

                Sachiko Kuno and Ryuji Ueno created the S&R Foundation in 2000 with a mission that promotes social entrepreneurship and supports innovation in the arts and sciences. The nonprofit operates out of two historic mansions in Georgetown. (Video by Emily Mekinc)

When Kei Tolliver interviewed for an office assistant role in 1998 at Sachiko Kuno and Ryuji Ueno’s Bethesda office — a small, two-bedroom condominium — she listened to Ueno explain the science behind his work, with “a sparkle in his eyes,” she remembers. The recent college graduate would be the first full-time employee for a startup that would become Sucampo Pharmaceuticals Inc. She knew little about science, but enough from the doctors’ fervor and ambition to recognize they were “working on something special.”
And they were. They had made a major medical discovery and launched an anti-glaucoma treatment in Japan, where they had established drug company R-Tech Ueno Ltd. They moved to the D.C. area in 1995 because of its proximity to the FDA and rich pool of researchers and industry talent, hoping to avoid the challenges of initially commercializing new medicines outside of the U.S. They would found Sucampo as R-Tech Ueno (USA) Inc. in 1996 and later bring to market their second product, a treatment for chronic constipation. They would take Sucampo public in 2007, making it an international player in the pharmaceutical industry before contently walking away from it in 2014.

They would leave their mark, but they wouldn’t leave Washington.
The tycoons had another project in the works. Back in 2000, they created the S&R Foundation, a D.C.-based nonprofit that supports artists, scientists and social entrepreneurs. It sponsors award programs, engages community partners and hosts concerts to encourage innovation. It was their brainchild, living largely under the radar.
The researchers — Kuno, a biochemist, now 60, and Ueno, a medical doctor, now 61 — took the foundation from its infancy, developing its mission, growing its programming and staff, and capitalizing on opportunities to expand its impact. After more than a decade with S&R in the District, in 2011, the husband-wife team made a splash in the Georgetown real estate market when they purchased two historic mansions: first, the Evermay estate for $22 million; then, the Halcyon House for $11 million. More recently, in June, they bought George Washington University’s Fillmore School building for $16.5 million.

Now the very private philanthropists were in the spotlight.





Today, the S&R Foundation comprises nine programs, providing performance opportunities, residency programs and three main awards: the Ueno Award for health care sciences, the Kuno Award for applied sciences and the Washington Award, which sponsors talented artists.
Then there’s the anchor project, the Halcyon Incubator. It follows an unusual model, providing residencies for individuals pursuing enterprises that prioritize measurable social change, in a 14-month fellowship. In each cohort, eight fellows — selected from an applicant pool of 250 — live together in the Halcyon House, a mansion built in 1787 by U.S. Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Stoddert.
The fellows have a “robust community built around them,” S&R Foundation Chief Operating Officer Kate Goodall said. In conceiving the idea, she and Kuno consulted leaders in the social enterprise field to create a program “that would be additive and not duplicative.”
The fellows are provided the space to live and work, a $10,000 stipend, mentors and coaches. They have access to pro bono services, from legal to accounting to communications to business development. Ninety-three percent have raised some kind of funding, and a number have raised more than $1 million. Unlike many other incubators, Goodall said, S&R doesn’t take equity in any ventures, but helps “give those people a leveled playing field to launch from, and greater support so that they can reach further and be bolder, be more confident.”
In 2015, the S&R Foundation has brought in about $2.27 million in revenue, with about $2.63 million in expenses, 79 percent of which funded its programs and 21 percent of which went toward supporting services, according to Goodall. Donor contributions directly fund its programs, while the founders and existing assets cover overhead and general operational costs, she said.
And the financial future of the foundation looks promising; the couple’s ability to support and continue to contribute is supported by their collective 46.7 percent ownership of Sucampo, according to the company’s most recent proxy — nearly half of a biotech that boasted a $773.92 million market cap as of Nov. 13.
The doctors, who live in upper Northwest, attribute their love of historic homes to spending time around those in Kyoto, Japan, where they met and lived for more than 10 years before moving to the D.C. area.
“Historic houses have some sort of power to inspire young, talented people, we believe,” Kuno said.
So the team decided to preserve and repurpose them. Now they’re continuing to expand this residency footprint with the Fillmore School, which will serve civic-minded artists as S&R’s second incubator, with a “similarly robust system of support,” Goodall said.
“Art is the center of the project,” Kuno said. “That means, how art can create social impact to change the world, to make the community better.”
At Evermay, which the doctors opened to predominantly showcase musicians, S&R hosts a concert series, as well as chamber and solo performances. Now with a 10-person staff, S&R supports roughly 23 individuals a year, in addition to those involved with special collaborations through other organizations, like The Washington Ballet, a new partner this year.




 


Char Prescott has experienced this support firsthand as the 2011 recipient of the Washington Award, an annual honor the foundation presents to an aspiring visual artist, dancer, photographer, musician, filmmaker, or writer. A few months after Prescott won the award, the current cellist in “The President’s Own” Marine Chamber Orchestra received a call from the doctors asking if she could perform last-minute in place of an injured artist at The Kennedy Center’s Terrace Theater. It was her childhood dream.
“They had not heard me live yet,” Prescott said. “They decided to take a chance and give me the opportunity.”
The then-22-year-old met Kuno and Ueno for the first time backstage, 10 minutes before her performance; she found them waiting for her afterward, with flowers.
Their hands-on generosity is constant, Prescott said. When she needed a better cello, Ueno quietly traveled to New York and identified one he believed would suit her. Prescott got a call to visit the music shop.
“I was just blown away by the cello he had chosen,” Prescott said. “He just had this sense of the essence that I would want out of an instrument.”
The organization owns the cello, and Prescott plays it on loan, an arrangement from which other S&R artists also benefit. She remains involved with the foundation, giving concerts, recitals or showcase performances with other musicians, or playing in a relaxed setting. For instance, sometimes Ueno invites the artists to come over, have wine and read chamber music together, she said.
“So many people just write a check and walk away, and that’s not what they do,” Prescott said. “They truly want to see the artists blossom and grow, and they will do whatever they can to help make that happen.”
The foundation also fosters artistic relationships and cross cultural collaborations. “Not only do they bring all of these different performers in with different backgrounds,” Prescott said, “but they encourage us to meet, and spend time together, and collaborate, and create ideas.”
The couple’s dedication to the arts has deep roots to their scientific training. Ueno has his M.D. from Keio University School of Medicine in Japan, as well as two doctorates; he has studied pharmacology, physiology and biochemistry at Kyoto and Osaka universities in Japan, and Columbia and Stanford universities in the U.S. Kuno earned her doctorate in biochemical engineering from Kyoto University in Japan, and completed post doctoral research at the Technical University of Munich in Germany. They met in the mid-80s, working together in the lab long before they were married.
Kuno realized her love for the visual arts when visiting museums during college in Kyoto. Ueno grew up watching his father support string instrument players, hoping to “do something similar to support the artists” if he could, he said.
S&R doesn’t draw distinctions between fields in the way it supports people, Goodall said. The doctors “recognize that people that are sort of pushing the envelope in any of those fields, or trying to do something new, need to have the time and space to think and breathe and try new, innovative things.”
Kuno and Ueno have no desire to slow down, no intention to leave the D.C. area and no plans to purchase more real estate — yet. They hope to continue growing the S&R model. They enjoy time with their two golden retrievers, Mario and Cherry. Ueno — formerly a Class A racecar driver — collects and restores old cars.
Some may wonder why the doctors are so powerfully drawn to the arts. But art has “a healing power, it’s almost like a medicine,” said Tolliver, who stayed with Sucampo for 10 years in various capacities, worked with S&R and is now an attorney.
“I believe the sciences and arts have some similarity, in terms of the creation or creativity,” Ueno said. “In order to do some invention or research work, the same portion of the brain may be used to create good art. That’s my belief.”

MISSION
To overcome disaster hand in hand with our friends across the world.
Disaster preparedness and response are normally addressed locally, then within a State, Prefecture, or Region, and finally within a single country. But while disasters may be seen as rare events in any one locality or country, from a global point of view a disaster occurs every year somewhere in the world. If disaster practitioners from around the world connect with each other and share their experience and knowledge, disaster preparedness and response can be improved everywhere. In that regard, IIGR’s mission is to help strengthen the readiness and professionalism of the emergency management community worldwide through training, education, consulting, and research.
GOALS
Currently, our primary focus is on Japan, a key friend and ally of the United States. Our two main goals are to:

Help strengthen emergency management and disaster resilience in Japan and the United States through mutual learning, and
Work to improve Japan – U.S. cooperation in disasters, including cooperation on Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief (HA/DR) in the Asia Pacific Region.

In the future, we hope to do similar work related to other countries as well.

The Three Decisions of Sachiko Kuno






VOLUME 1 – ISSUE NO.1 – SPRING 2017
By David Everett
Photographs by Marco Javier
 
Now in her Halcyon Days, the CEO turned philanthropist adds another chapter to a life story of entrepreneurial success.
 

If you are listed as one of the world’s most powerful women, if you are developing one of the nation’s most innovative foundations, if you are managing hundreds of millions of dollars, how else would you relax but frolic with your dog?
Such is Sachiko Kuno, soft-speaking entrepreneur, scion of a pharmaceutical-turned-foundation empire, and playmate of Cherry, the energetic golden retriever. Extraordinary people are still and again people, and dog wrangling is an easy choice for an introvert like Kuno, who once chose to work in a chemistry lab because she thought the job would not require human interaction.
Yet from the quiet of that long-ago lab, Kuno would transform into the business brains behind the genius of a boss-turned-husband. Along that other path, she would immigrate from a nation where she wasn’t accepted, buy and rebuild one of Washington’s most historic homes, and become a citizen of a new country.

Today, the marriage over, Kuno has turned her acumen in development, finance, and innovation to a new endeavor in philanthropy. The mission at DC’s Halcyon House and at Kuno’s other enterprises is the same as with the health-saving drugs she helped develop: to improve the residents of the blue planet through innovative science, art, finance, discourse, and social enterprise. Halycon is to synergize these disparate fields.
“I believe scientists, artists, and business entrepreneurs have some similarities,” Kuno reflects. “They all need to communicate with their communities, to showcase their talents … We need more of this getting together, with everyone who has the vision, who has the mission, or who has the talent, by creating a more inspirational space.”
1. Leaving Home
To see Japan from her Georgetown office, Sachiko Kuno need only glance left from her desk chair, to a long, narrow landscape painting of modern hints and darkened tones, a calming countryside view of hills and trees rising from a broad meadow. She put that painting there, at her side, a reminder she hardly needs.
As the country Kuno only recently, in life’s terms, began to visit again, as the country she had to formally leave behind when she became a U.S. citizen just last year, Japan is never far from mind. When Kuno needs to be alone – as she still does — she will slip into her kitchen at home and make a simple, traditional Japanese meal, adorning her marveled life with memories of years far and past. What better way to recollect your immortalities than cooking and smelling and tasting the foods of childhood?
She was born in Japan in 1954, the country still recovering from the devastation of World War II. The middle of three children, Sachiko grew up in a non-traditional family in a traditional land. Respectful of art, science, and business, her engineer father and college-educated mother set examples. Sure, her mother would remain a homemaker, as was expected for Japanese women, but she taught Sachiko and her sister about the freedoms she didn’t have outside the home.
“My mother was very much a dreamer,” Sachiko remembers. “I have been very much influenced by her to see some dreams, to think big, even though my father is more down to earth. It’s quite a good combination for parents.”
The interior design at the historic Halcyon House is muted, modern, and intended to showcase the striking art handpicked by Sachiko Kuno.
Sachiko chose a future in science for a reason. “You can’t believe it now, but I was super-shy when I was a high school student. I did not want to talk or communicate with other people. By selecting my profession, I wanted to get into some area where I didn’t need to communicate with other people, and science — the lab — was one of those professions.”
Japan, then and still male-centered, wasn’t welcoming to a woman in science. Yet first her sister and then Sachiko came to Kyoto University to study. Her chosen field: bioengineering chemistry. She was one of only six women among a thousand in her science and technology program. Later, Sachiko’s professor fretted that he wasn’t providing enough help for his lone female student, so he contacted a friend in Munich, Germany. The result would turn out to be momentous: a year-long research assistantship in a country half a world away, where women were not as rare in the lab. Or in business. In Munich, for the first time, Kuno received a salary. Smiles accompany this memory:
“I learned by doing something like that that I could earn money. This was quite a wonderful experience for me, because I was not sure before that I could make money by doing what I liked.”
Munich held another lesson, one critical to Sachiko’s future: “I needed to make all of my decisions by myself,” she explains. “There was no mother, no father, no professor. It was only one year, but it was a kind of milestone.”
She returned to Kyoto to finish her PhD. But Japan offered few jobs for quiet female scientists. She had no choice but the post-doc path. In the lab, she met Ryuji Ueno, a brilliant bioscientist with big ideas.
In the years to come, she worked more and more with and for the dashing Ueno. In what would become another fortuitous combination, they fell in love and married. Ueno focused on prostones, a chemical compound with wondrous medicinal potential, and, as the personal and professional merged at R-Tech Ueno Ltd., Kuno began turning her quiet mind to commercialization.
All she had to do was learn how to run a company.
All she needed were business skills, legal skills, management skills, negotiation skills, finance skills. At first, she just listened and watched, as many Japanese men expected of women anyway. But Kuno, the scientist once too shy to interact outside the lab, began to move beyond observation toward a real enterprise, to make her own discoveries in a world beyond test tubes. “My process was quite one by one,” she recalls. “We started a small startup … Little by little, through this process, I learned a lot in many decision-making points. Those experiments helped me.”
Halcyon House’s renovated and restored interior is used for everything from receptions to meetings. The main salon was part of the expansion carried out by Mark Twain’s nephew when he owned the historic Georgetown mansion.
The very idea that Kuno would meld two of Japan’s male-controlled worlds, in science and business, was clearly brave. But she never saw her new-found interest in entrepreneurship as moving away from science. “Instead, I was getting more into the translation process of basic science, into the development of science.” To her and Ueno, the goal was to make medicine and get it to patients.
By the mid-1980s, the small company was ready to pursue large dreams, if Kuno and Ueno could only find the money. They focused on a glaucoma drug called Rescula, which required years of work and many millions in development funding. Clinical trials, marketing, licensing, all that. She had not forgotten the salary lesson in Germany: “I studied the companies in Japan. I studied and I learned there were no venture capitalists. There was no one who would give us money as an investment, so we tried to find a corporation which could be a sponsor for our company, to be our umbrella.”
They found one, to the tune of $80 million. Rescula was on its way. But they needed more, just as a long recession started in Japan. “That was a huge debt we owed already, even before we had our first products. Our sponsor didn’t want to repeat that investment. That was a scary thing.” With the $80 million still owed but Rescula finally reaching patients, they kept looking for investors, for another sponsor, for what Kuno knew, across the oceans, were called venture capitalists. Maybe they should look in the U.S.?
They had developed friends and advisers in Bethesda, Maryland, but to follow the money would be momentous. A corporate move to the States, with its risks and opportunities, would be much more than a year in Bavaria. Yet the mission to help people with new products beckoned. “We saw that the prostone discoveries could be the platform technology to create many different types of medicines. … The potential of what I had as a basic technology could be huge. I really just wanted to see what we could do.”
Kuno also understood the challenges of remaining. “To me, as a woman, it was much easier to start a company in the United States than staying in Japan to struggle to create a company as a female CEO.”
The year: 1997. The entrepreneur, shy perhaps now only in memory, and the brilliant scientist, still focused on the lab, were ready. In the end, this one is simple to recount, as simple as wanting to see where fate and finance would take them.
“We decided to leave everything in Japan, and the two of us would come to the United States to start a company from scratch.”

Top: Kuno’s smallish office is classy and workable, but still adorned with art from her modern, innovative sensibilities. If she looked up from her desk, she would see over the rooftops of Georgetown and across the Potomac. Bottom: In her office, Kuno proudly displays a flag (left) she was given when she became a U.S. citizen in 2016, just over modernist paintings of two beloved pets. Looking out from her office (right) is the stunning view of the Potomac, the Key Bridge, and the Rosslyn skyline.
2. Saving Sucampo
To this day, Sachiko prefers to meet in small groups. At her smallish Georgetown office, the conference table and its ten chairs reside around a corner, just out of eyesight from her simple, table-top desk. Much closer and in front of the desk are four comfortable and classy fabric club chairs. They sit facing each other, equally spaced around a small circular coffee table stacked with a few books, all properly arranged. The chairs align so each occupant clearly sees the eyes of one, two, but no more than three others — close enough for conversation, but far enough to maintain space, to equalize height, to neutralize any bending back or leaning in. King Arthur thought of this, too.
Kuno’s voice is confident, calm, and accented from her native land. She’s quick to smile, ready to reflect, open to the most personal of inquiry. Sometimes English falters for a moment, but she nods quickly and easily re-starts sentences to arrive at the proper words. Her face is rounded, with flat cheeks and a small mouth bending only slightly downward on the edges. She dresses for business – a dark suit, tan hose, auburn hair mid-length, turned at the ends and perfectly done, manicured hands small but sure, never wandering in gesture. Class is the word, with a spot of jewelry in a pin and ring. You must look closely at the shoes, which seem as dark and all-business as the suit, to see the bright red surface on the inside edge of the thin, three-inch heels. Class with tiny splash.
Given the power her office represents, the room itself is compact, with modern glass shelving, a few messy piles on the desk. A working desk. In front of the four club chairs, beyond glass doors, is a small brick patio featuring a stunning view of the broad Potomac marred only by the hum and honks of DC traffic. You might suspect that patio is quietest at four in the morning, but the cross-river lights of high-rise Rosslyn must be grand any time after dark.
This gasp-inducing view over the rooftops of Georgetown is only the latest result of that move years ago to the United States. With advisers and friends and interim financing, Kuno and Ueno established Sucampo Pharmaceuticals. She completed her Executive MBA at Georgetown, attending on weekends or evenings like so many other working professionals in the region. To learn more, she kept listening carefully in those intimate groups, around tables small and not so small. “They could assist me with this information or that sum of their knowledge or skill, but the final thing you need to realize as CEO is – it’s your decision … The final decision always has to come from you.”
Those decisions must have worked, as Sucampo was out of the $80 million Japanese debt by the first year of the new century. She claims not to remember failures, but she acknowledges mistakes – perhaps some when she set unreachable goals. One of those was to keep Sucampo independent of the enormous pharmaceutical conglomerates. It would be easy to sell off, but that didn’t match the freedom Kuno sought. She and Ueno didn’t leave their home nation and its male-centric mentalities to fall under the control of a huge corporation, whose conference tables were large and not round. Maybe a dreaming mother would not approve that approach, either.
By 2003, Sucampo was nearing final clinical trials for its second product, AMITIZA, which would be used to treat chronic constipation resulting from various maladies. Money once more was the key to success, even if it wasn’t easy to come by. Cash was tight in the multi-million context of startup pharmaceuticals. For instance, Kuno knew a $5 million bond payment was soon due. She also knew Sucampo had only about $3 million in the bank. That was the entrepreneurial equivalent of a family facing a $3000 mortgage payment when it has only two grand in checking. Kuno’s plan was two-fold and labeled with initials dear to the heart of startups: IPO and VC. The options of venture support and a stock sale had drawn them to the States in the first place, and with the background of Rescula and the promise of more prostone-based meds, Sucampo was a certainty, right?
But the dot-com bubble had burst. The internet/digital startup boom lost its venture capital foundation, and other bankers disappeared with it. The $5 million deadline loomed. In entrepreneurial terms, the few months she had left to raise the money were like that mortgage payment coming due this weekend, or maybe tomorrow. We financial mortals would sell a car, borrow from retirement, maybe call Mom. For Sucampo, Kuno always knew there was a third option beyond VC and IPO: The conglomerates.
“I didn’t want to sell in the traditional way, to sell to Big Pharma, but I needed to change our strategy. I started visiting the big companies to start licensing negotiations.” All the evening classes, listening to advisers, learning with lawyers, bankers, regulators, and entrepreneurs led to this decision. “I’m always quite serious in thinking how to reach a goal, how to achieve a mission as quickly as possible.”
Just before the bond was due, Kuno reached a licensing agreement with one company. The money arrived in 2004 and 2005, with the IPO finally in 2007. AMITIZA was approved to treat chronic constipation in various forms, first in the U.S. and eventually in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and, yes, Japan. Kuno and Ueno kept the company. And the income. Yes, the lab certainly could make money and happiness.
She and Ueno expanded their compound of homes in Potomac, Maryland. They joined boards and foundations, developing one of their own labeled with certain initials — the S&R Foundation. In part to house this expanding philanthropy in science, music, and the arts, they would soon buy two of DC’s most famous and expensive Georgetown mansions: Halcyon House in 2011, for $12.5 million, and the landmark Evermay, for a reported $22 million. By 2015, the name Kuno joined Forbes magazine’s America’s Richest Self-Made Women, and Forbes Japan named her among the world’s 100 most powerful women. She was worth, the magazine reported, $330 million.
Even the beautiful, huge kitchen is open to staff, Halcyon Incubator fellows, and working visitors to historic Halcyon House.
2. Starting Halcyon
Sometimes the best way to explore a life is for a sagacious mind to turn inward, to describe the uncharted provinces of a world beyond pharmaceuticals, finance, and foundations, to offer what Wordsworth intimated were thoughts too deep for tears. To explain why Sachiko Kuno is not a mother. Some decisions are made for you, not by you.
“I wish I could have had children,” she says. “It was quite hard for me to accept that part, until I was maybe 45 years old.” If her English slows, it’s only for a second. “How can I say… Even before I was born, there was my story. There were many chapters, and I enjoyed many chapters. But quite unfortunately I didn’t have a chapter in which I had a child. However, there were many other things I can do, and I did … That’s my story. I don’t regret. I don’t cry. I just accept that.”
And so, we turn to the birth of Halcyon, the fitting name of the Georgetown mansion and now the moniker of a multi-idea foundation that aims, no less, to alter the earth. The goal is to find the entrepreneur, the scientist, the thinker, the artist who might create a product or develop an idea that would eventually improve or save thousands of lives. In short, Halcyon should produce, well … more Sachiko Kunos?
To understand the foundation’s name, we require more narrative – this from, say, a thousand eons ago, via Ovid and Virgil and other tellers of classical legend: The beauteous Alcyone plotted suicide after her beloved Ceyx drowned, his ship struck down by Zeus. To stop this tragedy, the gods transformed them both into birds, which upon generations were granted a few days without winter storms each year to lay their eggs. These are Halcyon days, this the name that inspired opera, poetry, film, literature, and a certain builder of a grand manse in 1787.
Its gardens designed by Mr. L’Enfant, the house was a center of Washington society for decades. Mark Twain’s nephew acquired it in 1900, extensively expanding and remodeling. Among its many histories since include a dorm for Georgetown students, an ambassador’s home, and finally the base for sculptor John Dreyfuss, who made his art there and rented it out for weddings and other events. In 2008, the price tag was $30 million. Kuno and Ueno finally got it, for less, six years ago. Twenty-three decades after it was built, a renewed and art-filled Halcyon House lords over Georgetown’s rooftops, with no less than the Key Bridge as its virtual driveway.
The house today – actually a complex of rooms and halls and workspaces over and under the older historic section, with an adjoining residential hall – exhibits the same modernist class of Kuno’s wardrobe. The tone and curtains and furniture are muted and classic, all the better to display the standout contemporary art – paintings, sculpture, and other works of modern, pop, and postmodern realms. In Kuno’s style and mission, this is truly now the striking home of Halcyon.
Underscoring Kuno’s mindset, the individual earth-changers Halcyon supports must present measurable goals: Halcyon Incubator, for early stage social entrepreneurs, Halcyon Arts Lab, for emerging artists who focus on social impact. Halcyon Stage, a boundary-leaping performance series that will stretch throughout DC and beyond. Halcyon Dialogue, a series of highest level discussions among global leaders, scientists, and other big thinkers to discuss the future of said planet. And Halcyon Awards, to recognize those dedicated to social change in arts, business, or policy.

The restored Halcyon House includes a lower workspace for the Halcyon Incubator fellows, who each have a cubicle designed to promote interaction and a sense of kinship in entrepreneurial creativity. Nearby are closed booths for phone calls.
The Incubator and Arts Lab are residential, with small groups of fellows living and working in or next to Halycon House or in the nearby Fillmore School to produce art and develop ideas. And the ideas! At Incubator, they range from hemorrhage-control systems for the battlefield, a text messaging platform for at-risk youth, a system to maintain rural roads, and vaccines that don’t need to be refrigerated. Most fellows start with a five-month residency to jumpstart or boost their ideas.
Carey Anne Nadeau, founder and CEO of the DC-based Open Data Nation data access service, credits her 2016 Halcyon fellowship with providing links to mentoring and markets not usually open to social enterprises.
“Dr. Kuno,” says Nadeau, “is an inspiration to our woman-owned small business — a strong female entrepreneur who shows that it is possible to both do well and do good.”
Here are two Important Meanwhiles: Kuno, long a permanent U.S. resident, became a citizen just last year – the same year she and Ueno ended their marriage, spurring a Solomonic division of the S&R Foundation, of Everymay and Halcyon, and even of their two retrievers. Ueno kept Mario, Kuno has Cherry. By 2017, S&R was only a shell, with Halcyon all in for Kuno’s vision, according to CEO Kate Goodall:
As a mentor, Kuno taught her “how to shift my perspective from looking at something as an obstacle,” Goodall says, “to looking at the same thing as an opportunity – such a gift.” Now Kuno has built Halcyon into what was unavailable to that young woman in Japan so many decades ago: a haven of time and space for creativity. “Our values,” Goodall says, “are really an embodiment of Dr. Kuno – risk tolerance, optimism, nimbleness, humility, and nurture.”
And the shy scientist turned philanthropy entrepreneur herself, the one who started it all? Today, at age 62, Kuno smiles about her achievements but stays driven to develop, to build more story. In her rare spare time, she secretly paints. (What do you do with the paintings? “I hide.”) She enjoys paging through design magazines, sometimes cooking those Japanese meals with soft jazz in the background. She prefers the mags over books – too busy. She has visited Japan much more since leaving the Sucampo board in 2012. She has some to say about her former home and its future:
“Japanese leaders are still maybe I think 90 percent male. We cannot see female leaders among bigger corporations. And there’s not yet great momentum in Japan to think about corporate advancement, to support startups.” In the end, a gap remains between individual potential in Japan and the reality of its tradition-bound culture, Kuno says.
America is home now, and Halcyon her future. Kuno comes to work most every day, dressed for business, to set and achieve measurable goals. You get the impression that more enterprises will soon bear the foundation’s name, more venturesome ideas will help other women on the path to entrepreneurship. She might even nurture another business, if the right idea attracts the Kuno touch. There are, after all, that vaccine company in Gaithersburg, the endowed chair in medical innovation at Johns Hopkins, and the all-female WE Capital venture investment group she founded, now 15 women and $15 million strong.
“When I came to the United States, I didn’t think that I could do much. Now I’m here in an optimistic way, in a positive way, to encourage younger people to challenge.”
Pause. She remembers the shyness, the intention to avoid interaction.
“Many people who have the tendency to be alone are searching for something by themselves. After that, they can talk to people.”
And tomorrow, if the season’s storms are quiet, Sachiko Kuno might let the adored Cherry lead her on another path, to ponder Halcyonic decisions yet to be made. ⦾

The Amazon.com Textbooks Store




	
Are you tired of paying a small fortune for your textbooks every year? Wouldn’t you rather buy cheap college textbooks and have more money to buy that great pair of skinny jeans, eat out more often instead of heating up a frozen pizza, or just have a little more spending money? When you come to Amazon.com, you can save money by buying cheap new and used textbooks and by renting textbooks for college. You can also trade your used textbooks for an Amazon Gift Card, whether you bought your books from us or not. By being a smart shopper and saving money on textbooks at Amazon.com, you’ll have more cash for the things in life that can’t be learned from a textbook.

The Amazon Textbooks Store allows you to shop online and buy all your textbooks without ever leaving the comfort of your couch. We offer a variety of new, used, rental, and eTextbooks. Don’t worry about selection, we’ve got your textbook needs covered for any subject from biology, chemistry, and nursing to accounting, arts, and engineering. Once you’re finished with your textbooks you can trade them in at Amazon.com and get up to 80% of their value in an Amazon Gift Card.   

Shop the Amazon Textbooks Store and save up to 90% on textbook rentals, up to 90% on used textbooks, and up to 50% on new textbooks. You can also enjoy Free Two-Day Shipping on millions of items, including cheap college textbooks, when you join Prime Student. Get your textbooks delivered to your door and save both time and money by shopping at Amazon.com. So go ahead and treat yourself to that designer purse or new video game, you can since you’ve saved so much on your textbooks.

Students may be eligible for a tax exemption on textbooks in some states. Learn More.
