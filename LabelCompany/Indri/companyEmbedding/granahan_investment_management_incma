SMALL CAP DISCOVERIES
 MORE >





Portfolio Manager: Gary C. Hatton, CFA
Inception: July 31, 2004


Market Cap: Typically <$700 mil at purchase
60-80 Holdings


Vehicle: Separate Account, $5 million minimum     LLC, $100,000 minimum                                                                                       Non-US Institutional Investors, UCITS



The Discoveries product has a focus on strong companies with market capitalizations under $700 million that exhibit, or have a catalyst for, accelerating earnings growth. The PM utilizes LifeCycle diversification as a risk mitigation tool, as the three LifeCycles have disparate performance drivers.



SMALL CAP FOCUSED GROWTH
 MORE >





Portfolio Manager: Andrew L. Beja, CFA
Inception: August 1, 2007


Market Cap: Typically $200 mil - $2 bil at purchase
±40 Holdings


Vehicle: Separate Account, $5 million minimum     Non-US Institutional Investors, UCITS



The Focused Growth strategy was created in 2007 by Mr. Beja who subsequently joined Granahan in 2011. The PM seeks companies that can sustain 15%+ growth over the foreseeable future, and are in his areas of expertise: technology services, internet, consumer, and business services.



SMALL CAP ADVANTAGE
MORE >





Portfolio Managers:  Gary C. Hatton, CFA;              Andrew L. Beja, CFA
 Inception: Sept 28, 2015


Market Cap: Typically $50 mil - $2 bil at purchase
±100 Holdings


Vehicle: Separate Account, $3 million minimum



The GIM Small Cap Advantage product is a distinct combination of two long standing individual strategies - Small Cap Focused Growth and Small Cap Discoveries - leveraging GIM's sleeve-managed system. The strength of the combination is that while both underlying GIM strategies have strong performance records, each emphasizes a  different area of the small cap market. The Focused Growth PM seeks sustainable growth companies, and the Discoveries PM looks for unrecognized growth in the smaller end of the market cap range.



SMID SELECT OPPORTUNITIES                                            MORE >




Portfolio Managers: David M. Rose, CFA
Inception: March 3, 2015


Market Cap: Typically $500 mil - $15 bil at purchase
±40 Holdings


Vehicle: Separate Account, $3 million minimum



The SMID Select strategy is a high conviction portfolio of stocks that represent a compelling combination of companies with exceptional long term growth opportunities and companies undergoing material fundamental business improvement leading to accelerated growth.  The PM, David Rose, joined GIM in early 2015, bringing with him a proven investment process and results that have earned recognition in the mutual fund and institutional communities.




SMALL CAP CORE GROWTH
MORE >





Portfolio Managers: Multi-managed/Sector Sleeves
Inception: April 30, 1993


Market Cap: Typically $200 mil - $1.5 bil at purchase
140-160 Holdings


Vehicle: Separate Account, $10 million minimum



The Core Growth portfolio is diversified across GIM’s portfolio managers, sectors, and LifeCycles (Pioneer, Core Growth, Special Situation). Each PM oversees a sector sleeve that represents his/her areas of core competency, allowing the client to benefit directly from each portfolio manager’s research expertise.




INTERNATIONAL SMALL CAP                                                  MORE >



Portfolio Manager: David L. Dineen, CFA
Inception: March 31 2010


Market Cap: Typically $100 mil - $5 bil at purchase
±65 Holdings


Vehicle: Separate Account, $3 million minimum, Commingled Fund



The GIM International Small Cap strategy invests primarily in the stocks of companies in EAFE-based countries, with up to 10% exposure to emerging markets equities. The PM, Mr. Dineen, joined GIM in 2015, and manages the portfolio with the same disciplined methodology that he used at his prior firm, a process recognized repeatedly for its performance across multiple categories and time periods.



GLOBAL SMALL CAP OPPORTUNITIES                                  MORE >




Portfolio Manager: David L. Dineen, CFA
Inception:May 31, 2016


Market Cap: Typically $300 mil - $5 bil at purchase
±65 Holdings


Vehicle: Separate Account, $1 million minimum, Commingled Fund



The GIM Global Small Cap strategy invests primarily in the stocks of companies from developed countries, with up to 10% exposure to emerging markets equities.  The PM, Mr. Dineen, joined GIM in 2015, and manages the portfolio with the same disciplined methodology that he has developed and honed over his 20 years of managing global, international and emerging markets portfolios.  Mr. Dineen leverages the research expertise of GIM's US small cap specialists.

Approach









Granahan Investment Management (“GIM”) employs in-depth fundamental, bottom‑up research to invest in stocks of companies that we believe exhibit a critical combination of superior growth prospects and an attractive risk/reward profile. GIM believes that over a 3- to 5-year period, growth in business value drives stock prices, but over shorter time periods, market sentiment can have an equally vital impact.

Consensus Ratings for Lawson Products (NASDAQ:LAWS) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 3.00)Consensus Price Target: $25.00 (24.69% upside)
