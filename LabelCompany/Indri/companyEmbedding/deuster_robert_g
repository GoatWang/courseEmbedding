A. Clinton Allen
Chairman of the Board





	Mr. A. Clinton Allen has been Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of A.C. Allen & Company, a consulting firm, since 1987.  He has been a director of the Company since 2001 and Chairman of the Board of Directors since December of 2002.  Mr. Allen serves as a director and Lead Director of LKQ Corporation, a supplier of recycled OEM automotive parts.  He is also a director of Brooks Automation, which provides integrated tool and factory automation solutions for the global semiconductor and related industries.  Mr. Allen served as a director of Steinway Musical Instruments Company, a publicly traded manufacturer of pianos and other musical instruments, from 1999 and served as its Lead Director from 2003 until his retirement from that board of directors in May 2011.  Mr. Allen provided the original financing for Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation, was one of its founding directors and served on its board until that company was acquired by Viacom/Paramount in September 1994.  Mr. Allen holds an Executive Masters Professional Director Certification from the American College of Corporate Directors, a public company director education and credentialing organization.  The Company believes that Mr. Allen's financial and business expertise, combined with his experience as an executive and director of other companies, both public and private, as well as his years of experience providing strategic advisory services, qualifies him to serve as the non-executive Chairman of our Board of Directors and as a member of the Board.
