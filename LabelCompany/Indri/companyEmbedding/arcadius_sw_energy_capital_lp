Strategy | Arcadius Capital



























 













Arcadius Homepage







						Arcadius provides growth capital to start-ups and early stage companies looking to create long-term value through the successful implementation of a lower risk ‘buy-and-build’ oriented business plan within a geographically focused niche. Arcadius follows a disciplined value-focused investment strategy designed to capitalize on the unique characteristics of the upstream oil and gas industry, the complementary expertise of the Arcadius team, and the operating ability and regional insights of our portfolio company management teams.
					


Asset-Based Business Strategies
Arcadius invests in regionally-focused small companies with lower-risk asset-based business strategies, including business plans focused on acquisitions, exploitation and development, area consolidation and buyouts. Arcadius partners with top quality management teams with focused regional expertise to drive improved operating performance and identify value enhancing capital investment projects to deliver profitable growth.


Lower Middle Market Focus
Arcadius believes that by focusing on small scale acquisition, exploitation and development opportunities, portfolio companies can capitalize on the more compelling valuations and greater potential for proprietary sourced deals available within the sub-$50 million transaction market. After portfolio companies have established more competitively-scaled, regionally-concentrated asset positions, those companies should benefit from improved exit prospects. Further, this asset-based strategy provides for the opportunistic use of financial leverage and commodity hedging to enhance and protect returns.
