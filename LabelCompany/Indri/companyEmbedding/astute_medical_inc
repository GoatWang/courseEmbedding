Astute Medical, Inc. Key Developments

Astute Medical, Inc.' Biomarkers Accurately Predict Acute Kidney Injury Risk in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure Patients
Mar 15 17
Astute Medical, Inc. announced that newly published findings show the NephroCheck Test could help clinicians identify risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with a sudden worsening of heart failure symptoms, a condition known as acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). The study published in Clinical Cardiology, is the first to investigate the risk assessment capabilities of TIMP-2 and IGFBP7, the urinary biomarkers measured by the test, in Emergency Department (ED) patients with ADHF. The study 'Urinary [TIMP-2] x [IGFBP7] for Risk Prediction of Acute Kidney Injury in Decompensated Heart Failure' conducted at Robert Bosch Hospital in Stuttgart, Germany, enrolled patients during initial workup in the ED. The investigators found that [TIMP-2] x [IGFBP7] measurements identified ADHF patients at risk of developing moderate to severe (stage 2-3) AKI for samples collected within 24 hours of enrollment. The authors also reported an area under the curve (AUC), an estimate of test accuracy, of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.72-0.93), a sensitivity of 86% at a 0.3 cutoff and specificity of 95% at the 2.0 cutoff for prediction of AKI stage 2–3. The NephroCheck Test System is intended to be used in conjunction with clinical evaluation in patients who currently have or have had within the past 24 hours acute cardiovascular and or respiratory compromise and are intensive care unit (ICU) patients as an aid in the risk assessment for moderate or severe AKI within 12 hours of patient assessment. The NephroCheck Test System is intended to be used in patients 21 years of age or older.


Ortho Clinical Diagnostics Announces Expansion of Global Agreement with Astute Medical for NephroCheck Test
Mar 13 17
Ortho Clinical Diagnostics announced that it has expanded its agreement with Astute Medical, Inc. for distribution of the NephroCheck Test, a biomarker-based test that aids in risk assessment for acute kidney injury. Under the new agreement, Astute Medical has granted Ortho distribution rights in additional European countries, enhancing customer access to a test that is changing the way hospital physicians approach acute kidney injury (AKI), a common and dangerous complication.


Astute Medical, Inc. Highlights Study of NephroCheck Test Biomarkers in Patients with Sepsis
Oct 21 15
Astute Medical, Inc. highlighted an oral presentation to be delivered at the CHEST Annual Meeting in Montreal on October 28, 2015 at 2:45 p.m. Eastern. The presentation describes a study of two urinary cell cycle arrest biomarkers, TIMP-2 and IGFBP-7, that were used to assess patients with sepsis for risk of moderate to severe acute kidney injury (AKI), a precursor to kidney failure. Astute's test was used in the study. Sepsis is the most common condition associated with acute kidney failure in the intensive care unit and the combination is deadly. AKI has been shown to nearly double the mortality rate in sepsis cases. The abstract "Urinary Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2 and Insulin-like Growth Factor-Binding Protein 7 ([TIMP-2]x[IGFBP7]) Accurately Risk Stratify Acute Kidney Injury in Patients with Sepsis" will be presented by Dr. H. Bryant Nguyen, M.D., M.S., vice-chair for research, Department of Medicine, Loma Linda University School of Medicine. The NephroCheck® Test is designed to detect the two urinary biomarkers featured in the presentation, TIMP-2 and IGFBP-7. Both biomarkers are involved in a wide array of responses to tissue insult (inflammation, oxidative stress, ultra-violet radiation, drugs and toxins) and are thought to be involved in G1 cell-cycle arrest during the earliest phases of injury to the kidney. With results in just 20 minutes, the NephroCheck® Test helps healthcare professionals evaluate intensive care patients' risk of moderate to severe acute kidney injury in the next 12 hours. The test was created for use alongside clinical evaluation of intensive care patients over 21 who have or have had acute cardiovascular and/or respiratory compromise in the past 24 hours. Once at-risk patients have been identified and their risk stratified, healthcare professionals can implement kidney-sparing strategies to potentially temper the severe consequences associated with AKI.
