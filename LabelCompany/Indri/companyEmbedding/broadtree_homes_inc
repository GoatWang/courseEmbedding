About Us | HiLine Homes



































Home »  About Us








About Us
Our History
In late 1963, William Sundby began building homes in rural North Dakota. He would complete each home himself, starting with the foundation and finishing with the last stroke of paint. William moved his family to the great northwest and realized a need for quality homes built at an affordable price. He founded HiLine Homes and now attributes its success to the combined talents and experience of his staff. This family owned business has become the leading edge in custom-built, new home construction.
HiLine Homes Today
HiLine Homes has a highly experienced team along with an advanced computerized construction scheduling system that offers custom home building services to make your project as efficient as possible. From your first HiLine Homes design center and model home visit to when you get the keys to your new home, our financial specialists, home consultants, pre-construction and project managers are there to answer any questions you may have.
HiLine Homes now has many design centers and model homes located throughout the Pacific Northwest. We invite you to walk through and experience for yourself the fine quality, features and benefits before you build. Find a model home nearest you!

LET HILINE BUILD A DREAM HOME FOR YOU
HiLine Homes will build a home that ensures you pride and satisfaction. Whether you own rural acreage, a neighborhood lot or need to replace a mobile home, HiLine guarantees that each phase of new home construction is built to the highest of standards and with the finest of building materials. HiLine Homes builds custom homes on your property from the ground up. It’s an efficient construction process that has been refined over the years to create thousands of new homes for people living in Washington and Oregon. A family owned-business with nearly 20 years of service to the housing industry, HiLine Homes understands the unique needs of each and every home buyer.
Buying A New Home – Buying a new home is one of the biggest financial decisions a person will make in his or her lifetime, so it’s important to meet with a mortgage lender to find out how much house you can afford.  HiLine’s lending consultants can help guide you through the entire lending process and provide you with expert advice to the most common banking and lending questions.
Pre-Construction – After your home is ordered, HiLine’s pre-construction experts will keep you informed about every detail regarding the preparation for construction of your new home. Home consultants can answer any additional questions you might have regarding construction permits, land evaluation, septic design, excavation, site preparation, water systems, electrical, ditching and landscaping ideas. HiLine Homes does it all so you don’t have to!
Construction – Once your land is prepared, HiLine’s construction managers will meet on site for the final review of your floor plan and home package. Together, you will review the blue prints, utility locations and foundation cut-out. You will also have the opportunity to finalize your selection of flooring, windows, doors, interior finish, cabinetry, countertops, exterior finish, roofing and trim.
When it comes to new home construction, outstanding value and customer satisfaction, HiLine’s custom home building services offer each home buyer personalized service. Now, let HiLine Homes build a dream home for you — on your lot, on time and built right!

Hiring a contractor in San Francisco



Who to hire?
Contractors in San Francisco are licensed by the California State License Board (CSLB), which regulates general contractors and 45 specialty classes (e.g. plumbing, electrical, etc.). When you click on a contractor to access their full profile, you should check their license type to verify that they are appropriate for your specific project.



How much should it cost?
Rates in San Francisco tend to be about 25% higher than the rest of the US. There are a lot of factors that can influence the cost for your project. We recommend using our bidding system to make sure you get a competitive quote. You can also browse our San Francisco project map to get a sense for cost in your neighborhood.



How can you protect yourself?
Hiring a contractor who holds an active license with the CSLB ensures they have several years of verified experience in their field and have passed an examination administered by the state. Licensed contractors are also subject to a criminal background check and hold an active bond to protect you in case their work is defective.

How do I know if the floor plan I want is available?



After you submit your application, you will be contacted by the property manager at the communities of your choice. Each property manager can give you specific information about the floor plans available at their community.





Do I use the Guest Login or Resident Login?

Broadtree Seeks Property Acquisitions
Nov 10 16
Broadtree Homes, Inc. seeks residential property acquisitions via outright purchase for cash and/or through UPREIT transactions. UPREIT transactions, (where "UPREIT" stands for Umbrella Partnership REIT), provide a tax deferred exit strategy for owners of real estate who might otherwise recognize a significant taxable gain in a cash sale of a highly appreciated property with a low tax basis. These transactions enable the property owner to exchange owned real estate for an interest in a professionally managed portfolio that is diversified by geography and property type.Broadtree, which is externally managed by Broadstone, remains open for investment by accredited investors only, with a minimum initial investment of $0.1 million.


Broadtree Homes Acquires Portfolio of 37 Atlanta-Area Single Family Rental Homes

The company, which focuses on acquiring portfolios of stabilized single family homes, multifamily apartment communities, student housing, and other types of residential rental property, purchased the 37-unit portfolio from American Homes 4 Rent. The homes, which average 1,440 square feet, were acquired for an average purchase price of approximately $70,000, or just under $49 per square foot. As of closing, the portfolio was over 97% occupied.


Broadtree Homes Seeks Acquisitions
Jul 22 16
Broadtree Homes, Inc. is looking for acquisition opportunities. Broadtree now has a robust acquisition pipeline of multifamily apartments, single family rental homes, and other residential property types, and we look forward to announcing these additional acquisitions throughout the second half of 2016.

Posted on July 10, 2014 by Chris Brodhead 


– Consolidation of Single-Family Home Rentals Reflects New Phase in the Industry –
ROCHESTER, N.Y. – Broadtree Homes (Broadtree), a private real estate investment company managed by Broadstone Real Estate, LLC, has acquired 127 single-family rental homes from The Dominion Group for a total purchase price of approximately $10 million. The transaction closed on Tuesday, June 24. Broadtree plans to acquire up to an additional 50 homes under the current contract, bringing the total acquisition price to $14 million. The purchase will strengthen Broadtree’s holdings and establish a meaningful and well-defined portfolio of rented homes in the recovering and robust Atlanta, Ga. market.
The Dominion Group, headquartered in Baltimore, Md., will invest a significant amount of the sale proceeds into shares of Broadtree Homes, and will continue to partner with the company to manage the Atlanta portfolio and provide additional homes for possible future Broadtree acquisition. The deal structure aligns incentives between the local operating platform of Dominion and the institutional oversight and capital markets expertise of Broadtree.

“We are delighted to have found a partner with a long term track record and approach to this business – one that fits with our company’s culture and outlook on the single family industry,” said Broadstone Real Estate CEO, Amy Tait. “We believe that our strategy of consolidating portfolios of renovated and leased homes is the model for the future of the industry.”
“It’s a great portfolio,” said Fred Lewis, principal and founder of the Dominion Group. “We hand-picked each property and renovated them with a long term view to ownership. We’re excited to provide on-going property management services and like the fact that we will participate in the future performance of the portfolio as shareholders in Broadtree Homes.”
With more than 14 million single-family home rentals in the U.S and only 250,000 (less than 1.8%) currently owned by institutional investment companies1, the market is ripe for deliberate consolidation. The single-family home rental market is poised to grow, considering the current state of housing:

The homeownership rate has dropped every year for the last nine years2
Since 2006, there has been a net loss of 1.75 million homeowner households2
During the same period, there has been a net gain of 5.77 million renter households2
Single-family rental homes now serve over 12% of the households in the U.S.3

The principals at Broadstone Real Estate established Broadtree Homes to take advantage of the opportunities in this evolving sector. The consolidation and institutionalization of the single family rental industry in many ways mirrors how the multifamily apartment sector evolved over the past three decades, where company founders, Amy Tait and Norman Leenhouts, participated in the founding and leadership of Home Properties, (NYSE: HME), an apartment REIT that went public in 1994*.
“As the homeownership rate in the U.S. continues to drop back to more sustainable levels, we believe that families will increasingly continue to turn to single-family home rentals to provide them the opportunity to live in quality suburban homes, without the financial concerns and limitations of homeownership,” Tait said. “Our goal is to address that demand and create an institutional-quality investment class, providing an exciting new opportunity for long-term real estate investors. We are pleased to participate as leaders in the consolidation phase of single-family home rentals.”

Summary

The President of Broadtree Home Rentals will lead an emerging organization that currently acquires and manages single family homes for rental and is expanding its scope to include additional forms of residential rental housing.  Headquartered in Rochester, New York, the company presently manages over 300 single family homes in four states, with the expectation that the operations will continue to expand into several additional Eastern and Central US states and that Broadtree will become a diversified residential fund including both multifamily apartment and single family rental homes. Further diversification could be achieved over time with the potential consideration of other residential asset classes. Broadtree Home Rentals is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Broadstone Real Estate, an established real estate investment and management company that also operates 270 commercial properties in 32 states and was founded by the same family that had previously formed Home Properties, Inc.* Broadstone Real Estate (including Broadtree Home Rentals) serves as the external manager for Broadtree Homes, a private equity residential fund REIT.

The ideal candidate will bring experience and expertise in acquiring, renovating, leasing and managing single family home and/or multifamily apartment rentals on a scalable basis.  He or she will have the entrepreneurial drive to lead a team and build an operating platform that can support a portfolio of thousands of homes/units, with policies and procedures that can provide information to satisfy the needs of institutional and/or public company investors.  A significant portion of the position’s compensation will be based on successful implementation of an aggressive growth plan.

This person will have excellent communication skills and solid financial and analytical skills, with a Master’s in Business Administration being a strong plus.  He or she must be exceedingly well organized, flexible and able to work well with external investors and independent board members, as well as with all levels of internal management and staff, including regional teams that are geographically dispersed. The president role is based in Rochester, NY and the individual must be able to travel without significant notice. This position reports to the Chief Executive Officer of Broadstone Real Estate.  This is an exciting opportunity for an entrepreneurial executive to play a lead role in growing an organization, with access to the resources and reputation of a successful parent company.

This position must be based in Rochester, NY.

About Us | HiLine Homes



































Home »  About Us








About Us
Our History
In late 1963, William Sundby began building homes in rural North Dakota. He would complete each home himself, starting with the foundation and finishing with the last stroke of paint. William moved his family to the great northwest and realized a need for quality homes built at an affordable price. He founded HiLine Homes and now attributes its success to the combined talents and experience of his staff. This family owned business has become the leading edge in custom-built, new home construction.
HiLine Homes Today
HiLine Homes has a highly experienced team along with an advanced computerized construction scheduling system that offers custom home building services to make your project as efficient as possible. From your first HiLine Homes design center and model home visit to when you get the keys to your new home, our financial specialists, home consultants, pre-construction and project managers are there to answer any questions you may have.
HiLine Homes now has many design centers and model homes located throughout the Pacific Northwest. We invite you to walk through and experience for yourself the fine quality, features and benefits before you build. Find a model home nearest you!

LET HILINE BUILD A DREAM HOME FOR YOU
HiLine Homes will build a home that ensures you pride and satisfaction. Whether you own rural acreage, a neighborhood lot or need to replace a mobile home, HiLine guarantees that each phase of new home construction is built to the highest of standards and with the finest of building materials. HiLine Homes builds custom homes on your property from the ground up. It’s an efficient construction process that has been refined over the years to create thousands of new homes for people living in Washington and Oregon. A family owned-business with nearly 20 years of service to the housing industry, HiLine Homes understands the unique needs of each and every home buyer.
Buying A New Home – Buying a new home is one of the biggest financial decisions a person will make in his or her lifetime, so it’s important to meet with a mortgage lender to find out how much house you can afford.  HiLine’s lending consultants can help guide you through the entire lending process and provide you with expert advice to the most common banking and lending questions.
Pre-Construction – After your home is ordered, HiLine’s pre-construction experts will keep you informed about every detail regarding the preparation for construction of your new home. Home consultants can answer any additional questions you might have regarding construction permits, land evaluation, septic design, excavation, site preparation, water systems, electrical, ditching and landscaping ideas. HiLine Homes does it all so you don’t have to!
Construction – Once your land is prepared, HiLine’s construction managers will meet on site for the final review of your floor plan and home package. Together, you will review the blue prints, utility locations and foundation cut-out. You will also have the opportunity to finalize your selection of flooring, windows, doors, interior finish, cabinetry, countertops, exterior finish, roofing and trim.
When it comes to new home construction, outstanding value and customer satisfaction, HiLine’s custom home building services offer each home buyer personalized service. Now, let HiLine Homes build a dream home for you — on your lot, on time and built right!

Hiring a contractor in San Francisco



Who to hire?
Contractors in San Francisco are licensed by the California State License Board (CSLB), which regulates general contractors and 45 specialty classes (e.g. plumbing, electrical, etc.). When you click on a contractor to access their full profile, you should check their license type to verify that they are appropriate for your specific project.



How much should it cost?
Rates in San Francisco tend to be about 25% higher than the rest of the US. There are a lot of factors that can influence the cost for your project. We recommend using our bidding system to make sure you get a competitive quote. You can also browse our San Francisco project map to get a sense for cost in your neighborhood.



How can you protect yourself?
Hiring a contractor who holds an active license with the CSLB ensures they have several years of verified experience in their field and have passed an examination administered by the state. Licensed contractors are also subject to a criminal background check and hold an active bond to protect you in case their work is defective.
