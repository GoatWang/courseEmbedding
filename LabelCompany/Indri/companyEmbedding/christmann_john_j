JOHN J. CHRISTMANN IV, 51, was appointed the company’s chief executive officer and president, and joined the company’s board of directors effective Jan.  20, 2015.
Christmann previously served as the company’s executive vice president and chief operating officer, North America, since January 2014. From January 2010 through December 2013, he served as region vice president, Permian Region. From January 2004 through December 2009, he served as vice president, Business Development, and from April through December 2003, he served as production manager for the Gulf Coast Region. Prior to that, Mr. Christmann held various positions of increasing responsibility in the business development area since joining the company in 1997.
Previously, Christmann was employed by Vastar Resources/ARCO Oil and Gas Company in business development, crude oil marketing, and various production, operational and reservoir engineering assignments.
He received his bachelor’s degree in petroleum engineering from the Colorado School of Mines and Master of Business Administration from Southern Methodist University.
With over 29 years in the oil and gas industry, including over 19 years at the company leading both operational and staff functions and most recently serving as chief executive officer, Christmann has the proficiency and depth to manage and operate a large-scale oil and gas exploration and production company.
Christmann’s extensive experience in the oil and gas industry has provided him with an in-depth understanding of successful execution and operational management in the field, an appreciation and talent for value-added merger and acquisition activity, and the expertise to oversee the strategic direction of a large, publicly-traded company.
His experience, coupled with his thorough knowledge and understanding of the company’s assets and unique operations, complement Christmann’s management strengths and enable him to lead the company through the complexities of day-to-day operations as well as the macro economic impact of commodity prices.

NGI's Shale Daily






	Apache Corp. Chairman and CEO G. Steven Farris, 66, who has been with the company since 1988, retired effective Tuesday. John J. Christmann IV, 48, COO of North America operations, has taken the helm.

	Farris has been CEO since 2002, chairman since 2009, and he re-assumed the title of president last February. From 1994-2009, Farris was president and COO. He also previously had been senior vice president (1991-1994) and vice president-exploration and production (1998-1991).

	Christmann was tapped as CEO and president. Farris would continue as nonexecutive chairman until May 1, after which he plans to retire from the board. Director John Lowe, 54, has been elected to succeed Farris as nonexecutive chairman.

	"It has been a privilege to lead one of the top independent oil and gas producers and work alongside some of the best professionals in the business," Farris said. "After more than 25 years with the company and 14 years as CEO, it is time to hand over the reins to a new generation of leaders. I look forward to working with John, the board and the management team over the next few months to ensure a smooth transition."

	Apache has been downsizing its operations for more than two years to improve its balance sheet. Through last June, Apache had announced or sold off almost $10 billion in assets (see Daily GPI, May 10, 2013). Leading shareholder Jana Partners LLC last summer added more pressure, urging the producer to downsize more by selling/spinning off the international and Canadian businesses to focus solely on the United States (see Daily GPI, July 22, 2014).

	Last fall, natural gas-heavy leaseholds were sold in South Louisiana and the Anadarko Basin (see Shale Daily, Nov. 20, 2014). In December, costly liquefied natural gas export businesses in British Columbia and Australia were sold (see Daily GPI, Dec. 15, 2014). With its repositioning, 70% of the production now is based in North America. It is one of the biggest operators in the Permian Basin, among other places.

	"We have a deeper inventory of North American opportunities than at any other time in our history, and I am confident the company is now well positioned to achieve its goal of becoming the premiere North American resource company," Farris said. "John is the ideal person to lead Apache going forward."

	Lead director Charles Pitman said the board has been working on CEO succession "for some time, and Steve has done an exceptional job grooming John Christmann and other future Apache leaders."

	Christmann has worked for Apache for 18 years. As the region vice president-Permian region from 2010 through 2013, he established Apache's Midland, TX, office and oversaw a doubling of production during his tenure. From 2004-2010, Christmann served as vice president-business development and helped execute more than $6 billion in acquisitions and divestments. Among other things, Christmann also was production manager for Gulf Coast region.

	Prior to joining Apache, Christmann was employed by Vastar Resources/Arco Oil and Gas Co. He earned his bachelor's degree in petroleum engineering from the Colorado School of Mines and his master's degree from Southern Methodist University.

	Lowe has served on the board since 2013. He previously spent more than 30 years with ConocoPhillips and predecessor firms, where he was, among other things, executive vice president, exploration and production. Lowe services on the board of Phillips 66 and Agrium Inc., and is a special executive adviser to Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.
