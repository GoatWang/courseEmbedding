Our Culture



 Welcome to EndologixWe are a fast-moving, high energy organization. This affords our employees exceptional growth opportunities and often employees describe Endologix as being a “talent accelerator.” Employees are offered development opportunities and new responsibilities that might have taken them significantly more time in other organizations. Accelerate Your CareerOur anticipated growth demands that we develop a strong bench of future leaders in our technical and management career paths. Our talent management systems are designed to encourage self-management for the employee’s career, with their manager acting as a coach and champion. With our global and multi-site locations, we encourage rotations to broaden skills and awareness. Our objective is for employees to grow their careers as we grow the business. Our commitment is to promise the development and refinement of skills.






















When I came to Endologix I was looking for an organization where I could make a large impact. I felt that finding a smaller organization would enable me to make impact and drive change. Endologix is a growing company, making it a place of constant change and innovation. I enjoy all of the new learning opportunities and challenges that I am presented with.”

– Christina, Quality Systems Manager












Endologix’s first value is “Put the patient first”. Who wouldn’t want to work for a company whose value is to help save a person’s life? The growth that Endologix has had and continues to have is tremendous.  With that growth comes opportunity. Opportunities that one would not have in other companies.”

– Elbert, Director of Therapy and Clinical Development












Endologix is at a fun stage in its life cycle. We are growing, changing, and continually seeking ways to improve. The Endologix team is great to work with – comprised of people from different backgrounds coming together to drive our future and  revolutionize aortic care for life. We are also very lucky to be led by our CEO, John McDermott, who has the right leadership style and values to shepherd us through growth.”

– Valerie, Sr. Director of Continuous Improvement












I started my career with Endologix as a Manufacturing Engineer for New Product Development and now I’m an Associate Product Manager. Endologix has exposed me to all corporate functions, as well as to the functional leaders. Leadership is accessible and open to conversations with all employees about their career goals.”

– Cole, Associate Product Manager












When I first joined Endologix, I was a Sales Contracts Administrator. I was given goals and objectives to meet. My manager showed a lot of confidence in me and allowed me the opportunity to bring my own expertise and creativity in meeting the objectives. He was also supportive in getting buy-in from upper management.”

– Mona, Sales Contract Supervisor












In my new role as a people manager, I am receiving Company-sponsored field research, leadership training and courses to support me as I lead a team of talented global product managers. We are excited to launch a totally new therapy. This Is exciting and humbling at the same time. By being on the forefront of innovation, Endologix is also responsible for ensuring positive clinical outcomes – a key goal driven by our commitment to putting the patient first.”

– Raja, Global Group Marketing Manager












I started in Quality Systems and transitioned over to Regulatory Affairs. I received support from both teams to provide a smooth transition. The camaraderie and teamwork in Regulatory Affairs is fantastic! They helped me feel right at home for which I am grateful! The growth potential of Endologix, and with it the opportunity to grow personally and professionally, is something I could not pass up. It’s exciting to work in a growing company with a bright future. This a unique opportunity we have to mold the future – let’s take full advantage of it!”

– Cynthia, Project Manager for International Regulatory












I started as a Customer Service Representative, then was promoted to a senior level. I was also provided with key projects to gain experience and visibility. After several successful meetings with management, I was able to demonstrate my strong work ethic, abilities and experience. I was subsequently offered the position of Sales Contracts Administrator. The process was collaborative in that my new supervisor and manager both worked diligently to ensure a smooth transition.”

– Tracy, Sales Contract Administrator

Our locations




























The Americas
It all started for Endologix in the Americas. Our global headquarters is located in Irvine, California, located about an hour south of Los Angeles. In Irvine, we develop, manufacture and market many of our products for global distribution. In Santa Rosa, California, our office includes Manufacturing and R&D, as well as a number of other corporate functions.  Santa Rosa is located in the beautiful Sonoma Wine Country, just about an hour from San Francisco. Also in the United States and Canada, our field sales and clinical specialist teams are involved in direct sales and support for our products.  North America remains our largest market and the vast majority of our employees work here.
More recently, we have begun expansion of our Latin American business. This region provides significant opportunity for the organization as we work with a strong selection of distributors and our own clinical employees. 





Europe
Our business in Europe covers most of the continent and we also have distributor relationships in the Middle East and Africa. Our European headquarters is located in Rosmalen, a picturesque Dutch town, located about an hour from Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport. Our headquarters operation in Rosmalen provides commercial support for our field Sales organizations. Endologix sells both directly and through distributors in the region. Europe is strategically critical to us as it represents a significant market opportunity and it is where most of our products begin their investigational phases.  





Asia Pacific
This region represents significant opportunity for Endologix and we have a growing presence in the region.  With our headquarters in Singapore, the region employs both direct sales and distributor relationships. In this region, we seek new team members that have the pioneering spirit of being part of fast growth and geographic expansion. 
Elbert Tzeng, who leads our therapy and clinical development for Asia Pacific, provided an insightful look into the culture of the Asia Pacific team. “Each of us has a title, but they are just that, titles. We are a team. A team that works together to accomplish our team goals and objectives. Whenever someone is in need of assistance, we are there to help because we know that we can only succeed as a team and not as individuals. So, it doesn't matter who a person reports to, when there is a need, everyone jumps in to help.”

AAA: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm











The aorta is the largest blood vessel in your body. It carries blood from the chest to the abdomen where it branches into the iliac arteries, which carry blood to the lower body and legs.
An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) occurs when the portion of the aorta passing through the abdomen bulges because of weakening of the vessel wall. An aneurysm means the walls of the artery have stretched and become thin causing the vessel to bulge or expand. This weakens the vessel wall and affects its ability to support normal blood flow. If an AAA bursts, it can cause internal bleeding–a serious and potentially life threatening condition.





ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURSYM
Prevalence & Rupture Risk
Prevalence in males is 5 times that of women, while rupture risk is greater for women than men.*


Prevalence1

WOMEN
1.1%


MEN
5.5%



Rupture Risk (unscreened)1

WOMEN
5.7%


MEN
1.9%








* 65 years and older
1 Wanhainen et al, Cost-effectiveness of screening women for abdominal aortic aneurysm. JVS 43:5; 2005





Symptoms
Some patients with AAA don’t have any
symptoms. Others might experience:




















SCREENING




The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force and the American Academy of Family Physicians recommend AAA screening for:






Men aged 65 to 75 y who have ever smoked*
Screen once for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) by ultrasonography.
Men aged 65 to 75 y who have never smoked
Selectively screen for AAA.
Women aged 65 to 75 y who have ever smoked*
Inconclusive. No recommendation.

* “Ever smoked” is defined as having smoked at least 100 cigarettes during a lifetime.




Risk Assessment: Risk factors for AAA include older age; a positive smoking history; having a first-degree relative with an AAA; and having a history of other vascular aneurysms, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, or hypertension.
Factors associated with a reduced risk for AAA include African American race, Hispanic ethnicity, and diabetes.
LeFevre ML.  Screening for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement. Ann Intern Med 2014; 161:281-290.
Keisler B, et. Al. Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm. Am Fam Physician 2015; 91:538-543.











Diagnosis





AAA may be detected during a routine physical when feeling your abdomen, with a chest x-ray or ultrasound. 





If your doctor suspects an AAA, you may need additional testing by:










ANGIOGRAM










CT SCAN
Computed Tomography Scan










MRI
Magnetic Resonance Imaging





These tests can show the location, shape, and size of your aneurysm.





Treatment
Regular Examinations with ultrasounds (if AAA is less than 5 cm) to monitor the condition
Abdominal Surgery (also called Open Repair) is performed under general anesthesia to access the aorta through an incision in your abdomen. The damaged section of the aorta is removed and a fabric tube called a graft is stitched in its place. The surgery usually takes 2-4 hours and requires a hospital stay of 5-7 days. Your recovery may take 3 months or longer.





Advantages


Standard treatment
Effective
Lasting results
Long-term follow up isn’t needed







Disadvantages


General anesthesia required
Major surgery, large incision
Higher complication rate than endovascular aneurysm repair
Longer hospital stay and recovery













Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) is a minimally invasive procedure that accesses the aorta through a small incision in your groin. Thin wires are inserted through the femoral arteries and act as a guide for a long, thin tube called a catheter. A stent is delivered through the catheter to the site of the aneurysm and expands to reinforce the damaged portion of the aorta. The wire and catheter will be removed, the doctor will confirm that the stent is in the proper position, and the incision will be closed with a few stitches or sutures. The stent will remain in place permanently. The procedure takes 1-3 hours to complete and requires a hospital stay of a few days.





Advantages


Minimally invasive procedure
Local anesthesia
Small incisions
Lower complication rate than surgery
Shorter hospital stay, recovery







Disadvantages


Higher potential for complications
Long-term follow up required
Possibility of additional procedures













Percutaneous Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (PEVAR) accesses your femoral artery through a small puncture in your groin area. Thin wires are inserted through the femoral arteries and act as a guide for a long, thin tube called a catheter. A stent is delivered through the catheter to the site of the aneurysm and expands to reinforce the damaged portion of the aorta. The wire and catheter will be removed. The doctor will confirm that the stent is in the proper position and pressure will be applied to the puncture site to control any bleeding. The stent will remain in place permanently. The procedure takes 1-3 hours to complete and requires a hospital stay of a few days.





Advantages


Minimally invasive procedure
Local anesthesia
Small punctures
Lower complication rate than surgery
Shorter hospital stay, recovery







Disadvantages


Higher potential for complications
Long-term follow up required
Possibility of additional procedures














Aftercare





ABDOMINAL SURGERY
Following abdominal surgery, you may need a ventilator to help with your breathing. Once you can breathe on your own, you will be asked to cough occasionally to keep fluid from collecting in your lungs. You will have a drainage tube in your stomach and will not be able to eat or drink until it is removed, usually a few days after the procedure. Gradually you will be able to get out of bed, walk, and return to eating solid foods. Recovery from abdominal surgical repair takes approximately 3 months and will require a follow up visit with your doctor.





Call your doctor if you experience any of the following:

Fever or chills
Redness, bleeding, drainage or swelling of your incision
Increased pain around the incision






EVAR OR PEVAR 
After an EVAR or PEVAR procedure, you will be given pain medication if needed and will be able to gradually get out of bed, walk, and eat solid foods. You may feel well enough to resume your normal activities in 4 to 6 weeks. Endovascular repair means you will need regular follow up visits with your doctor: a month afterward, at six months, and each year following your procedure. The visits will include a physical exam and an ultrasound, CT scan, or angiography to check for any changes.





Call your doctor if you experience any of the following:

Pain in the legs, back, chest or abdomen
Numbness in the legs, back, chest, or abdomen
Weakness in the legs, back, chest, or abdomen
Dizziness
Fainting
Rapid heartbeat
Sudden weakness
Discoloration or coolness in the leg

The Company's products are intended for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).

The EVAR products include the Endologix AFX Endovascular AAA System (AFX), the VELA Proximal Endograft (VELA) and the Endologix Powerlink with Intuitrak Delivery System (Intuitrak).
