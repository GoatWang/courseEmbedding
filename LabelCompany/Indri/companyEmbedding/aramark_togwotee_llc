Go
















Leave it all behind and get deep in the surroundings high above Jackson Hole, Wyoming at the Togwotee Mountain Lodge. Take in the awe-inspiring scenery – whether you’re snowmobiling through endless powder in the winter, or hiking across the wide-open glades just outside of Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks in the summer. From here, you can go anywhere.

Insight

                                    Alaska is the largest US state, spanning 586,000 square miles, encompassing stunning vistas, incredible wildlife and the opportunity to experience unforgettable adventures and rich cultural history. Knowing that guests want to get the most out of their Alaskan vacations and many have limited vacation time, we took action.
                                

See our innovation




Innovation

                                    We created Denali Park Village. This unique area gives visitors a one-of-a-kind look into the culture and history of an authentic Alaskan mining town. In addition to a main lodge, private cabins and two full-service restaurants, Denali Park Village offers a saloon and a full main street market with grab-and-go gourmet food and grocery items. Additionally, experiential and interactive activities like gem panning training and other native Alaskan activities are great for the entire family.
                                

See our impact




Impact

                                    Alaska is a bucket-list destination and a once-in-a-lifetime experience for many. By creating a self-contained environment where people can immerse themselves in the Alaskan culture, we offer a rare and impactful opportunity for many. The result is a destination unlike any other and an experience our customers will never forget. This is just one of the ways we innovate the everyday.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
