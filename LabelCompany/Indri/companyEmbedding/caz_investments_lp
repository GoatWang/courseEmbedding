Access ToInnovative Investing

Investing is art mixed with science, and we pride ourselves on our ability to identify unique investment themes that have outstanding reward to risk profiles. Once we have decided to invest in a theme, we ascertain the right vehicle with which to execute on that theme. We invest our firm’s capital, the capital of our principals and shareholders and then provide the opportunity for our clients to co-invest with us. This unique investing model allows us to create access for our investors to vehicles that they would not normally hear about and/or be permitted to participate in on their own.  Our firm, our principals and our shareholders have committed more than $150 million to our investment vehicles. This unusual alignment of interests creates an environment that allows us to focus exclusively on finding the best investment opportunities. We profit when our clients profit.

Investment Advisors











CAZ Investments partners with Investment Advisors to provide them with access to investment themes and opportunities that are generally unavailable to the vast majority of investors. We also can provide access to ideas and opportunities that may supplement the work that is done by the internal research team. There are simply too many potential investment vehicles for the staff of a traditional investment advisor to possibly evaluate thoroughly. CAZ can serve in an adjunct research role for the advisors that we work with and then provide the ability for the advisor, or the advisor’s clients, to co-invest with us in the vehicles that we choose to invest our own capital.
Our typical investment advisor partner is usually a qualified purchaser themselves and works with a large number of qualified purchaser clients. They usually have an entrepreneur mindset where they understand risk vs. reward and are very comfortable investing in multiple asset classes in order to maximize the opportunities available to them and/or their clients.
Our relationship managers are very comfortable working with many types of Investment Advisors. We will do everything we can to provide massive value to those we work with via the service that we deliver as well as the way we provide Access to Innovative Investing.

Family Offices











CAZ Investments co-invests with Family Offices to provide them with access to investment themes and opportunities that are generally unavailable to the vast majority of investors. We also can provide access to ideas and opportunities that may supplement the work that is done by the internal research team. There are simply too many potential investment vehicles for the staff of a traditional family office to possibly evaluate thoroughly. CAZ can serve in an adjunct research role for the families that we work with and then provide the ability for the family to co-invest with us in the vehicles that we choose to invest our own capital.
Our typical family office client has a net worth greater than $100 million. They usually have an entrepreneur mindset where they understand risk vs. reward and are very comfortable investing in multiple asset classes in order to maximize the opportunities available to them. Some of the families have large internal investment staffs and others have very small staffs.
Our relationship managers are very comfortable working with many types of family offices. We will do everything we can to provide massive value to those we work with via the service that we deliver as well as the way we provide Access to Innovative Investing.

That’s $12.50/year on a $5,000 accountQuestions? Here to helpWe’ll be there every step of the way. Need more info? Visit our FAQs. What is the price?We charge a monthly fee of $1, with no commissions or surprises. All new investors get their first month free. Once your account reaches $5,000, we switch to 0.25% of your account per year.* (that’s $12.50 a year for a $5,000 portfolio)  How does Stash work?Stash is an SEC registered investment adviser. When you sign up for a Stash account you get access to over 30 different investment options and personalized guidance. To make an investment, you’ll need to connect a checking account. All it takes is $5 to make your first investment. We let you buy fractional shares so you can invest what you can afford. That’s it – sign up, customize your portfolio, and boom, you’re an investor. Learn more about Stash. Why should I start investing now?The sooner you start investing, the greater your chance of benefiting from compound returns. It’s the reason you might not want to put off investing any longer, because it takes time to experience the effect. Here’s why... Let's say you invested $20 a week. After 20 years, your $20,800 investment would be worth over $34,000. (Assuming a 5% compound annual return)Why do you need my Social Security number?The Patriot Act requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person opening an account. We also require your Social Security number to issue you a tax reporting form at the end of the year. Your Social Security number is only used to verify your identity. Stash does not perform a credit check.Is the money invested in my Stash Account protected?Your investments with Stash are protected by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). All holdings and cash are held at APEX Clearing Corp. For more information on SIPC insurance, please visit www.sipc.org.

Small Business and Self-Employed Retirement Plans




Solo 401(k)
A 401(k) plan designed especially for businesses without employees.
 
A Solo 401(k), also commonly referred to as an Individual 401(k), is for self-employed individuals without full-time employees. By allowing you to contribute as both the employer and the employee, this plan enables you (and your spouse) to boost your retirement savings with higher contribution limits.

SEP IRA
A 100% employer-funded retirement plan for businesses with or without employees.
 
A Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRA is a plan completely funded by the employer. This plan benefits both the employer and employees, with tax-deductible contributions for the employer and tax-deferred growth for the employees. Flexibility over contributions makes it a good choice for businesses with varying profits.
 
Learn More


SIMPLE IRA
A matching plan for businesses with employees that is funded by both employer and employee contributions.
 
A Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) allows both the employer and employee to contribute to employee retirement accounts, with tax benefits for employer contributions and the ability for employees to make pretax contributions. This plan is intended for businesses with steady profits.
 
Learn More
 


Profit-Sharing
An incentive-based contribution plan.
 
Profit-sharing plans reward employees with a percentage of company profits. Employer contributions are discretionary and provide tax benefits for both the employer and employee.
