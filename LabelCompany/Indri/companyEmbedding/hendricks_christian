Publisher's Description▼▲
For every person who draws strength and direction from the Bible, there are many more who struggle with it. Some call it a long book with fine print and obscure meaning. Some call it a mystery, a chore to read, or an undecipherable puzzle.The good news is you can easily solve this problem. With over 300,000 sold, this revised and expanded edition of Living by the Book will remove the barriers that keep Scripture from transforming your life. In a simple, step-by-step fashion, the authors explain how to glean truth from Scripture. It is practical, readable, and applicable. By following its easy-to-apply principles, you'll soon find yourself drawing great nourishment from the Wordand enjoying the process! The Living by the Book Workbook is the perfect compliment to provide practical application of lessons.

            This book really opens you up to a whole new level of understanding of how to read the Bible. I have been a minister for 23 years, read many books, taken a class about how to interpret the Bible, by far this is most readable and understandable book I have ever read. Definitely worth the money and time to read!

            This book was life-changing for me. I could finally study Scripture for myself. I now use it as a teaching tool. The organization is a little unwieldy. I found it necessary to write a flow-sheet to remind myself of the different things I was looking for in a text. It works hard at sticking with principles of hermeneutics. If I had the opportunity, I would probably give it 4.5 stars, but it a book that is well worth having and using.

A down-home Christmas from the Appalachian Mountains featuring Jim Hendricks
Jim Hendricks is a multi-instrumentalist who plays guitar, mandolin, dobro and autoharp. His career has spanned over four decades of American Music.Â  He was a pioneer on the 1960's folk circuit, performing with such artists as "Mama" Cass Elliot and John Sebastian. He wrote the number one hit "Summer Rain" for Johnny Rivers and the theme song "Long Lonesome Highway" for the TV show "Then Came Bronson".
Now living in Nashville, Tennessee, Jim has recorded over fifty albums of traditional American folk, mountain, gospel, and western music. The warmth and spirit of Jim's music touches our hearts and memories, and adds to the legacy of America's music and the legacy of a true American folk artist... Jim Hendricks.
