That experience taught me many things, not the least of which were managing expectations, and resilience.PublicationsBeyond Breach: Challenges in Cybersecurity & CoverageBig Data Tech Law BlogAuthors: David L. Cox, Jon NeiditzRansomware Cuts Deep, in Life & in CoverageBig Data Tech Law BlogApril 2016Authors: David L. Cox, Jon NeiditzOpen Mouth, Insert Foot!:  Social Media Liability and Insurance in a Cyber WorldLexis/Nexis New Applemans Current Critical Issues in Insurance LawApril 2016Most recent attention on cyber-risks has focused on high-profile data breaches.  All companies need to consider such risks, of course.  However, for some companies, there are also substantial risks associated with social media and content generation on the web.   This article focuses on “content liability” arising out of a company’s website or from social media.  Content liability is a catch-all name for the various risks that are associated with content published by an organization, its employees, or that is perceived to be sanctioned by the organization.  Companies today are expected to have an internet presence, and that presence creates exposure to any number of claims. Companies that conduct business online, and that market or brand themselves through social media, potentially could be liable for a number of content-related liability claims.  Companies may even be liable for non-sponsored social media postings of their employees under certain circumstances.Authors: David L. CoxShouldn’t Cyber-Insurance Cover Negligence?ABA Insurance Coverage Litigation Committee NewsletterSeptember 2015Companies’ own negligence often contributes to data breach losses. For example, data breaches may be caused by an “oops,” negligent employee conduct, which includes failure to follow company policies and procedures, failure to maintain reasonable expertise in company software, website, and related applications, failure to maintain awareness of current threats to the company, and general carelessness in maintaining a secure work environment. Another cause is the “ghost in the machine,” system glitches, which include inherent design flaw in security software, processing error, imperfect software updates or patches, application failures, and inadvertent data dumps. According to a recent survey of United States companies, over half of commercial data breaches can be attributed to various types of human error by company employees.  The Ponemon Institute’s 2015 Cost of Data Breach Study reports that 53% of the time, the root cause for the data breaches in its study were negligent in nature — either “system glitch” or “human error” as opposed to “malicious or criminal attack.”  Policyholders should be aware, however, that a number of cyber insurance forms contain certain exclusions that, if interpreted broadly, could operate to significantly limit or eliminate altogether coverage for losses created by the “oops” or the “ghost in the machine.” Authors: David L.

Below is an overview of those steps, and affected businesses can contact any of the listed Kilpatrick Townsend Insurance Recovery professionals for further guidance.Authors: David L.

Increasingly, having cyber-insurance in place is becoming a regulatory requirement for financial institutions.  But how to evaluate the coverage required …Authors: David L. Cox, Erica DominitzChapter 151, RESPONDING TO LITIGATIONNew Appleman on Insurance Law Library Edition, Volume 12 – Litigation, Arbitration and SettlementDecember 2014Chapter in authoritative insurance coverage publication that focuses on the procedural and strategic considerations of the party that has been sued as it responds to litigation. These considerations are not necessarily driven by the procedural law of what a party can do in responding to litigation. Rather, these considerations may be based on prudential, financial, or other strategic concerns. Authors: Helen Michael, David L.

The decision should also prompt in-house counsel to consider the interplay between a company’s indemnification obligations and its D&O insurance coverage. Authors: David L. Cox, Clay C. WheelerFDIC Re-asserts Prohibition Against Banks Buying Civil Money Penalties InsuranceLegal AlertsOctober 2013Authors: David L. CoxLiability Insurers Must Timely Disclaim Coverage Even While Investigating ClaimGlobal Insurance Recovery BlogJuly 2013Authors: David L. CoxLegal Alert - Property Insurance and Severe WeatherKilpatrick Townsend & Stockton Insurance Recovery TeamNovember 2012As the Northeast continues to recover from Hurricane Sandy, many businesses are assessing insurance coverage for claims related to expenses, property damage, or loss due to business interruption resulting from the storm. Property insurance policies typically cover a wide range of such expenses, damages, and loss. These coverages typically include expenses that a business incurs before severe weather strikes to minimize its weather-related loss or damage; weather-related property damage that the business nevertheless sustains; operational loss that the business sustains due to weather-related damage to either its property or the property of a customer or supplier; and expenses that the business incurs after severe weather strikes to mitigate such loss. This legal alert outlines some helpful pre- and post-loss steps for businesses facing storm damage. Regardless of where your business is in the recovery process and even if you were uneffected, it's useful information. If your business has sustained damage, Kilpatrick Townsend's Insurance Recovery team can quickly evaluate your situation, tell you how to proceed and help get your business on the road to recovery.

 Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry is the #1 bestseller for the introductory biochemistry course because it brings clarity and coherence to an often unwieldy discipline, offering a thoroughly updated survey of biochemistry’s enduring principles, definitive discoveries, and groundbreaking new advances with each edition. This new Seventh Edition maintains the qualities that have distinguished the text since Albert Lehninger’s original edition—clear writing, careful explanations of difficult concepts, helpful problem-solving support, and insightful communication of contemporary biochemistry’s core ideas, new techniques, and pivotal discoveries. Again, David Nelson and Michael Cox introduce students to an extraordinary amount of exciting new findings without an overwhelming amount of extra discussion or detail. And with this edition, W.H. Freeman and Sapling Learning have teamed up to provide the book’s richest, most completely integrated text/media learning experience yet, through an extraordinary new online resource: SaplingPlus.

For over 35 years, in edition after bestselling edition, Principles of Biochemistry has put those defining principles into practice, guiding students through a coherent introduction to the essentials of biochemistry without overwhelming them. The new edition brings this remarkable text into a new era. Like its predecessors, Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry, Sixth Edition strikes a careful balance of current science and enduring concepts, incorporating a tremendous amount of new findings, but only those that help illustrate biochemistrys foundational principles. With this edition, students will encounter new information emerging from high throughput DNA sequencing, x-ray crystallography, and the manipulation of genes and gene expression, and other techniques. In addition, students will see how contemporary biochemistry has shifted away from exploring metabolic pathways in isolation to focusing on interactions among pathways. They will also get an updated understanding of the relevance of biochemistry to the study of human disease (especially diabetes) as well as the important role of evolutionary theory in biochemical research. These extensive content changes, as well as new art and powerful new learning technologies make this edition of Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry the most impressive yet.Product IdentifiersISBN-101429234148ISBN-139781429234146Key DetailsAuthorDavid L.

A book is the nearest thing we have to telepathy, sending thoughts from the author's mind directly to the readers even over a gap of two thousand years. Even with all our technology, there is no better way to make a brain to brain connection than by simply reading a book. Go Way Back to the BeginningAntique books and manuscripts offer an amazing look into history, you can see the thoughts of the past as they saw them themselves. Antiquarian and collectible books don't just look good on the shelf, they also grow in value. There is nothing like picking up an old book to really feel the past. Explore the Human ConditionThe beauty of fiction and literature is that it lets you explore the human condition in a way that mere recitations of fact can never duplicate. Rather than focusing on the mundane, these books bring out the emotional truth of human experience. They show you who you really are by exposing you to other experiences you could never have discovered yourself. These books are the underpinnings of human culture. See how someone else sees the world. Discover the World Around YouNon fiction books offer the widest range of human experience, joined only by their commitment to the truth. From self-help to space travel, they run the gamut of human thought. Learn how to deal with your family, how to save money for that trip, or how the Egyptians built the pyramids. Follow famous lives, or study esoteric philosophies. It's all there for you to find. Non fiction gives us the foundations of human civilization, the story of how everything works. Keep Learning for LifeEducation is the gateway to success, and textbooks are your key to that door. From elementary readers to calculus texts, these books are the doors to our full potential. Textbooks not only give us facts, they give us the tools to interpret and make use of those facts. They are the key to organizing our thoughts and making our brains work for us. It's not just academia either, mechanics textbooks can help you learn how to fix your car.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsSee all in Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsBook Wholesale LotsOther Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsWholesale AudiobooksWholesale MagazinesBook AccessoriesSee all in Book AccessoriesAddress BooksBlank Diaries & JournalsBook CoversBook LightsBook PlatesBook Stands & HoldersBookendsBookmarksOther Book AccessoriesCatalogsSee all in CatalogsAgriculture CatalogsArt & Exhibitions CatalogsAuction CatalogsClothing & Fashion CatalogsDepartment Stores CatalogsMusic & Instruments CatalogsOther CatalogsOwner's Manuals CatalogsToys & Hobbies CatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksSee all in Children & Young Adult BooksChildren & YA Non-Fiction BooksChildren's Fiction BooksChildren's Picture BooksOther Children & Young Adult BooksYoung Adult Fiction BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksOther BooksTextbooks & Educational Books

One reason is simple, while the Internet may be everywhere, it's not always accurate, and when it comes to educating people you need to have accurate information. That's why approved textbooks are so important; they give you the facts, not the opinions of someone on the Internet.Help for the Home SchooledNo one needs textbooks more than the parent who home schools their children. There is a growing movement toward home schooling so that parents can focus their children's education on the aspects Engl are most important to them, and tailor the curriculum to their own child's individual learning styles. From science and mathematics to English and history, textbooks are a vital part of any education program.For Every Age LevelNo matter what age or grade level your student is at, there are education textbooks to cover their needs.  Even if they go to a regular grade school, there are supplementary textbooks you can pick up to help them if they need it. Not every book is the right fit for every student, and sometimes the one who is having the most trouble with math in school is the one who flourishes the most as soon as you expose them to a different textbook.Explore Adult EducationEducation isn't just for children; many adults have a need for textbooks too. From those who left school early and are now looking for textbooks so they can get their GED, to professionals looking to further their development, there's a huge demand for textbooks from people in all walks of life. It's not just academic textbooks. You can also get textbooks on practical subjects from financial management, to woodworking, and auto repair.Control Your College EducationCollege is more than just an investment in your future; it's an investment. One way to take charge of your college costs is to look outside your college bookstore for your textbooks. Many textbooks, especially in fields such as English and history do not change much from year to year, so grabbing last  year's engineering handbook may be the best way to go.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryBooksTextbooks & Educational BooksBook AccessoriesAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksCatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsOther BooksFormatsee allHardcoverMixed LotPaperbackNot SpecifiedPublication Yearsee all1900-19491950-19992000-20102011-NowSubjectsee allBusiness & EconomicsEducation, TeachingEngineeringHistoryMathMedicineScience & TechLanguagesee allConditionsee allBrand NewLike NewVery GoodGoodAcceptableNot SpecifiedPricePlease provide a valid price range$-$Buying Formatsee allAll ListingsAuctionBuy It NowItem Locationsee allDefaultWithindistance2 miles5 miles10 miles15 miles20 miles50 miles75 miles100 miles150 miles200 miles500 miles750 miles1000 miles1500 miles2000 milesofGoUS OnlyNorth AmericaWorldwideDelivery Optionssee allFree ShippingFree In-store PickupShow onlysee allReturns AcceptedCompleted ItemsSold ItemsDeals & SavingsMore refinements...

The concept of “induced fit” refers to the fact that:
enzyme specificity is induced by enzyme-substrate binding.
enzyme-substrate binding induces an increase in the reaction entropy, thereby catalyzing the reaction.
enzyme-substrate binding induces movement along the reaction coordinate to the transition state.
substrate binding may induce a conformational change in the enzyme, which then brings catalytic groups into proper orientation.

Page: 194 Difficulty: 1 Ans: B
The benefit of measuring the initial rate of a reaction V0 is that at the beginning of a reaction:
[ES] can be measured accurately.
changes in [S] are negligible, so [S] can be treated as a constant.
changes in Km are negligible, so Km can be treated as a constant.
V0 = Vmax.
varying [S] has no effect on V0.

Examples of enzymatic reactions
Page: 212 Difficulty: 2 Ans: B
Both water and glucose share an —OH that can serve as a substrate for a reaction with the terminal phosphate of ATP catalyzed by hexokinase.  Glucose, however, is about a million times more reactive as a substrate than water.  The best explanation is that:
glucose has more —OH groups per molecule than does water.
the larger glucose binds better to the enzyme; it induces a conformational change in hexokinase that brings active-site amino acids into position for catalysis.
the —OH group of water is attached to an inhibitory H atom, while the glucose —OH group is attached to C.
water and the second substrate, ATP, compete for the active site resulting in a competitive inhibition of the enzyme.
water normally will not reach the active site because it is hydrophobic.

The difference in (standard) free energy content, ΔG’°, between substrate S and product P may vary considerably among different reactions.  What is the significance of these differences?
Ans: The difference in free energy content between substrate (or reactant) and product for each reaction reflects the relative amounts of each compound present at equilibrium.  The greater the difference in free energy, the greater the difference in amounts of each compound at equilibrium.

Pages: 187−188 Difficulty: 2
Sometimes the difference in (standard) free-energy content, ΔG’°, between a substrate S and a product P is very large, yet the rate of chemical conversion, S → P, is quite slow. Why?
Ans: The rate of conversion from substrate to product (or the reverse reaction, from product to substrate) does not depend on the free-energy difference between them.  The rate of the reaction depends on the activation energy of the reaction ΔG’‡, which is the difference between the free-energy content of S (or P) and the reaction transition state.
How enzymes work
Page: 188 Difficulty: 2
Write an equilibrium expression for the reaction S → P and briefly explain the relationship between the value of the equilibrium constant and free energy.
Ans: Keq‘ = [P]/[S].  The value of Keq‘ reflects the difference between the free energy content of S and P.  Free energy and equilibrium constant are related by the expression:
ΔG’° = -RT ln Keq‘
For each change in Keq‘ by one order of magnitude, ΔG’° changes by 5.7 Kjoule/mole.

What is the difference between general acid-base catalysis and specific acid-base catalysis?  (Assume that the solvent is water.)
Ans: Specific acid-base catalysis refers to catalysis by the constituents of water; that is, the donation of a proton by the hydronium ion, H3O+ or the acceptance of a proton by the hydroxyl ion OH–.  General acid-base catalysis refers to the donation or acceptance of a proton by weak acids and bases other than water.

Pages: 194−195 Difficulty: 2
Michaelis-Menten kinetics is sometimes referred to as “saturation” kinetics.  Why?
Ans: According to the Michaelis-Menten model of enzyme-substrate interaction, when [S] becomes very high, an enzyme molecule’s active site will become occupied with a new substrate molecule as soon as it releases a product.  Therefore, at very high [S], V0 does not increase with additional substrate, and the enzyme is said to be “saturated” with substrate.

An enzyme can catalyze a reaction with either of two substrates, S1 or S2.  The Km for S1 was found to be 2.0 mM, and the Km, for S2 was found to be 20 mM.  A student determined that the Vmax was the same for the two substrates.  Unfortunately, he lost the page of his notebook and needed to know the value of Vmax.  He carried out two reactions: one with 0.1 mM S1, the other with 0.1 mM S2.  Unfortunately, he forgot to label which reaction tube contained which substrate. Determine the value of Vmax from the results he obtained:

Write out the equation that describes the mechanism for enzyme action used as a model by Michaelis and Menten.  List the important assumptions used by Michaelis and Menten to derive a rate equation for this reaction.
Ans: The two equations are
k1 k2
E + ES             E + P
k-1 k-2
One assumption is that [P] = 0 so that the rate of the reaction depends exclusively on the breakdown of ES and is not influenced by the reverse reaction; that is, k-2 can be ignored and V0 = k2 [ES].  This condition is possible only if early reaction times are measured; the velocity, therefore, is an initial velocity. A second assumption is that the rate of ES formation equals the rate of ES breakdown; in other words, the reaction is at a steady state.  A third assumption is [S] >> [Et], so that total [S], which equals free substrate and enzyme-bound substrate, is essentially equal to [S].

For the reaction E + S → ES → P the Michaelis-Menten constant, Km, is actually a summary of three terms.  What are they?  How is Km determined graphically?
Ans: Km = (k2 + k-1)/ k1, where k-1 and k1 are the rate constants for the breakdown and association,
respectively, of the ES complex and k2 is the rate constant for the breakdown of ES to form E + P. Km can be determined graphically on a plot of V0 vs. [S] by finding the [S] at which V0 = 1/2 Vmax. More conveniently, on a double-reciprocal plot, the x-axis intercept = –1/ Km.

Pages: 196−198 Difficulty: 3
An enzyme catalyzes a reaction at a velocity of 20 μmol/min when the concentration of substrate (S) is 0.01 M.  The Km for this substrate is 1 × 10-5 M. Assuming that Michaelis-Menten kinetics are followed, what will the reaction velocity be when the concentration of S is (a) 1 × 10-5 M and (b) 1 × 10-6 M?
Ans: The velocity of 20 μmol/min is essentially Vmax because it is measured at [S] >> Km.  (a) When [S] = 10-5 M = Km, V = 1/2 Vmax, or 10 μmol/min.  (b) When [S] is 10-6 M, velocity can be calculated from the Michaelis-Menten equation:
V0 = Vmax [S]/( Km + [S]) = (20 μmol/min)(10-6 M)/(10-5 + 10-6) = 1.8 μmol/min.

Give the Michaelis-Menten equation and define each term in it.  Does this equation apply to all enzymes?  If not, to which kind does it not apply?
Ans: The Michaelis-Menten equation is: V0 = Vmax [S]/( Km + [S]), in which V0 is the initial velocity at any given concentration of S, Vmax is the velocity when all enzyme molecules are saturated with S, [S] is the concentration of S, and Km is a constant characteristic for the enzyme.  This equation does not apply to enzymes that display sigmoidal V0 vs. [S] curves, but only to those giving hyperbolic kinetic plots.

(a)  Vmax for the enzyme is __________.  Explain in one sentence how you determined Vmax.
(b)  Km for the enzyme is _________.  Explain in one sentence how you determined Km.
Ans: (a) Vmax is about 700.  In a plot of V vs. [S], the asymptote is Vmax.  Simple inspection of the data shows the approach to Vmax—the rate increases by only 1 unit when [S] increases fivefold.
(b)  Km is about 8 μM, the [S] at which the velocity is half-maximal.  Because Vmax is about 700, 1/2 Vmax is about 350.  The [S] at that rate is about 8 μM.

Why is the Lineweaver-Burk (double reciprocal) plot (see Box 6, p. 206) more useful than the standard V vs. [S] plot in determining kinetic constants for an enzyme?  (Your answer should probably show typical plots.)
Ans: The plot of V vs. [S] is hyperbolic; maximum velocity is never achieved experimentally, because it is impossible to do experiments at infinitely high [S].  The Lineweaver-Burk transformation of the Michaelis-Menten equation produces a linear plot that can be extrapolated to infinite [S] (where 1/[S] becomes zero), allowing a determination of Vmax.

Km = __________.  (b) Total enzyme = __________ μmol.
Ans: Km = about 2 mM (the concentration of S needed to achieve one-half of Vmax, which is about 500).  The total enzyme present is producing about 500 μmol of product per minute.  Because the turnover number is 5,000/min, the amount of enzyme present must be 0.1 μmol; 1 μmol of enzyme would produce 5000 μmol product/min.

Page: 198 Difficulty: 3
When 10 μg of an enzyme of Mr 50,000 is added to a solution containing its substrate at a concentration one hundred times the Km, it catalyzes the conversion of 75 μmol of substrate into product in 3 min.  What is the enzyme’s turnover number?
Ans: Because the velocity measured occurs far above Km, it represents Vmax.  Ten μg of the enzyme represents 10 × 10-6 g/(5 × 104 g/mol), or 2 × 10-10 mol of enzyme.  In 3 minutes, this amount of enzyme produced 75 μmol of product, equivalent to 25 × 10-6 mol of product per minute.  The turnover number is therefore (25 × 10-6 mol/min)/(2 × 10-10 mol) = 12.5 × 104 min-1.

Page: 198 Difficulty: 3
Fifteen μg of an enzyme of Mr 30,000 working at Vmax catalyzes the conversion of 60 μmol of substrate into product in 3 min.  What is the enzyme’s turnover number?
Ans: The amount of enzyme present is 15 × 10-6 g, which is (15 × 10-6 g)/(3 × 104 g/mol) = 5 × 10-10 mol of enzyme.  The rate of product formation is 60 × 10-6 mol/3 min, or 20 × 10-6 mol of product per minute.  The turnover number is therefore (20 × 10-6 mol/min)/(5 × 10-10 mol of enzyme), or 4 × 10-4 min-1.
Enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism
Page: 198 Difficulty: 2
How does the total enzyme concentration affect turnover number and Vmax?
Ans: The turnover number, kcat, is the number of substrate molecules converted to product in a given time by a single enzyme molecule, so turnover number is not affected by the total enzyme concentration, [Et].  For any given reaction, however, Vmax can change because Vmax is the product of turnover number × the total enzyme concentration, or Vmax = kcat [Et].
Enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism
Pages: 198−199 Difficulty: 3
Enzymes with a kcat / Km ratio of about 108 M-1s-1 are considered to show optimal catalytic efficiency.  Fumarase, which catalyzes the reversible-dehydration reaction
fumarate + H2O            malate
has a ratio of turnover number to the Michaelis-Menten constant, (kcat / Km) of 1.6 × 108 for the substrate fumarate and 3.6 × 107 for the substrate malate.  Because the turnover number for both substrates is nearly identical, what factors might be involved that explain the different ratio for the two substrates?
Ans: If the turnover number is nearly identical for both substrates, then the Km for malate must be much larger than for fumarate.  Similar turnover numbers suggest no significant differences in rate of conversion of substrate to product, but the different Km values could possibly be explained by a stronger binding affinity of the enzyme for fumarate than for malate or some other aspect of the reaction mechanism that affects Km.
 Enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism
Pages: 202−203 Difficulty: 3
Methanol (wood alcohol) is highly toxic because it is converted to formaldehyde in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase:
NAD+ + methanol → NADH + H+ + formaldehyde
Part of the medical treatment for methanol poisoning is to administer ethanol (ethyl alcohol) in amounts large enough to cause intoxication under normal circumstances.  Explain this in terms of what you know about examples of enzymatic reactions.
Ans: Ethanol is a structural analog of methanol, and competes with methanol for the binding site of alcohol dehydrogenase, slowing the conversion of methanol to formaldehyde, and allowing its clearance by the kidneys.  The effect of ethanol is that of a competitive inhibitor.

Page: 210 Difficulty: 2
Define the term “suicide inhibitor.”
Ans: A suicide inhibitor is a molecule that is unreactive until it binds to the active site of an enzyme. In the active site, it undergoes the first chemical steps of the normal enzymatic reaction and is converted into a highly reactive species that combines irreversibly with the enzyme’s active site, rendering the enzyme inactive towards substrate.

Pages: 211−212 Difficulty: 3

Examples of enzymatic reactions
Pages: 207, 213−216 Difficulty: 3
The enzymatic activity of lysozyme is optimal at pH 5.2 and decreases above and below this pH value.  Lysozyme contains two amino acid residues in the active site essential for catalysis: Glu35 and Asp52.  The pK value for the carboxyl side chains of these two residues are 5.9 and 4.5, respectively.  What is the ionization state of each residue at the pH optimum of lysozyme?  How can the ionization states of these two amino acid residues explain the pH-activity profile of lysozyme?
Ans: For the enzyme to be active, it is likely that Asp52 is unprotonated and Glu35 is protonated.  When the pH is below 4.5, Asp52 becomes protonated, and when it is above 5.9, Glu35 is deprotonated, either of which decreases the activity of the enzyme. (See Fig. 6-20, p. 207.)
Examples of enzymatic reactions
Page: 207 Difficulty: 2
Why does pH affect the activity of an enzyme?
Ans: The state of ionization of several amino acid side chains is affected by pH, and the activity of many enzymes requires that certain of the amino acid residue side chains be in a specific ionization state. (See Fig 6-20, p. 207.)
Examples of enzymatic reactions
Pages: 208−209 Difficulty: 3
Chymotrypsin belongs to a group of proteolytic enzymes called the “serine proteases,” many of which have an Asp, His, and Ser residue that are crucial to the catalytic mechanism.  The serine hydroxyl functions as a nucleophile.  What do the other two amino acids do to support this nucleophilic reaction?
Ans: In chymotrypsin, histidine functions as a general base, accepting a proton from the serine hydroxyl, thereby increasing serine’s reactivity as a nucleophile. The negatively charged Asp stabilizes the positive charge that develops on the His.
 Examples of enzymatic reactions
Pages: 208−209 Difficulty: 3
For serine to work effectively as a nucleophile in covalent catalysis in chymotrypsin a nearby amino acid, histidine, must serve as general base catalyst.  Briefly describe, in words, how these two amino acids work together.
Ans: The serine is a polar hydroxyl, with the oxygen functioning as an electronegative nucleophile.  A nearby histidine residue, with pKa ≈ 6.0, however, functions as a base to abstract the proton from the serine hydroxyl group.  The result is to substantially increase the electronegativity of the serine oxygen, making it a much stronger nucleophile.  This, in turn, lowers the activation energy of the covalent catalysis between serine and the carbonyl carbon of the substrate peptide bond. (See Fig. 6-21, pages 208−209.) 
Examples of enzymatic reactions
Pages: 216−217 Difficulty: 2
Penicillin and related antibiotics contain a 4-membered β-lactam ring.  Explain why this feature is important to the mechanism of action of these drugs.
Ans: The strained 4-membered ring is easily opened (ΔG << 0); this energy drives the reaction that covalently inactivates the transpeptidase. 
Regulatory enzymes
Page: 212 Difficulty: 3
On the enzyme hexokinase, ATP reacts with glucose to produce glucose 6-phosphate and ADP five orders of magnitude faster than ATP reacts with H2O to form phosphate and ADP.  The intrinsic chemical reactivity of the —OH group in water is about the same as that of the glucose molecule, and water can certainly fit into the active site.  Explain this rate differential in two sentences or less.
Ans: The binding of glucose to hexokinase induces a conformation change that brings the amino acid residues that facilitate the phosphoryl transfer into position in the active site.  Binding of water alone does not induce this conformational change.
Examples of enzymatic reactions
Pages: 210−211 Difficulty: 3
Why is a transition-state analog not necessarily the same as a competitive inhibitor?
Ans: The structure of a competitive inhibitor may be similar to the structure of the free substrate.  Similar structure will mean that the competitive inhibitor can associate with the enzyme at the active site, effectively blocking the normal substrate from binding.  A transition-state analog, however, is similar in structure to the transition-state of the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme.  Often, a transition-state analog will bind tightly to an enzyme, and it is not easily competed away by substrate.
Regulatory enzymes
Pages: 220−221 Difficulty: 2
Explain how a biochemist might discover that a certain enzyme is allosterically regulated.
Ans: The enzyme would show kinetics that do not fit the Michaelis-Menten equation; the plot of V vs. [S] would be sigmoidal, not hyperbolic. The enzyme kinetics would be affected by molecules other than the substrate(s).
Regulatory enzymes
Pages: 226−227 Difficulty: 2
What is a zymogen (proenzyme)?  Explain briefly with an example.
Ans: A zymogen is an inactive form of an enzyme that is activated by one or more proteolytic cleavages in its sequence. Chymotrypsinogen, trypsinogen, and proelastase are all zymogens, becoming chymotrypsin, trypsin, and elastase, respectively, after proper cleavage.
