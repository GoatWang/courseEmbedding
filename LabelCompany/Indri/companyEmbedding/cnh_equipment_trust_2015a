                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

and
 

WHEREAS , the Receivables will be transferred by CNHCR,

ARTICLE II
 

CONVEYANCE OF
RECEIVABLES
 

Section 2.1.
                                                             
Conveyance of Purchased
Contracts .  In
consideration of CNHCR’s payment of $234,351,535.76 (the
“Purchase Price”) in the manner set out in
Section 2.5(a), and the other consideration (including the
terms and covenants) contained herein, CNHICA does hereby sell,
transfer, assign, set over and otherwise convey to CNHCR, without
recourse (subject to the obligations herein), all of its right,
title, interest in, to and under (collectively, the “CNHICA
Assets”):
 

(i)                                     
the Purchased Contracts and the
Owned Contracts, including all documents constituting chattel paper
included therewith, and all obligations of the Obligors thereunder,
including all monies paid thereunder on or after the Cutoff
Date;
 

(ii)                                  
the security interests in the
Financed Equipment granted by Obligors pursuant to the Purchased
Contracts and the Owned Contracts and any other interest of CNHICA
in such Financed Equipment;
 
2 





 

(iii)                               
any proceeds with respect to the
Purchased Contracts and the Owned Contracts from claims on
insurance policies covering Financed Equipment or Obligors (to the
extent not used to purchase Substitute Equipment);
 

(iv)                              
any proceeds from recourse to
Dealers with respect to the Purchased Contracts and the Owned
Contracts;
 

(v)                                 
any Financed Equipment that shall
have secured the Purchased Contracts and the Owned Contracts and
that shall have been acquired by or on behalf of CNHCR;
and
 

(vi)                              
the proceeds of any and all of the
foregoing.
 
Insofar as the grant above relates to Owned
Contracts and related property, it is made for administrative
convenience and is not intended to derogate from the prior
conveyance of the Owned Contracts and related property pursuant to
the Liquidity Receivables Purchase Agreement.  The parties to
this Agreement acknowledge and agree that, except as set
forth in Section 5.5 of this Agreement, the sole
remedy for any breach of any representation or warranty made by
CNHICA to CNHCR at any time as to the Owned
Contracts and related property will be the repurchase
obligation of CNHICA set forth in Section 6.2 of this
Agreement.
 

Section 2.2.
                                                             
[Reserved]
.
 

Section 2.3.
                                                             
Intention of the
Parties .  The
parties to this Agreement intend that the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be, and shall be treated as, a purchase by CNHCR and a
sale by CNHICA of the Receivables and not as a lending transaction,
such that in the event of a filing of a petition for relief by or
against CNHICA under the Bankruptcy Code, (i) such Receivables
would not be property of CNHICA’s bankruptcy estate under
Section 541 of the Bankruptcy Code, (ii) the bankruptcy
court would not compel the turnover of such Receivables or
collections thereon by CNHCR to CNHICA under Section 542 of
the Bankruptcy Code, and (iii) the bankruptcy court would
determine that payments on such Receivables not in the possession
of CNHICA would not be subject to the automatic stay provisions of
Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code imposed upon the
commencement of CNHICA’s bankruptcy case.  The foregoing
sale, assignment, transfer and conveyance does not constitute, and
is not intended to result in a creation or assumption by CNHCR of,
any obligation or liability with respect to any Receivables, nor
shall CNHCR be obligated to perform or otherwise be responsible for
any obligation of CNHICA or any other Person in connection with the
Receivables or under any agreement or instrument relating thereto,
including any contract or any other obligation to any
Obligor.  If (but only to the extent that) the transfer of the
Assets hereunder is characterized by a court or other governmental
authority as a loan rather than a sale, CNHICA shall be deemed
hereunder to have granted to CNHCR a security interest in all of
CNHICA’s right, title and interest in and to the
Assets.  Such security interest shall secure all of
CNHICA’s obligations (monetary or otherwise) under this
Agreement and the other Basic Documents to which it is a party,
whether now or hereafter existing or arising, due or to become due,
direct or indirect, absolute or contingent.  CNHCR shall have,

subsequent
 
6 





 
assignment and transfer of such Receivables to
the Trust pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement and the
Grant to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the
Indenture:
 

(i)                                     
Characteristics of
Receivables.   Each
Receivable is a Retail Installment Contract and: 
(A) (1) (i) was originated in the United States of
America by a Dealer in connection with the retail sale of Financed
Equipment in the ordinary course of such Dealer’s business,
and (ii) was purchased by CNHICA from a Dealer and validly
assigned by such Dealer to CNHICA in accordance with its terms,
except that some of the Receivables were purchased by NH Credit
from Dealers (after being originated as provided above),
securitized in a previous CNH Equipment Trust and purchased by
CNHICA through the exercise of a clean-up call relating to that
previous securitization or (2) was originated in the United
States of America by CNHICA in connection with the financing or
refinancing, as applicable, of Financed Equipment in the ordinary
course of CNHICA’s business, and in the case of the foregoing
clauses (1) and (2), was fully and properly executed by the
parties thereto, (B) has created a valid, subsisting and
enforceable first priority security interest in the Financed
Equipment in favor of CNHICA except to the extent that such
security interest has been assigned by CNHICA to CNHCR, by CNHCR to
the Issuing Entity and by the Issuing Entity to the Indenture
Trustee, (C) contains customary and enforceable provisions
such that the rights and remedies of the holder thereof are
adequate for realization against the collateral of the benefits of
the security, and (D) provides for fixed payments on a
periodic basis that fully amortize the Amount Financed by maturity
and yield interest at the Annual Percentage Rate.
 

(ii)                                  
Schedule of Receivables; No
Adverse Selection of Receivables; Accuracy of Computer
Tape.   The
information set forth on Schedule A to the CNHICA Assignment
delivered on the Closing Date is true and correct in all material
respects as of the opening of business on the Cutoff Date.  No
selection procedures believed by CNHICA to be adverse to the
interests of the Trust, the Noteholders or the Certificateholders
were or will be utilized in selecting the Receivables.  The
computer tape regarding the Receivables made available to CNHCR and
its assigns is true and correct in all respects.
 

(iii)                               
Compliance with Law.
  Each Receivable and the sale
of the related Financed Equipment complied in all material respects
at the time it was originated or made and at the execution of this
Agreement with all requirements of applicable federal, state and
local laws and regulations thereunder, including usury law, the
Federal Truth-in-Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the
Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act,
the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act,
the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Regulations B and
Z, the Wisconsin Consumer Act and state adaptations of the National
Consumer Act and of the Uniform Consumer Credit Code, and other
consumer credit laws and equal credit opportunity and disclosure
laws, in each case, to the extent applicable.
 

(iv)                              
Binding Obligation.
  Each Receivable represents
the genuine, legal, valid and binding payment obligation in writing
of the Obligor, enforceable by the holder thereof in accordance
with its terms.
 
7 






 

(v)          
No Government Obligor.   None of the Receivables is due
from the United States of America or any state or from any agency,
department or instrumentality of the United States of America or
any state.
 

(vi)         
Security Interest in Financed Equipment.   Immediately
prior to the sale, assignment and transfer thereof, each Receivable
shall be secured by a validly perfected first priority security
interest in the Financed Equipment in favor of CNHICA as secured
party or all necessary and appropriate actions have been commenced
that would result in the valid perfection of a first priority
security interest in the Financed Equipment in favor of CNHICA as
secured party.
 

(vii)        
Receivables in Force.   No Receivable has been
satisfied, subordinated or rescinded, nor has any Financed
Equipment been released from the Lien granted by the related
Receivable in whole or in part (other than with respect to
equipment released from a Lien in accordance with the Servicing
Procedures and replaced with Substitute Equipment).
 

(viii)       
No Amendment or Waiver.   No provision of a Receivable
has been waived, altered or modified in any respect, except
pursuant to a document, instrument or writing included in the
Receivable Files and no such amendment, waiver, alteration or
modification causes such Receivable not to conform to the other
warranties contained in this Section.
 

(ix)         
No Defenses.   No right of rescission, setoff,
counterclaim or defense has been asserted or threatened or exists
with respect to any Receivable.
 

(x)          
No Liens.   To the best of CNHICA’s knowledge, no
Liens or claims, including claims for work, labor or materials,
relating to any of the Financed Equipment have been filed that are
Liens prior to, or equal or coordinate with, the security interest
in the Financed Equipment granted by any Receivable, except those
pursuant to the Basic Documents.
 

(xi)         
No Default; Delinquency Limitations.   No Receivable is
a non-performing Receivable or has a payment that is more than 90
days overdue as of the Cutoff Date and, except for a payment
default continuing for a period of not more than 90 days, no
default, breach, violation or event permitting acceleration under
the terms of any Receivable has occurred and is continuing; and no
continuing condition (other than a payment default

Fitch Affirms Four Classes of CNH Equipment Trust 2015-A | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms Four Classes of CNH Equipment Trust 2015-A
    





February 03, 2016 02:20 PM Eastern Standard Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings affirms four classes of CNH Equipment Trust 2015-A as 
      follows:
    

      --Class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      --Class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B at 'A+sf'; Outlook revised to Positive from Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations of the class A and B notes reflect loss coverage 
      consistent with ratings of 'AAAsf' and 'A+sf' respectively. The Stable 
      Outlook for the class A notes reflects Fitch's expectation for loss 
      coverage and credit enhancement to continue to improve as the 
      transaction amortizes. The Outlook revision to Positive for the class B 
      notes reflects the possibility for positive rating actions in the next 
      12 to 18 months.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case 
      loss proxy, which would impact available loss coverage. Lower loss 
      coverage could impact ratings and rating outlooks, depending on the 
      extent of the decline in coverage. In Fitch's initial review of the 
      transaction, the notes were found to have limited sensitivity to 1.5x 
      and 2.5x higher of Fitch's base case loss expectation. Initial key 
      rating drivers and rating sensitivities are further described in the new 
      issue report published Feb. 19, 2015.
    

      To date, the transaction has exhibited strong performance with losses 
      within Fitch's initial expectations with rising loss coverage and 
      multiple levels. As such, continued strong performance for the 
      transaction would most likely result in continued stable ratings. 
      Conversely, a material deterioration in performance would have to occur 
      within the asset pool to have potential negative impact on the 
      outstanding ratings.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of CNH 
      2015-A can be found in 'CNH Equipment Trust 2015-A - Appendix'. These 
      R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed 
      in the special report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement 
      Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated Jan. 21, 
      2016.

Fitch Expects to Rate CNH Equipment Trust 2015-A; Presale Issued | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Expects to Rate CNH Equipment Trust 2015-A; Presale Issued
    





February 19, 2015 02:57 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings to the CNH 
      Equipment Trust 2015-A notes:
    

      --$158,000,000 class A-1 'F1+sf';
    

      --$268,000,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$244,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$112,000,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$18,000,000 class B 'A+sf'; Outlook Stable
    

      Fitch's stress and rating sensitivity analysis are discussed in the 
      presale report titled 'CNH Equipment Trust 2015-A', dated Feb. 19, 2015, 
      which is available on Fitch's web site. The presale report details how 
      Fitch addresses the key rating drivers summarized below.
    

      Key Rating Drivers
    

      High AG Concentration: The 2015-A collateral pool consists of 91% 
      agricultural (AG) and 9% construction (CO) equipment. While the 
      concentration is consistent with CNH Industrial Capital securitizations 
      going back to 2009, the AG concentrations in all these transactions are 
      significantly higher relative to CNH Industrial Capital transactions 
      issued prior to 2009.
    

      Consistent Collateral Concentrations: The pool contains 51% used 
      equipment, higher than 2014-C (46%), but remains inside historical 
      ranges.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement: Credit enhancement (CE) for the 2015-A 
      transaction is consistent with the prior nine transactions. Class A CE 
      remains at 4.50% and class B remains at 2.25%. These levels are 
      sufficient for the ratings under a 1.15% CNL proxy.
    

      Quality Origination, Underwriting, and Servicing: CNH Industrial Capital 
      has demonstrated adequate abilities as originator, underwriter, and 
      servicer, as evidenced by historical delinquency and loss performance of 
      securitized trusts and the managed portfolio.
    

      Integrity of Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction 
      should provide that a bankruptcy of the trust would not impair the 
      timeliness of payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings to increased losses over the 
      life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the notes display 
      limited sensitivity to increased defaults and losses, showing limited 
      impact on the rating of the notes under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case 
      loss) scenario. The notes could experience downgrades of up to two 
      rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      presale report dated Jan. 30, 2015. Fitch's analysis of the 
      Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this transaction can be found in 
      'CNH Equipment Trust 2015-A - Appendix'. These R&Ws are compared to 
      those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special 
      report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in 
      Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated April 17, 2012.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      accompanying presale report, available at 'www.fitchratings.com' 
      or by clicking on the above link.
