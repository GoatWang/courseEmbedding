Ronald J. Kramer


Born
1958
U.S.


Alma mater
University of Pennsylvania (B.S.)
New York University (MBA)


Occupation
CEO of Griffon Corporation 2008–present
President and Director of Wynn Resorts 2002–2008


Spouse(s)
Stephanie Blau Kramer (1992–present)[1]


Ronald J. "Ron" Kramer (born 1958) is an American business executive. He is the CEO of Griffon Corporation, a conglomerate holding company headquartered in New York, New York.[2][3]
Kramer received a B.S. from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1980 and a MBA from New York University in 1981.[4][5] He started his career at Citibank and then worked as a corporate finance specialist at Ladenburg Thalmann, a New York-based investment bank, for thirteen years, becoming Chairman and CEO in 1995.[6] In 1999, Kramer became a Managing Director and Partner at Wasserstein Perella & Co. and its successor Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. Kramer left Wall Street in 2002 to become President and Director of Wynn Resorts Ltd (NASDAQ: WYNN), a Las Vegas-based developer and operator of destination casino resorts.[7]
Kramer succeeded his father-in-law Harvey R. Blau as CEO of Griffon in 2008.[3][8] To improve Griffon's balance sheet, Kramer secured a new $100 million revolving line of credit from JPMorgan Chase, exited the residential installation services business, refinanced Griffon's senior debt, and raised approximately $250 million through a common stock rights offering with investments by Goldman Sachs and Kramer himself.[9] Griffon's recapitalization built a foundation to transform the company for growth. In 2015, Griffon generated over $2 billion in sales with approximately 6,000 employees worldwide.[10]
Griffon operates as a diversified management and holding company, conducting business through its wholly owned subsidiaries: Clopay Building Products, the largest manufacturer of residential garage doors in North America; The AMES Companies, a leading global manufacturer of non-powered lawn and garden tools and accessories; Clopay Plastic Products, a global manufacturer of performance plastic films and laminates for a variety of personal care and industrial uses; and Telephonics Corporation, a manufacturer of advanced electronic surveillance, intelligence and communication systems for defense, aerospace and civil applications.[10]
Kramer has served on the Board of Directors of Leap Wireless International, Monster Worldwide, Sapphire Industrials Corporation, Grand Casinos, Republic Properties, New Valley Corporation, and Lakes Entertainment.[2] Kramer currently serves as the Chairman of the Undergraduate Board of the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania and as a Director of Mount Sinai Children’s Center, New York. He resides with his wife, Stephanie, and two daughters in New York City.
