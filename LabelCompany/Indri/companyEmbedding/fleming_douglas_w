Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time.

                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

Jones  By William H. Jones  February 22, 1982   Back in the late 1920s, stock broker and investment adviser W. B. Hibbs was giving his colleagues fits. In talking to local investors and business people, Hibbs told them not to buy stocks any more. Stock trading had become just like gambling and something was wrong with the economy, he advised. Partners in the Hibbs firm talked of ways to silence the man who came to Washington in the 1870s and once sold newspapers on 15th Street NW, where a building bearing his name later was built. Hibbs founded a major stock brokerage and commodity trading firm in 1889, and W. B. Hibbs & Co. later became the first Washington-area member of the New York Stock Exchange. After the stock market crash in October 1929, many customers of the Hibbs firm never forgot the advice they got and their loyalty to the brokerage could never be broken. Internal criticism disappeared rather quickly. Things are not so bad today, although the stock market continued on a very weak footing last week and ominous comparisons can be made with economic developments in the past year and those of 50 years ago. Indeed, the 1982 successors to leadership of the area's oldest major investment house are quite cautious about the current climate. They are bullish about long-term equity markets and they are not out of the stock market completely, but they are not investing much of their customers' funds in stocks at the moment when short-term interest rates are so attractive that "it doesn't make sense to take risk in the stock market." The company today is called Folger Nolan Fleming Douglas Inc., which has a family tree with two significant roots--the Hibbs company and a separate investment firm founded in 1931 by John Clifford Folger and James Parker Nolan. Folger, Nolan combined with Hibbs in 1953 and offices were consolidated in the old Hibbs building at 725 15th St. NW, built in 1907. In a coincidence, both Mr. Folger and Mr. Nolan died last year, exactly 50 years after they had founded their business. Each man had been in his 15th Street office four days before he died. The deaths of the board chairman and president of any business, in such a short span of time, normally would present major problems of corporate restructuring and invite questions about new goals for a different era. But Folger Nolan has faced no such difficulties. Indeed, a new management team at Folger Nolan has taken over and only emphasized anew the company's hallmark as a conservative investment house in a time of economic turmoil. "Most of our customers have long-term accounts, and they are on the conservative side, mainly interested in long-term purchasing power plus a small percentage of investments in high-growth areas," said 45-year old Lee M. Folger, son of John Folger and new board chairman. Lee Folger has been in the investment business since 1959 and his family is the dominant owner of stock in the Washington firm. "We have a conservative investment philosophy, and are not interested in highly-speculative, go-go stocks . . . the markets will be increasingly volatile, with big changes in a day or two, and there is a need for constant attention to each customer's portfolio," he emphasized in an interview last week. Because of these constant changes, Folger said his firm is looking at new investment products for customers to help them maintain the value of their assets and to work on the more illusive goal of increasing purchasing power. "The political scene and climate has the potential for being very positive for business but the deficits are frightening . . . I hope there will be substantive discussions by Congress and the Reagan administration to reduce the deficits, but until that develops, we need to be cautious" in investment of customers' funds, he added. Moreover, metropolitan Washington offers a special challenge to investment advisers, in Folger's view: "This is a fabulous town for this business because of the large number of two-earner families, and one of the main problems people here face is converting income to assets." To some extent, this has led to a change in Folger Nolan's emphasis. The investment firm still thinks of itself as aimed at "the top of the market" in Washington. But top of the market used to be measured in the size of assets a customer had. Today, top of the market also is measured by income since many investors or potential investors have large family incomes but not yet the overall assets. To compete for the business of these Washingtonians and to maintain existing specialties in retail stock brokerage, municipal finance and corporate finance, Lee Folger is joined by two long-term colleagues in a senior management group. Robert W. Fleming, known throughout the local community as "Bus" Fleming, has been named president to succeed the late Mr. Nolan. Fleming joined the firm in 1948 and became a general partner in 1950; he was added to the firm's name in 1956, when it became known as Folger, Nolan, Fleming--W. B. Hibbs & Co. The Douglas in the current name of the firm is that of W. Leslie Douglas, a new senior vice president. A broker-dealer since 1946, Douglas had been a vice president of the company for more than 25 years and his name was added to that of the firm in 1971. Other top officers named include John P. Rodler, senior vice president, secretary and treasurer; and Thomas Roddy, Robert Leahy, H. Montgomery Snyder, Lillian Blucher and James Mersereau, senior vice presidents. In terms of capital, Folger Nolan ranks first among Washington area investment firms; total stockholders' equity as of last Sept. 25 was $7.3 million. The firm has about 4,000 customer accounts, 80 employes (including 25 registered sales representatives) and just one small branch office in Northern Virginia. Virtually all operations are done under one roof in the old Hibbs building, which is being renovated inside. Other area investment firms have more customer accounts but Folger and Fleming emphasized they are not seeking "to be all things to all people." For example, the firm does not put its clients into commodities. At one time, Folger Nolan had a membership in the Chicago Board of Trade and it was a big commodities trader in earlier decades. But no more. Fleming emphasized that his firm's investment philosophy does not in any way mean that only wealthy persons can be served. To the contrary, where some investment firms discourage persons with only small amounts of money, Folger Nolan emphasizes retail activity and seeks all customers. "I have a feeling that for a person with $1,000 to invest, it's more important to him than for a person with $50,000 to invest," said Fleming. "A theme for many, many years" has been personalized service no matter how big the initial account, he added. For individuals, couples and institutions with substantial assets and income, Folger Nolan established a capital management division in 1978 to conduct research and to manage a broad range of investments. There is a minimum annual fee of $500 for this service and the company says that the benefits of investment management can best be realized where portfolio values approach or exceed $100,000. Folger Nolan is an active participant in stock underwritings and, periodically, a major investment banker in this area when opportuntities open up. Two of the largest deals in Washington business history took place in the past decade and Folger Nolan was investment banker for both: Joe L. Allbritton's purchase of the now defunct Washington Star and his surprising but successful bid for control of Riggs National Bank. With more such takeovers and financial institution consolidations taking place in the next few years, Folger said "everything is possible" when asked if his firm would move into other business lines or find itself a target for acquisition. But, he emphasized, "We feel very strongly that there's an important place for locally-based, locally-controlled investment firms in the nation's capital . . . major banks and investment firms should not be just branches of firms elsewhere, with decisions made elsewhere." His firm has a capital position among the strongest in the industry and since Folger's family controls ownership, his goal of continued independence is assured.          business   Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 magnet-olympics2016 false after3th false          Please provide a valid email address.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
