  Richard C. Kelly today announced his intention to retire as chairman and CEO of Xcel Energy effective Aug. 24, 2011, after 43 years with the company. He made the announcement at Xcel Energy’s annual meeting of shareholders in Minneapolis.   Richard C. Kelly (Photo: Xcel Energy)   Kelly also announced that Xcel Energy’s board of directors has elected Benjamin G.S. Fowke III, currently president and chief operating officer, to succeed him as chairman and CEO, effective upon Kelly’s retirement.  Kelly, 64, has held various positions with Xcel Energy, including president and CEO, chief operating officer and chief financial officer. Prior to the merger forming Xcel Energy in 2000, he held a number of finance-related positions with predecessor companies New Century Energies and Public Service Company of Colorado. He has served on numerous boards of directors for industry and community organizations, and currently is completing his term as chairman of the national Edison Electric Institute.  Before assuming his current responsibilities in August 2009, Fowke, 53, held a variety of executive positions at the company, including executive vice president and CFO from December 2008 to August 2009; vice president and CFO from May 2004 to December 2008; vice president, CFO and treasurer, October 2003 to May 2004; vice president and treasurer, November 2002 to October 2003; and vice president and CFO of Energy Markets business unit, August 2000 to November 2002. Prior to the 2000 merger of Northern States Power Co. and New Century Energies (NCE) to form Xcel Energy in 2000, he was a vice president in the NCE Retail business unit. Earlier in his career, Fowke worked for 10 years with Next Era Energy, where he held various management positions.  Fredric W. Corrigan, lead director on the Xcel Energy board of directors and retired CEO and president of The Mosaic Company, praised Kelly for his outstanding leadership of the company and within the industry. “Dick has done an extraordinary job managing the company’s operations while developing an environmental platform that has established Xcel Energy as a true leader in the industry,” he said.

Total compensation for each chief executive includes the following: salary and bonuses; other compensation, such as vested restricted stock grants, LTIP payouts and perks; and stock gains, the value realized by exercising stock options. Efficiency rank is based on our chief executive's performance/pay score. Ranks are given only to chief executives who have a six-year tenure and six-year compensation history. The most efficient rank is 1 and least efficient is 206.

Footnotes: 
	Compensation data is from the latest available proxy statements filed through Mar. 23, 2012. Total returns and value of stock owned (including all classes) is based on Mar. 14, 2012 stock price. Compensation percent change is based on combined salary and bonus. Annualized total return during tenure covers the tenure of the executive or from the time of the IPO or available stock history. Relative to market is the ending value of $100 invested in the stock, divided by the ending value of $1 invested in the S & P 500 (a score of 100 = the S & P 500). NA: Not available or not applicable.
