A business (also known as an enterprise, a company or a firm) is an organizational entity involved in the provision of goods and services to consumers.[1][2] Businesses serve as conductors of economic activity, and are prevalent in capitalist economies, where most of them are privately owned and provide goods and services allocated through a market to consumers and customers in exchange for other goods, services, money, or other forms of exchange that hold intrinsic economic value. Businesses may also be social non-profit enterprises or state-owned public enterprises operated by governments with specific social and economic objectives. A business owned by multiple private individuals may form as an incorporated company or jointly organise as a partnership. Countries have different laws that may ascribe different rights to the various business entities.
The word "business" can refer to a particular organization or to an entire market sector (for example, "the finance business" is "the financial sector") or to all economic sectors collectively ("the business sector"). Compound forms such as "agribusiness" represent subsets of the concept's broader meaning, which encompasses all activity by suppliers of goods and services.
Typically private-sector businesses aim to maximize their profit, although in some contexts they may aim to maximize their sales revenue or their market share. Government-run businesses may aim to maximize some measure of social welfare.

Basic forms of ownership[edit]
Forms of business ownership vary by jurisdiction, but several common entities exist:

Sole proprietorship: A sole proprietorship, also known as a sole trader, is owned by one person and operates for their benefit. The owner operates the business alone and may hire employees. A sole proprietor has unlimited liability for all obligations incurred by the business, whether from operating costs or judgements against the business. All assets of the business belong to a sole proprietor, including, for example, computer infrastructure, any inventory, manufacturing equipment, or retail fixtures, as well as any real property owned by the sole proprietor.
Partnership: A partnership is a business owned by two or more people. In most forms of partnerships, each partner has unlimited liability for the debts incurred by the business. The three most prevalent types of for-profit partnerships are: general partnerships, limited partnerships, and limited liability partnerships.[3]
Corporation: The owners of a corporation have limited liability and the business has a separate legal personality from its owners. Corporations can be either government-owned or privately owned. They can organize either for profit or as nonprofit organizations. A privately owned, for-profit corporation is owned by its shareholders, who elect a board of directors to direct the corporation and hire its managerial staff. A privately owned, for-profit corporation can be either privately held by a small group of individuals, or publicly held, with publicly traded shares listed on a stock exchange.
Cooperative: Often referred to as a "co-op", a cooperative is a limited-liability business that can organize as for-profit or not-for-profit. A cooperative differs from a corporation in that it has members, not shareholders, and they share decision-making authority. Cooperatives are typically classified as either consumer cooperatives or worker cooperatives. Cooperatives are fundamental to the ideology of economic democracy.
Limited liability companies (LLC), limited liability partnerships, and other specific types of business organization protect their owners or shareholders from business failure by doing business under a separate legal entity with certain legal protections. In contrast, unincorporated businesses or persons working on their own are usually not as protected.[4][5]
Franchises: A franchise is a system in which entrepreneurs purchase the rights to open and run a business from a larger corporation.[6] Franchising in the United States is widespread and is a major economic powerhouse. One out of twelve retail businesses in the United States are franchised and 8 million people are employed in a franchised business.[7]

Classifications[edit]

Agriculture such as the domestication of fish, animals and livestock, as well as lumber, oil and mining businesses that extract natural resources and raw materials, such as wood, petroleum, natural gas, ores, plants or minerals.
Financial services businesses include banks, brokerage firms, credit unions, credit cards, insurance companies, asset and investment companies such as private equity firms, real estate investment trusts, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, mutual funds, index funds, and hedge funds, stock exchanges, and other companies that generate profits through investment and management of capital.
Entertainment and mass media companies generate profits primarily from the sale of intellectual property â they include film studios and production houses, mass media companies such as cable television networks, online digital media agencies, mobile media outlets, newspapers, book and magazine publishing houses.
Industrial manufacturers produce products, either from raw materials or from component parts, then export the finished products at a profit - they include tangible goods such as cars, glass, or aircraft.
Real estate businesses sell, invest, construct and develop properties â including land, residential homes, and other buildings.
Retailers, wholesalers, and distributors act as middlemen and get goods produced by manufacturers to the intended consumers; they make their profits by marking up their prices. Most stores and catalog companies are distributors or retailers.
Transportation businesses such as railways, airlines, shipping companies that deliver goods and individuals to their destinations for a fee.
Utilities produce public services such as electricity, waste management or sewage treatment, usually under the charge of a government.
Service businesses offer intangible goods or services and typically charge for labor or other services provided to government, to consumers, or to other businesses. Interior decorators, hairstylists, tanning salons, laundromats, and pest controllers are service businesses.

Business activities[edit]
Accounting[edit]
Main article: Accounting
Accounting is the measurement, processing and communication of financial information about economic entities[8][9] such as businesses and corporations. The modern field was established by the Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli in 1494.[10] Accounting, which has been called the "language of business",[11] measures the results of an organization's economic activities and conveys this information to a variety of users, including investors, creditors, management, and regulators.[12] Practitioners of accounting are known as accountants. The terms "accounting" and "financial reporting" are often used as synonyms.
Finance[edit]
Main article: Finance
Finance is a field that deals with the study of investments. It includes the dynamics of assets and liabilities over time under conditions of different degrees of uncertainty and risk. Finance can also be defined as the science of money management. Finance aims to price assets based on their risk level and their expected rate of return. Finance can be broken into three different sub-categories: public finance, corporate finance and personal finance.
Manufacturing[edit]
Main article: Manufacturing
Manufacturing is the production of merchandise for use or sale using labour and machines, tools, chemical and biological processing, or formulation. The term may refer to a range of human activity, from handicraft to high tech, but is most commonly applied to industrial production, in which raw materials are transformed into finished goods on a large scale.
Marketing[edit]
Main article: Marketing
Marketing is defined by the American Marketing Association as "the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large."[13] The term developed from the original meaning which referred literally to going to a market to buy or sell goods or services. Marketing tactics include advertising as well as determining product pricing.
Research and development[edit]
Main article: Research and development
Research and development refers to activities in connection with corporate or government innovation. Research and development constitutes the first stage of development of a potential new service or product. Research and development are very difficult to manage, since the defining feature of research is that the researchers do not know in advance exactly how to accomplish the desired result.[citation needed]
Sales[edit]
Main article: Sales
Sales is activity related to selling or the amount of goods or services sold in a given time period.
Management[edit]
Main article: Management
See also: Outline of business management
The efficient and effective operation of a business, and study of this subject, is called management. The major branches of management are financial management, marketing management, human resource management, strategic management, production management, operations management, service management, and information technology management.[citation needed]
Owners may manage their businesses themselves, or employ managers to do so for them. Whether they are owners or employees, managers administer three primary components of the business' value: financial resources, capital (tangible resources), and human resources. These resources are administered in at least five functional areas: legal contracting, manufacturing or service production, marketing, accounting, financing, and human resources.[citation needed]
Restructuring state enterprises[edit]
In recent decades, states modeled some of their assets and enterprises after business enterprises. In 2003, for example, the People's Republic of China modeled 80% of its state-owned enterprises on a company-type management system.[14] Many state institutions and enterprises in China and Russia have transformed into joint-stock companies, with part of their shares being listed on public stock markets.
Business process management (BPM) is a holistic management approach focused on aligning all aspects of an organization with the wants and needs of clients. BPM attempts to improve processes continuously. It can therefore be described as a "process optimization process". It is argued that BPM enables organizations to be more efficient, effective and capable of change than a functionally focused, traditional hierarchical management approach.[who?]
Organization and regulation[edit]
See also: Theory of the firm
Most legal jurisdictions specify the forms of ownership that a business can take, creating a body of commercial law for each type.
The major factors affecting how a business is organized are usually:

The size and scope of the business firm and its structure, management, and ownership, broadly analyzed in the theory of the firm. Generally, a smaller business is more flexible, while larger businesses, or those with wider ownership or more formal structures, will usually tend to be organized as corporations or (less often) partnerships. In addition, a business that wishes to raise money on a stock market or to be owned by a wide range of people will often be required to adopt a specific legal form to do so.
The sector and country. Private profit-making businesses are different from government-owned bodies. In some countries, certain businesses are legally obliged to be organized in certain ways.
Tax advantages. Different structures are treated differently in tax law, and may have advantages for this reason.
Disclosure and compliance requirements. Different business structures may be required to make less or more information public (or report it to relevant authorities), and may be bound to comply with different rules and regulations.

Many businesses are operated through a separate entity such as a corporation or a partnership (either formed with or without limited liability). Most legal jurisdictions allow people to organize such an entity by filing certain charter documents with the relevant Secretary of State or equivalent, and complying with certain other ongoing obligations. The relationships and legal rights of shareholders, limited partners, or members are governed partly by the charter documents and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the entity is organized. Generally speaking, shareholders in a corporation, limited partners in a limited partnership, and members in a limited liability company are shielded from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the entity, which is legally treated as a separate "person". This means that unless there is misconduct, the owner's own possessions are strongly protected in law if the business does not succeed.
Where two or more individuals own a business together but have failed to organize a more specialized form of vehicle, they will be treated as a general partnership. The terms of a partnership are partly governed by a partnership agreement if one is created, and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. No paperwork or filing is necessary to create a partnership, and without an agreement, the relationships and legal rights of the partners will be entirely governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. A single person who owns and runs a business is commonly known as a sole proprietor, whether that person owns it directly or through a formally organized entity. Depending on the business needs, an adviser can decide what kind is proprietorship will be most suitable.
A few relevant factors to consider in deciding how to operate a business include:

General partners in a partnership (other than a limited liability partnership), plus anyone who personally owns and operates a business without creating a separate legal entity, are personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business.
Generally, corporations are required to pay tax just like "real" people. In some tax systems, this can give rise to so-called double taxation, because first the corporation pays tax on the profit, and then when the corporation distributes its profits to its owners, individuals have to include dividends in their income when they complete their personal tax returns, at which point a second layer of income tax is imposed.
In most countries, there are laws which treat small corporations differently from large ones. They may be exempt from certain legal filing requirements or labor laws, have simplified procedures in specialized areas, and have simplified, advantageous, or slightly different tax treatment.
"Going public" through a process known as an initial public offering (IPO) means that part of the business will be owned by members of the public. This requires the organization as a distinct entity, to disclose information to the public, and adhering to a tighter set of laws and procedures. Most public entities are corporations that have sold shares, but increasingly there are also public LLC's that sell units (sometimes also called shares), and other more exotic entities as well, such as, for example, real estate investment trusts in the USA, and unit trusts in the UK. A general partnership cannot "go public".

Commercial law[edit]
Main article: Corporate law




Offices in the Los Angeles Downtown Financial District


A very detailed and well-established body of rules that evolved over a very long period of time applies to commercial transactions. The need to regulate trade and commerce and resolve business disputes helped shape the creation of law and courts. The Code of Hammurabi dates back to about 1772 BC for example, and contains provisions that relate, among other matters, to shipping costs and dealings between merchants and brokers.[15] The word "corporation" derives from the Latin corpus, meaning body, and the Maurya Empire in Iron-Age India accorded legal rights to business entities.[16]
In many countries, it is difficult to compile all the laws that can affect a business into a single reference source. Laws can govern treatment of labour and employee relations, worker protection and safety, discrimination on the basis of age, gender, disability, race, and in some jurisdictions, sexual orientation, and the minimum wage, as well as unions, worker compensation, and working hours and leave.
Some specialized businesses may also require licenses, either due to laws governing entry into certain trades, occupations or professions, that require special education, or to raise revenue for local governments. Professions that require special licenses include law, medicine, piloting aircraft, selling liquor, radio broadcasting, selling investment securities, selling used cars, and roofing. Local jurisdictions may also require special licenses and taxes just to operate a business.
Some businesses are subject to ongoing special regulation, for example, public utilities, investment securities, banking, insurance, broadcasting, aviation, and health care providers. Environmental regulations are also very complex and can affect many businesses.
Capital[edit]




Mexican Stock Exchange in Paseo de la Reforma, Mexico City


When businesses need to raise money (called capital), they sometimes offer securities for sale.
Capital may be raised through private means, by an initial public offering or IPO on a stock exchange, or in other ways.
Major stock exchanges include the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Singapore Exchange, Hong Kong Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ (USA), the London Stock Exchange (UK), the Tokyo Stock Exchange (Japan), and Bombay Stock Exchange (India). Most countries with capital markets have at least one.
Businesses that have gone public are subject to regulations concerning their internal governance, such as how executive officers' compensation is determined, and when and how information is disclosed to shareholders and to the public. In the United States, these regulations are primarily implemented and enforced by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Other western nations have comparable regulatory bodies. The regulations are implemented and enforced by the China Securities Regulation Commission (CSRC) in China. In Singapore, the regulation authority is the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and in Hong Kong, it is the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).
The proliferation and increasing complexity of the laws governing business have forced increasing specialization in corporate law. It is not unheard of for certain kinds of corporate transactions to require a team of five to ten attorneys due to sprawling regulation. Commercial law spans general corporate law, employment and labor law, health-care law, securities law, mergers and acquisitions, tax law, employee benefit plans, food and drug regulation, intellectual property law on copyrights, patents, trademarks, telecommunications law, and financing.
Other types of capital sourcing includes crowd sourcing on the Internet, venture capital, bank loans, and debentures.
Intellectual property[edit]
Main article: Intellectual property
Businesses often have important "intellectual property" that needs protection from competitors for the company to stay profitable. This could require patents, copyrights, trademarks, or preservation of trade secrets. Most businesses have names, logos, and similar branding techniques that could benefit from trademarking. Patents and copyrights in the United States are largely governed by federal law, while trade secrets and trademarking are mostly a matter of state law. Because of the nature of intellectual property, a business needs protection in every jurisdiction in which they are concerned about competitors. Many countries are signatories to international treaties concerning intellectual property, and thus companies registered in these countries are subject to national laws bound by these treaties. In order to protect trade secrets, companies may require employees to sign non-compete clauses which will impose limitations on an employee's interactions with stakeholders, and competitors.
Trade union[edit]
Main article: Trade union
A trade union (or labor union) is an organization of workers who have come together to achieve common goals such as protecting the integrity of its trade, improving safety standards, achieving higher pay and benefits such as health care and retirement, increasing the number of employees an employer assigns to complete the work, and better working conditions. The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members (rank and file members) and negotiates labour contracts (collective bargaining) with employers. The most common purpose of these associations or unions is "maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment".[17] This may include the negotiation of wages, work rules, complaint procedures, rules governing hiring, firing and promotion of workers, benefits, workplace safety and policies.

A business (also known as an enterprise, a company or a firm) is an organizational entity involved in the provision of goods and services to consumers.[1][2] Businesses serve as conductors of economic activity, and are prevalent in capitalist economies, where most of them are privately owned and provide goods and services allocated through a market to consumers and customers in exchange for other goods, services, money, or other forms of exchange that hold intrinsic economic value. Businesses may also be social non-profit enterprises or state-owned public enterprises operated by governments with specific social and economic objectives. A business owned by multiple private individuals may form as an incorporated company or jointly organise as a partnership. Countries have different laws that may ascribe different rights to the various business entities.
The word "business" can refer to a particular organization or to an entire market sector (for example, "the finance business" is "the financial sector") or to all economic sectors collectively ("the business sector"). Compound forms such as "agribusiness" represent subsets of the concept's broader meaning, which encompasses all activity by suppliers of goods and services.
Typically private-sector businesses aim to maximize their profit, although in some contexts they may aim to maximize their sales revenue or their market share. Government-run businesses may aim to maximize some measure of social welfare.

Basic forms of ownership[edit]
Forms of business ownership vary by jurisdiction, but several common entities exist:

Sole proprietorship: A sole proprietorship, also known as a sole trader, is owned by one person and operates for their benefit. The owner operates the business alone and may hire employees. A sole proprietor has unlimited liability for all obligations incurred by the business, whether from operating costs or judgements against the business. All assets of the business belong to a sole proprietor, including, for example, computer infrastructure, any inventory, manufacturing equipment, or retail fixtures, as well as any real property owned by the sole proprietor.
Partnership: A partnership is a business owned by two or more people. In most forms of partnerships, each partner has unlimited liability for the debts incurred by the business. The three most prevalent types of for-profit partnerships are: general partnerships, limited partnerships, and limited liability partnerships.[3]
Corporation: The owners of a corporation have limited liability and the business has a separate legal personality from its owners. Corporations can be either government-owned or privately owned. They can organize either for profit or as nonprofit organizations. A privately owned, for-profit corporation is owned by its shareholders, who elect a board of directors to direct the corporation and hire its managerial staff. A privately owned, for-profit corporation can be either privately held by a small group of individuals, or publicly held, with publicly traded shares listed on a stock exchange.
Cooperative: Often referred to as a "co-op", a cooperative is a limited-liability business that can organize as for-profit or not-for-profit. A cooperative differs from a corporation in that it has members, not shareholders, and they share decision-making authority. Cooperatives are typically classified as either consumer cooperatives or worker cooperatives. Cooperatives are fundamental to the ideology of economic democracy.
Limited liability companies (LLC), limited liability partnerships, and other specific types of business organization protect their owners or shareholders from business failure by doing business under a separate legal entity with certain legal protections. In contrast, unincorporated businesses or persons working on their own are usually not as protected.[4][5]
Franchises: A franchise is a system in which entrepreneurs purchase the rights to open and run a business from a larger corporation.[6] Franchising in the United States is widespread and is a major economic powerhouse. One out of twelve retail businesses in the United States are franchised and 8 million people are employed in a franchised business.[7]

Classifications[edit]

Financial services businesses include banks, brokerage firms, credit unions, credit cards, insurance companies, asset and investment companies such as private equity firms, real estate investment trusts, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, mutual funds, index funds, and hedge funds, stock exchanges, and other companies that generate profits through investment and management of capital.
Entertainment and mass media companies generate profits primarily from the sale of intellectual property â they include film studios and production houses, mass media companies such as cable television networks, online digital media agencies, mobile media outlets, newspapers, book and magazine publishing houses.
Industrial manufacturers produce products, either from raw materials or from component parts, then export the finished products at a profit - they include tangible goods such as cars, glass, or aircraft.
Real estate businesses sell, invest, construct and develop properties â including land, residential homes, and other buildings.
Retailers, wholesalers, and distributors act as middlemen and get goods produced by manufacturers to the intended consumers; they make their profits by marking up their prices. Most stores and catalog companies are distributors or retailers.
Transportation businesses such as railways, airlines, shipping companies that deliver goods and individuals to their destinations for a fee.
Utilities produce public services such as electricity, waste management or sewage treatment, usually under the charge of a government.
Service businesses offer intangible goods or services and typically charge for labor or other services provided to government, to consumers, or to other businesses. Interior decorators, hairstylists, tanning salons, laundromats, and pest controllers are service businesses.

Business activities[edit]
Accounting[edit]
Main article: Accounting
Accounting is the measurement, processing and communication of financial information about economic entities[8][9] such as businesses and corporations. The modern field was established by the Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli in 1494.[10] Accounting, which has been called the "language of business",[11] measures the results of an organization's economic activities and conveys this information to a variety of users, including investors, creditors, management, and regulators.[12] Practitioners of accounting are known as accountants. The terms "accounting" and "financial reporting" are often used as synonyms.
Finance[edit]
Main article: Finance
Finance is a field that deals with the study of investments. It includes the dynamics of assets and liabilities over time under conditions of different degrees of uncertainty and risk. Finance can also be defined as the science of money management. Finance aims to price assets based on their risk level and their expected rate of return. Finance can be broken into three different sub-categories: public finance, corporate finance and personal finance.
Manufacturing[edit]
Main article: Manufacturing
Manufacturing is the production of merchandise for use or sale using labour and machines, tools, chemical and biological processing, or formulation. The term may refer to a range of human activity, from handicraft to high tech, but is most commonly applied to industrial production, in which raw materials are transformed into finished goods on a large scale.
Marketing[edit]
Main article: Marketing
Marketing is defined by the American Marketing Association as "the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large."[13] The term developed from the original meaning which referred literally to going to a market to buy or sell goods or services. Marketing tactics include advertising as well as determining product pricing.
Research and development[edit]
Main article: Research and development
Research and development refers to activities in connection with corporate or government innovation. Research and development constitutes the first stage of development of a potential new service or product. Research and development are very difficult to manage, since the defining feature of research is that the researchers do not know in advance exactly how to accomplish the desired result.[citation needed]
Sales[edit]
Main article: Sales
Sales is activity related to selling or the amount of goods or services sold in a given time period.
Management[edit]
Main article: Management
See also: Outline of business management
The efficient and effective operation of a business, and study of this subject, is called management. The major branches of management are financial management, marketing management, human resource management, strategic management, production management, operations management, service management, and information technology management.[citation needed]
Owners may manage their businesses themselves, or employ managers to do so for them. Whether they are owners or employees, managers administer three primary components of the business' value: financial resources, capital (tangible resources), and human resources. These resources are administered in at least five functional areas: legal contracting, manufacturing or service production, marketing, accounting, financing, and human resources.[citation needed]
Restructuring state enterprises[edit]
In recent decades, states modeled some of their assets and enterprises after business enterprises. In 2003, for example, the People's Republic of China modeled 80% of its state-owned enterprises on a company-type management system.[14] Many state institutions and enterprises in China and Russia have transformed into joint-stock companies, with part of their shares being listed on public stock markets.
Business process management (BPM) is a holistic management approach focused on aligning all aspects of an organization with the wants and needs of clients. BPM attempts to improve processes continuously. It can therefore be described as a "process optimization process". It is argued that BPM enables organizations to be more efficient, effective and capable of change than a functionally focused, traditional hierarchical management approach.[who?]
Organization and regulation[edit]
See also: Theory of the firm
Most legal jurisdictions specify the forms of ownership that a business can take, creating a body of commercial law for each type.
The major factors affecting how a business is organized are usually:

The size and scope of the business firm and its structure, management, and ownership, broadly analyzed in the theory of the firm. Generally, a smaller business is more flexible, while larger businesses, or those with wider ownership or more formal structures, will usually tend to be organized as corporations or (less often) partnerships. In addition, a business that wishes to raise money on a stock market or to be owned by a wide range of people will often be required to adopt a specific legal form to do so.
The sector and country. Private profit-making businesses are different from government-owned bodies. In some countries, certain businesses are legally obliged to be organized in certain ways.
Tax advantages. Different structures are treated differently in tax law, and may have advantages for this reason.
Disclosure and compliance requirements. Different business structures may be required to make less or more information public (or report it to relevant authorities), and may be bound to comply with different rules and regulations.

Many businesses are operated through a separate entity such as a corporation or a partnership (either formed with or without limited liability). Most legal jurisdictions allow people to organize such an entity by filing certain charter documents with the relevant Secretary of State or equivalent, and complying with certain other ongoing obligations. The relationships and legal rights of shareholders, limited partners, or members are governed partly by the charter documents and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the entity is organized. Generally speaking, shareholders in a corporation, limited partners in a limited partnership, and members in a limited liability company are shielded from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the entity, which is legally treated as a separate "person". This means that unless there is misconduct, the owner's own possessions are strongly protected in law if the business does not succeed.
Where two or more individuals own a business together but have failed to organize a more specialized form of vehicle, they will be treated as a general partnership. The terms of a partnership are partly governed by a partnership agreement if one is created, and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. No paperwork or filing is necessary to create a partnership, and without an agreement, the relationships and legal rights of the partners will be entirely governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. A single person who owns and runs a business is commonly known as a sole proprietor, whether that person owns it directly or through a formally organized entity. Depending on the business needs, an adviser can decide what kind is proprietorship will be most suitable.
A few relevant factors to consider in deciding how to operate a business include:

General partners in a partnership (other than a limited liability partnership), plus anyone who personally owns and operates a business without creating a separate legal entity, are personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business.
Generally, corporations are required to pay tax just like "real" people. In some tax systems, this can give rise to so-called double taxation, because first the corporation pays tax on the profit, and then when the corporation distributes its profits to its owners, individuals have to include dividends in their income when they complete their personal tax returns, at which point a second layer of income tax is imposed.
In most countries, there are laws which treat small corporations differently from large ones. They may be exempt from certain legal filing requirements or labor laws, have simplified procedures in specialized areas, and have simplified, advantageous, or slightly different tax treatment.
"Going public" through a process known as an initial public offering (IPO) means that part of the business will be owned by members of the public. This requires the organization as a distinct entity, to disclose information to the public, and adhering to a tighter set of laws and procedures. Most public entities are corporations that have sold shares, but increasingly there are also public LLC's that sell units (sometimes also called shares), and other more exotic entities as well, such as, for example, real estate investment trusts in the USA, and unit trusts in the UK. A general partnership cannot "go public".

Commercial law[edit]
Main article: Corporate law




Offices in the Los Angeles Downtown Financial District


A very detailed and well-established body of rules that evolved over a very long period of time applies to commercial transactions. The need to regulate trade and commerce and resolve business disputes helped shape the creation of law and courts. The Code of Hammurabi dates back to about 1772 BC for example, and contains provisions that relate, among other matters, to shipping costs and dealings between merchants and brokers.[15] The word "corporation" derives from the Latin corpus, meaning body, and the Maurya Empire in Iron-Age India accorded legal rights to business entities.[16]
In many countries, it is difficult to compile all the laws that can affect a business into a single reference source. Laws can govern treatment of labour and employee relations, worker protection and safety, discrimination on the basis of age, gender, disability, race, and in some jurisdictions, sexual orientation, and the minimum wage, as well as unions, worker compensation, and working hours and leave.
Some specialized businesses may also require licenses, either due to laws governing entry into certain trades, occupations or professions, that require special education, or to raise revenue for local governments. Professions that require special licenses include law, medicine, piloting aircraft, selling liquor, radio broadcasting, selling investment securities, selling used cars, and roofing. Local jurisdictions may also require special licenses and taxes just to operate a business.
Some businesses are subject to ongoing special regulation, for example, public utilities, investment securities, banking, insurance, broadcasting, aviation, and health care providers. Environmental regulations are also very complex and can affect many businesses.
Capital[edit]




Mexican Stock Exchange in Paseo de la Reforma, Mexico City


When businesses need to raise money (called capital), they sometimes offer securities for sale.
Capital may be raised through private means, by an initial public offering or IPO on a stock exchange, or in other ways.
Major stock exchanges include the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Singapore Exchange, Hong Kong Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ (USA), the London Stock Exchange (UK), the Tokyo Stock Exchange (Japan), and Bombay Stock Exchange (India). Most countries with capital markets have at least one.
Businesses that have gone public are subject to regulations concerning their internal governance, such as how executive officers' compensation is determined, and when and how information is disclosed to shareholders and to the public. In the United States, these regulations are primarily implemented and enforced by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Other western nations have comparable regulatory bodies. The regulations are implemented and enforced by the China Securities Regulation Commission (CSRC) in China. In Singapore, the regulation authority is the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and in Hong Kong, it is the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).
The proliferation and increasing complexity of the laws governing business have forced increasing specialization in corporate law. It is not unheard of for certain kinds of corporate transactions to require a team of five to ten attorneys due to sprawling regulation. Commercial law spans general corporate law, employment and labor law, health-care law, securities law, mergers and acquisitions, tax law, employee benefit plans, food and drug regulation, intellectual property law on copyrights, patents, trademarks, telecommunications law, and financing.
Other types of capital sourcing includes crowd sourcing on the Internet, venture capital, bank loans, and debentures.
Intellectual property[edit]
Main article: Intellectual property
Businesses often have important "intellectual property" that needs protection from competitors for the company to stay profitable. This could require patents, copyrights, trademarks, or preservation of trade secrets. Most businesses have names, logos, and similar branding techniques that could benefit from trademarking. Patents and copyrights in the United States are largely governed by federal law, while trade secrets and trademarking are mostly a matter of state law. Because of the nature of intellectual property, a business needs protection in every jurisdiction in which they are concerned about competitors. Many countries are signatories to international treaties concerning intellectual property, and thus companies registered in these countries are subject to national laws bound by these treaties. In order to protect trade secrets, companies may require employees to sign non-compete clauses which will impose limitations on an employee's interactions with stakeholders, and competitors.
Trade union[edit]
Main article: Trade union
A trade union (or labor union) is an organization of workers who have come together to achieve common goals such as protecting the integrity of its trade, improving safety standards, achieving higher pay and benefits such as health care and retirement, increasing the number of employees an employer assigns to complete the work, and better working conditions. The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members (rank and file members) and negotiates labour contracts (collective bargaining) with employers. The most common purpose of these associations or unions is "maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment".[17] This may include the negotiation of wages, work rules, complaint procedures, rules governing hiring, firing and promotion of workers, benefits, workplace safety and policies.

A business (also known as an enterprise, a company or a firm) is an organizational entity involved in the provision of goods and services to consumers.[1][2] Businesses serve as conductors of economic activity, and are prevalent in capitalist economies, where most of them are privately owned and provide goods and services allocated through a market to consumers and customers in exchange for other goods, services, money, or other forms of exchange that hold intrinsic economic value. Businesses may also be social non-profit enterprises or state-owned public enterprises operated by governments with specific social and economic objectives. A business owned by multiple private individuals may form as an incorporated company or jointly organise as a partnership. Countries have different laws that may ascribe different rights to the various business entities.
The word "business" can refer to a particular organization or to an entire market sector (for example, "the finance business" is "the financial sector") or to all economic sectors collectively ("the business sector"). Compound forms such as "agribusiness" represent subsets of the concept's broader meaning, which encompasses all activity by suppliers of goods and services.
Typically private-sector businesses aim to maximize their profit, although in some contexts they may aim to maximize their sales revenue or their market share. Government-run businesses may aim to maximize some measure of social welfare.

Basic forms of ownership[edit]
Forms of business ownership vary by jurisdiction, but several common entities exist:

Sole proprietorship: A sole proprietorship, also known as a sole trader, is owned by one person and operates for their benefit. The owner operates the business alone and may hire employees. A sole proprietor has unlimited liability for all obligations incurred by the business, whether from operating costs or judgements against the business. All assets of the business belong to a sole proprietor, including, for example, computer infrastructure, any inventory, manufacturing equipment, or retail fixtures, as well as any real property owned by the sole proprietor.
Partnership: A partnership is a business owned by two or more people. In most forms of partnerships, each partner has unlimited liability for the debts incurred by the business. The three most prevalent types of for-profit partnerships are: general partnerships, limited partnerships, and limited liability partnerships.[3]
Corporation: The owners of a corporation have limited liability and the business has a separate legal personality from its owners. Corporations can be either government-owned or privately owned. They can organize either for profit or as nonprofit organizations. A privately owned, for-profit corporation is owned by its shareholders, who elect a board of directors to direct the corporation and hire its managerial staff. A privately owned, for-profit corporation can be either privately held by a small group of individuals, or publicly held, with publicly traded shares listed on a stock exchange.
Cooperative: Often referred to as a "co-op", a cooperative is a limited-liability business that can organize as for-profit or not-for-profit. A cooperative differs from a corporation in that it has members, not shareholders, and they share decision-making authority. Cooperatives are typically classified as either consumer cooperatives or worker cooperatives. Cooperatives are fundamental to the ideology of economic democracy.
Limited liability companies (LLC), limited liability partnerships, and other specific types of business organization protect their owners or shareholders from business failure by doing business under a separate legal entity with certain legal protections. In contrast, unincorporated businesses or persons working on their own are usually not as protected.[4][5]
Franchises: A franchise is a system in which entrepreneurs purchase the rights to open and run a business from a larger corporation.[6] Franchising in the United States is widespread and is a major economic powerhouse. One out of twelve retail businesses in the United States are franchised and 8 million people are employed in a franchised business.[7]

Classifications[edit]

Financial services businesses include banks, brokerage firms, credit unions, credit cards, insurance companies, asset and investment companies such as private equity firms, real estate investment trusts, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, mutual funds, index funds, and hedge funds, stock exchanges, and other companies that generate profits through investment and management of capital.
Entertainment and mass media companies generate profits primarily from the sale of intellectual property â they include film studios and production houses, mass media companies such as cable television networks, online digital media agencies, mobile media outlets, newspapers, book and magazine publishing houses.
Industrial manufacturers produce products, either from raw materials or from component parts, then export the finished products at a profit - they include tangible goods such as cars, glass, or aircraft.
Real estate businesses sell, invest, construct and develop properties â including land, residential homes, and other buildings.
Retailers, wholesalers, and distributors act as middlemen and get goods produced by manufacturers to the intended consumers; they make their profits by marking up their prices. Most stores and catalog companies are distributors or retailers.
Transportation businesses such as railways, airlines, shipping companies that deliver goods and individuals to their destinations for a fee.
Utilities produce public services such as electricity, waste management or sewage treatment, usually under the charge of a government.
Service businesses offer intangible goods or services and typically charge for labor or other services provided to government, to consumers, or to other businesses. Interior decorators, hairstylists, tanning salons, laundromats, and pest controllers are service businesses.

Business activities[edit]
Accounting[edit]
Main article: Accounting
Accounting is the measurement, processing and communication of financial information about economic entities[8][9] such as businesses and corporations. The modern field was established by the Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli in 1494.[10] Accounting, which has been called the "language of business",[11] measures the results of an organization's economic activities and conveys this information to a variety of users, including investors, creditors, management, and regulators.[12] Practitioners of accounting are known as accountants. The terms "accounting" and "financial reporting" are often used as synonyms.
Finance[edit]
Main article: Finance
Finance is a field that deals with the study of investments. It includes the dynamics of assets and liabilities over time under conditions of different degrees of uncertainty and risk. Finance can also be defined as the science of money management. Finance aims to price assets based on their risk level and their expected rate of return. Finance can be broken into three different sub-categories: public finance, corporate finance and personal finance.
Manufacturing[edit]
Main article: Manufacturing
Manufacturing is the production of merchandise for use or sale using labour and machines, tools, chemical and biological processing, or formulation. The term may refer to a range of human activity, from handicraft to high tech, but is most commonly applied to industrial production, in which raw materials are transformed into finished goods on a large scale.
Marketing[edit]
Main article: Marketing
Marketing is defined by the American Marketing Association as "the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large."[13] The term developed from the original meaning which referred literally to going to a market to buy or sell goods or services. Marketing tactics include advertising as well as determining product pricing.
Research and development[edit]
Main article: Research and development
Research and development refers to activities in connection with corporate or government innovation. Research and development constitutes the first stage of development of a potential new service or product. Research and development are very difficult to manage, since the defining feature of research is that the researchers do not know in advance exactly how to accomplish the desired result.[citation needed]
Sales[edit]
Main article: Sales
Sales is activity related to selling or the amount of goods or services sold in a given time period.
Management[edit]
Main article: Management
See also: Outline of business management
The efficient and effective operation of a business, and study of this subject, is called management. The major branches of management are financial management, marketing management, human resource management, strategic management, production management, operations management, service management, and information technology management.[citation needed]
Owners may manage their businesses themselves, or employ managers to do so for them. Whether they are owners or employees, managers administer three primary components of the business' value: financial resources, capital (tangible resources), and human resources. These resources are administered in at least five functional areas: legal contracting, manufacturing or service production, marketing, accounting, financing, and human resources.[citation needed]
Restructuring state enterprises[edit]
In recent decades, states modeled some of their assets and enterprises after business enterprises. In 2003, for example, the People's Republic of China modeled 80% of its state-owned enterprises on a company-type management system.[14] Many state institutions and enterprises in China and Russia have transformed into joint-stock companies, with part of their shares being listed on public stock markets.
Business process management (BPM) is a holistic management approach focused on aligning all aspects of an organization with the wants and needs of clients. BPM attempts to improve processes continuously. It can therefore be described as a "process optimization process". It is argued that BPM enables organizations to be more efficient, effective and capable of change than a functionally focused, traditional hierarchical management approach.[who?]
Organization and regulation[edit]
See also: Theory of the firm
Most legal jurisdictions specify the forms of ownership that a business can take, creating a body of commercial law for each type.
The major factors affecting how a business is organized are usually:

The size and scope of the business firm and its structure, management, and ownership, broadly analyzed in the theory of the firm. Generally, a smaller business is more flexible, while larger businesses, or those with wider ownership or more formal structures, will usually tend to be organized as corporations or (less often) partnerships. In addition, a business that wishes to raise money on a stock market or to be owned by a wide range of people will often be required to adopt a specific legal form to do so.
The sector and country. Private profit-making businesses are different from government-owned bodies. In some countries, certain businesses are legally obliged to be organized in certain ways.
Tax advantages. Different structures are treated differently in tax law, and may have advantages for this reason.
Disclosure and compliance requirements. Different business structures may be required to make less or more information public (or report it to relevant authorities), and may be bound to comply with different rules and regulations.

Many businesses are operated through a separate entity such as a corporation or a partnership (either formed with or without limited liability). Most legal jurisdictions allow people to organize such an entity by filing certain charter documents with the relevant Secretary of State or equivalent, and complying with certain other ongoing obligations. The relationships and legal rights of shareholders, limited partners, or members are governed partly by the charter documents and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the entity is organized. Generally speaking, shareholders in a corporation, limited partners in a limited partnership, and members in a limited liability company are shielded from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the entity, which is legally treated as a separate "person". This means that unless there is misconduct, the owner's own possessions are strongly protected in law if the business does not succeed.
Where two or more individuals own a business together but have failed to organize a more specialized form of vehicle, they will be treated as a general partnership. The terms of a partnership are partly governed by a partnership agreement if one is created, and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. No paperwork or filing is necessary to create a partnership, and without an agreement, the relationships and legal rights of the partners will be entirely governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. A single person who owns and runs a business is commonly known as a sole proprietor, whether that person owns it directly or through a formally organized entity. Depending on the business needs, an adviser can decide what kind is proprietorship will be most suitable.
A few relevant factors to consider in deciding how to operate a business include:

General partners in a partnership (other than a limited liability partnership), plus anyone who personally owns and operates a business without creating a separate legal entity, are personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business.
Generally, corporations are required to pay tax just like "real" people. In some tax systems, this can give rise to so-called double taxation, because first the corporation pays tax on the profit, and then when the corporation distributes its profits to its owners, individuals have to include dividends in their income when they complete their personal tax returns, at which point a second layer of income tax is imposed.
In most countries, there are laws which treat small corporations differently from large ones. They may be exempt from certain legal filing requirements or labor laws, have simplified procedures in specialized areas, and have simplified, advantageous, or slightly different tax treatment.
"Going public" through a process known as an initial public offering (IPO) means that part of the business will be owned by members of the public. This requires the organization as a distinct entity, to disclose information to the public, and adhering to a tighter set of laws and procedures. Most public entities are corporations that have sold shares, but increasingly there are also public LLC's that sell units (sometimes also called shares), and other more exotic entities as well, such as, for example, real estate investment trusts in the USA, and unit trusts in the UK. A general partnership cannot "go public".

Commercial law[edit]
Main article: Corporate law




Offices in the Los Angeles Downtown Financial District


A very detailed and well-established body of rules that evolved over a very long period of time applies to commercial transactions. The need to regulate trade and commerce and resolve business disputes helped shape the creation of law and courts. The Code of Hammurabi dates back to about 1772 BC for example, and contains provisions that relate, among other matters, to shipping costs and dealings between merchants and brokers.[15] The word "corporation" derives from the Latin corpus, meaning body, and the Maurya Empire in Iron-Age India accorded legal rights to business entities.[16]
In many countries, it is difficult to compile all the laws that can affect a business into a single reference source. Laws can govern treatment of labour and employee relations, worker protection and safety, discrimination on the basis of age, gender, disability, race, and in some jurisdictions, sexual orientation, and the minimum wage, as well as unions, worker compensation, and working hours and leave.
Some specialized businesses may also require licenses, either due to laws governing entry into certain trades, occupations or professions, that require special education, or to raise revenue for local governments. Professions that require special licenses include law, medicine, piloting aircraft, selling liquor, radio broadcasting, selling investment securities, selling used cars, and roofing. Local jurisdictions may also require special licenses and taxes just to operate a business.
Some businesses are subject to ongoing special regulation, for example, public utilities, investment securities, banking, insurance, broadcasting, aviation, and health care providers. Environmental regulations are also very complex and can affect many businesses.
Capital[edit]




Mexican Stock Exchange in Paseo de la Reforma, Mexico City


When businesses need to raise money (called capital), they sometimes offer securities for sale.
Capital may be raised through private means, by an initial public offering or IPO on a stock exchange, or in other ways.
Major stock exchanges include the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Singapore Exchange, Hong Kong Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ (USA), the London Stock Exchange (UK), the Tokyo Stock Exchange (Japan), and Bombay Stock Exchange (India). Most countries with capital markets have at least one.
Businesses that have gone public are subject to regulations concerning their internal governance, such as how executive officers' compensation is determined, and when and how information is disclosed to shareholders and to the public. In the United States, these regulations are primarily implemented and enforced by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Other western nations have comparable regulatory bodies. The regulations are implemented and enforced by the China Securities Regulation Commission (CSRC) in China. In Singapore, the regulation authority is the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and in Hong Kong, it is the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).
The proliferation and increasing complexity of the laws governing business have forced increasing specialization in corporate law. It is not unheard of for certain kinds of corporate transactions to require a team of five to ten attorneys due to sprawling regulation. Commercial law spans general corporate law, employment and labor law, health-care law, securities law, mergers and acquisitions, tax law, employee benefit plans, food and drug regulation, intellectual property law on copyrights, patents, trademarks, telecommunications law, and financing.
Other types of capital sourcing includes crowd sourcing on the Internet, venture capital, bank loans, and debentures.
Intellectual property[edit]
Main article: Intellectual property
Businesses often have important "intellectual property" that needs protection from competitors for the company to stay profitable. This could require patents, copyrights, trademarks, or preservation of trade secrets. Most businesses have names, logos, and similar branding techniques that could benefit from trademarking. Patents and copyrights in the United States are largely governed by federal law, while trade secrets and trademarking are mostly a matter of state law. Because of the nature of intellectual property, a business needs protection in every jurisdiction in which they are concerned about competitors. Many countries are signatories to international treaties concerning intellectual property, and thus companies registered in these countries are subject to national laws bound by these treaties. In order to protect trade secrets, companies may require employees to sign non-compete clauses which will impose limitations on an employee's interactions with stakeholders, and competitors.
Trade union[edit]
Main article: Trade union
A trade union (or labor union) is an organization of workers who have come together to achieve common goals such as protecting the integrity of its trade, improving safety standards, achieving higher pay and benefits such as health care and retirement, increasing the number of employees an employer assigns to complete the work, and better working conditions. The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members (rank and file members) and negotiates labour contracts (collective bargaining) with employers. The most common purpose of these associations or unions is "maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment".[17] This may include the negotiation of wages, work rules, complaint procedures, rules governing hiring, firing and promotion of workers, benefits, workplace safety and policies.

A business (also known as an enterprise, a company or a firm) is an organizational entity involved in the provision of goods and services to consumers.[1][2] Businesses serve as conductors of economic activity, and are prevalent in capitalist economies, where most of them are privately owned and provide goods and services allocated through a market to consumers and customers in exchange for other goods, services, money, or other forms of exchange that hold intrinsic economic value. Businesses may also be social non-profit enterprises or state-owned public enterprises operated by governments with specific social and economic objectives. A business owned by multiple private individuals may form as an incorporated company or jointly organise as a partnership. Countries have different laws that may ascribe different rights to the various business entities.
The word "business" can refer to a particular organization or to an entire market sector (for example, "the finance business" is "the financial sector") or to all economic sectors collectively ("the business sector"). Compound forms such as "agribusiness" represent subsets of the concept's broader meaning, which encompasses all activity by suppliers of goods and services.
Typically private-sector businesses aim to maximize their profit, although in some contexts they may aim to maximize their sales revenue or their market share. Government-run businesses may aim to maximize some measure of social welfare.

Basic forms of ownership[edit]
Forms of business ownership vary by jurisdiction, but several common entities exist:

Sole proprietorship: A sole proprietorship, also known as a sole trader, is owned by one person and operates for their benefit. The owner operates the business alone and may hire employees. A sole proprietor has unlimited liability for all obligations incurred by the business, whether from operating costs or judgements against the business. All assets of the business belong to a sole proprietor, including, for example, computer infrastructure, any inventory, manufacturing equipment, or retail fixtures, as well as any real property owned by the sole proprietor.
Partnership: A partnership is a business owned by two or more people. In most forms of partnerships, each partner has unlimited liability for the debts incurred by the business. The three most prevalent types of for-profit partnerships are: general partnerships, limited partnerships, and limited liability partnerships.[3]
Corporation: The owners of a corporation have limited liability and the business has a separate legal personality from its owners. Corporations can be either government-owned or privately owned. They can organize either for profit or as nonprofit organizations. A privately owned, for-profit corporation is owned by its shareholders, who elect a board of directors to direct the corporation and hire its managerial staff. A privately owned, for-profit corporation can be either privately held by a small group of individuals, or publicly held, with publicly traded shares listed on a stock exchange.
Cooperative: Often referred to as a "co-op", a cooperative is a limited-liability business that can organize as for-profit or not-for-profit. A cooperative differs from a corporation in that it has members, not shareholders, and they share decision-making authority. Cooperatives are typically classified as either consumer cooperatives or worker cooperatives. Cooperatives are fundamental to the ideology of economic democracy.
Limited liability companies (LLC), limited liability partnerships, and other specific types of business organization protect their owners or shareholders from business failure by doing business under a separate legal entity with certain legal protections. In contrast, unincorporated businesses or persons working on their own are usually not as protected.[4][5]
Franchises: A franchise is a system in which entrepreneurs purchase the rights to open and run a business from a larger corporation.[6] Franchising in the United States is widespread and is a major economic powerhouse. One out of twelve retail businesses in the United States are franchised and 8 million people are employed in a franchised business.[7]

Classifications[edit]

Financial services businesses include banks, brokerage firms, credit unions, credit cards, insurance companies, asset and investment companies such as private equity firms, real estate investment trusts, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, mutual funds, index funds, and hedge funds, stock exchanges, and other companies that generate profits through investment and management of capital.
Entertainment and mass media companies generate profits primarily from the sale of intellectual property â they include film studios and production houses, mass media companies such as cable television networks, online digital media agencies, mobile media outlets, newspapers, book and magazine publishing houses.
Industrial manufacturers produce products, either from raw materials or from component parts, then export the finished products at a profit - they include tangible goods such as cars, glass, or aircraft.
Real estate businesses sell, invest, construct and develop properties â including land, residential homes, and other buildings.
Retailers, wholesalers, and distributors act as middlemen and get goods produced by manufacturers to the intended consumers; they make their profits by marking up their prices. Most stores and catalog companies are distributors or retailers.
Transportation businesses such as railways, airlines, shipping companies that deliver goods and individuals to their destinations for a fee.
Utilities produce public services such as electricity, waste management or sewage treatment, usually under the charge of a government.
Service businesses offer intangible goods or services and typically charge for labor or other services provided to government, to consumers, or to other businesses. Interior decorators, hairstylists, tanning salons, laundromats, and pest controllers are service businesses.

Business activities[edit]
Accounting[edit]
Main article: Accounting
Accounting is the measurement, processing and communication of financial information about economic entities[8][9] such as businesses and corporations. The modern field was established by the Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli in 1494.[10] Accounting, which has been called the "language of business",[11] measures the results of an organization's economic activities and conveys this information to a variety of users, including investors, creditors, management, and regulators.[12] Practitioners of accounting are known as accountants. The terms "accounting" and "financial reporting" are often used as synonyms.
Finance[edit]
Main article: Finance
Finance is a field that deals with the study of investments. It includes the dynamics of assets and liabilities over time under conditions of different degrees of uncertainty and risk. Finance can also be defined as the science of money management. Finance aims to price assets based on their risk level and their expected rate of return. Finance can be broken into three different sub-categories: public finance, corporate finance and personal finance.
Manufacturing[edit]
Main article: Manufacturing
Manufacturing is the production of merchandise for use or sale using labour and machines, tools, chemical and biological processing, or formulation. The term may refer to a range of human activity, from handicraft to high tech, but is most commonly applied to industrial production, in which raw materials are transformed into finished goods on a large scale.
Marketing[edit]
Main article: Marketing
Marketing is defined by the American Marketing Association as "the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large."[13] The term developed from the original meaning which referred literally to going to a market to buy or sell goods or services. Marketing tactics include advertising as well as determining product pricing.
Research and development[edit]
Main article: Research and development
Research and development refers to activities in connection with corporate or government innovation. Research and development constitutes the first stage of development of a potential new service or product. Research and development are very difficult to manage, since the defining feature of research is that the researchers do not know in advance exactly how to accomplish the desired result.[citation needed]
Sales[edit]
Main article: Sales
Sales is activity related to selling or the amount of goods or services sold in a given time period.
Management[edit]
Main article: Management
See also: Outline of business management
The efficient and effective operation of a business, and study of this subject, is called management. The major branches of management are financial management, marketing management, human resource management, strategic management, production management, operations management, service management, and information technology management.[citation needed]
Owners may manage their businesses themselves, or employ managers to do so for them. Whether they are owners or employees, managers administer three primary components of the business' value: financial resources, capital (tangible resources), and human resources. These resources are administered in at least five functional areas: legal contracting, manufacturing or service production, marketing, accounting, financing, and human resources.[citation needed]
Restructuring state enterprises[edit]
In recent decades, states modeled some of their assets and enterprises after business enterprises. In 2003, for example, the People's Republic of China modeled 80% of its state-owned enterprises on a company-type management system.[14] Many state institutions and enterprises in China and Russia have transformed into joint-stock companies, with part of their shares being listed on public stock markets.
Business process management (BPM) is a holistic management approach focused on aligning all aspects of an organization with the wants and needs of clients. BPM attempts to improve processes continuously. It can therefore be described as a "process optimization process". It is argued that BPM enables organizations to be more efficient, effective and capable of change than a functionally focused, traditional hierarchical management approach.[who?]
Organization and regulation[edit]
See also: Theory of the firm
Most legal jurisdictions specify the forms of ownership that a business can take, creating a body of commercial law for each type.
The major factors affecting how a business is organized are usually:

The size and scope of the business firm and its structure, management, and ownership, broadly analyzed in the theory of the firm. Generally, a smaller business is more flexible, while larger businesses, or those with wider ownership or more formal structures, will usually tend to be organized as corporations or (less often) partnerships. In addition, a business that wishes to raise money on a stock market or to be owned by a wide range of people will often be required to adopt a specific legal form to do so.
The sector and country. Private profit-making businesses are different from government-owned bodies. In some countries, certain businesses are legally obliged to be organized in certain ways.
Tax advantages. Different structures are treated differently in tax law, and may have advantages for this reason.
Disclosure and compliance requirements. Different business structures may be required to make less or more information public (or report it to relevant authorities), and may be bound to comply with different rules and regulations.

Many businesses are operated through a separate entity such as a corporation or a partnership (either formed with or without limited liability). Most legal jurisdictions allow people to organize such an entity by filing certain charter documents with the relevant Secretary of State or equivalent, and complying with certain other ongoing obligations. The relationships and legal rights of shareholders, limited partners, or members are governed partly by the charter documents and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the entity is organized. Generally speaking, shareholders in a corporation, limited partners in a limited partnership, and members in a limited liability company are shielded from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the entity, which is legally treated as a separate "person". This means that unless there is misconduct, the owner's own possessions are strongly protected in law if the business does not succeed.
Where two or more individuals own a business together but have failed to organize a more specialized form of vehicle, they will be treated as a general partnership. The terms of a partnership are partly governed by a partnership agreement if one is created, and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. No paperwork or filing is necessary to create a partnership, and without an agreement, the relationships and legal rights of the partners will be entirely governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. A single person who owns and runs a business is commonly known as a sole proprietor, whether that person owns it directly or through a formally organized entity. Depending on the business needs, an adviser can decide what kind is proprietorship will be most suitable.
A few relevant factors to consider in deciding how to operate a business include:

General partners in a partnership (other than a limited liability partnership), plus anyone who personally owns and operates a business without creating a separate legal entity, are personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business.
Generally, corporations are required to pay tax just like "real" people. In some tax systems, this can give rise to so-called double taxation, because first the corporation pays tax on the profit, and then when the corporation distributes its profits to its owners, individuals have to include dividends in their income when they complete their personal tax returns, at which point a second layer of income tax is imposed.
In most countries, there are laws which treat small corporations differently from large ones. They may be exempt from certain legal filing requirements or labor laws, have simplified procedures in specialized areas, and have simplified, advantageous, or slightly different tax treatment.
"Going public" through a process known as an initial public offering (IPO) means that part of the business will be owned by members of the public. This requires the organization as a distinct entity, to disclose information to the public, and adhering to a tighter set of laws and procedures. Most public entities are corporations that have sold shares, but increasingly there are also public LLC's that sell units (sometimes also called shares), and other more exotic entities as well, such as, for example, real estate investment trusts in the USA, and unit trusts in the UK. A general partnership cannot "go public".

Commercial law[edit]
Main article: Corporate law




Offices in the Los Angeles Downtown Financial District


A very detailed and well-established body of rules that evolved over a very long period of time applies to commercial transactions. The need to regulate trade and commerce and resolve business disputes helped shape the creation of law and courts. The Code of Hammurabi dates back to about 1772 BC for example, and contains provisions that relate, among other matters, to shipping costs and dealings between merchants and brokers.[15] The word "corporation" derives from the Latin corpus, meaning body, and the Maurya Empire in Iron-Age India accorded legal rights to business entities.[16]
In many countries, it is difficult to compile all the laws that can affect a business into a single reference source. Laws can govern treatment of labour and employee relations, worker protection and safety, discrimination on the basis of age, gender, disability, race, and in some jurisdictions, sexual orientation, and the minimum wage, as well as unions, worker compensation, and working hours and leave.
Some specialized businesses may also require licenses, either due to laws governing entry into certain trades, occupations or professions, that require special education, or to raise revenue for local governments. Professions that require special licenses include law, medicine, piloting aircraft, selling liquor, radio broadcasting, selling investment securities, selling used cars, and roofing. Local jurisdictions may also require special licenses and taxes just to operate a business.
Some businesses are subject to ongoing special regulation, for example, public utilities, investment securities, banking, insurance, broadcasting, aviation, and health care providers. Environmental regulations are also very complex and can affect many businesses.
Capital[edit]




Mexican Stock Exchange in Paseo de la Reforma, Mexico City


When businesses need to raise money (called capital), they sometimes offer securities for sale.
Capital may be raised through private means, by an initial public offering or IPO on a stock exchange, or in other ways.
Major stock exchanges include the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Singapore Exchange, Hong Kong Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ (USA), the London Stock Exchange (UK), the Tokyo Stock Exchange (Japan), and Bombay Stock Exchange (India). Most countries with capital markets have at least one.
Businesses that have gone public are subject to regulations concerning their internal governance, such as how executive officers' compensation is determined, and when and how information is disclosed to shareholders and to the public. In the United States, these regulations are primarily implemented and enforced by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Other western nations have comparable regulatory bodies. The regulations are implemented and enforced by the China Securities Regulation Commission (CSRC) in China. In Singapore, the regulation authority is the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and in Hong Kong, it is the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).
The proliferation and increasing complexity of the laws governing business have forced increasing specialization in corporate law. It is not unheard of for certain kinds of corporate transactions to require a team of five to ten attorneys due to sprawling regulation. Commercial law spans general corporate law, employment and labor law, health-care law, securities law, mergers and acquisitions, tax law, employee benefit plans, food and drug regulation, intellectual property law on copyrights, patents, trademarks, telecommunications law, and financing.
Other types of capital sourcing includes crowd sourcing on the Internet, venture capital, bank loans, and debentures.
Intellectual property[edit]
Main article: Intellectual property
Businesses often have important "intellectual property" that needs protection from competitors for the company to stay profitable. This could require patents, copyrights, trademarks, or preservation of trade secrets. Most businesses have names, logos, and similar branding techniques that could benefit from trademarking. Patents and copyrights in the United States are largely governed by federal law, while trade secrets and trademarking are mostly a matter of state law. Because of the nature of intellectual property, a business needs protection in every jurisdiction in which they are concerned about competitors. Many countries are signatories to international treaties concerning intellectual property, and thus companies registered in these countries are subject to national laws bound by these treaties. In order to protect trade secrets, companies may require employees to sign non-compete clauses which will impose limitations on an employee's interactions with stakeholders, and competitors.
Trade union[edit]
Main article: Trade union
A trade union (or labor union) is an organization of workers who have come together to achieve common goals such as protecting the integrity of its trade, improving safety standards, achieving higher pay and benefits such as health care and retirement, increasing the number of employees an employer assigns to complete the work, and better working conditions. The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members (rank and file members) and negotiates labour contracts (collective bargaining) with employers. The most common purpose of these associations or unions is "maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment".[17] This may include the negotiation of wages, work rules, complaint procedures, rules governing hiring, firing and promotion of workers, benefits, workplace safety and policies.

A business (also known as an enterprise, a company or a firm) is an organizational entity involved in the provision of goods and services to consumers.[1][2] Businesses serve as conductors of economic activity, and are prevalent in capitalist economies, where most of them are privately owned and provide goods and services allocated through a market to consumers and customers in exchange for other goods, services, money, or other forms of exchange that hold intrinsic economic value. Businesses may also be social non-profit enterprises or state-owned public enterprises operated by governments with specific social and economic objectives. A business owned by multiple private individuals may form as an incorporated company or jointly organise as a partnership. Countries have different laws that may ascribe different rights to the various business entities.
The word "business" can refer to a particular organization or to an entire market sector (for example, "the finance business" is "the financial sector") or to all economic sectors collectively ("the business sector"). Compound forms such as "agribusiness" represent subsets of the concept's broader meaning, which encompasses all activity by suppliers of goods and services.
Typically private-sector businesses aim to maximize their profit, although in some contexts they may aim to maximize their sales revenue or their market share. Government-run businesses may aim to maximize some measure of social welfare.

Basic forms of ownership[edit]
Forms of business ownership vary by jurisdiction, but several common entities exist:

Sole proprietorship: A sole proprietorship, also known as a sole trader, is owned by one person and operates for their benefit. The owner operates the business alone and may hire employees. A sole proprietor has unlimited liability for all obligations incurred by the business, whether from operating costs or judgements against the business. All assets of the business belong to a sole proprietor, including, for example, computer infrastructure, any inventory, manufacturing equipment, or retail fixtures, as well as any real property owned by the sole proprietor.
Partnership: A partnership is a business owned by two or more people. In most forms of partnerships, each partner has unlimited liability for the debts incurred by the business. The three most prevalent types of for-profit partnerships are: general partnerships, limited partnerships, and limited liability partnerships.[3]
Corporation: The owners of a corporation have limited liability and the business has a separate legal personality from its owners. Corporations can be either government-owned or privately owned. They can organize either for profit or as nonprofit organizations. A privately owned, for-profit corporation is owned by its shareholders, who elect a board of directors to direct the corporation and hire its managerial staff. A privately owned, for-profit corporation can be either privately held by a small group of individuals, or publicly held, with publicly traded shares listed on a stock exchange.
Cooperative: Often referred to as a "co-op", a cooperative is a limited-liability business that can organize as for-profit or not-for-profit. A cooperative differs from a corporation in that it has members, not shareholders, and they share decision-making authority. Cooperatives are typically classified as either consumer cooperatives or worker cooperatives. Cooperatives are fundamental to the ideology of economic democracy.
Limited liability companies (LLC), limited liability partnerships, and other specific types of business organization protect their owners or shareholders from business failure by doing business under a separate legal entity with certain legal protections. In contrast, unincorporated businesses or persons working on their own are usually not as protected.[4][5]
Franchises: A franchise is a system in which entrepreneurs purchase the rights to open and run a business from a larger corporation.[6] Franchising in the United States is widespread and is a major economic powerhouse. One out of twelve retail businesses in the United States are franchised and 8 million people are employed in a franchised business.[7]

Classifications[edit]

Financial services businesses include banks, brokerage firms, credit unions, credit cards, insurance companies, asset and investment companies such as private equity firms, real estate investment trusts, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, mutual funds, index funds, and hedge funds, stock exchanges, and other companies that generate profits through investment and management of capital.
Entertainment and mass media companies generate profits primarily from the sale of intellectual property â they include film studios and production houses, mass media companies such as cable television networks, online digital media agencies, mobile media outlets, newspapers, book and magazine publishing houses.
Industrial manufacturers produce products, either from raw materials or from component parts, then export the finished products at a profit - they include tangible goods such as cars, glass, or aircraft.
Real estate businesses sell, invest, construct and develop properties â including land, residential homes, and other buildings.
Retailers, wholesalers, and distributors act as middlemen and get goods produced by manufacturers to the intended consumers; they make their profits by marking up their prices. Most stores and catalog companies are distributors or retailers.
Transportation businesses such as railways, airlines, shipping companies that deliver goods and individuals to their destinations for a fee.
Utilities produce public services such as electricity, waste management or sewage treatment, usually under the charge of a government.
Service businesses offer intangible goods or services and typically charge for labor or other services provided to government, to consumers, or to other businesses. Interior decorators, hairstylists, tanning salons, laundromats, and pest controllers are service businesses.

Business activities[edit]
Accounting[edit]
Main article: Accounting
Accounting is the measurement, processing and communication of financial information about economic entities[8][9] such as businesses and corporations. The modern field was established by the Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli in 1494.[10] Accounting, which has been called the "language of business",[11] measures the results of an organization's economic activities and conveys this information to a variety of users, including investors, creditors, management, and regulators.[12] Practitioners of accounting are known as accountants. The terms "accounting" and "financial reporting" are often used as synonyms.
Finance[edit]
Main article: Finance
Finance is a field that deals with the study of investments. It includes the dynamics of assets and liabilities over time under conditions of different degrees of uncertainty and risk. Finance can also be defined as the science of money management. Finance aims to price assets based on their risk level and their expected rate of return. Finance can be broken into three different sub-categories: public finance, corporate finance and personal finance.
Manufacturing[edit]
Main article: Manufacturing
Manufacturing is the production of merchandise for use or sale using labour and machines, tools, chemical and biological processing, or formulation. The term may refer to a range of human activity, from handicraft to high tech, but is most commonly applied to industrial production, in which raw materials are transformed into finished goods on a large scale.
Marketing[edit]
Main article: Marketing
Marketing is defined by the American Marketing Association as "the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large."[13] The term developed from the original meaning which referred literally to going to a market to buy or sell goods or services. Marketing tactics include advertising as well as determining product pricing.
Research and development[edit]
Main article: Research and development
Research and development refers to activities in connection with corporate or government innovation. Research and development constitutes the first stage of development of a potential new service or product. Research and development are very difficult to manage, since the defining feature of research is that the researchers do not know in advance exactly how to accomplish the desired result.[citation needed]
Sales[edit]
Main article: Sales
Sales is activity related to selling or the amount of goods or services sold in a given time period.
Management[edit]
Main article: Management
See also: Outline of business management
The efficient and effective operation of a business, and study of this subject, is called management. The major branches of management are financial management, marketing management, human resource management, strategic management, production management, operations management, service management, and information technology management.[citation needed]
Owners may manage their businesses themselves, or employ managers to do so for them. Whether they are owners or employees, managers administer three primary components of the business' value: financial resources, capital (tangible resources), and human resources. These resources are administered in at least five functional areas: legal contracting, manufacturing or service production, marketing, accounting, financing, and human resources.[citation needed]
Restructuring state enterprises[edit]
In recent decades, states modeled some of their assets and enterprises after business enterprises. In 2003, for example, the People's Republic of China modeled 80% of its state-owned enterprises on a company-type management system.[14] Many state institutions and enterprises in China and Russia have transformed into joint-stock companies, with part of their shares being listed on public stock markets.
Business process management (BPM) is a holistic management approach focused on aligning all aspects of an organization with the wants and needs of clients. BPM attempts to improve processes continuously. It can therefore be described as a "process optimization process". It is argued that BPM enables organizations to be more efficient, effective and capable of change than a functionally focused, traditional hierarchical management approach.[who?]
Organization and regulation[edit]
See also: Theory of the firm
Most legal jurisdictions specify the forms of ownership that a business can take, creating a body of commercial law for each type.
The major factors affecting how a business is organized are usually:

The size and scope of the business firm and its structure, management, and ownership, broadly analyzed in the theory of the firm. Generally, a smaller business is more flexible, while larger businesses, or those with wider ownership or more formal structures, will usually tend to be organized as corporations or (less often) partnerships. In addition, a business that wishes to raise money on a stock market or to be owned by a wide range of people will often be required to adopt a specific legal form to do so.
The sector and country. Private profit-making businesses are different from government-owned bodies. In some countries, certain businesses are legally obliged to be organized in certain ways.
Tax advantages. Different structures are treated differently in tax law, and may have advantages for this reason.
Disclosure and compliance requirements. Different business structures may be required to make less or more information public (or report it to relevant authorities), and may be bound to comply with different rules and regulations.

Many businesses are operated through a separate entity such as a corporation or a partnership (either formed with or without limited liability). Most legal jurisdictions allow people to organize such an entity by filing certain charter documents with the relevant Secretary of State or equivalent, and complying with certain other ongoing obligations. The relationships and legal rights of shareholders, limited partners, or members are governed partly by the charter documents and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the entity is organized. Generally speaking, shareholders in a corporation, limited partners in a limited partnership, and members in a limited liability company are shielded from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the entity, which is legally treated as a separate "person". This means that unless there is misconduct, the owner's own possessions are strongly protected in law if the business does not succeed.
Where two or more individuals own a business together but have failed to organize a more specialized form of vehicle, they will be treated as a general partnership. The terms of a partnership are partly governed by a partnership agreement if one is created, and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. No paperwork or filing is necessary to create a partnership, and without an agreement, the relationships and legal rights of the partners will be entirely governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. A single person who owns and runs a business is commonly known as a sole proprietor, whether that person owns it directly or through a formally organized entity. Depending on the business needs, an adviser can decide what kind is proprietorship will be most suitable.
A few relevant factors to consider in deciding how to operate a business include:

General partners in a partnership (other than a limited liability partnership), plus anyone who personally owns and operates a business without creating a separate legal entity, are personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business.
Generally, corporations are required to pay tax just like "real" people. In some tax systems, this can give rise to so-called double taxation, because first the corporation pays tax on the profit, and then when the corporation distributes its profits to its owners, individuals have to include dividends in their income when they complete their personal tax returns, at which point a second layer of income tax is imposed.
In most countries, there are laws which treat small corporations differently from large ones. They may be exempt from certain legal filing requirements or labor laws, have simplified procedures in specialized areas, and have simplified, advantageous, or slightly different tax treatment.
"Going public" through a process known as an initial public offering (IPO) means that part of the business will be owned by members of the public. This requires the organization as a distinct entity, to disclose information to the public, and adhering to a tighter set of laws and procedures. Most public entities are corporations that have sold shares, but increasingly there are also public LLC's that sell units (sometimes also called shares), and other more exotic entities as well, such as, for example, real estate investment trusts in the USA, and unit trusts in the UK. A general partnership cannot "go public".

Commercial law[edit]
Main article: Corporate law




Offices in the Los Angeles Downtown Financial District


A very detailed and well-established body of rules that evolved over a very long period of time applies to commercial transactions. The need to regulate trade and commerce and resolve business disputes helped shape the creation of law and courts. The Code of Hammurabi dates back to about 1772 BC for example, and contains provisions that relate, among other matters, to shipping costs and dealings between merchants and brokers.[15] The word "corporation" derives from the Latin corpus, meaning body, and the Maurya Empire in Iron-Age India accorded legal rights to business entities.[16]
In many countries, it is difficult to compile all the laws that can affect a business into a single reference source. Laws can govern treatment of labour and employee relations, worker protection and safety, discrimination on the basis of age, gender, disability, race, and in some jurisdictions, sexual orientation, and the minimum wage, as well as unions, worker compensation, and working hours and leave.
Some specialized businesses may also require licenses, either due to laws governing entry into certain trades, occupations or professions, that require special education, or to raise revenue for local governments. Professions that require special licenses include law, medicine, piloting aircraft, selling liquor, radio broadcasting, selling investment securities, selling used cars, and roofing. Local jurisdictions may also require special licenses and taxes just to operate a business.
Some businesses are subject to ongoing special regulation, for example, public utilities, investment securities, banking, insurance, broadcasting, aviation, and health care providers. Environmental regulations are also very complex and can affect many businesses.
Capital[edit]




Mexican Stock Exchange in Paseo de la Reforma, Mexico City


When businesses need to raise money (called capital), they sometimes offer securities for sale.
Capital may be raised through private means, by an initial public offering or IPO on a stock exchange, or in other ways.
Major stock exchanges include the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Singapore Exchange, Hong Kong Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ (USA), the London Stock Exchange (UK), the Tokyo Stock Exchange (Japan), and Bombay Stock Exchange (India). Most countries with capital markets have at least one.
Businesses that have gone public are subject to regulations concerning their internal governance, such as how executive officers' compensation is determined, and when and how information is disclosed to shareholders and to the public. In the United States, these regulations are primarily implemented and enforced by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Other western nations have comparable regulatory bodies. The regulations are implemented and enforced by the China Securities Regulation Commission (CSRC) in China. In Singapore, the regulation authority is the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and in Hong Kong, it is the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).
The proliferation and increasing complexity of the laws governing business have forced increasing specialization in corporate law. It is not unheard of for certain kinds of corporate transactions to require a team of five to ten attorneys due to sprawling regulation. Commercial law spans general corporate law, employment and labor law, health-care law, securities law, mergers and acquisitions, tax law, employee benefit plans, food and drug regulation, intellectual property law on copyrights, patents, trademarks, telecommunications law, and financing.
Other types of capital sourcing includes crowd sourcing on the Internet, venture capital, bank loans, and debentures.
Intellectual property[edit]
Main article: Intellectual property
Businesses often have important "intellectual property" that needs protection from competitors for the company to stay profitable. This could require patents, copyrights, trademarks, or preservation of trade secrets. Most businesses have names, logos, and similar branding techniques that could benefit from trademarking. Patents and copyrights in the United States are largely governed by federal law, while trade secrets and trademarking are mostly a matter of state law. Because of the nature of intellectual property, a business needs protection in every jurisdiction in which they are concerned about competitors. Many countries are signatories to international treaties concerning intellectual property, and thus companies registered in these countries are subject to national laws bound by these treaties. In order to protect trade secrets, companies may require employees to sign non-compete clauses which will impose limitations on an employee's interactions with stakeholders, and competitors.
Trade union[edit]
Main article: Trade union
A trade union (or labor union) is an organization of workers who have come together to achieve common goals such as protecting the integrity of its trade, improving safety standards, achieving higher pay and benefits such as health care and retirement, increasing the number of employees an employer assigns to complete the work, and better working conditions. The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members (rank and file members) and negotiates labour contracts (collective bargaining) with employers. The most common purpose of these associations or unions is "maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment".[17] This may include the negotiation of wages, work rules, complaint procedures, rules governing hiring, firing and promotion of workers, benefits, workplace safety and policies.

Do I need to worry about securities laws when I issue stock in my corporation?

Securities laws are meant to protect investors from unscrupulous business owners. These laws require corporations to jump through some hoops before accepting investments in exchange for shares of stock (the "securities"). Technically, a corporation is required to register the sale of shares with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its state securities agency before granting stock to the initial corporate owners (shareholders). Registration takes time and typically involves extra legal and accounting fees.
Fortunately, many small corporations can skip the registration process because of exemptions provided by both federal and state laws. For example, SEC rules don't require a corporation to register a "private offering," which is a non-advertised sale of stock to either:

a limited number of people (generally 35 or fewer), or
those who, because of their net worth or income earning capacity, can reasonably be expected to take care of themselves in the investment process.

Most states have enacted their own versions of this popular federal exemption.
If you and a few associates are setting up a corporation that you'll actively manage, you will no doubt qualify for an exemption, and you will not have to file any paperwork. For more information about federal exemptions, visit the SEC website at www.sec.gov. For more information on your state's exemption rules, go to your secretary of state's website; you can find links to each state's site at the website of the National Association of Secretaries of State, www.nass.org.



What is "limited liability" and why is it important?

If a business owner has "limited liability," it means that he or she is not personally responsible for business debts and obligations of the corporation. In other words, if the corporation is sued, only the assets of the business are at risk, not the owners' (shareholders) personal assets, such as their houses or cars. The corporation's owners must comply with certain corporate formalities, keep up with paperwork requirements, and adequately fund ("capitalize") their business to maintain this limited liability privilege. For more information, see Nolo's article Corporation Basics.
Limited liability, traditionally associated with corporations, is the main reason most people consider incorporating. However, other business structures, such as limited liability companies (LLCs), now offer this limited personal liability to business owners. Sole proprietorships and general partnerships do not.



How are corporations different from partnerships, sole proprietorships, and LLCs?

Unlike corporations, partnerships and sole proprietorships do not provide limited personal liability for business debts. This means that creditors of those businesses can go after the owners' personal assets to collect what's due. However, organizing and operating a partnership or sole proprietorship is much easier than forming a corporation, because no formal paperwork is required.
A limited liability company (LLC), on the other hand, does offer limited personal liability, like a corporation. And while formal paperwork is required to form an LLC, running an LLC is less complicated than running a corporation. LLC owners do not have to hold regular ownership and management meetings or follow other corporate formalities, for example.
Corporations also differ from other business structures in the way they are taxed. The corporation itself must pay corporate income taxes on its profits -- whatever is left over after paying salaries, bonuses, and other deductible expenses. In contrast, partnerships, sole proprietorships, and LLCs are not taxed on business profits; instead, the profits "pass through" the business to the owners, who report business income or losses on their personal tax returns.
For more on corporations, see Nolo's article Corporation Basics. For more on the other business structures, see Nolo's articles LLC Basics, Partnership Basics, and Sole Proprietorship Basics.
Finally, for guidance on deciding which ownership structure is most suitable for your business, read Nolo's article Choosing the Best Ownership Structure for Your Business.



Who should form a corporation?

Because of the expense and formalities involved in setting up a corporation and issuing stock (shares in the corporation), you should form a corporation only if you have good reason to do so. If you merely want to limit your personal liability for business debts, forming a limited liability company (LLC) is probably smarter, because LLCs cost less to form and are easier to run. But here are some situations in which incorporating your business instead of forming an LLC might make sense:

Your business needs the ability to issue stock or stock options to attract key employees or outside investment capital.
Your business is so profitable that you can save significant income tax dollars by keeping some profits in the corporation each year. This strategy, called "income splitting," takes advantage of the lower tax rates on corporate income of up to $75,000. (For more information, see Nolo's article How Corporations Are Taxed.)
You own a family business and you want to begin making gifts of ownership to your family as part of your financial or estate plan or to plan for the next generation of owners. You can easily make gifts of shares in your corporation without necessarily giving up management control and, if it's done correctly, without paying gift tax.
Others insist that you incorporate your business. For example, if you are an independent contractor, companies you want to work for may ask you to incorporate before they will sign contracts for your services. These companies don't want the IRS or another government agency to reclassify you as an employee, which is very unlikely if you are incorporated.




How do I form a corporation?

There are several steps required to legally create a corporation. The first is filing a short document called "articles of incorporation" with the corporations division of your state government. (Some states refer to this organizational document as a "certificate of incorporation," a "certificate of formation," or a "charter.") You'll have to pay a filing fee that ranges from about $100 to $800, depending on the rules of the state where you file. This document contains basic information such as:

the name of your corporation
the corporation's address
the name and address of your "registered agent" (the person to be contacted by any member of the public who needs to speak to someone about the corporation), and
in some states, the names of the corporation's directors.

When forming your corporation, you must also create "corporate bylaws," a longer document that sets out the rules that govern your corporation, including decision-making procedures and voting rights.
Finally, before you start doing business, you must hold an initial meeting of your board of directors to take care of some formalities, and you need to issue shares of stock to the initial owners (shareholders).
For more information, see Nolo's article How to Form a Corporation.



Does running a corporation involve more paperwork than running other types of businesses?

Yes. Corporations must comply with statutory rules that unincorporated businesses, such as limited liability companies (LLCs), partnerships, and sole proprietorships, do not. For instance, corporations must observe corporate formalities such as holding and taking minutes of annual shareholder and director meetings and documenting important decisions. Also, corporations must file and pay taxes on a separate corporate tax return and must set up a double-entry bookkeeping system to record business transactions, complete with daily journals and a general ledger.
To learn more about corporate paperwork, read Nolo's article Documenting Corporate Decisions.



How is corporate income taxed?

Unlike sole proprietors and owners of partnerships and LLCs, a corporation's owners do not pay individual taxes on all business profits. The owners pay taxes only on profits paid out to them in the form of salaries, bonuses, and dividends. (Dividends are portions of profits that large corporations sometimes pay out to shareholders in return for their investment in the company.) The corporation pays taxes, at special corporate tax rates, on any profits that are left in the company from year to year (called "retained earnings").
Note that this taxation scheme does not apply to S corporations, which are corporations that have elected partnership-style taxation. (Regular corporations, discussed above, are called C corporations.) If your corporation elects to be taxed as an S corporation, all of the corporation's profits and losses will "pass through" to the owners, who will report them on their individual income tax returns. (To learn more about S corporations, see Nolo's article S Corporation Facts.)
For more information on regular corporate taxation, see Nolo's article How Corporations Are Taxed.



What is double taxation? Does it mean that corporate income is taxed twice?

Many people have heard that corporate income is taxed twice: once to the corporation itself and then a second time when earnings are paid out to the corporation's owners (shareholders). This is true only for earnings paid out to shareholders in the form of dividends -- that is, profits paid by the corporation to its shareholders in return for their investment in the company.
In practice, this sort of double taxation seldom occurs in a small corporation. The reason is simple: Shareholders rarely pay themselves dividends. Instead, they work for the corporation and pay themselves salaries and bonuses. Because the corporation can deduct salaries and bonuses as ordinary and necessary business expenses, it doesn't have to pay corporate tax on them. (Dividends, on the other hand, are not a tax-deductible corporate expense, so both the corporation and the shareholder must pay tax.) As long as you work for your corporation, even in a part-time or consulting capacity, you can avoid double taxation by taking home profits in the form of a salary and bonuses rather than dividends.

What is a professional corporation?

A professional corporation is a special kind of corporation that only members of certain professions, such as lawyers, doctors, and healthcare workers, can create. By forming a professional corporation, professionals can limit their personal liability for the malpractice of their associates.
For more information, see Nolo's article Professional Corporations.



What is a corporation?

What sets the corporation apart from all other types of businesses is that a corporation is an independent legal entity, separate from the people who own, control, and manage it. In other words, corporation and tax laws view the corporation as a legal "person" that can enter into contracts, incur debts, and pay taxes apart from its owners. Other important characteristics also result from the corporation's separate existence: A corporation does not dissolve when its owners (shareholders) change or die, and the owners of a corporation have limited liability -- that is, they are not personally responsible for the corporation's debts.

What happens if we forget to hold an annual meeting?
My husband and I just formed a Texas corporation this year, of which we are the only shareholders and directors. We forgot that we had, in our bylaws, set the annual meeting for the first Monday in December, which is already past. What is the best way to handle this now?




How do I quit being an S corporation officer?
I'm an officer of an S corporation, but I'd like to get out of this position and terminate my association with the corporation. If I do so, will I remain responsible for any corporate liabilities? Do I need a lawyer?




How do I start a pension plan for my C corporation?
I have just started a company, a C corporation. I want to start a pension plan by contributing the maximum possible amount into a money purchase plan and managing the assets (stocks) myself. Can I just open a brokerage account, call it XYZ Pension Fund, and do it?




Am I liable for co-shareholders' decisions in an S corporation?
My partner and I have formed an S corporation, with him as secretary and me as president. The landlord and my partner worked out the rent and it increased significantly with changes that my partner suggested to the builder. Now the rent will be too expensive for the business to succeed, in my opinion. The landlord has sent me a five-year lease to sign and it has a clause for us to sign to personally indemnify and guarantee all money. I do not intend to sign it. Can I be held personally responsible for the money that the landlord has paid the builder for this building -- or anything else?




How do I serve a corporation that has no agent?
I'm planning on filing a lawsuit against an out-of-state corporation that owns retail locations in California. I was instructed to serve its agent for service, but the company does not have one. How can I properly serve the business -- and is it legal for it to continue doing business in California without having an agent?




Can our nonprofit get in trouble for failing to file tax returns?
We live in a townhouse run by a nonprofit association. Â The CC&Rs say that Â the association is a nonprofit organization. Do we need to file taxes yearly? Our ex-treasurer did not file for the past two years. I think we might be in trouble. Are we?




Can my corporate directors be H-1B visa holders?
In California (the home state of the questioner), the law places no restrictions on who may be directors.




I want to sell but the other shareholder doesn't. Who wins?
A friend and I formed a corporation together, and we share ownership equally. The business is in financial trouble now, and I would like to sell it and make at least something out of it before it is too late. My partner says she cannot afford to buy me out and refuses to sell. What should I do?




Should my very small business incorporate in Delaware?
I have heard that Delaware has the most business-friendly corporation laws. Would I save money or gain other benefits if I incorporated my new two-owner business in Delaware, or is it better to do so in my own state?

A limited liability company (LLC) is the United States-specific form of a private limited company. It is a business structure that combines the pass-through taxation of a partnership or sole proprietorship with the limited liability of a corporation.[1][2] An LLC is not a corporation; it is a legal form of a company that provides limited liability to its owners in many jurisdictions. LLCs do not need to be organized for profit.[3] In certain U.S. states (for example, Texas), businesses that provide professional services requiring a state professional license, such as legal or medical services, may not be allowed to form an LLC but may be required to form a similar entity called a professional limited liability company (PLLC).[4]

Overview[edit]
A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is a hybrid business entity having certain characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership or sole proprietorship (depending on how many owners there are). An LLC, although a business entity, is a type of unincorporated association and is not a corporation. The primary characteristic an LLC shares with a corporation is limited liability, and the primary characteristic it shares with a partnership is the availability of pass-through income taxation. It is often more flexible than a corporation, and it is well-suited for companies with a single owner.
In the absence of express statutory guidance, most American courts have held that LLC members are subject to the same common law alter ego piercing theories as corporate shareholders. However, it is more difficult to pierce the LLC veil because LLCs do not have many formalities to maintain. So long as the LLC and the members do not commingle funds, it would be difficult to pierce this veil.[5] Membership interests in LLCs and partnership interests are also afforded a significant level of protection through the charging order mechanism. The charging order limits the creditor of a debtor-partner or a debtor-member to the debtor's share of distributions, without conferring on the creditor any voting or management rights.[citation needed] Limited liability company members may, in certain circumstances, also incur a personal liability in cases where distributions to members render the LLC insolvent.[6]
Flexibility and default rules[edit]
The phrase "unless otherwise provided for in the operating agreement" (or its equivalent) is found throughout all existing LLC statutes[citation needed] and is responsible for the flexibility the members of the LLC have in deciding how their LLC will be governed (provided it does not go outside legal bounds). State statutes typically provide automatic or "default" rules for how an LLC will be governed unless the operating agreement provides otherwise.
Similarly, the phrase "unless otherwise provided for in the by laws" is also found in all corporation law statutes[citation needed] but often refers only to a narrower range of matters.
The limited liability company ("LLC") has grown to become one of the most prevalent business forms in the United States. As the LLC's popularity has surged, unforeseen issues have emerged in these new statutes, particularly around single-member LLCs in Florida, New York, California, Colorado, and Georgia, where personal asset protection has been subverted.[7]
Effective August 1, 2013, the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act provides that the managers and controlling members of a limited liability company owe fiduciary duties of care and loyalty to the limited liability company and its members. Under the amendment (prompted by the Delaware Supreme Court's decision in Gatz Properties, LLC v. Auriga Capital Corp, November 2012), parties to an LLC remain free to expand, restrict, or eliminate fiduciary duties in their LLC agreements (subject to the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing).[8]
Under 6 Del. C. Section 18-101(7), a Delaware LLC operating agreement can be written, oral or implied. It sets forth member capital contributions, ownership percentages, and management structure. Like a prenuptial agreement, an operating agreement can avoid future disputes between members by addressing buy-out rights, valuation formulas, and transfer restrictions. A written LLC operating agreement should be signed by all of its members.[9]
Income tax[edit]
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, an LLC is treated by default as a pass-through entity.[10] If there is only one member in the company, the LLC is treated as a âdisregarded entityâ for tax purposes, and an individual owner would report the LLC's income or loss on Schedule C of his or her individual tax return. Thus, income from the LLC is taxed at the individual tax rates. The default tax status for LLCs with multiple members is as a partnership, which is required to report income and loss on IRS Form 1065. Under partnership tax treatment, each member of the LLC, as is the case for all partners of a partnership, annually receives a Form K-1 reporting the member's distributive share of the LLC's income or loss that is then reported on the member's individual income tax return. On the other hand, income from corporations is taxed twice, once at the corporate entity level and again when distributed to shareholders, thus more tax savings often result if a business formed as an LLC rather than a corporation.[11]
An LLC with either single or multiple members may elect to be taxed as a corporation through the filing of IRS Form 8832.[12] After electing corporate tax status, an LLC may further elect to be treated as a regular C corporation (taxation of the entity's income prior to any dividends or distributions to the members and then taxation of the dividends or distributions once received as income by the members) or as an S corporation (entity level income and loss passes through to the members). Some commentators have recommended an LLC taxed as a S-corporation as the best possible small business structure. It combines the simplicity and flexibility of an LLC with the tax benefits of an S-corporation (self-employment tax savings).[13]
Advantages[edit]

Choice of tax regime. An LLC can elect to be taxed as a sole proprietor, partnership, S corporation or C corporation (as long as they would otherwise qualify for such tax treatment), providing for a great deal of flexibility.
A limited liability company with multiple members that elects to be taxed as partnership may specially allocate the members' distributive share of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit via the company operating agreement on a basis other than the ownership percentage of each member so long as the rules contained in Treasury Regulation (26 CFR) 1.704-1 are met. S corporations may not specially allocate profits, losses and other tax items under US tax law.
The owners of the LLC, called "members", are protected from some or all liability for acts and debts of the LLC, depending on state shield laws.
In the United States, an S corporation has a limited number of stockholders, and all of them must be U.S. citizens; an LLC may have an unlimited number of members, and there is no citizenship restriction.
Much less administrative paperwork and record-keeping than a corporation.
Pass-through taxation (i.e., no double taxation), unless the LLC elects to be taxed as a C corporation.
Using default tax classification, profits are taxed personally at the member level, not at the LLC level.
LLCs in most states are treated as entities separate from their members. However, in some jurisdictions such as Connecticut, case law has determined that owners were not required to plead facts sufficient to pierce the corporate veil and LLC members can be personally liable for operation of the LLC (see, for example, the case of Sturm v. Harb Development[14]).
LLCs in some states can be set up with just one natural person involved.
Less risk of being "stolen" by fire-sale acquisitions (more protection against "hungry" investors).
For real estate companies, each separate property can be owned by its own individual LLC, thereby shielding not only the owners but their other properties from cross-liability.

Disadvantages[edit]
Although there is no statutory requirement for an operating agreement in most jurisdictions, members of a multiple member LLC who operate without one may encounter problems. Unlike state laws regarding stock corporations, which are very well developed and provide for a variety of governance and protective provisions for the corporation and its shareholders, most states do not dictate detailed governance and protective provisions for the members of a limited liability company. Thus, in the absence of such statutory provisions, the members of an LLC must establish governance and protective provisions pursuant to an operating agreement or similar governing document.

It may be more difficult to raise financial capital for an LLC as investors may be more comfortable investing funds in the better-understood corporate form with a view toward an eventual IPO. One possible solution may be to form a new corporation and merge into it, dissolving the LLC and converting into a corporation.
Many jurisdictionsâincluding Alabama, California, Kentucky, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Texasâlevy a franchise tax or capital values tax on LLCs. In essence, this franchise or business privilege tax is the fee the LLC pays the state for the benefit of limited liability. The franchise tax can be an amount based on revenue, an amount based on profits, or an amount based on the number of owners or the amount of capital employed in the state, or some combination of those factors, or simply a flat fee, as in Delaware.

Effective in Texas for 2007 the franchise tax is replaced with the Texas Business Margin Tax. This is paid as: tax payable = revenues minus some expenses with an apportionment factor. In most states, however, the fee is nominal and only a handful charge a tax comparable to the tax imposed on corporations.
In California, both foreign and domestic LLCs, corporations, and trusts, whether for-profit or non-profitâunless the entity is tax exemptâmust at least pay a minimum income tax of $800 per year to the Franchise Tax Board; and no foreign LLC, corporation or trust may conduct business in California unless it is duly registered with the California Secretary of State.


The District of Columbia considers LLCs to be taxable entities, thus eliminating the benefit of pass-through taxesâsubjecting members to double taxation.[15] Typically, LLCs will choose to be taxed as a partnership to avoid double taxation, which occurs in corporations. This allows companies to distribute their income among members who then report it on their personal tax returns.
Renewal fees may also be higher. Maryland, for example, charges a stock or nonstock corporation $120 for the initial charter, and $100 for an LLC. The fee for filing the annual report the following year is $300 for stock-corporations and LLCs. The fee is zero for non-stock corporations. In addition, certain states, such as New York, impose a publication requirement upon formation of the LLC which requires that the members of the LLC publish a notice in newspapers in the geographic region that the LLC will be located that it is being formed. For LLCs located in major metropolitan areas (e.g., New York City), the cost of publication can be significant.
The management structure of an LLC may not be clearly stated. Unlike corporations, they are not required to have a board of directors or officers. (This could also be seen as an advantage to some.)
Taxing jurisdictions outside the US are likely to treat a US LLC as a corporation, regardless of its treatment for US tax purposesâfor example a US LLC doing business outside the US or as a resident of a foreign jurisdiction.[16] This is very likely where the country (such as Canada) does not recognize LLCs as an authorized form of business entity in that country.
The principals of LLCs use many different titlesâe.g., member, manager, managing member, managing director, chief executive officer, president, and partner. As such, it can be difficult to determine who actually has the authority to enter into a contract on the LLC's behalf.

Variations[edit]

A Professional Limited Liability Company (PLLC, P.L.L.C., or P.L.) is a limited liability company organized for the purpose of providing professional services. Usually, professions where the state requires a license to provide services, such as a doctor, chiropractor, lawyer, accountant, architect, landscape architect, or engineer, require the formation of a PLLC.[17] However, some states, such as California, do not permit LLCs to engage in the practice of a licensed profession. Exact requirements of PLLCs vary from state to state. Typically, a PLLC's members must all be professionals practicing the same profession. In addition, the limitation of personal liability of members does not extend to professional malpractice claims.
A Series LLC is a special form of a Limited liability company that allows a single LLC to segregate its assets into separate series. For example, a series LLC that purchases separate pieces of real estate may put each in a separate series so if the lender forecloses on one piece of property, the others are not affected.
An L3C is a for-profit, social enterprise venture that has a stated goal of performing a socially beneficial purpose, not maximizing income. It is a hybrid structure that combines the legal and tax flexibility of a traditional LLC, the social benefits of a nonprofit organization, and the branding and market positioning advantages of a social enterprise.
An Anonymous Limited Liability Company is a LLC where ownership information is not made publicly available by the state where the LLC is registered. This is done by using a third-party to act as the organizer and registered agent of the LLC. Level of anonymity varies with different states.[18]

International equivalents[edit]





It has been suggested that this section be merged into Private limited company. (Discuss) Proposed since December 2014.


Companies with limited liability exist in business law worldwide. However, the limited liability company is a specific legal structure defined by the laws of U.S. states, with quite distinct characteristics. Many other countries have similar structures.
Albania[edit]
In Albania a limited liability company (Albanian: ShoqÃ«ri me pÃ«rgjegjÃ«si tÃ« kufizuar Sh.p.k) is a commercial company founded by persons of physical or judicial status, who are not liable for the company and personally bear losses only up to the outstanding contribution agreements. Partners' contributions constitute the registered capital of a limited liability company. Each partner has his quota in the company in proportion to the contribution of the capital so the registered capital of the company is divided between the partners based on the proportional ratio of their contribution. In Albania a limited liability company may not have a capital of less than 100 lek.[19]
Argentina[edit]
Although not an exact equivalent, the Argentine variant of the LLC is called Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada (S.R.L.) and it limits the liability of its members up to their capital contribution in the company. The equity is divided into equal stakes (can not be called "shares"), each one of which represents a percentage of the company and that can not be traded on the stock exchange. Their by-laws are regulated by law NÂ° 19550[20] and the commercial partnership is limited to a maximum of 50 partners.
Bosnia and Herzegovina[edit]
Bosnian and Herzegovinian legislation, similarly to that in Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia contemplates LLCs as druÅ¡tvo s ograniÄenom odgovornoÅ¡Äu (d.o.o.). Companies using this structure append the abbreviation d.o.o. to their company name. A shareholder or member in a d.o.o. is only personally liable up to the value of the memberâs investment in the company.[21]
Brazil[edit]
The corporate structure in Brazilian law most similar to the American LLC is the Sociedade Limitada (âLtda.â), under the new Brazilian Civil Code of 2002. The sociedade limitada is the new name of the sociedade por quotas de responsabilidade limitada, and it can be organized as empresÃ¡ria or simples, under this new code, roughly corresponding to the form types of comercial (âcommercialâ) and civil (ânon commercialâ) of the Commercial Code. A new law in Brazil has made it legal to obtain an LLC by a sole-proprietor called Empresa Individual de Responsabilidade Limitada (Eireli for short). The main requirement is a capital of 100 times the current minimum wage,[22] R$ 78.800,00 [23](US$26.267.00) as of 2015.
Bulgaria[edit]
Bulgarian legislation contemplates LLCs as ÐÑÑÐ¶ÐµÑÑÐ²Ð¾ Ñ Ð¾Ð³ÑÐ°Ð½Ð¸ÑÐµÐ½Ð° Ð¾ÑÐ³Ð¾Ð²Ð¾ÑÐ½Ð¾ÑÑ (Druzhestvo s ogranichena otgovornost; Limited liability company). Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation ÐÐÐ (OOD) to their name. In case of an LLC with individual owner it is contemplated as ÐÐ´Ð½Ð¾Ð»Ð¸ÑÐ½Ð¾ Ð´ÑÑÐ¶ÐµÑÑÐ²Ð¾ Ñ Ð¾Ð³ÑÐ°Ð½Ð¸ÑÐµÐ½Ð° Ð¾ÑÐ³Ð¾Ð²Ð¾ÑÐ½Ð¾ÑÑ (Ednolichno druzhestvo s ogranichena otgovornost; One-man/ Single-member limited liability company) and abbreviated as ÐÐÐÐ (EOOD).[24]
Chile[edit]
Chilean law contemplates a certain form of LLC known as "Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada" (Limited Liability Association). Also (LLC) These companies are regulated by law NÂ° 3.918. Among their most important characteristics we can say that:

They can pursue a commercial or non-commercial purpose (Sociedad Comercial de Responsabilidad Limitada / Sociedad Civil de Responsabilidad Limitada).
They must be formed by two or more partners and can hold up to a maximum of fifty.
Their equity is divided into "cuotas" (not shares) each one of which represents a percentage of the company.
They can be managed by one or more managers (external if need be), or by a board of directors.
Their by-laws can't be modified, nor their partners be changed, without the consent of all the other partners.
In tax considerations, they differ from the LLC's because they pay a corporate tax for their income, amount that can be deducted by their owners as a credit against the taxes they pay.

Chilean law also contemplates a very special kind of individual owner LLC called Empresa Individual de Responsabilidad Limitada (Limited Liability Individual Company), which uses the E.I.R.L. abbreviation.
Colombia[edit]
Colombian legislation contemplates a very similar structure as mentioned above in the Chilean case. The Ltda. abbreviation is also used in Colombia.[25]
Croatia[edit]
In Croatia, a private limited liability company is termed druÅ¡tvo s ograniÄenom odgovornoÅ¡Äu (literal: limited liability company), abbreviated d.o.o.. A public limited liability company is termed a dioniÄko druÅ¡tvo (literal: joint stock company) abbreviated d.d..[26]
Czech Republic[edit]
Czech legislation contemplates LLCs as spoleÄnost s ruÄenÃ­m omezenÃ½m (s.r.o. or spol. s r.o.). An s.r.o. is not technically comparable to an LLC because the profits are still subject to double taxation. Czech law does not offer a possibility to start up a limited company without the possibility of avoiding double taxation. As of 2014 the liability is not limited in Czech, since managing director (jednatel, mandatory board member in Czech LLCs) bears full liability that extends to all of his/her property, including private one.
Denmark[edit]
The Danish form of the LLC is the kommanditselskab (K/S). There is no minimum capital requirements. In a K/S there are two types of shareholders, the komplementar which is fully liable, and the kommanditist which liability is limited. The K/S is a tax-transparent company, which means the income "passes through" the company directly to the shareholders.
Dominican Republic[edit]
Dominican Republic legislation contemplates LLCs as Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada, also known by their abbreviation S.R.L.;; S.R.L.s award limited liability to their members up to their contribution in the company (i.e., contribution of capital). This type of company began after the law number 479 of the year 2008.
Estonia[edit]
In Estonia, a limited liability company is referred to as osaÃ¼hing (OÃ). The type of entity is also required to be identified in the name. An OÃ is taxed as a corporation. The minimum capital required by law is â¬2,500.
Finland[edit]
Although not an exact equivalent, the Finnish version of the LLC is the Oy (osakeyhtiÃ¶) or in Swedish Ab (aktiebolag). An Oy is taxed as a corporation. The minimum capital required by law is â¬2,500.[27]
Germany[edit]
Because of its hybrid characteristics it is very difficult to determine the German equivalent. On one hand it is possible to consider it as a kind of Gesellschaft mit beschrÃ¤nkter Haftung (GmbH) because it has aspects of a corporation; on the other hand it could be considered to be a kind of Kommanditgesellschaft (KG), which is the German equivalent of a limited partnership. Based on the literal translation of the word "company", an LLC should be considered to be a kind of KG without any liable partner. The German equivalent that comes closest to LLC, is GmbH & Co KG, a nested Kommanditgesellschaft (KG) where a Gesellschaft mit beschrÃ¤nkter Haftung (GmbH) takes the role of the fully liable partner. For the purpose of taxation, the Bundesfinanzministerium (German Federal Ministry of Finance) gives detailed guidelines of the circumstances under which an LLC is to be considered to be a "corporation" or as a "limited partnership".[28] It is useful to note, however, that the original LLC statutes of Wyoming and other US states were more or less explicitly modeled after the GmbH.[29]
Greece[edit]
A limited liability company (LLC) in Greece is synonymous to an EPE (ÎÎ Î - ÎÏÎ±Î¹ÏÎµÎ¯Î± Î ÎµÏÎ¹Î¿ÏÎ¹ÏÎ¼Î­Î½Î·Ï ÎÏÎ¸ÏÎ½Î·Ï).[30]
Hong Kong[edit]
In Hong Kong, the Limited Company is the most commonly incorporated type of company[31] and bears the characteristics of a Limited Liability Company. The core characteristics of a Hong Kong Limited Company include: i) it requires a minimum of one shareholder and one director (can be the same person), ii) a Hong Kong company requires a company secretary resident in HK, iii) foreign ownership is allowed, iv) company shareholders have limited liability and v) the company must have registered HK address.
Entrepreneurs who register a company in Hong Kong can choose a Hong Kong offshore company. This company structure is basically a HK Limited Company but all business is conducted outside of Hong Kong. The advantage of this structure is that all business income that is sourced outside of Hong Kong is tax exempt.
Hungary[edit]
Hungarian legislation contemplates LLCs as KorlÃ¡tolt felelÅssÃ©gÅ± tÃ¡rsasÃ¡g. Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation Kft. to their name.[32] Hungarian LLCs are required to have a 3 million HUF (Hungarian Forint) (approx. 11,000 USD) starting capital. The time of formation by the new electronic formation option has been reduced from 2 weeks to 2 hours, additional cost of formation is around 100,000 HUF (approx. 540 USD). Kft.s can be formed by the cooperation of lawyers.
The Hungarian Kft. is the most common form of doing business in Hungary. As being part of the European Union (EU), Hungarian Kft.s can now obtain an EU VAT registration number for doing business across the EU. The Hungarian EU-VAT reg. number starts with "HU". This way the existence of the subject company, VAT issues and the cross-check is available on the common EU website for companies.[citation needed]
Iceland[edit]
According to Icelandic legislation, there are two types of LLC forms, private and public held limited liability forms. Private LLC is abbreviated "Ehf." The minimum capital of 500,000 Icelandic krÃ³nas (kr.). Public LLC is abbreviated "Hf." with minimum capital of 4,000,000 kr and goes to LLC.
India[edit]
Commonly used business forms in India are:
(a) Public and Private Limited Companies - Incorporated entities with limited liabilities. These are very similar to "Corporations" under U.S law.
(b) Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs) - Incorporated entities with limited liability. The LLPs are organized as partnerships - they do not have a Board of Directors as such. LLP has lesser compliance requirements compared to Private limited companies. There is no maximum limit for the no. of partners in LLP. In the private limited company shareholders are limited to the extent of 200 shareholders.[33]
The above entities are treated as taxable entities ("persons"), and as such are liable to tax on their incomes. These entities do not offer "pass-through" taxation benefits, unlike LLCs in the USA.
India vide Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008 introduced concept of LLP and it got implemented in 2009. 2 persons are required to Incorporate LLP in India and they are called designated partners. This form is very organised in India and controlled under Ministry of Corporate Affairs. There is no specific minimum capital requirement. Foreign Direct Investment too allowed in LLP. Essential part is one of the 2 promoters must be Indian Resident.
Iran[edit]
As of 2015, there are seven types of companies which can be registered under Iran's company registration law. One of these seven types of companies and partnerships refers to LLPs. Like many other countries, two persons are required to form an LLP in Iran. Each person has his/her own shares and is responsible for business liability equivalent to his/her share percentage. LLPs in Iran are named according to the format illustrated by the following example: "Sherkat Ba Masooliyate Mahdood" translates as "Sherkat Ø´Ø±Ú©Øª Company" + "Mahdood ÙØ­Ø¯ÙØ¯ Limited" + "Masooliyat ÙØ³Ø¦ÙÙÛØª Liability".
Italy[edit]
The Italian Civil Code, approved in 1942 and as amended by the Government Act 6/2003 and furthers modifications, mainly provides three forms of limited liability company:

SocietÃ  per azioni (S.p.A.): the minimum required starting capital for an SpA is â¬50,000.[34] The capital is divided into shares (azioni) that can be transferred by endorsement or bought and sold on stock exchange. Only SpAs can be quoted in stock exchange market, issue corporate bonds, and other financial instruments. SpA form and a higher capital are required by law to operate in protected businesses (i.e. banks, leasing companies, etc.).
SocietÃ  a responsabilitÃ  limitata (Srl): the minimum required starting capital for an Srl is â¬10,000. Its capital is divided into stakes (quote) which can be bought or sold just by notarial act. Srls can issue corporate bonds but are subject to many limitations. Similar to the Srl is the SocietÃ  Cooperativa a ResponsabilitÃ  Limitata (Scarl) whose scope is not making profit but give benefits to stakes' holders.
SocietÃ  in accomandita per azioni (Sapa): the minimum required starting capital for a Sapa is â¬120,000 divided into shares. Sapas have a mixed liability scheme, where standard shareholders have limited liability while managing shareholders have full liability. Except this, SAPAs are exactly like SPAs even if uncommon.

Companies append the corresponding abbreviation to their company names.
Japan[edit]
Japan passed legislation in 1996 creating a new type of business organization, godo kaisha (J-LLC), a close variant of the American LLC.[citation needed] Japanese Tax authority does not consider J-LLC (Godo-Kaisha) a pass-through entity, but as a taxable entity.
Macedonia, Republic of[edit]
Macedonian legislation contemplates LLCs as ÐÑÑÑÑÐ²Ð¾ ÑÐ¾ Ð¾Ð³ÑÐ°Ð½Ð¸ÑÐµÐ½Ð° Ð¾Ð´Ð³Ð¾Ð²Ð¾ÑÐ½Ð¾ÑÑ (Drushtvo so ogranichena odgovornost). Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation Ð´.Ð¾.Ð¾. (d.o.o.) to their name. The minimum required starting capital for a d.o.o. is â¬5,000.
Mexico[edit]
Mexican legislation contemplates LLCs as Sociedades de Responsabilidad Limitada, also known for their abbreviation "S. de R.L.". S. de R.L.'s award limited liability to its members up to their contribution in the company (i.e., contribution of capital) and also act as pass-through or flow-through entities whereby profits are "passed-through" to its members, avoiding double taxation. This type of company is widely used by foreign investors in Mexico because of its "pass-through" modality and its "check the box" capability under the IRC (Internal Revenue Code of the U.S.).[citation needed]
Moldova[edit]
Moldovan legislation contemplates LLCs as Societate cu RÄspundere LimitatÄ, abbreviated "S.R.L.", and are regulated member(s)-founder(s), and other non-founder members, minimum one member-founder and maximum total of 50 members, at least one of them must be the founder of the company, but all of the 50 could be also founders.[citation needed]
Norway[edit]
In Norway, the closest to an LLC is probably the kommandittselskap (KS). In a K/S there are two types of participants, one komplementar which is fully liable, and one or more kommandittist, with limited liability. There are minimum capital requirements. The KS is a tax-transparent company, which means the income "passes through" the company directly to the shareholders.
Pakistan[edit]
In Pakistan, LLCs are known as private companies that end (Local Liability Company) with Pvt. Ltd. They should have at least Rs. 100,000 as their minimum paid up capital.
The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has made it mandatory for all listed companies to file their documents, returns, accounts and applications through the commission's eServices online filing facility, earlier, this requirement was only applicable to the companies, which had been incorporated through eServices online filing facility.[35]
Peru[edit]
There is no direct equivalent of an LLC in Peru, but some similar corporate forms include:

Sociedad anÃ³nima cerrada (SAC), a corporation which must have at least two and not more than twenty shareholders; its shares may not be offered to the public and cannot be traded on the stock exchange.
Sociedad comercial de responsabilidad limitada (SRL), a commercial partnership divided in equal participations which may not be called "shares". It must have at least two and not more than twenty partners.
Sociedad civil de responsabilidad limitada (S civil de RL), a professional partnership of at least two and not more than thirty individuals, with co-owner participation in the form of capital, of professional contribution, or of any combination of both.
Empresa individual de responsabilidad limitada (EIRL), a legal entity with one single owner.

The capital for any of the above entities is freely determined by its statutes. There is no minimum requirement except for entities with certain types of activities, mainly in the financial markets, and then irrespective of their type.[36]
Poland[edit]
In Poland, a limited liability company is referred to literally as âcompany with limited liabilityâ (spÃ³Åka z ograniczonÄ odpowiedzialnoÅciÄ, legally abbreviated as sp. z o.o. (or sometimes Sp. z o.o. in particular names). Informally, in the Polish speaking slang, it is abbreviated as spÃ³Åka zoo (pronounced with a long "o", as in "tow."). However, sp. z o.o. has a (separate from its owners) legal personality, which gives it the ability to do certain actions under law, and it is considered a "corporation".
The minimum start capital is 5,000 PLN (since 2009; until then, 50,000 PLN).
Portugal[edit]
In Portugal, LLCs are called "Sociedades de Responsabilidade Limitada", that is, "company of limited responsibility", usually abbreviated Lda.. They are tax subject, and company shares cannot be sold in a public market, since 2006 the transference of them is not required to be done in the presence of a civil law notary, except if the company owns buildings, in the same way other major properties have to be sold. Nonetheless, the responsibility of the partners is limited to the capital share they hold, and the minimum capital required by law for a Lda. of â¬5000. (In 2006 the PS Government, led by JosÃ© Socrates, did reduce the minimum capital to â¬1, but in 2011 the new PSD Government, led by Pedro Passos Coelho, reinstated the â¬5000 minimum capital.) The capital is not required to be deposited at the time of the registration of the company, instead the share holders have until 31 December of the year the registry was made.[citation needed]
Romania[edit]
Romania recognizes the limited liability company since 1990 under the name of societate cu rÄspundere limitatÄ (S.R.L.), in which the owners are personally liable for the company obligations within the limit of their contribution to social capital. The minimum start capital is 200 RON which currently amounts to less than â¬50.[37]
Russia[edit]
In Russia and certain other former Soviet countries, an entity with a somewhat similar structure is known as ÐÐ±ÑÐµÑÑÐ²Ð¾ Ñ Ð¾Ð³ÑÐ°Ð½Ð¸ÑÐµÐ½Ð½Ð¾Ð¹ Ð¾ÑÐ²ÐµÑÑÑÐ²ÐµÐ½Ð½Ð¾ÑÑÑÑ (Obshchestvo s ogranichennoy otvetstvennost'yu) (lit., "company with limited liability"), usually abbreviated OOO, or in some CIS countries as OÑOO.[citation needed]
Although a Russian limited liability company shares the same name with an American LLC, it is different in many ways. Most importantly, a Russian LLC is not tax transparent: the company is taxed at the corporate level, and then, upon distribution of dividends, shareholders pay income tax (personal or corporate).[citation needed]
A limited liability company is the most popular form of legal undertaking in Russia for simple shareholding structures.[38]
The minimum capital required is 10,000 Russian rubles.
Serbia[edit]
Serbian legislation contemplates LLCs as druÅ¡tvo sa ograniÄenom odgovornoÅ¡Äu. Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation d.o.o. or DOO to their name same as in Croatia. As in the Czech Republic, a d.o.o. is not technically comparable to an LLC because the profits are still subject to double taxation.[citation needed] In Kosovo a company does not need to provide proof for payment of capital.[39]
Slovakia[edit]
In Slovakia, the law contemplates spoloÄnosÅ¥ s ruÄenÃ­m obmedzenÃ½m (abbreviation spol. s r. o. or s. r. o.) or as the rough equivalent of a limited liability company. It is very popular form of business organization due to ensurance of limited liability in exchange for a relatively small investment into the registered capital. From one to 50 associates can found it through a founding agreement with minimum registered capital of â¬5000, minimum â¬750 per person, in money or other property. (Â§ 105â153 of Act. No 513/1991 Coll. â Commercial Code as amended.)[40][41]
Slovenia[edit]
Slovenian legislation contemplates LLCs as druÅ¾ba z omejeno odgovornostjo. Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation d. o. o. to their name. The minimum required starting capital for a d. o. o. is â¬7,500. Due to the high cost and complicated bookkeeping of a real corporation, this is a more widespread form.[citation needed]
Spain[edit]
In Spain, LLCs are called Sociedad de responsabilidad limitada (SRL), "company of limited responsibility", or sociedad limitada (SL), or "limited partnership". They are tax subject, and company shares cannot be sold in a public market, the transference of them having to be done compulsorily in the presence of a civil law notary, in the same way other major properties have to be sold. Nonetheless, the responsibility of the partners is limited to the capital share they hold, and the minimum capital required by law for a S.L. is at least â¬3,000.
Sweden[edit]
Sweden has no equivalent of an LLC. The closest company form is the handelsbolag (lit.: "trade company"). The Swedish AB (aktiebolag; lit.: "share company"), like the handelsbolag, is a tax subject and is more similar to a US C Corporation than an LLC. The minimum capital required by law in a private company, privat aktiebolag, is SEK 50,000, although this may be in the form of assets as well as capital. It should be noted that the AB structure requires shareholders, a Board of Directors, and regular meetings of both, together with complete accounts once per year. Depending on the size of the AB, the accounts may have to be audited. Creation or purchase "off-the-shelf" of an AB is relatively cheap and tax effective, but liquidation of a created aktiebolag can be an expensive and time-consuming operation.[42] Creation of public limited liability companies, or publikt aktiebolag, which can raise capital from the public, requires a minimum capitalization of SEK 500,000, however the overall regulation of public companies in Sweden, especially regarding accounting methods and taxes, is thorough and detailed.[43]
Switzerland[edit]
The Swiss Code of Obligations[44] provides for different kinds of companies with limited liability, the two most commonly used are:
Swiss Limited Liability Company:[45][46] The terms for this kind of company used in the three official languages of the Swiss Confederation are as follows: In German Gesellschaft mit beschrÃ¤nkter Haftung (abbreviation: GmbH), in French SociÃ©tÃ© Ã  responsabilitÃ© limitÃ©e (abbreviation: S.Ã  r.l. or SARL) and in Italian SocietÃ  a Garanzia Limitata (abbreviation: SaGL). A Swiss LLC is similar to an LLC with respect to various matters, including the following: Members may also be natural persons, corporations, partnerships or other LLCs,[47] the liability of a member of a Swiss LLC to pay for the LLC's obligations is limited to its capital contribution,[48] a Swiss LLC may be either member-managed or manager-managed,[49] and, unless otherwise provided for in the operating agreement, the membersâ right to control or manage a Swiss LLC is proportionate to their individual membership interest.[50] The membership interests in a Swiss LLC have to be registered[51] and, thus, they may only be issued in the name of a member but not to the bearer.
Swiss Corporation[46][52] (in English common law context usually translated as company limited by shares): The terms for this kind of company used in the three official languages of the Swiss Confederation are as follows: In German Aktiengesellschaft (abbreviation: AG), in French SociÃ©tÃ© Anonyme (abbreviation: SA) and in Italian SocietÃ  Anonima (abbreviation: SA). A Swiss corporation is with respect to various matters different from an LLC (including a Swiss LLC): Most important is that a Swiss corporation may, neither by default nor by exercising any respective option provided by the Swiss law, be member-managed like an LLC, as the respective mandatory provisions of Swiss law provide that the board of directors has certain non-transferable duties.[53] Furthermore, the shares of a Swiss corporation may also be issued to the bearer (bearer shares)[54] and, thus, not only in the name of a holder (registered shares), which, however, applies to the membership interests in a Swiss LLC, which may only be registered.
Tajikistan[edit]
In Tajikistan, the same as in Russia, an entity with a somewhat similar structure is known as "Ò¶Ð°Ð¼ÑÐ¸ÑÑÐ¸ Ð´Ð¾ÑÐ¾Ð¸ Ð¼Ð°ÑÑÑÐ»Ð¸ÑÑÐ¸ Ð¼Ð°Ò³Ð´ÑÐ´", Chamiyti Doroi Masuliyti Machdud, abbreviated as "Ò¶ÐÐÐ".
Turkey[edit]
Minimum capital should be 10,000 TL. That capital could be the minimum total capital of company. Number of founding shareholders (real persons or legal entities) could be minimum 1 and maximum 50. All or some of the shareholders could be foreign nationals. There is no issued stock certificates and all shareholders liability is limited to their registered capital amount. 1/4 of capital should be blocked in a Bank until procedure of registration ends. The equivalent of LLC for Turkish is Ltd. Åti. (Which means Limited Åirketi.)
Ukraine[edit]
This type of entity has existed in Ukraine since the 1990s. LLC is the most common type of business entity in Ukraine.[55] In Ukrainian, it is spelled "Ð¢Ð¾Ð²Ð°ÑÐ¸ÑÑÐ²Ð¾ Ð· Ð¾Ð±Ð¼ÐµÐ¶ÐµÐ½Ð¾Ñ Ð²ÑÐ´Ð¿Ð¾Ð²ÑÐ´Ð°Ð»ÑÐ½ÑÑÑÑ" (abbreviated â TÐÐ, TÐ·ÐÐ), in transliteration "Tovarystvo z Obmezhenoyu Vidpovidalnistyu," that is, "company with limited liability".
By Ukrainian law LLC is a legal person. Authorized capital of LLC is divided into shares (or stakes), the amount of which is determined by the charter. LLC is responsible to the creditors only with its assets. Legal entities (foreign or Ukrainian companies) individuals, regardless of their country of citizenship or residency can be the founders (participants) of LLC. Limited liability company can be formed either by one person or by several individuals or legal entities (corporations). Maximum number of participants (founders) of LLC in Ukraine is 100. Since 2014 registration procedure has been significantly simplified in Ukraine. Minimum amount of authorised capital is 1 (one) hryvnia (less than 0,04 US cents). There is no state fee for LLC formation.
By Ukrainian Law LLC dividend payment is possible after the declaration of companyâs income or profit to the fiscal/tax authorities and the approval of the income statement.[56] Thus, regardless of the tax system, LLC can make dividend payments up to 4 times a year, or one time a quarter.
Taxation. LLC can be registered:
â as corporate/profit tax (18% rate) with or without VAT (up to 20% rate, depends on product or service) tax payer;
â fixed tax rate (in transliteration "yediniy podatok" or "sproschena sistema opodatkuvannia") is a 5% rate from revenue, with or without (on request) VAT registration.
United Arab Emirates[edit]
A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is the most common type of registration in the UAE and is recommended where the purpose of the entity is to make sales within the region. However, it should be noted that 100% foreign ownership of such an entity is not permitted. Under the UAE Commercial Companies Law (CCL), foreign investors are permitted to hold up to 49 per cent equity ownership in UAE companies and 51 per cent of the equity must be held at all times by one or more UAE nationals. In accordance with Article (218) of the CCL a Limited Liability Company can be formed by a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 50 shareholders whose liability is limited to their shares in the capital of the company. Recent amendments to Article (217) of the CCL that came into force in June 2009 removed the requirement for minimum share capital (previously AED 300,000 in Dubai and AED 150,000 in other Emirates) allowing founders of a limited liability company the freedom to determine the companyâs share capital which could be less than the earlier prescribed bottom line. Shares of an LLC are not open for subscription by the public.[57] Despite the split in shareholdings, profits may be divided in other ratios agreed upon, taking into consideration efforts of foreign partners in management, provision of technology or expertise. Responsibility for the management of a LLC can be vested in the foreign partner or UAE national partners or a third party. A LLC must appoint a minimum of one manager and up to a maximum of five managers for the business. Managers must be appointed by a Memorandum of Association or by a management contract, for a fixed term or an unlimited term. Unless the Memorandum of Association states otherwise, the manager has full powers of administration and management of the LLC. LLC is not allowed to practice its activities in the UAE without a Trade License and Commercial Registration Certificate.
[58]
United Kingdom[edit]
The new form of limited liability partnership (LLP), created in 2000, is similar to a US LLC in being tax neutral: member partners are taxed at the partner level, but the LLP itself pays no tax. It is treated as a body corporate for all other purposes including VAT. Otherwise, all companies, including limited companies and US LLCs, are treated as bodies corporate subject to United Kingdom corporation tax if the profits of the entity belong to the entity and not to its members.
United States[edit]
A limited liability company (LLC) is a relatively new business structure authorized by state statutes.[59] The LLC is chiefly inspired by the GmbH ("Company with limited liability"), a type of business organization in Germany, and by the limitada, a type of business organization available in many Latin American countries.[29]
In the United States, the first limited liability company act appeared in Wyoming in 1977 as special interest[60] legislation for an oil company.[61] In 1980, the Internal Revenue Service issued a private letter ruling to an LLC formed under the Wyoming LLC Act, indicating that the IRS would treat the LLC as a partnership for federal tax purposes.[62] However, later that year, the IRS proposed regulations that would deny partnership classification to any business entity in which no member bore personal responsibility for the entity's liabilities.[63] In 1982, Florida adopted an LLC act modeled on Wyoming's LLC Act.[64] Due to uncertainty over the tax treatment of LLCs, no other states introduced LLC legislation until after 1988.[65] In 1988, the IRS issued a revenue ruling stating that it would treat a Wyoming-style LLC as a partnership for tax purposes.[66] By 1996, nearly every state had enacted an LLC statute.[67] The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws adopted the Uniform Limited Liability Company Act in 1996 and revised it in 2006.[68]
A potential disadvantage specific to the United States is that LLCs are not considered to be corporations for the purposes of federal civil procedure; they are instead treated as partnerships. This affects the applicability of diversity jurisdiction in cases involving LLCs, barring application of diversity jurisdiction when even one member of the LLC is a citizen of the same state as one of the opposing parties. Should one member of an LLC be a citizen of a state of which one of the opposing parties is a citizen, any case between the LLC and those parties must be heard in that state's courts; corporations enjoy a more complete legal personhood that only denies diversity jurisdiction when the opposing party is a citizen of the state in which the corporation is incorporated (most commonly Delaware for large corporations, which has a small population) or has its principal place of business.
AOL was set up as an LLC during its ownership by Time Warner from 2001 to 2008. There is a similar setup for BMW's American subsidiary, BMW of North America, LLC. Chrysler has been an LLC since restructuring during the auto industry bailout of 2009, owned by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V..

A limited liability company (LLC) is the United States-specific form of a private limited company. It is a business structure that combines the pass-through taxation of a partnership or sole proprietorship with the limited liability of a corporation.[1][2] An LLC is not a corporation; it is a legal form of a company that provides limited liability to its owners in many jurisdictions. LLCs do not need to be organized for profit.[3] In certain U.S. states (for example, Texas), businesses that provide professional services requiring a state professional license, such as legal or medical services, may not be allowed to form an LLC but may be required to form a similar entity called a professional limited liability company (PLLC).[4]

Overview[edit]
A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is a hybrid business entity having certain characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership or sole proprietorship (depending on how many owners there are). An LLC, although a business entity, is a type of unincorporated association and is not a corporation. The primary characteristic an LLC shares with a corporation is limited liability, and the primary characteristic it shares with a partnership is the availability of pass-through income taxation. It is often more flexible than a corporation, and it is well-suited for companies with a single owner.
In the absence of express statutory guidance, most American courts have held that LLC members are subject to the same common law alter ego piercing theories as corporate shareholders. However, it is more difficult to pierce the LLC veil because LLCs do not have many formalities to maintain. So long as the LLC and the members do not commingle funds, it would be difficult to pierce this veil.[5] Membership interests in LLCs and partnership interests are also afforded a significant level of protection through the charging order mechanism. The charging order limits the creditor of a debtor-partner or a debtor-member to the debtor's share of distributions, without conferring on the creditor any voting or management rights.[citation needed] Limited liability company members may, in certain circumstances, also incur a personal liability in cases where distributions to members render the LLC insolvent.[6]
Flexibility and default rules[edit]
The phrase "unless otherwise provided for in the operating agreement" (or its equivalent) is found throughout all existing LLC statutes[citation needed] and is responsible for the flexibility the members of the LLC have in deciding how their LLC will be governed (provided it does not go outside legal bounds). State statutes typically provide automatic or "default" rules for how an LLC will be governed unless the operating agreement provides otherwise.
Similarly, the phrase "unless otherwise provided for in the by laws" is also found in all corporation law statutes[citation needed] but often refers only to a narrower range of matters.
The limited liability company ("LLC") has grown to become one of the most prevalent business forms in the United States. As the LLC's popularity has surged, unforeseen issues have emerged in these new statutes, particularly around single-member LLCs in Florida, New York, California, Colorado, and Georgia, where personal asset protection has been subverted.[7]
Effective August 1, 2013, the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act provides that the managers and controlling members of a limited liability company owe fiduciary duties of care and loyalty to the limited liability company and its members. Under the amendment (prompted by the Delaware Supreme Court's decision in Gatz Properties, LLC v. Auriga Capital Corp, November 2012), parties to an LLC remain free to expand, restrict, or eliminate fiduciary duties in their LLC agreements (subject to the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing).[8]
Under 6 Del. C. Section 18-101(7), a Delaware LLC operating agreement can be written, oral or implied. It sets forth member capital contributions, ownership percentages, and management structure. Like a prenuptial agreement, an operating agreement can avoid future disputes between members by addressing buy-out rights, valuation formulas, and transfer restrictions. A written LLC operating agreement should be signed by all of its members.[9]
Income tax[edit]
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, an LLC is treated by default as a pass-through entity.[10] If there is only one member in the company, the LLC is treated as a âdisregarded entityâ for tax purposes, and an individual owner would report the LLC's income or loss on Schedule C of his or her individual tax return. Thus, income from the LLC is taxed at the individual tax rates. The default tax status for LLCs with multiple members is as a partnership, which is required to report income and loss on IRS Form 1065. Under partnership tax treatment, each member of the LLC, as is the case for all partners of a partnership, annually receives a Form K-1 reporting the member's distributive share of the LLC's income or loss that is then reported on the member's individual income tax return. On the other hand, income from corporations is taxed twice, once at the corporate entity level and again when distributed to shareholders, thus more tax savings often result if a business formed as an LLC rather than a corporation.[11]
An LLC with either single or multiple members may elect to be taxed as a corporation through the filing of IRS Form 8832.[12] After electing corporate tax status, an LLC may further elect to be treated as a regular C corporation (taxation of the entity's income prior to any dividends or distributions to the members and then taxation of the dividends or distributions once received as income by the members) or as an S corporation (entity level income and loss passes through to the members). Some commentators have recommended an LLC taxed as a S-corporation as the best possible small business structure. It combines the simplicity and flexibility of an LLC with the tax benefits of an S-corporation (self-employment tax savings).[13]
Advantages[edit]

Choice of tax regime. An LLC can elect to be taxed as a sole proprietor, partnership, S corporation or C corporation (as long as they would otherwise qualify for such tax treatment), providing for a great deal of flexibility.
A limited liability company with multiple members that elects to be taxed as partnership may specially allocate the members' distributive share of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit via the company operating agreement on a basis other than the ownership percentage of each member so long as the rules contained in Treasury Regulation (26 CFR) 1.704-1 are met. S corporations may not specially allocate profits, losses and other tax items under US tax law.
The owners of the LLC, called "members", are protected from some or all liability for acts and debts of the LLC, depending on state shield laws.
In the United States, an S corporation has a limited number of stockholders, and all of them must be U.S. citizens; an LLC may have an unlimited number of members, and there is no citizenship restriction.
Much less administrative paperwork and record-keeping than a corporation.
Pass-through taxation (i.e., no double taxation), unless the LLC elects to be taxed as a C corporation.
Using default tax classification, profits are taxed personally at the member level, not at the LLC level.
LLCs in most states are treated as entities separate from their members. However, in some jurisdictions such as Connecticut, case law has determined that owners were not required to plead facts sufficient to pierce the corporate veil and LLC members can be personally liable for operation of the LLC (see, for example, the case of Sturm v. Harb Development[14]).
LLCs in some states can be set up with just one natural person involved.
Less risk of being "stolen" by fire-sale acquisitions (more protection against "hungry" investors).
For real estate companies, each separate property can be owned by its own individual LLC, thereby shielding not only the owners but their other properties from cross-liability.

Disadvantages[edit]
Although there is no statutory requirement for an operating agreement in most jurisdictions, members of a multiple member LLC who operate without one may encounter problems. Unlike state laws regarding stock corporations, which are very well developed and provide for a variety of governance and protective provisions for the corporation and its shareholders, most states do not dictate detailed governance and protective provisions for the members of a limited liability company. Thus, in the absence of such statutory provisions, the members of an LLC must establish governance and protective provisions pursuant to an operating agreement or similar governing document.

It may be more difficult to raise financial capital for an LLC as investors may be more comfortable investing funds in the better-understood corporate form with a view toward an eventual IPO. One possible solution may be to form a new corporation and merge into it, dissolving the LLC and converting into a corporation.
Many jurisdictionsâincluding Alabama, California, Kentucky, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Texasâlevy a franchise tax or capital values tax on LLCs. In essence, this franchise or business privilege tax is the fee the LLC pays the state for the benefit of limited liability. The franchise tax can be an amount based on revenue, an amount based on profits, or an amount based on the number of owners or the amount of capital employed in the state, or some combination of those factors, or simply a flat fee, as in Delaware.

Effective in Texas for 2007 the franchise tax is replaced with the Texas Business Margin Tax. This is paid as: tax payable = revenues minus some expenses with an apportionment factor. In most states, however, the fee is nominal and only a handful charge a tax comparable to the tax imposed on corporations.
In California, both foreign and domestic LLCs, corporations, and trusts, whether for-profit or non-profitâunless the entity is tax exemptâmust at least pay a minimum income tax of $800 per year to the Franchise Tax Board; and no foreign LLC, corporation or trust may conduct business in California unless it is duly registered with the California Secretary of State.


The District of Columbia considers LLCs to be taxable entities, thus eliminating the benefit of pass-through taxesâsubjecting members to double taxation.[15] Typically, LLCs will choose to be taxed as a partnership to avoid double taxation, which occurs in corporations. This allows companies to distribute their income among members who then report it on their personal tax returns.
Renewal fees may also be higher. Maryland, for example, charges a stock or nonstock corporation $120 for the initial charter, and $100 for an LLC. The fee for filing the annual report the following year is $300 for stock-corporations and LLCs. The fee is zero for non-stock corporations. In addition, certain states, such as New York, impose a publication requirement upon formation of the LLC which requires that the members of the LLC publish a notice in newspapers in the geographic region that the LLC will be located that it is being formed. For LLCs located in major metropolitan areas (e.g., New York City), the cost of publication can be significant.
The management structure of an LLC may not be clearly stated. Unlike corporations, they are not required to have a board of directors or officers. (This could also be seen as an advantage to some.)
Taxing jurisdictions outside the US are likely to treat a US LLC as a corporation, regardless of its treatment for US tax purposesâfor example a US LLC doing business outside the US or as a resident of a foreign jurisdiction.[16] This is very likely where the country (such as Canada) does not recognize LLCs as an authorized form of business entity in that country.
The principals of LLCs use many different titlesâe.g., member, manager, managing member, managing director, chief executive officer, president, and partner. As such, it can be difficult to determine who actually has the authority to enter into a contract on the LLC's behalf.

Variations[edit]

A Professional Limited Liability Company (PLLC, P.L.L.C., or P.L.) is a limited liability company organized for the purpose of providing professional services. Usually, professions where the state requires a license to provide services, such as a doctor, chiropractor, lawyer, accountant, architect, landscape architect, or engineer, require the formation of a PLLC.[17] However, some states, such as California, do not permit LLCs to engage in the practice of a licensed profession. Exact requirements of PLLCs vary from state to state. Typically, a PLLC's members must all be professionals practicing the same profession. In addition, the limitation of personal liability of members does not extend to professional malpractice claims.
A Series LLC is a special form of a Limited liability company that allows a single LLC to segregate its assets into separate series. For example, a series LLC that purchases separate pieces of real estate may put each in a separate series so if the lender forecloses on one piece of property, the others are not affected.
An L3C is a for-profit, social enterprise venture that has a stated goal of performing a socially beneficial purpose, not maximizing income. It is a hybrid structure that combines the legal and tax flexibility of a traditional LLC, the social benefits of a nonprofit organization, and the branding and market positioning advantages of a social enterprise.
An Anonymous Limited Liability Company is a LLC where ownership information is not made publicly available by the state where the LLC is registered. This is done by using a third-party to act as the organizer and registered agent of the LLC. Level of anonymity varies with different states.[18]

International equivalents[edit]





It has been suggested that this section be merged into Private limited company. (Discuss) Proposed since December 2014.


Companies with limited liability exist in business law worldwide. However, the limited liability company is a specific legal structure defined by the laws of U.S. states, with quite distinct characteristics. Many other countries have similar structures.
Albania[edit]
In Albania a limited liability company (Albanian: ShoqÃ«ri me pÃ«rgjegjÃ«si tÃ« kufizuar Sh.p.k) is a commercial company founded by persons of physical or judicial status, who are not liable for the company and personally bear losses only up to the outstanding contribution agreements. Partners' contributions constitute the registered capital of a limited liability company. Each partner has his quota in the company in proportion to the contribution of the capital so the registered capital of the company is divided between the partners based on the proportional ratio of their contribution. In Albania a limited liability company may not have a capital of less than 100 lek.[19]
Argentina[edit]
Although not an exact equivalent, the Argentine variant of the LLC is called Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada (S.R.L.) and it limits the liability of its members up to their capital contribution in the company. The equity is divided into equal stakes (can not be called "shares"), each one of which represents a percentage of the company and that can not be traded on the stock exchange. Their by-laws are regulated by law NÂ° 19550[20] and the commercial partnership is limited to a maximum of 50 partners.
Bosnia and Herzegovina[edit]
Bosnian and Herzegovinian legislation, similarly to that in Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia contemplates LLCs as druÅ¡tvo s ograniÄenom odgovornoÅ¡Äu (d.o.o.). Companies using this structure append the abbreviation d.o.o. to their company name. A shareholder or member in a d.o.o. is only personally liable up to the value of the memberâs investment in the company.[21]
Brazil[edit]
The corporate structure in Brazilian law most similar to the American LLC is the Sociedade Limitada (âLtda.â), under the new Brazilian Civil Code of 2002. The sociedade limitada is the new name of the sociedade por quotas de responsabilidade limitada, and it can be organized as empresÃ¡ria or simples, under this new code, roughly corresponding to the form types of comercial (âcommercialâ) and civil (ânon commercialâ) of the Commercial Code. A new law in Brazil has made it legal to obtain an LLC by a sole-proprietor called Empresa Individual de Responsabilidade Limitada (Eireli for short). The main requirement is a capital of 100 times the current minimum wage,[22] R$ 78.800,00 [23](US$26.267.00) as of 2015.
Bulgaria[edit]
Bulgarian legislation contemplates LLCs as ÐÑÑÐ¶ÐµÑÑÐ²Ð¾ Ñ Ð¾Ð³ÑÐ°Ð½Ð¸ÑÐµÐ½Ð° Ð¾ÑÐ³Ð¾Ð²Ð¾ÑÐ½Ð¾ÑÑ (Druzhestvo s ogranichena otgovornost; Limited liability company). Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation ÐÐÐ (OOD) to their name. In case of an LLC with individual owner it is contemplated as ÐÐ´Ð½Ð¾Ð»Ð¸ÑÐ½Ð¾ Ð´ÑÑÐ¶ÐµÑÑÐ²Ð¾ Ñ Ð¾Ð³ÑÐ°Ð½Ð¸ÑÐµÐ½Ð° Ð¾ÑÐ³Ð¾Ð²Ð¾ÑÐ½Ð¾ÑÑ (Ednolichno druzhestvo s ogranichena otgovornost; One-man/ Single-member limited liability company) and abbreviated as ÐÐÐÐ (EOOD).[24]
Chile[edit]
Chilean law contemplates a certain form of LLC known as "Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada" (Limited Liability Association). Also (LLC) These companies are regulated by law NÂ° 3.918. Among their most important characteristics we can say that:

They can pursue a commercial or non-commercial purpose (Sociedad Comercial de Responsabilidad Limitada / Sociedad Civil de Responsabilidad Limitada).
They must be formed by two or more partners and can hold up to a maximum of fifty.
Their equity is divided into "cuotas" (not shares) each one of which represents a percentage of the company.
They can be managed by one or more managers (external if need be), or by a board of directors.
Their by-laws can't be modified, nor their partners be changed, without the consent of all the other partners.
In tax considerations, they differ from the LLC's because they pay a corporate tax for their income, amount that can be deducted by their owners as a credit against the taxes they pay.

Chilean law also contemplates a very special kind of individual owner LLC called Empresa Individual de Responsabilidad Limitada (Limited Liability Individual Company), which uses the E.I.R.L. abbreviation.
Colombia[edit]
Colombian legislation contemplates a very similar structure as mentioned above in the Chilean case. The Ltda. abbreviation is also used in Colombia.[25]
Croatia[edit]
In Croatia, a private limited liability company is termed druÅ¡tvo s ograniÄenom odgovornoÅ¡Äu (literal: limited liability company), abbreviated d.o.o.. A public limited liability company is termed a dioniÄko druÅ¡tvo (literal: joint stock company) abbreviated d.d..[26]
Czech Republic[edit]
Czech legislation contemplates LLCs as spoleÄnost s ruÄenÃ­m omezenÃ½m (s.r.o. or spol. s r.o.). An s.r.o. is not technically comparable to an LLC because the profits are still subject to double taxation. Czech law does not offer a possibility to start up a limited company without the possibility of avoiding double taxation. As of 2014 the liability is not limited in Czech, since managing director (jednatel, mandatory board member in Czech LLCs) bears full liability that extends to all of his/her property, including private one.
Denmark[edit]
The Danish form of the LLC is the kommanditselskab (K/S). There is no minimum capital requirements. In a K/S there are two types of shareholders, the komplementar which is fully liable, and the kommanditist which liability is limited. The K/S is a tax-transparent company, which means the income "passes through" the company directly to the shareholders.
Dominican Republic[edit]
Dominican Republic legislation contemplates LLCs as Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada, also known by their abbreviation S.R.L.;; S.R.L.s award limited liability to their members up to their contribution in the company (i.e., contribution of capital). This type of company began after the law number 479 of the year 2008.
Estonia[edit]
In Estonia, a limited liability company is referred to as osaÃ¼hing (OÃ). The type of entity is also required to be identified in the name. An OÃ is taxed as a corporation. The minimum capital required by law is â¬2,500.
Finland[edit]
Although not an exact equivalent, the Finnish version of the LLC is the Oy (osakeyhtiÃ¶) or in Swedish Ab (aktiebolag). An Oy is taxed as a corporation. The minimum capital required by law is â¬2,500.[27]
Germany[edit]
Because of its hybrid characteristics it is very difficult to determine the German equivalent. On one hand it is possible to consider it as a kind of Gesellschaft mit beschrÃ¤nkter Haftung (GmbH) because it has aspects of a corporation; on the other hand it could be considered to be a kind of Kommanditgesellschaft (KG), which is the German equivalent of a limited partnership. Based on the literal translation of the word "company", an LLC should be considered to be a kind of KG without any liable partner. The German equivalent that comes closest to LLC, is GmbH & Co KG, a nested Kommanditgesellschaft (KG) where a Gesellschaft mit beschrÃ¤nkter Haftung (GmbH) takes the role of the fully liable partner. For the purpose of taxation, the Bundesfinanzministerium (German Federal Ministry of Finance) gives detailed guidelines of the circumstances under which an LLC is to be considered to be a "corporation" or as a "limited partnership".[28] It is useful to note, however, that the original LLC statutes of Wyoming and other US states were more or less explicitly modeled after the GmbH.[29]
Greece[edit]
A limited liability company (LLC) in Greece is synonymous to an EPE (ÎÎ Î - ÎÏÎ±Î¹ÏÎµÎ¯Î± Î ÎµÏÎ¹Î¿ÏÎ¹ÏÎ¼Î­Î½Î·Ï ÎÏÎ¸ÏÎ½Î·Ï).[30]
Hong Kong[edit]
In Hong Kong, the Limited Company is the most commonly incorporated type of company[31] and bears the characteristics of a Limited Liability Company. The core characteristics of a Hong Kong Limited Company include: i) it requires a minimum of one shareholder and one director (can be the same person), ii) a Hong Kong company requires a company secretary resident in HK, iii) foreign ownership is allowed, iv) company shareholders have limited liability and v) the company must have registered HK address.
Entrepreneurs who register a company in Hong Kong can choose a Hong Kong offshore company. This company structure is basically a HK Limited Company but all business is conducted outside of Hong Kong. The advantage of this structure is that all business income that is sourced outside of Hong Kong is tax exempt.
Hungary[edit]
Hungarian legislation contemplates LLCs as KorlÃ¡tolt felelÅssÃ©gÅ± tÃ¡rsasÃ¡g. Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation Kft. to their name.[32] Hungarian LLCs are required to have a 3 million HUF (Hungarian Forint) (approx. 11,000 USD) starting capital. The time of formation by the new electronic formation option has been reduced from 2 weeks to 2 hours, additional cost of formation is around 100,000 HUF (approx. 540 USD). Kft.s can be formed by the cooperation of lawyers.
The Hungarian Kft. is the most common form of doing business in Hungary. As being part of the European Union (EU), Hungarian Kft.s can now obtain an EU VAT registration number for doing business across the EU. The Hungarian EU-VAT reg. number starts with "HU". This way the existence of the subject company, VAT issues and the cross-check is available on the common EU website for companies.[citation needed]
Iceland[edit]
According to Icelandic legislation, there are two types of LLC forms, private and public held limited liability forms. Private LLC is abbreviated "Ehf." The minimum capital of 500,000 Icelandic krÃ³nas (kr.). Public LLC is abbreviated "Hf." with minimum capital of 4,000,000 kr and goes to LLC.
India[edit]
Commonly used business forms in India are:
(a) Public and Private Limited Companies - Incorporated entities with limited liabilities. These are very similar to "Corporations" under U.S law.
(b) Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs) - Incorporated entities with limited liability. The LLPs are organized as partnerships - they do not have a Board of Directors as such. LLP has lesser compliance requirements compared to Private limited companies. There is no maximum limit for the no. of partners in LLP. In the private limited company shareholders are limited to the extent of 200 shareholders.[33]
The above entities are treated as taxable entities ("persons"), and as such are liable to tax on their incomes. These entities do not offer "pass-through" taxation benefits, unlike LLCs in the USA.
India vide Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008 introduced concept of LLP and it got implemented in 2009. 2 persons are required to Incorporate LLP in India and they are called designated partners. This form is very organised in India and controlled under Ministry of Corporate Affairs. There is no specific minimum capital requirement. Foreign Direct Investment too allowed in LLP. Essential part is one of the 2 promoters must be Indian Resident.
Iran[edit]
As of 2015, there are seven types of companies which can be registered under Iran's company registration law. One of these seven types of companies and partnerships refers to LLPs. Like many other countries, two persons are required to form an LLP in Iran. Each person has his/her own shares and is responsible for business liability equivalent to his/her share percentage. LLPs in Iran are named according to the format illustrated by the following example: "Sherkat Ba Masooliyate Mahdood" translates as "Sherkat Ø´Ø±Ú©Øª Company" + "Mahdood ÙØ­Ø¯ÙØ¯ Limited" + "Masooliyat ÙØ³Ø¦ÙÙÛØª Liability".
Italy[edit]
The Italian Civil Code, approved in 1942 and as amended by the Government Act 6/2003 and furthers modifications, mainly provides three forms of limited liability company:

SocietÃ  per azioni (S.p.A.): the minimum required starting capital for an SpA is â¬50,000.[34] The capital is divided into shares (azioni) that can be transferred by endorsement or bought and sold on stock exchange. Only SpAs can be quoted in stock exchange market, issue corporate bonds, and other financial instruments. SpA form and a higher capital are required by law to operate in protected businesses (i.e. banks, leasing companies, etc.).
SocietÃ  a responsabilitÃ  limitata (Srl): the minimum required starting capital for an Srl is â¬10,000. Its capital is divided into stakes (quote) which can be bought or sold just by notarial act. Srls can issue corporate bonds but are subject to many limitations. Similar to the Srl is the SocietÃ  Cooperativa a ResponsabilitÃ  Limitata (Scarl) whose scope is not making profit but give benefits to stakes' holders.
SocietÃ  in accomandita per azioni (Sapa): the minimum required starting capital for a Sapa is â¬120,000 divided into shares. Sapas have a mixed liability scheme, where standard shareholders have limited liability while managing shareholders have full liability. Except this, SAPAs are exactly like SPAs even if uncommon.

Companies append the corresponding abbreviation to their company names.
Japan[edit]
Japan passed legislation in 1996 creating a new type of business organization, godo kaisha (J-LLC), a close variant of the American LLC.[citation needed] Japanese Tax authority does not consider J-LLC (Godo-Kaisha) a pass-through entity, but as a taxable entity.
Macedonia, Republic of[edit]
Macedonian legislation contemplates LLCs as ÐÑÑÑÑÐ²Ð¾ ÑÐ¾ Ð¾Ð³ÑÐ°Ð½Ð¸ÑÐµÐ½Ð° Ð¾Ð´Ð³Ð¾Ð²Ð¾ÑÐ½Ð¾ÑÑ (Drushtvo so ogranichena odgovornost). Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation Ð´.Ð¾.Ð¾. (d.o.o.) to their name. The minimum required starting capital for a d.o.o. is â¬5,000.
Mexico[edit]
Mexican legislation contemplates LLCs as Sociedades de Responsabilidad Limitada, also known for their abbreviation "S. de R.L.". S. de R.L.'s award limited liability to its members up to their contribution in the company (i.e., contribution of capital) and also act as pass-through or flow-through entities whereby profits are "passed-through" to its members, avoiding double taxation. This type of company is widely used by foreign investors in Mexico because of its "pass-through" modality and its "check the box" capability under the IRC (Internal Revenue Code of the U.S.).[citation needed]
Moldova[edit]
Moldovan legislation contemplates LLCs as Societate cu RÄspundere LimitatÄ, abbreviated "S.R.L.", and are regulated member(s)-founder(s), and other non-founder members, minimum one member-founder and maximum total of 50 members, at least one of them must be the founder of the company, but all of the 50 could be also founders.[citation needed]
Norway[edit]
In Norway, the closest to an LLC is probably the kommandittselskap (KS). In a K/S there are two types of participants, one komplementar which is fully liable, and one or more kommandittist, with limited liability. There are minimum capital requirements. The KS is a tax-transparent company, which means the income "passes through" the company directly to the shareholders.
Pakistan[edit]
In Pakistan, LLCs are known as private companies that end (Local Liability Company) with Pvt. Ltd. They should have at least Rs. 100,000 as their minimum paid up capital.
The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has made it mandatory for all listed companies to file their documents, returns, accounts and applications through the commission's eServices online filing facility, earlier, this requirement was only applicable to the companies, which had been incorporated through eServices online filing facility.[35]
Peru[edit]
There is no direct equivalent of an LLC in Peru, but some similar corporate forms include:

Sociedad anÃ³nima cerrada (SAC), a corporation which must have at least two and not more than twenty shareholders; its shares may not be offered to the public and cannot be traded on the stock exchange.
Sociedad comercial de responsabilidad limitada (SRL), a commercial partnership divided in equal participations which may not be called "shares". It must have at least two and not more than twenty partners.
Sociedad civil de responsabilidad limitada (S civil de RL), a professional partnership of at least two and not more than thirty individuals, with co-owner participation in the form of capital, of professional contribution, or of any combination of both.
Empresa individual de responsabilidad limitada (EIRL), a legal entity with one single owner.

The capital for any of the above entities is freely determined by its statutes. There is no minimum requirement except for entities with certain types of activities, mainly in the financial markets, and then irrespective of their type.[36]
Poland[edit]
In Poland, a limited liability company is referred to literally as âcompany with limited liabilityâ (spÃ³Åka z ograniczonÄ odpowiedzialnoÅciÄ, legally abbreviated as sp. z o.o. (or sometimes Sp. z o.o. in particular names). Informally, in the Polish speaking slang, it is abbreviated as spÃ³Åka zoo (pronounced with a long "o", as in "tow."). However, sp. z o.o. has a (separate from its owners) legal personality, which gives it the ability to do certain actions under law, and it is considered a "corporation".
The minimum start capital is 5,000 PLN (since 2009; until then, 50,000 PLN).
Portugal[edit]
In Portugal, LLCs are called "Sociedades de Responsabilidade Limitada", that is, "company of limited responsibility", usually abbreviated Lda.. They are tax subject, and company shares cannot be sold in a public market, since 2006 the transference of them is not required to be done in the presence of a civil law notary, except if the company owns buildings, in the same way other major properties have to be sold. Nonetheless, the responsibility of the partners is limited to the capital share they hold, and the minimum capital required by law for a Lda. of â¬5000. (In 2006 the PS Government, led by JosÃ© Socrates, did reduce the minimum capital to â¬1, but in 2011 the new PSD Government, led by Pedro Passos Coelho, reinstated the â¬5000 minimum capital.) The capital is not required to be deposited at the time of the registration of the company, instead the share holders have until 31 December of the year the registry was made.[citation needed]
Romania[edit]
Romania recognizes the limited liability company since 1990 under the name of societate cu rÄspundere limitatÄ (S.R.L.), in which the owners are personally liable for the company obligations within the limit of their contribution to social capital. The minimum start capital is 200 RON which currently amounts to less than â¬50.[37]
Russia[edit]
In Russia and certain other former Soviet countries, an entity with a somewhat similar structure is known as ÐÐ±ÑÐµÑÑÐ²Ð¾ Ñ Ð¾Ð³ÑÐ°Ð½Ð¸ÑÐµÐ½Ð½Ð¾Ð¹ Ð¾ÑÐ²ÐµÑÑÑÐ²ÐµÐ½Ð½Ð¾ÑÑÑÑ (Obshchestvo s ogranichennoy otvetstvennost'yu) (lit., "company with limited liability"), usually abbreviated OOO, or in some CIS countries as OÑOO.[citation needed]
Although a Russian limited liability company shares the same name with an American LLC, it is different in many ways. Most importantly, a Russian LLC is not tax transparent: the company is taxed at the corporate level, and then, upon distribution of dividends, shareholders pay income tax (personal or corporate).[citation needed]
A limited liability company is the most popular form of legal undertaking in Russia for simple shareholding structures.[38]
The minimum capital required is 10,000 Russian rubles.
Serbia[edit]
Serbian legislation contemplates LLCs as druÅ¡tvo sa ograniÄenom odgovornoÅ¡Äu. Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation d.o.o. or DOO to their name same as in Croatia. As in the Czech Republic, a d.o.o. is not technically comparable to an LLC because the profits are still subject to double taxation.[citation needed] In Kosovo a company does not need to provide proof for payment of capital.[39]
Slovakia[edit]
In Slovakia, the law contemplates spoloÄnosÅ¥ s ruÄenÃ­m obmedzenÃ½m (abbreviation spol. s r. o. or s. r. o.) or as the rough equivalent of a limited liability company. It is very popular form of business organization due to ensurance of limited liability in exchange for a relatively small investment into the registered capital. From one to 50 associates can found it through a founding agreement with minimum registered capital of â¬5000, minimum â¬750 per person, in money or other property. (Â§ 105â153 of Act. No 513/1991 Coll. â Commercial Code as amended.)[40][41]
Slovenia[edit]
Slovenian legislation contemplates LLCs as druÅ¾ba z omejeno odgovornostjo. Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation d. o. o. to their name. The minimum required starting capital for a d. o. o. is â¬7,500. Due to the high cost and complicated bookkeeping of a real corporation, this is a more widespread form.[citation needed]
Spain[edit]
In Spain, LLCs are called Sociedad de responsabilidad limitada (SRL), "company of limited responsibility", or sociedad limitada (SL), or "limited partnership". They are tax subject, and company shares cannot be sold in a public market, the transference of them having to be done compulsorily in the presence of a civil law notary, in the same way other major properties have to be sold. Nonetheless, the responsibility of the partners is limited to the capital share they hold, and the minimum capital required by law for a S.L. is at least â¬3,000.
Sweden[edit]
Sweden has no equivalent of an LLC. The closest company form is the handelsbolag (lit.: "trade company"). The Swedish AB (aktiebolag; lit.: "share company"), like the handelsbolag, is a tax subject and is more similar to a US C Corporation than an LLC. The minimum capital required by law in a private company, privat aktiebolag, is SEK 50,000, although this may be in the form of assets as well as capital. It should be noted that the AB structure requires shareholders, a Board of Directors, and regular meetings of both, together with complete accounts once per year. Depending on the size of the AB, the accounts may have to be audited. Creation or purchase "off-the-shelf" of an AB is relatively cheap and tax effective, but liquidation of a created aktiebolag can be an expensive and time-consuming operation.[42] Creation of public limited liability companies, or publikt aktiebolag, which can raise capital from the public, requires a minimum capitalization of SEK 500,000, however the overall regulation of public companies in Sweden, especially regarding accounting methods and taxes, is thorough and detailed.[43]
Switzerland[edit]
The Swiss Code of Obligations[44] provides for different kinds of companies with limited liability, the two most commonly used are:
Swiss Limited Liability Company:[45][46] The terms for this kind of company used in the three official languages of the Swiss Confederation are as follows: In German Gesellschaft mit beschrÃ¤nkter Haftung (abbreviation: GmbH), in French SociÃ©tÃ© Ã  responsabilitÃ© limitÃ©e (abbreviation: S.Ã  r.l. or SARL) and in Italian SocietÃ  a Garanzia Limitata (abbreviation: SaGL). A Swiss LLC is similar to an LLC with respect to various matters, including the following: Members may also be natural persons, corporations, partnerships or other LLCs,[47] the liability of a member of a Swiss LLC to pay for the LLC's obligations is limited to its capital contribution,[48] a Swiss LLC may be either member-managed or manager-managed,[49] and, unless otherwise provided for in the operating agreement, the membersâ right to control or manage a Swiss LLC is proportionate to their individual membership interest.[50] The membership interests in a Swiss LLC have to be registered[51] and, thus, they may only be issued in the name of a member but not to the bearer.
Swiss Corporation[46][52] (in English common law context usually translated as company limited by shares): The terms for this kind of company used in the three official languages of the Swiss Confederation are as follows: In German Aktiengesellschaft (abbreviation: AG), in French SociÃ©tÃ© Anonyme (abbreviation: SA) and in Italian SocietÃ  Anonima (abbreviation: SA). A Swiss corporation is with respect to various matters different from an LLC (including a Swiss LLC): Most important is that a Swiss corporation may, neither by default nor by exercising any respective option provided by the Swiss law, be member-managed like an LLC, as the respective mandatory provisions of Swiss law provide that the board of directors has certain non-transferable duties.[53] Furthermore, the shares of a Swiss corporation may also be issued to the bearer (bearer shares)[54] and, thus, not only in the name of a holder (registered shares), which, however, applies to the membership interests in a Swiss LLC, which may only be registered.
Tajikistan[edit]
In Tajikistan, the same as in Russia, an entity with a somewhat similar structure is known as "Ò¶Ð°Ð¼ÑÐ¸ÑÑÐ¸ Ð´Ð¾ÑÐ¾Ð¸ Ð¼Ð°ÑÑÑÐ»Ð¸ÑÑÐ¸ Ð¼Ð°Ò³Ð´ÑÐ´", Chamiyti Doroi Masuliyti Machdud, abbreviated as "Ò¶ÐÐÐ".
Turkey[edit]
Minimum capital should be 10,000 TL. That capital could be the minimum total capital of company. Number of founding shareholders (real persons or legal entities) could be minimum 1 and maximum 50. All or some of the shareholders could be foreign nationals. There is no issued stock certificates and all shareholders liability is limited to their registered capital amount. 1/4 of capital should be blocked in a Bank until procedure of registration ends. The equivalent of LLC for Turkish is Ltd. Åti. (Which means Limited Åirketi.)
Ukraine[edit]
This type of entity has existed in Ukraine since the 1990s. LLC is the most common type of business entity in Ukraine.[55] In Ukrainian, it is spelled "Ð¢Ð¾Ð²Ð°ÑÐ¸ÑÑÐ²Ð¾ Ð· Ð¾Ð±Ð¼ÐµÐ¶ÐµÐ½Ð¾Ñ Ð²ÑÐ´Ð¿Ð¾Ð²ÑÐ´Ð°Ð»ÑÐ½ÑÑÑÑ" (abbreviated â TÐÐ, TÐ·ÐÐ), in transliteration "Tovarystvo z Obmezhenoyu Vidpovidalnistyu," that is, "company with limited liability".
By Ukrainian law LLC is a legal person. Authorized capital of LLC is divided into shares (or stakes), the amount of which is determined by the charter. LLC is responsible to the creditors only with its assets. Legal entities (foreign or Ukrainian companies) individuals, regardless of their country of citizenship or residency can be the founders (participants) of LLC. Limited liability company can be formed either by one person or by several individuals or legal entities (corporations). Maximum number of participants (founders) of LLC in Ukraine is 100. Since 2014 registration procedure has been significantly simplified in Ukraine. Minimum amount of authorised capital is 1 (one) hryvnia (less than 0,04 US cents). There is no state fee for LLC formation.
By Ukrainian Law LLC dividend payment is possible after the declaration of companyâs income or profit to the fiscal/tax authorities and the approval of the income statement.[56] Thus, regardless of the tax system, LLC can make dividend payments up to 4 times a year, or one time a quarter.
Taxation. LLC can be registered:
â as corporate/profit tax (18% rate) with or without VAT (up to 20% rate, depends on product or service) tax payer;
â fixed tax rate (in transliteration "yediniy podatok" or "sproschena sistema opodatkuvannia") is a 5% rate from revenue, with or without (on request) VAT registration.
United Arab Emirates[edit]
A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is the most common type of registration in the UAE and is recommended where the purpose of the entity is to make sales within the region. However, it should be noted that 100% foreign ownership of such an entity is not permitted. Under the UAE Commercial Companies Law (CCL), foreign investors are permitted to hold up to 49 per cent equity ownership in UAE companies and 51 per cent of the equity must be held at all times by one or more UAE nationals. In accordance with Article (218) of the CCL a Limited Liability Company can be formed by a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 50 shareholders whose liability is limited to their shares in the capital of the company. Recent amendments to Article (217) of the CCL that came into force in June 2009 removed the requirement for minimum share capital (previously AED 300,000 in Dubai and AED 150,000 in other Emirates) allowing founders of a limited liability company the freedom to determine the companyâs share capital which could be less than the earlier prescribed bottom line. Shares of an LLC are not open for subscription by the public.[57] Despite the split in shareholdings, profits may be divided in other ratios agreed upon, taking into consideration efforts of foreign partners in management, provision of technology or expertise. Responsibility for the management of a LLC can be vested in the foreign partner or UAE national partners or a third party. A LLC must appoint a minimum of one manager and up to a maximum of five managers for the business. Managers must be appointed by a Memorandum of Association or by a management contract, for a fixed term or an unlimited term. Unless the Memorandum of Association states otherwise, the manager has full powers of administration and management of the LLC. LLC is not allowed to practice its activities in the UAE without a Trade License and Commercial Registration Certificate.
[58]
United Kingdom[edit]
The new form of limited liability partnership (LLP), created in 2000, is similar to a US LLC in being tax neutral: member partners are taxed at the partner level, but the LLP itself pays no tax. It is treated as a body corporate for all other purposes including VAT. Otherwise, all companies, including limited companies and US LLCs, are treated as bodies corporate subject to United Kingdom corporation tax if the profits of the entity belong to the entity and not to its members.
United States[edit]
A limited liability company (LLC) is a relatively new business structure authorized by state statutes.[59] The LLC is chiefly inspired by the GmbH ("Company with limited liability"), a type of business organization in Germany, and by the limitada, a type of business organization available in many Latin American countries.[29]
In the United States, the first limited liability company act appeared in Wyoming in 1977 as special interest[60] legislation for an oil company.[61] In 1980, the Internal Revenue Service issued a private letter ruling to an LLC formed under the Wyoming LLC Act, indicating that the IRS would treat the LLC as a partnership for federal tax purposes.[62] However, later that year, the IRS proposed regulations that would deny partnership classification to any business entity in which no member bore personal responsibility for the entity's liabilities.[63] In 1982, Florida adopted an LLC act modeled on Wyoming's LLC Act.[64] Due to uncertainty over the tax treatment of LLCs, no other states introduced LLC legislation until after 1988.[65] In 1988, the IRS issued a revenue ruling stating that it would treat a Wyoming-style LLC as a partnership for tax purposes.[66] By 1996, nearly every state had enacted an LLC statute.[67] The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws adopted the Uniform Limited Liability Company Act in 1996 and revised it in 2006.[68]
A potential disadvantage specific to the United States is that LLCs are not considered to be corporations for the purposes of federal civil procedure; they are instead treated as partnerships. This affects the applicability of diversity jurisdiction in cases involving LLCs, barring application of diversity jurisdiction when even one member of the LLC is a citizen of the same state as one of the opposing parties. Should one member of an LLC be a citizen of a state of which one of the opposing parties is a citizen, any case between the LLC and those parties must be heard in that state's courts; corporations enjoy a more complete legal personhood that only denies diversity jurisdiction when the opposing party is a citizen of the state in which the corporation is incorporated (most commonly Delaware for large corporations, which has a small population) or has its principal place of business.
AOL was set up as an LLC during its ownership by Time Warner from 2001 to 2008. There is a similar setup for BMW's American subsidiary, BMW of North America, LLC. Chrysler has been an LLC since restructuring during the auto industry bailout of 2009, owned by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V..

A limited liability company (LLC) is the United States-specific form of a private limited company. It is a business structure that combines the pass-through taxation of a partnership or sole proprietorship with the limited liability of a corporation.[1][2] An LLC is not a corporation; it is a legal form of a company that provides limited liability to its owners in many jurisdictions. LLCs do not need to be organized for profit.[3] In certain U.S. states (for example, Texas), businesses that provide professional services requiring a state professional license, such as legal or medical services, may not be allowed to form an LLC but may be required to form a similar entity called a professional limited liability company (PLLC).[4]

Overview[edit]
A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is a hybrid business entity having certain characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership or sole proprietorship (depending on how many owners there are). An LLC, although a business entity, is a type of unincorporated association and is not a corporation. The primary characteristic an LLC shares with a corporation is limited liability, and the primary characteristic it shares with a partnership is the availability of pass-through income taxation. It is often more flexible than a corporation, and it is well-suited for companies with a single owner.
In the absence of express statutory guidance, most American courts have held that LLC members are subject to the same common law alter ego piercing theories as corporate shareholders. However, it is more difficult to pierce the LLC veil because LLCs do not have many formalities to maintain. So long as the LLC and the members do not commingle funds, it would be difficult to pierce this veil.[5] Membership interests in LLCs and partnership interests are also afforded a significant level of protection through the charging order mechanism. The charging order limits the creditor of a debtor-partner or a debtor-member to the debtor's share of distributions, without conferring on the creditor any voting or management rights.[citation needed] Limited liability company members may, in certain circumstances, also incur a personal liability in cases where distributions to members render the LLC insolvent.[6]
Flexibility and default rules[edit]
The phrase "unless otherwise provided for in the operating agreement" (or its equivalent) is found throughout all existing LLC statutes[citation needed] and is responsible for the flexibility the members of the LLC have in deciding how their LLC will be governed (provided it does not go outside legal bounds). State statutes typically provide automatic or "default" rules for how an LLC will be governed unless the operating agreement provides otherwise.
Similarly, the phrase "unless otherwise provided for in the by laws" is also found in all corporation law statutes[citation needed] but often refers only to a narrower range of matters.
The limited liability company ("LLC") has grown to become one of the most prevalent business forms in the United States. As the LLC's popularity has surged, unforeseen issues have emerged in these new statutes, particularly around single-member LLCs in Florida, New York, California, Colorado, and Georgia, where personal asset protection has been subverted.[7]
Effective August 1, 2013, the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act provides that the managers and controlling members of a limited liability company owe fiduciary duties of care and loyalty to the limited liability company and its members. Under the amendment (prompted by the Delaware Supreme Court's decision in Gatz Properties, LLC v. Auriga Capital Corp, November 2012), parties to an LLC remain free to expand, restrict, or eliminate fiduciary duties in their LLC agreements (subject to the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing).[8]
Under 6 Del. C. Section 18-101(7), a Delaware LLC operating agreement can be written, oral or implied. It sets forth member capital contributions, ownership percentages, and management structure. Like a prenuptial agreement, an operating agreement can avoid future disputes between members by addressing buy-out rights, valuation formulas, and transfer restrictions. A written LLC operating agreement should be signed by all of its members.[9]
Income tax[edit]
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, an LLC is treated by default as a pass-through entity.[10] If there is only one member in the company, the LLC is treated as a âdisregarded entityâ for tax purposes, and an individual owner would report the LLC's income or loss on Schedule C of his or her individual tax return. Thus, income from the LLC is taxed at the individual tax rates. The default tax status for LLCs with multiple members is as a partnership, which is required to report income and loss on IRS Form 1065. Under partnership tax treatment, each member of the LLC, as is the case for all partners of a partnership, annually receives a Form K-1 reporting the member's distributive share of the LLC's income or loss that is then reported on the member's individual income tax return. On the other hand, income from corporations is taxed twice, once at the corporate entity level and again when distributed to shareholders, thus more tax savings often result if a business formed as an LLC rather than a corporation.[11]
An LLC with either single or multiple members may elect to be taxed as a corporation through the filing of IRS Form 8832.[12] After electing corporate tax status, an LLC may further elect to be treated as a regular C corporation (taxation of the entity's income prior to any dividends or distributions to the members and then taxation of the dividends or distributions once received as income by the members) or as an S corporation (entity level income and loss passes through to the members). Some commentators have recommended an LLC taxed as a S-corporation as the best possible small business structure. It combines the simplicity and flexibility of an LLC with the tax benefits of an S-corporation (self-employment tax savings).[13]
Advantages[edit]

Choice of tax regime. An LLC can elect to be taxed as a sole proprietor, partnership, S corporation or C corporation (as long as they would otherwise qualify for such tax treatment), providing for a great deal of flexibility.
A limited liability company with multiple members that elects to be taxed as partnership may specially allocate the members' distributive share of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit via the company operating agreement on a basis other than the ownership percentage of each member so long as the rules contained in Treasury Regulation (26 CFR) 1.704-1 are met. S corporations may not specially allocate profits, losses and other tax items under US tax law.
The owners of the LLC, called "members", are protected from some or all liability for acts and debts of the LLC, depending on state shield laws.
In the United States, an S corporation has a limited number of stockholders, and all of them must be U.S. citizens; an LLC may have an unlimited number of members, and there is no citizenship restriction.
Much less administrative paperwork and record-keeping than a corporation.
Pass-through taxation (i.e., no double taxation), unless the LLC elects to be taxed as a C corporation.
Using default tax classification, profits are taxed personally at the member level, not at the LLC level.
LLCs in most states are treated as entities separate from their members. However, in some jurisdictions such as Connecticut, case law has determined that owners were not required to plead facts sufficient to pierce the corporate veil and LLC members can be personally liable for operation of the LLC (see, for example, the case of Sturm v. Harb Development[14]).
LLCs in some states can be set up with just one natural person involved.
Less risk of being "stolen" by fire-sale acquisitions (more protection against "hungry" investors).
For real estate companies, each separate property can be owned by its own individual LLC, thereby shielding not only the owners but their other properties from cross-liability.

Disadvantages[edit]
Although there is no statutory requirement for an operating agreement in most jurisdictions, members of a multiple member LLC who operate without one may encounter problems. Unlike state laws regarding stock corporations, which are very well developed and provide for a variety of governance and protective provisions for the corporation and its shareholders, most states do not dictate detailed governance and protective provisions for the members of a limited liability company. Thus, in the absence of such statutory provisions, the members of an LLC must establish governance and protective provisions pursuant to an operating agreement or similar governing document.

It may be more difficult to raise financial capital for an LLC as investors may be more comfortable investing funds in the better-understood corporate form with a view toward an eventual IPO. One possible solution may be to form a new corporation and merge into it, dissolving the LLC and converting into a corporation.
Many jurisdictionsâincluding Alabama, California, Kentucky, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Texasâlevy a franchise tax or capital values tax on LLCs. In essence, this franchise or business privilege tax is the fee the LLC pays the state for the benefit of limited liability. The franchise tax can be an amount based on revenue, an amount based on profits, or an amount based on the number of owners or the amount of capital employed in the state, or some combination of those factors, or simply a flat fee, as in Delaware.

Effective in Texas for 2007 the franchise tax is replaced with the Texas Business Margin Tax. This is paid as: tax payable = revenues minus some expenses with an apportionment factor. In most states, however, the fee is nominal and only a handful charge a tax comparable to the tax imposed on corporations.
In California, both foreign and domestic LLCs, corporations, and trusts, whether for-profit or non-profitâunless the entity is tax exemptâmust at least pay a minimum income tax of $800 per year to the Franchise Tax Board; and no foreign LLC, corporation or trust may conduct business in California unless it is duly registered with the California Secretary of State.


The District of Columbia considers LLCs to be taxable entities, thus eliminating the benefit of pass-through taxesâsubjecting members to double taxation.[15] Typically, LLCs will choose to be taxed as a partnership to avoid double taxation, which occurs in corporations. This allows companies to distribute their income among members who then report it on their personal tax returns.
Renewal fees may also be higher. Maryland, for example, charges a stock or nonstock corporation $120 for the initial charter, and $100 for an LLC. The fee for filing the annual report the following year is $300 for stock-corporations and LLCs. The fee is zero for non-stock corporations. In addition, certain states, such as New York, impose a publication requirement upon formation of the LLC which requires that the members of the LLC publish a notice in newspapers in the geographic region that the LLC will be located that it is being formed. For LLCs located in major metropolitan areas (e.g., New York City), the cost of publication can be significant.
The management structure of an LLC may not be clearly stated. Unlike corporations, they are not required to have a board of directors or officers. (This could also be seen as an advantage to some.)
Taxing jurisdictions outside the US are likely to treat a US LLC as a corporation, regardless of its treatment for US tax purposesâfor example a US LLC doing business outside the US or as a resident of a foreign jurisdiction.[16] This is very likely where the country (such as Canada) does not recognize LLCs as an authorized form of business entity in that country.
The principals of LLCs use many different titlesâe.g., member, manager, managing member, managing director, chief executive officer, president, and partner. As such, it can be difficult to determine who actually has the authority to enter into a contract on the LLC's behalf.

Variations[edit]

A Professional Limited Liability Company (PLLC, P.L.L.C., or P.L.) is a limited liability company organized for the purpose of providing professional services. Usually, professions where the state requires a license to provide services, such as a doctor, chiropractor, lawyer, accountant, architect, landscape architect, or engineer, require the formation of a PLLC.[17] However, some states, such as California, do not permit LLCs to engage in the practice of a licensed profession. Exact requirements of PLLCs vary from state to state. Typically, a PLLC's members must all be professionals practicing the same profession. In addition, the limitation of personal liability of members does not extend to professional malpractice claims.
A Series LLC is a special form of a Limited liability company that allows a single LLC to segregate its assets into separate series. For example, a series LLC that purchases separate pieces of real estate may put each in a separate series so if the lender forecloses on one piece of property, the others are not affected.
An L3C is a for-profit, social enterprise venture that has a stated goal of performing a socially beneficial purpose, not maximizing income. It is a hybrid structure that combines the legal and tax flexibility of a traditional LLC, the social benefits of a nonprofit organization, and the branding and market positioning advantages of a social enterprise.
An Anonymous Limited Liability Company is a LLC where ownership information is not made publicly available by the state where the LLC is registered. This is done by using a third-party to act as the organizer and registered agent of the LLC. Level of anonymity varies with different states.[18]

International equivalents[edit]





It has been suggested that this section be merged into Private limited company. (Discuss) Proposed since December 2014.


Companies with limited liability exist in business law worldwide. However, the limited liability company is a specific legal structure defined by the laws of U.S. states, with quite distinct characteristics. Many other countries have similar structures.
Albania[edit]
In Albania a limited liability company (Albanian: ShoqÃ«ri me pÃ«rgjegjÃ«si tÃ« kufizuar Sh.p.k) is a commercial company founded by persons of physical or judicial status, who are not liable for the company and personally bear losses only up to the outstanding contribution agreements. Partners' contributions constitute the registered capital of a limited liability company. Each partner has his quota in the company in proportion to the contribution of the capital so the registered capital of the company is divided between the partners based on the proportional ratio of their contribution. In Albania a limited liability company may not have a capital of less than 100 lek.[19]
Argentina[edit]
Although not an exact equivalent, the Argentine variant of the LLC is called Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada (S.R.L.) and it limits the liability of its members up to their capital contribution in the company. The equity is divided into equal stakes (can not be called "shares"), each one of which represents a percentage of the company and that can not be traded on the stock exchange. Their by-laws are regulated by law NÂ° 19550[20] and the commercial partnership is limited to a maximum of 50 partners.
Bosnia and Herzegovina[edit]
Bosnian and Herzegovinian legislation, similarly to that in Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia contemplates LLCs as druÅ¡tvo s ograniÄenom odgovornoÅ¡Äu (d.o.o.). Companies using this structure append the abbreviation d.o.o. to their company name. A shareholder or member in a d.o.o. is only personally liable up to the value of the memberâs investment in the company.[21]
Brazil[edit]
The corporate structure in Brazilian law most similar to the American LLC is the Sociedade Limitada (âLtda.â), under the new Brazilian Civil Code of 2002. The sociedade limitada is the new name of the sociedade por quotas de responsabilidade limitada, and it can be organized as empresÃ¡ria or simples, under this new code, roughly corresponding to the form types of comercial (âcommercialâ) and civil (ânon commercialâ) of the Commercial Code. A new law in Brazil has made it legal to obtain an LLC by a sole-proprietor called Empresa Individual de Responsabilidade Limitada (Eireli for short). The main requirement is a capital of 100 times the current minimum wage,[22] R$ 78.800,00 [23](US$26.267.00) as of 2015.
Bulgaria[edit]
Bulgarian legislation contemplates LLCs as ÐÑÑÐ¶ÐµÑÑÐ²Ð¾ Ñ Ð¾Ð³ÑÐ°Ð½Ð¸ÑÐµÐ½Ð° Ð¾ÑÐ³Ð¾Ð²Ð¾ÑÐ½Ð¾ÑÑ (Druzhestvo s ogranichena otgovornost; Limited liability company). Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation ÐÐÐ (OOD) to their name. In case of an LLC with individual owner it is contemplated as ÐÐ´Ð½Ð¾Ð»Ð¸ÑÐ½Ð¾ Ð´ÑÑÐ¶ÐµÑÑÐ²Ð¾ Ñ Ð¾Ð³ÑÐ°Ð½Ð¸ÑÐµÐ½Ð° Ð¾ÑÐ³Ð¾Ð²Ð¾ÑÐ½Ð¾ÑÑ (Ednolichno druzhestvo s ogranichena otgovornost; One-man/ Single-member limited liability company) and abbreviated as ÐÐÐÐ (EOOD).[24]
Chile[edit]
Chilean law contemplates a certain form of LLC known as "Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada" (Limited Liability Association). Also (LLC) These companies are regulated by law NÂ° 3.918. Among their most important characteristics we can say that:

They can pursue a commercial or non-commercial purpose (Sociedad Comercial de Responsabilidad Limitada / Sociedad Civil de Responsabilidad Limitada).
They must be formed by two or more partners and can hold up to a maximum of fifty.
Their equity is divided into "cuotas" (not shares) each one of which represents a percentage of the company.
They can be managed by one or more managers (external if need be), or by a board of directors.
Their by-laws can't be modified, nor their partners be changed, without the consent of all the other partners.
In tax considerations, they differ from the LLC's because they pay a corporate tax for their income, amount that can be deducted by their owners as a credit against the taxes they pay.

Chilean law also contemplates a very special kind of individual owner LLC called Empresa Individual de Responsabilidad Limitada (Limited Liability Individual Company), which uses the E.I.R.L. abbreviation.
Colombia[edit]
Colombian legislation contemplates a very similar structure as mentioned above in the Chilean case. The Ltda. abbreviation is also used in Colombia.[25]
Croatia[edit]
In Croatia, a private limited liability company is termed druÅ¡tvo s ograniÄenom odgovornoÅ¡Äu (literal: limited liability company), abbreviated d.o.o.. A public limited liability company is termed a dioniÄko druÅ¡tvo (literal: joint stock company) abbreviated d.d..[26]
Czech Republic[edit]
Czech legislation contemplates LLCs as spoleÄnost s ruÄenÃ­m omezenÃ½m (s.r.o. or spol. s r.o.). An s.r.o. is not technically comparable to an LLC because the profits are still subject to double taxation. Czech law does not offer a possibility to start up a limited company without the possibility of avoiding double taxation. As of 2014 the liability is not limited in Czech, since managing director (jednatel, mandatory board member in Czech LLCs) bears full liability that extends to all of his/her property, including private one.
Denmark[edit]
The Danish form of the LLC is the kommanditselskab (K/S). There is no minimum capital requirements. In a K/S there are two types of shareholders, the komplementar which is fully liable, and the kommanditist which liability is limited. The K/S is a tax-transparent company, which means the income "passes through" the company directly to the shareholders.
Dominican Republic[edit]
Dominican Republic legislation contemplates LLCs as Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada, also known by their abbreviation S.R.L.;; S.R.L.s award limited liability to their members up to their contribution in the company (i.e., contribution of capital). This type of company began after the law number 479 of the year 2008.
Estonia[edit]
In Estonia, a limited liability company is referred to as osaÃ¼hing (OÃ). The type of entity is also required to be identified in the name. An OÃ is taxed as a corporation. The minimum capital required by law is â¬2,500.
Finland[edit]
Although not an exact equivalent, the Finnish version of the LLC is the Oy (osakeyhtiÃ¶) or in Swedish Ab (aktiebolag). An Oy is taxed as a corporation. The minimum capital required by law is â¬2,500.[27]
Germany[edit]
Because of its hybrid characteristics it is very difficult to determine the German equivalent. On one hand it is possible to consider it as a kind of Gesellschaft mit beschrÃ¤nkter Haftung (GmbH) because it has aspects of a corporation; on the other hand it could be considered to be a kind of Kommanditgesellschaft (KG), which is the German equivalent of a limited partnership. Based on the literal translation of the word "company", an LLC should be considered to be a kind of KG without any liable partner. The German equivalent that comes closest to LLC, is GmbH & Co KG, a nested Kommanditgesellschaft (KG) where a Gesellschaft mit beschrÃ¤nkter Haftung (GmbH) takes the role of the fully liable partner. For the purpose of taxation, the Bundesfinanzministerium (German Federal Ministry of Finance) gives detailed guidelines of the circumstances under which an LLC is to be considered to be a "corporation" or as a "limited partnership".[28] It is useful to note, however, that the original LLC statutes of Wyoming and other US states were more or less explicitly modeled after the GmbH.[29]
Greece[edit]
A limited liability company (LLC) in Greece is synonymous to an EPE (ÎÎ Î - ÎÏÎ±Î¹ÏÎµÎ¯Î± Î ÎµÏÎ¹Î¿ÏÎ¹ÏÎ¼Î­Î½Î·Ï ÎÏÎ¸ÏÎ½Î·Ï).[30]
Hong Kong[edit]
In Hong Kong, the Limited Company is the most commonly incorporated type of company[31] and bears the characteristics of a Limited Liability Company. The core characteristics of a Hong Kong Limited Company include: i) it requires a minimum of one shareholder and one director (can be the same person), ii) a Hong Kong company requires a company secretary resident in HK, iii) foreign ownership is allowed, iv) company shareholders have limited liability and v) the company must have registered HK address.
Entrepreneurs who register a company in Hong Kong can choose a Hong Kong offshore company. This company structure is basically a HK Limited Company but all business is conducted outside of Hong Kong. The advantage of this structure is that all business income that is sourced outside of Hong Kong is tax exempt.
Hungary[edit]
Hungarian legislation contemplates LLCs as KorlÃ¡tolt felelÅssÃ©gÅ± tÃ¡rsasÃ¡g. Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation Kft. to their name.[32] Hungarian LLCs are required to have a 3 million HUF (Hungarian Forint) (approx. 11,000 USD) starting capital. The time of formation by the new electronic formation option has been reduced from 2 weeks to 2 hours, additional cost of formation is around 100,000 HUF (approx. 540 USD). Kft.s can be formed by the cooperation of lawyers.
The Hungarian Kft. is the most common form of doing business in Hungary. As being part of the European Union (EU), Hungarian Kft.s can now obtain an EU VAT registration number for doing business across the EU. The Hungarian EU-VAT reg. number starts with "HU". This way the existence of the subject company, VAT issues and the cross-check is available on the common EU website for companies.[citation needed]
Iceland[edit]
According to Icelandic legislation, there are two types of LLC forms, private and public held limited liability forms. Private LLC is abbreviated "Ehf." The minimum capital of 500,000 Icelandic krÃ³nas (kr.). Public LLC is abbreviated "Hf." with minimum capital of 4,000,000 kr and goes to LLC.
India[edit]
Commonly used business forms in India are:
(a) Public and Private Limited Companies - Incorporated entities with limited liabilities. These are very similar to "Corporations" under U.S law.
(b) Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs) - Incorporated entities with limited liability. The LLPs are organized as partnerships - they do not have a Board of Directors as such. LLP has lesser compliance requirements compared to Private limited companies. There is no maximum limit for the no. of partners in LLP. In the private limited company shareholders are limited to the extent of 200 shareholders.[33]
The above entities are treated as taxable entities ("persons"), and as such are liable to tax on their incomes. These entities do not offer "pass-through" taxation benefits, unlike LLCs in the USA.
India vide Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008 introduced concept of LLP and it got implemented in 2009. 2 persons are required to Incorporate LLP in India and they are called designated partners. This form is very organised in India and controlled under Ministry of Corporate Affairs. There is no specific minimum capital requirement. Foreign Direct Investment too allowed in LLP. Essential part is one of the 2 promoters must be Indian Resident.
Iran[edit]
As of 2015, there are seven types of companies which can be registered under Iran's company registration law. One of these seven types of companies and partnerships refers to LLPs. Like many other countries, two persons are required to form an LLP in Iran. Each person has his/her own shares and is responsible for business liability equivalent to his/her share percentage. LLPs in Iran are named according to the format illustrated by the following example: "Sherkat Ba Masooliyate Mahdood" translates as "Sherkat Ø´Ø±Ú©Øª Company" + "Mahdood ÙØ­Ø¯ÙØ¯ Limited" + "Masooliyat ÙØ³Ø¦ÙÙÛØª Liability".
Italy[edit]
The Italian Civil Code, approved in 1942 and as amended by the Government Act 6/2003 and furthers modifications, mainly provides three forms of limited liability company:

SocietÃ  per azioni (S.p.A.): the minimum required starting capital for an SpA is â¬50,000.[34] The capital is divided into shares (azioni) that can be transferred by endorsement or bought and sold on stock exchange. Only SpAs can be quoted in stock exchange market, issue corporate bonds, and other financial instruments. SpA form and a higher capital are required by law to operate in protected businesses (i.e. banks, leasing companies, etc.).
SocietÃ  a responsabilitÃ  limitata (Srl): the minimum required starting capital for an Srl is â¬10,000. Its capital is divided into stakes (quote) which can be bought or sold just by notarial act. Srls can issue corporate bonds but are subject to many limitations. Similar to the Srl is the SocietÃ  Cooperativa a ResponsabilitÃ  Limitata (Scarl) whose scope is not making profit but give benefits to stakes' holders.
SocietÃ  in accomandita per azioni (Sapa): the minimum required starting capital for a Sapa is â¬120,000 divided into shares. Sapas have a mixed liability scheme, where standard shareholders have limited liability while managing shareholders have full liability. Except this, SAPAs are exactly like SPAs even if uncommon.

Companies append the corresponding abbreviation to their company names.
Japan[edit]
Japan passed legislation in 1996 creating a new type of business organization, godo kaisha (J-LLC), a close variant of the American LLC.[citation needed] Japanese Tax authority does not consider J-LLC (Godo-Kaisha) a pass-through entity, but as a taxable entity.
Macedonia, Republic of[edit]
Macedonian legislation contemplates LLCs as ÐÑÑÑÑÐ²Ð¾ ÑÐ¾ Ð¾Ð³ÑÐ°Ð½Ð¸ÑÐµÐ½Ð° Ð¾Ð´Ð³Ð¾Ð²Ð¾ÑÐ½Ð¾ÑÑ (Drushtvo so ogranichena odgovornost). Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation Ð´.Ð¾.Ð¾. (d.o.o.) to their name. The minimum required starting capital for a d.o.o. is â¬5,000.
Mexico[edit]
Mexican legislation contemplates LLCs as Sociedades de Responsabilidad Limitada, also known for their abbreviation "S. de R.L.". S. de R.L.'s award limited liability to its members up to their contribution in the company (i.e., contribution of capital) and also act as pass-through or flow-through entities whereby profits are "passed-through" to its members, avoiding double taxation. This type of company is widely used by foreign investors in Mexico because of its "pass-through" modality and its "check the box" capability under the IRC (Internal Revenue Code of the U.S.).[citation needed]
Moldova[edit]
Moldovan legislation contemplates LLCs as Societate cu RÄspundere LimitatÄ, abbreviated "S.R.L.", and are regulated member(s)-founder(s), and other non-founder members, minimum one member-founder and maximum total of 50 members, at least one of them must be the founder of the company, but all of the 50 could be also founders.[citation needed]
Norway[edit]
In Norway, the closest to an LLC is probably the kommandittselskap (KS). In a K/S there are two types of participants, one komplementar which is fully liable, and one or more kommandittist, with limited liability. There are minimum capital requirements. The KS is a tax-transparent company, which means the income "passes through" the company directly to the shareholders.
Pakistan[edit]
In Pakistan, LLCs are known as private companies that end (Local Liability Company) with Pvt. Ltd. They should have at least Rs. 100,000 as their minimum paid up capital.
The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has made it mandatory for all listed companies to file their documents, returns, accounts and applications through the commission's eServices online filing facility, earlier, this requirement was only applicable to the companies, which had been incorporated through eServices online filing facility.[35]
Peru[edit]
There is no direct equivalent of an LLC in Peru, but some similar corporate forms include:

Sociedad anÃ³nima cerrada (SAC), a corporation which must have at least two and not more than twenty shareholders; its shares may not be offered to the public and cannot be traded on the stock exchange.
Sociedad comercial de responsabilidad limitada (SRL), a commercial partnership divided in equal participations which may not be called "shares". It must have at least two and not more than twenty partners.
Sociedad civil de responsabilidad limitada (S civil de RL), a professional partnership of at least two and not more than thirty individuals, with co-owner participation in the form of capital, of professional contribution, or of any combination of both.
Empresa individual de responsabilidad limitada (EIRL), a legal entity with one single owner.

The capital for any of the above entities is freely determined by its statutes. There is no minimum requirement except for entities with certain types of activities, mainly in the financial markets, and then irrespective of their type.[36]
Poland[edit]
In Poland, a limited liability company is referred to literally as âcompany with limited liabilityâ (spÃ³Åka z ograniczonÄ odpowiedzialnoÅciÄ, legally abbreviated as sp. z o.o. (or sometimes Sp. z o.o. in particular names). Informally, in the Polish speaking slang, it is abbreviated as spÃ³Åka zoo (pronounced with a long "o", as in "tow."). However, sp. z o.o. has a (separate from its owners) legal personality, which gives it the ability to do certain actions under law, and it is considered a "corporation".
The minimum start capital is 5,000 PLN (since 2009; until then, 50,000 PLN).
Portugal[edit]
In Portugal, LLCs are called "Sociedades de Responsabilidade Limitada", that is, "company of limited responsibility", usually abbreviated Lda.. They are tax subject, and company shares cannot be sold in a public market, since 2006 the transference of them is not required to be done in the presence of a civil law notary, except if the company owns buildings, in the same way other major properties have to be sold. Nonetheless, the responsibility of the partners is limited to the capital share they hold, and the minimum capital required by law for a Lda. of â¬5000. (In 2006 the PS Government, led by JosÃ© Socrates, did reduce the minimum capital to â¬1, but in 2011 the new PSD Government, led by Pedro Passos Coelho, reinstated the â¬5000 minimum capital.) The capital is not required to be deposited at the time of the registration of the company, instead the share holders have until 31 December of the year the registry was made.[citation needed]
Romania[edit]
Romania recognizes the limited liability company since 1990 under the name of societate cu rÄspundere limitatÄ (S.R.L.), in which the owners are personally liable for the company obligations within the limit of their contribution to social capital. The minimum start capital is 200 RON which currently amounts to less than â¬50.[37]
Russia[edit]
In Russia and certain other former Soviet countries, an entity with a somewhat similar structure is known as ÐÐ±ÑÐµÑÑÐ²Ð¾ Ñ Ð¾Ð³ÑÐ°Ð½Ð¸ÑÐµÐ½Ð½Ð¾Ð¹ Ð¾ÑÐ²ÐµÑÑÑÐ²ÐµÐ½Ð½Ð¾ÑÑÑÑ (Obshchestvo s ogranichennoy otvetstvennost'yu) (lit., "company with limited liability"), usually abbreviated OOO, or in some CIS countries as OÑOO.[citation needed]
Although a Russian limited liability company shares the same name with an American LLC, it is different in many ways. Most importantly, a Russian LLC is not tax transparent: the company is taxed at the corporate level, and then, upon distribution of dividends, shareholders pay income tax (personal or corporate).[citation needed]
A limited liability company is the most popular form of legal undertaking in Russia for simple shareholding structures.[38]
The minimum capital required is 10,000 Russian rubles.
Serbia[edit]
Serbian legislation contemplates LLCs as druÅ¡tvo sa ograniÄenom odgovornoÅ¡Äu. Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation d.o.o. or DOO to their name same as in Croatia. As in the Czech Republic, a d.o.o. is not technically comparable to an LLC because the profits are still subject to double taxation.[citation needed] In Kosovo a company does not need to provide proof for payment of capital.[39]
Slovakia[edit]
In Slovakia, the law contemplates spoloÄnosÅ¥ s ruÄenÃ­m obmedzenÃ½m (abbreviation spol. s r. o. or s. r. o.) or as the rough equivalent of a limited liability company. It is very popular form of business organization due to ensurance of limited liability in exchange for a relatively small investment into the registered capital. From one to 50 associates can found it through a founding agreement with minimum registered capital of â¬5000, minimum â¬750 per person, in money or other property. (Â§ 105â153 of Act. No 513/1991 Coll. â Commercial Code as amended.)[40][41]
Slovenia[edit]
Slovenian legislation contemplates LLCs as druÅ¾ba z omejeno odgovornostjo. Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation d. o. o. to their name. The minimum required starting capital for a d. o. o. is â¬7,500. Due to the high cost and complicated bookkeeping of a real corporation, this is a more widespread form.[citation needed]
Spain[edit]
In Spain, LLCs are called Sociedad de responsabilidad limitada (SRL), "company of limited responsibility", or sociedad limitada (SL), or "limited partnership". They are tax subject, and company shares cannot be sold in a public market, the transference of them having to be done compulsorily in the presence of a civil law notary, in the same way other major properties have to be sold. Nonetheless, the responsibility of the partners is limited to the capital share they hold, and the minimum capital required by law for a S.L. is at least â¬3,000.
Sweden[edit]
Sweden has no equivalent of an LLC. The closest company form is the handelsbolag (lit.: "trade company"). The Swedish AB (aktiebolag; lit.: "share company"), like the handelsbolag, is a tax subject and is more similar to a US C Corporation than an LLC. The minimum capital required by law in a private company, privat aktiebolag, is SEK 50,000, although this may be in the form of assets as well as capital. It should be noted that the AB structure requires shareholders, a Board of Directors, and regular meetings of both, together with complete accounts once per year. Depending on the size of the AB, the accounts may have to be audited. Creation or purchase "off-the-shelf" of an AB is relatively cheap and tax effective, but liquidation of a created aktiebolag can be an expensive and time-consuming operation.[42] Creation of public limited liability companies, or publikt aktiebolag, which can raise capital from the public, requires a minimum capitalization of SEK 500,000, however the overall regulation of public companies in Sweden, especially regarding accounting methods and taxes, is thorough and detailed.[43]
Switzerland[edit]
The Swiss Code of Obligations[44] provides for different kinds of companies with limited liability, the two most commonly used are:
Swiss Limited Liability Company:[45][46] The terms for this kind of company used in the three official languages of the Swiss Confederation are as follows: In German Gesellschaft mit beschrÃ¤nkter Haftung (abbreviation: GmbH), in French SociÃ©tÃ© Ã  responsabilitÃ© limitÃ©e (abbreviation: S.Ã  r.l. or SARL) and in Italian SocietÃ  a Garanzia Limitata (abbreviation: SaGL). A Swiss LLC is similar to an LLC with respect to various matters, including the following: Members may also be natural persons, corporations, partnerships or other LLCs,[47] the liability of a member of a Swiss LLC to pay for the LLC's obligations is limited to its capital contribution,[48] a Swiss LLC may be either member-managed or manager-managed,[49] and, unless otherwise provided for in the operating agreement, the membersâ right to control or manage a Swiss LLC is proportionate to their individual membership interest.[50] The membership interests in a Swiss LLC have to be registered[51] and, thus, they may only be issued in the name of a member but not to the bearer.
Swiss Corporation[46][52] (in English common law context usually translated as company limited by shares): The terms for this kind of company used in the three official languages of the Swiss Confederation are as follows: In German Aktiengesellschaft (abbreviation: AG), in French SociÃ©tÃ© Anonyme (abbreviation: SA) and in Italian SocietÃ  Anonima (abbreviation: SA). A Swiss corporation is with respect to various matters different from an LLC (including a Swiss LLC): Most important is that a Swiss corporation may, neither by default nor by exercising any respective option provided by the Swiss law, be member-managed like an LLC, as the respective mandatory provisions of Swiss law provide that the board of directors has certain non-transferable duties.[53] Furthermore, the shares of a Swiss corporation may also be issued to the bearer (bearer shares)[54] and, thus, not only in the name of a holder (registered shares), which, however, applies to the membership interests in a Swiss LLC, which may only be registered.
Tajikistan[edit]
In Tajikistan, the same as in Russia, an entity with a somewhat similar structure is known as "Ò¶Ð°Ð¼ÑÐ¸ÑÑÐ¸ Ð´Ð¾ÑÐ¾Ð¸ Ð¼Ð°ÑÑÑÐ»Ð¸ÑÑÐ¸ Ð¼Ð°Ò³Ð´ÑÐ´", Chamiyti Doroi Masuliyti Machdud, abbreviated as "Ò¶ÐÐÐ".
Turkey[edit]
Minimum capital should be 10,000 TL. That capital could be the minimum total capital of company. Number of founding shareholders (real persons or legal entities) could be minimum 1 and maximum 50. All or some of the shareholders could be foreign nationals. There is no issued stock certificates and all shareholders liability is limited to their registered capital amount. 1/4 of capital should be blocked in a Bank until procedure of registration ends. The equivalent of LLC for Turkish is Ltd. Åti. (Which means Limited Åirketi.)
Ukraine[edit]
This type of entity has existed in Ukraine since the 1990s. LLC is the most common type of business entity in Ukraine.[55] In Ukrainian, it is spelled "Ð¢Ð¾Ð²Ð°ÑÐ¸ÑÑÐ²Ð¾ Ð· Ð¾Ð±Ð¼ÐµÐ¶ÐµÐ½Ð¾Ñ Ð²ÑÐ´Ð¿Ð¾Ð²ÑÐ´Ð°Ð»ÑÐ½ÑÑÑÑ" (abbreviated â TÐÐ, TÐ·ÐÐ), in transliteration "Tovarystvo z Obmezhenoyu Vidpovidalnistyu," that is, "company with limited liability".
By Ukrainian law LLC is a legal person. Authorized capital of LLC is divided into shares (or stakes), the amount of which is determined by the charter. LLC is responsible to the creditors only with its assets. Legal entities (foreign or Ukrainian companies) individuals, regardless of their country of citizenship or residency can be the founders (participants) of LLC. Limited liability company can be formed either by one person or by several individuals or legal entities (corporations). Maximum number of participants (founders) of LLC in Ukraine is 100. Since 2014 registration procedure has been significantly simplified in Ukraine. Minimum amount of authorised capital is 1 (one) hryvnia (less than 0,04 US cents). There is no state fee for LLC formation.
By Ukrainian Law LLC dividend payment is possible after the declaration of companyâs income or profit to the fiscal/tax authorities and the approval of the income statement.[56] Thus, regardless of the tax system, LLC can make dividend payments up to 4 times a year, or one time a quarter.
Taxation. LLC can be registered:
â as corporate/profit tax (18% rate) with or without VAT (up to 20% rate, depends on product or service) tax payer;
â fixed tax rate (in transliteration "yediniy podatok" or "sproschena sistema opodatkuvannia") is a 5% rate from revenue, with or without (on request) VAT registration.
United Arab Emirates[edit]
A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is the most common type of registration in the UAE and is recommended where the purpose of the entity is to make sales within the region. However, it should be noted that 100% foreign ownership of such an entity is not permitted. Under the UAE Commercial Companies Law (CCL), foreign investors are permitted to hold up to 49 per cent equity ownership in UAE companies and 51 per cent of the equity must be held at all times by one or more UAE nationals. In accordance with Article (218) of the CCL a Limited Liability Company can be formed by a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 50 shareholders whose liability is limited to their shares in the capital of the company. Recent amendments to Article (217) of the CCL that came into force in June 2009 removed the requirement for minimum share capital (previously AED 300,000 in Dubai and AED 150,000 in other Emirates) allowing founders of a limited liability company the freedom to determine the companyâs share capital which could be less than the earlier prescribed bottom line. Shares of an LLC are not open for subscription by the public.[57] Despite the split in shareholdings, profits may be divided in other ratios agreed upon, taking into consideration efforts of foreign partners in management, provision of technology or expertise. Responsibility for the management of a LLC can be vested in the foreign partner or UAE national partners or a third party. A LLC must appoint a minimum of one manager and up to a maximum of five managers for the business. Managers must be appointed by a Memorandum of Association or by a management contract, for a fixed term or an unlimited term. Unless the Memorandum of Association states otherwise, the manager has full powers of administration and management of the LLC. LLC is not allowed to practice its activities in the UAE without a Trade License and Commercial Registration Certificate.
[58]
United Kingdom[edit]
The new form of limited liability partnership (LLP), created in 2000, is similar to a US LLC in being tax neutral: member partners are taxed at the partner level, but the LLP itself pays no tax. It is treated as a body corporate for all other purposes including VAT. Otherwise, all companies, including limited companies and US LLCs, are treated as bodies corporate subject to United Kingdom corporation tax if the profits of the entity belong to the entity and not to its members.
United States[edit]
A limited liability company (LLC) is a relatively new business structure authorized by state statutes.[59] The LLC is chiefly inspired by the GmbH ("Company with limited liability"), a type of business organization in Germany, and by the limitada, a type of business organization available in many Latin American countries.[29]
In the United States, the first limited liability company act appeared in Wyoming in 1977 as special interest[60] legislation for an oil company.[61] In 1980, the Internal Revenue Service issued a private letter ruling to an LLC formed under the Wyoming LLC Act, indicating that the IRS would treat the LLC as a partnership for federal tax purposes.[62] However, later that year, the IRS proposed regulations that would deny partnership classification to any business entity in which no member bore personal responsibility for the entity's liabilities.[63] In 1982, Florida adopted an LLC act modeled on Wyoming's LLC Act.[64] Due to uncertainty over the tax treatment of LLCs, no other states introduced LLC legislation until after 1988.[65] In 1988, the IRS issued a revenue ruling stating that it would treat a Wyoming-style LLC as a partnership for tax purposes.[66] By 1996, nearly every state had enacted an LLC statute.[67] The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws adopted the Uniform Limited Liability Company Act in 1996 and revised it in 2006.[68]
A potential disadvantage specific to the United States is that LLCs are not considered to be corporations for the purposes of federal civil procedure; they are instead treated as partnerships. This affects the applicability of diversity jurisdiction in cases involving LLCs, barring application of diversity jurisdiction when even one member of the LLC is a citizen of the same state as one of the opposing parties. Should one member of an LLC be a citizen of a state of which one of the opposing parties is a citizen, any case between the LLC and those parties must be heard in that state's courts; corporations enjoy a more complete legal personhood that only denies diversity jurisdiction when the opposing party is a citizen of the state in which the corporation is incorporated (most commonly Delaware for large corporations, which has a small population) or has its principal place of business.
AOL was set up as an LLC during its ownership by Time Warner from 2001 to 2008. There is a similar setup for BMW's American subsidiary, BMW of North America, LLC. Chrysler has been an LLC since restructuring during the auto industry bailout of 2009, owned by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V..

A limited liability company (LLC) is the United States-specific form of a private limited company. It is a business structure that combines the pass-through taxation of a partnership or sole proprietorship with the limited liability of a corporation.[1][2] An LLC is not a corporation; it is a legal form of a company that provides limited liability to its owners in many jurisdictions. LLCs do not need to be organized for profit.[3] In certain U.S. states (for example, Texas), businesses that provide professional services requiring a state professional license, such as legal or medical services, may not be allowed to form an LLC but may be required to form a similar entity called a professional limited liability company (PLLC).[4]

Overview[edit]
A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is a hybrid business entity having certain characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership or sole proprietorship (depending on how many owners there are). An LLC, although a business entity, is a type of unincorporated association and is not a corporation. The primary characteristic an LLC shares with a corporation is limited liability, and the primary characteristic it shares with a partnership is the availability of pass-through income taxation. It is often more flexible than a corporation, and it is well-suited for companies with a single owner.
In the absence of express statutory guidance, most American courts have held that LLC members are subject to the same common law alter ego piercing theories as corporate shareholders. However, it is more difficult to pierce the LLC veil because LLCs do not have many formalities to maintain. So long as the LLC and the members do not commingle funds, it would be difficult to pierce this veil.[5] Membership interests in LLCs and partnership interests are also afforded a significant level of protection through the charging order mechanism. The charging order limits the creditor of a debtor-partner or a debtor-member to the debtor's share of distributions, without conferring on the creditor any voting or management rights.[citation needed] Limited liability company members may, in certain circumstances, also incur a personal liability in cases where distributions to members render the LLC insolvent.[6]
Flexibility and default rules[edit]
The phrase "unless otherwise provided for in the operating agreement" (or its equivalent) is found throughout all existing LLC statutes[citation needed] and is responsible for the flexibility the members of the LLC have in deciding how their LLC will be governed (provided it does not go outside legal bounds). State statutes typically provide automatic or "default" rules for how an LLC will be governed unless the operating agreement provides otherwise.
Similarly, the phrase "unless otherwise provided for in the by laws" is also found in all corporation law statutes[citation needed] but often refers only to a narrower range of matters.
The limited liability company ("LLC") has grown to become one of the most prevalent business forms in the United States. As the LLC's popularity has surged, unforeseen issues have emerged in these new statutes, particularly around single-member LLCs in Florida, New York, California, Colorado, and Georgia, where personal asset protection has been subverted.[7]
Effective August 1, 2013, the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act provides that the managers and controlling members of a limited liability company owe fiduciary duties of care and loyalty to the limited liability company and its members. Under the amendment (prompted by the Delaware Supreme Court's decision in Gatz Properties, LLC v. Auriga Capital Corp, November 2012), parties to an LLC remain free to expand, restrict, or eliminate fiduciary duties in their LLC agreements (subject to the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing).[8]
Under 6 Del. C. Section 18-101(7), a Delaware LLC operating agreement can be written, oral or implied. It sets forth member capital contributions, ownership percentages, and management structure. Like a prenuptial agreement, an operating agreement can avoid future disputes between members by addressing buy-out rights, valuation formulas, and transfer restrictions. A written LLC operating agreement should be signed by all of its members.[9]
Income tax[edit]
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, an LLC is treated by default as a pass-through entity.[10] If there is only one member in the company, the LLC is treated as a âdisregarded entityâ for tax purposes, and an individual owner would report the LLC's income or loss on Schedule C of his or her individual tax return. Thus, income from the LLC is taxed at the individual tax rates. The default tax status for LLCs with multiple members is as a partnership, which is required to report income and loss on IRS Form 1065. Under partnership tax treatment, each member of the LLC, as is the case for all partners of a partnership, annually receives a Form K-1 reporting the member's distributive share of the LLC's income or loss that is then reported on the member's individual income tax return. On the other hand, income from corporations is taxed twice, once at the corporate entity level and again when distributed to shareholders, thus more tax savings often result if a business formed as an LLC rather than a corporation.[11]
An LLC with either single or multiple members may elect to be taxed as a corporation through the filing of IRS Form 8832.[12] After electing corporate tax status, an LLC may further elect to be treated as a regular C corporation (taxation of the entity's income prior to any dividends or distributions to the members and then taxation of the dividends or distributions once received as income by the members) or as an S corporation (entity level income and loss passes through to the members). Some commentators have recommended an LLC taxed as a S-corporation as the best possible small business structure. It combines the simplicity and flexibility of an LLC with the tax benefits of an S-corporation (self-employment tax savings).[13]
Advantages[edit]

Choice of tax regime. An LLC can elect to be taxed as a sole proprietor, partnership, S corporation or C corporation (as long as they would otherwise qualify for such tax treatment), providing for a great deal of flexibility.
A limited liability company with multiple members that elects to be taxed as partnership may specially allocate the members' distributive share of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit via the company operating agreement on a basis other than the ownership percentage of each member so long as the rules contained in Treasury Regulation (26 CFR) 1.704-1 are met. S corporations may not specially allocate profits, losses and other tax items under US tax law.
The owners of the LLC, called "members", are protected from some or all liability for acts and debts of the LLC, depending on state shield laws.
In the United States, an S corporation has a limited number of stockholders, and all of them must be U.S. citizens; an LLC may have an unlimited number of members, and there is no citizenship restriction.
Much less administrative paperwork and record-keeping than a corporation.
Pass-through taxation (i.e., no double taxation), unless the LLC elects to be taxed as a C corporation.
Using default tax classification, profits are taxed personally at the member level, not at the LLC level.
LLCs in most states are treated as entities separate from their members. However, in some jurisdictions such as Connecticut, case law has determined that owners were not required to plead facts sufficient to pierce the corporate veil and LLC members can be personally liable for operation of the LLC (see, for example, the case of Sturm v. Harb Development[14]).
LLCs in some states can be set up with just one natural person involved.
Less risk of being "stolen" by fire-sale acquisitions (more protection against "hungry" investors).
For real estate companies, each separate property can be owned by its own individual LLC, thereby shielding not only the owners but their other properties from cross-liability.

Disadvantages[edit]
Although there is no statutory requirement for an operating agreement in most jurisdictions, members of a multiple member LLC who operate without one may encounter problems. Unlike state laws regarding stock corporations, which are very well developed and provide for a variety of governance and protective provisions for the corporation and its shareholders, most states do not dictate detailed governance and protective provisions for the members of a limited liability company. Thus, in the absence of such statutory provisions, the members of an LLC must establish governance and protective provisions pursuant to an operating agreement or similar governing document.

It may be more difficult to raise financial capital for an LLC as investors may be more comfortable investing funds in the better-understood corporate form with a view toward an eventual IPO. One possible solution may be to form a new corporation and merge into it, dissolving the LLC and converting into a corporation.
Many jurisdictionsâincluding Alabama, California, Kentucky, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Texasâlevy a franchise tax or capital values tax on LLCs. In essence, this franchise or business privilege tax is the fee the LLC pays the state for the benefit of limited liability. The franchise tax can be an amount based on revenue, an amount based on profits, or an amount based on the number of owners or the amount of capital employed in the state, or some combination of those factors, or simply a flat fee, as in Delaware.

Effective in Texas for 2007 the franchise tax is replaced with the Texas Business Margin Tax. This is paid as: tax payable = revenues minus some expenses with an apportionment factor. In most states, however, the fee is nominal and only a handful charge a tax comparable to the tax imposed on corporations.
In California, both foreign and domestic LLCs, corporations, and trusts, whether for-profit or non-profitâunless the entity is tax exemptâmust at least pay a minimum income tax of $800 per year to the Franchise Tax Board; and no foreign LLC, corporation or trust may conduct business in California unless it is duly registered with the California Secretary of State.


The District of Columbia considers LLCs to be taxable entities, thus eliminating the benefit of pass-through taxesâsubjecting members to double taxation.[15] Typically, LLCs will choose to be taxed as a partnership to avoid double taxation, which occurs in corporations. This allows companies to distribute their income among members who then report it on their personal tax returns.
Renewal fees may also be higher. Maryland, for example, charges a stock or nonstock corporation $120 for the initial charter, and $100 for an LLC. The fee for filing the annual report the following year is $300 for stock-corporations and LLCs. The fee is zero for non-stock corporations. In addition, certain states, such as New York, impose a publication requirement upon formation of the LLC which requires that the members of the LLC publish a notice in newspapers in the geographic region that the LLC will be located that it is being formed. For LLCs located in major metropolitan areas (e.g., New York City), the cost of publication can be significant.
The management structure of an LLC may not be clearly stated. Unlike corporations, they are not required to have a board of directors or officers. (This could also be seen as an advantage to some.)
Taxing jurisdictions outside the US are likely to treat a US LLC as a corporation, regardless of its treatment for US tax purposesâfor example a US LLC doing business outside the US or as a resident of a foreign jurisdiction.[16] This is very likely where the country (such as Canada) does not recognize LLCs as an authorized form of business entity in that country.
The principals of LLCs use many different titlesâe.g., member, manager, managing member, managing director, chief executive officer, president, and partner. As such, it can be difficult to determine who actually has the authority to enter into a contract on the LLC's behalf.

Variations[edit]

A Professional Limited Liability Company (PLLC, P.L.L.C., or P.L.) is a limited liability company organized for the purpose of providing professional services. Usually, professions where the state requires a license to provide services, such as a doctor, chiropractor, lawyer, accountant, architect, landscape architect, or engineer, require the formation of a PLLC.[17] However, some states, such as California, do not permit LLCs to engage in the practice of a licensed profession. Exact requirements of PLLCs vary from state to state. Typically, a PLLC's members must all be professionals practicing the same profession. In addition, the limitation of personal liability of members does not extend to professional malpractice claims.
A Series LLC is a special form of a Limited liability company that allows a single LLC to segregate its assets into separate series. For example, a series LLC that purchases separate pieces of real estate may put each in a separate series so if the lender forecloses on one piece of property, the others are not affected.
An L3C is a for-profit, social enterprise venture that has a stated goal of performing a socially beneficial purpose, not maximizing income. It is a hybrid structure that combines the legal and tax flexibility of a traditional LLC, the social benefits of a nonprofit organization, and the branding and market positioning advantages of a social enterprise.
An Anonymous Limited Liability Company is a LLC where ownership information is not made publicly available by the state where the LLC is registered. This is done by using a third-party to act as the organizer and registered agent of the LLC. Level of anonymity varies with different states.[18]

International equivalents[edit]





It has been suggested that this section be merged into Private limited company. (Discuss) Proposed since December 2014.


Companies with limited liability exist in business law worldwide. However, the limited liability company is a specific legal structure defined by the laws of U.S. states, with quite distinct characteristics. Many other countries have similar structures.
Albania[edit]
In Albania a limited liability company (Albanian: ShoqÃ«ri me pÃ«rgjegjÃ«si tÃ« kufizuar Sh.p.k) is a commercial company founded by persons of physical or judicial status, who are not liable for the company and personally bear losses only up to the outstanding contribution agreements. Partners' contributions constitute the registered capital of a limited liability company. Each partner has his quota in the company in proportion to the contribution of the capital so the registered capital of the company is divided between the partners based on the proportional ratio of their contribution. In Albania a limited liability company may not have a capital of less than 100 lek.[19]
Argentina[edit]
Although not an exact equivalent, the Argentine variant of the LLC is called Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada (S.R.L.) and it limits the liability of its members up to their capital contribution in the company. The equity is divided into equal stakes (can not be called "shares"), each one of which represents a percentage of the company and that can not be traded on the stock exchange. Their by-laws are regulated by law NÂ° 19550[20] and the commercial partnership is limited to a maximum of 50 partners.
Bosnia and Herzegovina[edit]
Bosnian and Herzegovinian legislation, similarly to that in Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia contemplates LLCs as druÅ¡tvo s ograniÄenom odgovornoÅ¡Äu (d.o.o.). Companies using this structure append the abbreviation d.o.o. to their company name. A shareholder or member in a d.o.o. is only personally liable up to the value of the memberâs investment in the company.[21]
Brazil[edit]
The corporate structure in Brazilian law most similar to the American LLC is the Sociedade Limitada (âLtda.â), under the new Brazilian Civil Code of 2002. The sociedade limitada is the new name of the sociedade por quotas de responsabilidade limitada, and it can be organized as empresÃ¡ria or simples, under this new code, roughly corresponding to the form types of comercial (âcommercialâ) and civil (ânon commercialâ) of the Commercial Code. A new law in Brazil has made it legal to obtain an LLC by a sole-proprietor called Empresa Individual de Responsabilidade Limitada (Eireli for short). The main requirement is a capital of 100 times the current minimum wage,[22] R$ 78.800,00 [23](US$26.267.00) as of 2015.
Bulgaria[edit]
Bulgarian legislation contemplates LLCs as ÐÑÑÐ¶ÐµÑÑÐ²Ð¾ Ñ Ð¾Ð³ÑÐ°Ð½Ð¸ÑÐµÐ½Ð° Ð¾ÑÐ³Ð¾Ð²Ð¾ÑÐ½Ð¾ÑÑ (Druzhestvo s ogranichena otgovornost; Limited liability company). Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation ÐÐÐ (OOD) to their name. In case of an LLC with individual owner it is contemplated as ÐÐ´Ð½Ð¾Ð»Ð¸ÑÐ½Ð¾ Ð´ÑÑÐ¶ÐµÑÑÐ²Ð¾ Ñ Ð¾Ð³ÑÐ°Ð½Ð¸ÑÐµÐ½Ð° Ð¾ÑÐ³Ð¾Ð²Ð¾ÑÐ½Ð¾ÑÑ (Ednolichno druzhestvo s ogranichena otgovornost; One-man/ Single-member limited liability company) and abbreviated as ÐÐÐÐ (EOOD).[24]
Chile[edit]
Chilean law contemplates a certain form of LLC known as "Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada" (Limited Liability Association). Also (LLC) These companies are regulated by law NÂ° 3.918. Among their most important characteristics we can say that:

They can pursue a commercial or non-commercial purpose (Sociedad Comercial de Responsabilidad Limitada / Sociedad Civil de Responsabilidad Limitada).
They must be formed by two or more partners and can hold up to a maximum of fifty.
Their equity is divided into "cuotas" (not shares) each one of which represents a percentage of the company.
They can be managed by one or more managers (external if need be), or by a board of directors.
Their by-laws can't be modified, nor their partners be changed, without the consent of all the other partners.
In tax considerations, they differ from the LLC's because they pay a corporate tax for their income, amount that can be deducted by their owners as a credit against the taxes they pay.

Chilean law also contemplates a very special kind of individual owner LLC called Empresa Individual de Responsabilidad Limitada (Limited Liability Individual Company), which uses the E.I.R.L. abbreviation.
Colombia[edit]
Colombian legislation contemplates a very similar structure as mentioned above in the Chilean case. The Ltda. abbreviation is also used in Colombia.[25]
Croatia[edit]
In Croatia, a private limited liability company is termed druÅ¡tvo s ograniÄenom odgovornoÅ¡Äu (literal: limited liability company), abbreviated d.o.o.. A public limited liability company is termed a dioniÄko druÅ¡tvo (literal: joint stock company) abbreviated d.d..[26]
Czech Republic[edit]
Czech legislation contemplates LLCs as spoleÄnost s ruÄenÃ­m omezenÃ½m (s.r.o. or spol. s r.o.). An s.r.o. is not technically comparable to an LLC because the profits are still subject to double taxation. Czech law does not offer a possibility to start up a limited company without the possibility of avoiding double taxation. As of 2014 the liability is not limited in Czech, since managing director (jednatel, mandatory board member in Czech LLCs) bears full liability that extends to all of his/her property, including private one.
Denmark[edit]
The Danish form of the LLC is the kommanditselskab (K/S). There is no minimum capital requirements. In a K/S there are two types of shareholders, the komplementar which is fully liable, and the kommanditist which liability is limited. The K/S is a tax-transparent company, which means the income "passes through" the company directly to the shareholders.
Dominican Republic[edit]
Dominican Republic legislation contemplates LLCs as Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada, also known by their abbreviation S.R.L.;; S.R.L.s award limited liability to their members up to their contribution in the company (i.e., contribution of capital). This type of company began after the law number 479 of the year 2008.
Estonia[edit]
In Estonia, a limited liability company is referred to as osaÃ¼hing (OÃ). The type of entity is also required to be identified in the name. An OÃ is taxed as a corporation. The minimum capital required by law is â¬2,500.
Finland[edit]
Although not an exact equivalent, the Finnish version of the LLC is the Oy (osakeyhtiÃ¶) or in Swedish Ab (aktiebolag). An Oy is taxed as a corporation. The minimum capital required by law is â¬2,500.[27]
Germany[edit]
Because of its hybrid characteristics it is very difficult to determine the German equivalent. On one hand it is possible to consider it as a kind of Gesellschaft mit beschrÃ¤nkter Haftung (GmbH) because it has aspects of a corporation; on the other hand it could be considered to be a kind of Kommanditgesellschaft (KG), which is the German equivalent of a limited partnership. Based on the literal translation of the word "company", an LLC should be considered to be a kind of KG without any liable partner. The German equivalent that comes closest to LLC, is GmbH & Co KG, a nested Kommanditgesellschaft (KG) where a Gesellschaft mit beschrÃ¤nkter Haftung (GmbH) takes the role of the fully liable partner. For the purpose of taxation, the Bundesfinanzministerium (German Federal Ministry of Finance) gives detailed guidelines of the circumstances under which an LLC is to be considered to be a "corporation" or as a "limited partnership".[28] It is useful to note, however, that the original LLC statutes of Wyoming and other US states were more or less explicitly modeled after the GmbH.[29]
Greece[edit]
A limited liability company (LLC) in Greece is synonymous to an EPE (ÎÎ Î - ÎÏÎ±Î¹ÏÎµÎ¯Î± Î ÎµÏÎ¹Î¿ÏÎ¹ÏÎ¼Î­Î½Î·Ï ÎÏÎ¸ÏÎ½Î·Ï).[30]
Hong Kong[edit]
In Hong Kong, the Limited Company is the most commonly incorporated type of company[31] and bears the characteristics of a Limited Liability Company. The core characteristics of a Hong Kong Limited Company include: i) it requires a minimum of one shareholder and one director (can be the same person), ii) a Hong Kong company requires a company secretary resident in HK, iii) foreign ownership is allowed, iv) company shareholders have limited liability and v) the company must have registered HK address.
Entrepreneurs who register a company in Hong Kong can choose a Hong Kong offshore company. This company structure is basically a HK Limited Company but all business is conducted outside of Hong Kong. The advantage of this structure is that all business income that is sourced outside of Hong Kong is tax exempt.
Hungary[edit]
Hungarian legislation contemplates LLCs as KorlÃ¡tolt felelÅssÃ©gÅ± tÃ¡rsasÃ¡g. Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation Kft. to their name.[32] Hungarian LLCs are required to have a 3 million HUF (Hungarian Forint) (approx. 11,000 USD) starting capital. The time of formation by the new electronic formation option has been reduced from 2 weeks to 2 hours, additional cost of formation is around 100,000 HUF (approx. 540 USD). Kft.s can be formed by the cooperation of lawyers.
The Hungarian Kft. is the most common form of doing business in Hungary. As being part of the European Union (EU), Hungarian Kft.s can now obtain an EU VAT registration number for doing business across the EU. The Hungarian EU-VAT reg. number starts with "HU". This way the existence of the subject company, VAT issues and the cross-check is available on the common EU website for companies.[citation needed]
Iceland[edit]
According to Icelandic legislation, there are two types of LLC forms, private and public held limited liability forms. Private LLC is abbreviated "Ehf." The minimum capital of 500,000 Icelandic krÃ³nas (kr.). Public LLC is abbreviated "Hf." with minimum capital of 4,000,000 kr and goes to LLC.
India[edit]
Commonly used business forms in India are:
(a) Public and Private Limited Companies - Incorporated entities with limited liabilities. These are very similar to "Corporations" under U.S law.
(b) Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs) - Incorporated entities with limited liability. The LLPs are organized as partnerships - they do not have a Board of Directors as such. LLP has lesser compliance requirements compared to Private limited companies. There is no maximum limit for the no. of partners in LLP. In the private limited company shareholders are limited to the extent of 200 shareholders.[33]
The above entities are treated as taxable entities ("persons"), and as such are liable to tax on their incomes. These entities do not offer "pass-through" taxation benefits, unlike LLCs in the USA.
India vide Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008 introduced concept of LLP and it got implemented in 2009. 2 persons are required to Incorporate LLP in India and they are called designated partners. This form is very organised in India and controlled under Ministry of Corporate Affairs. There is no specific minimum capital requirement. Foreign Direct Investment too allowed in LLP. Essential part is one of the 2 promoters must be Indian Resident.
Iran[edit]
As of 2015, there are seven types of companies which can be registered under Iran's company registration law. One of these seven types of companies and partnerships refers to LLPs. Like many other countries, two persons are required to form an LLP in Iran. Each person has his/her own shares and is responsible for business liability equivalent to his/her share percentage. LLPs in Iran are named according to the format illustrated by the following example: "Sherkat Ba Masooliyate Mahdood" translates as "Sherkat Ø´Ø±Ú©Øª Company" + "Mahdood ÙØ­Ø¯ÙØ¯ Limited" + "Masooliyat ÙØ³Ø¦ÙÙÛØª Liability".
Italy[edit]
The Italian Civil Code, approved in 1942 and as amended by the Government Act 6/2003 and furthers modifications, mainly provides three forms of limited liability company:

SocietÃ  per azioni (S.p.A.): the minimum required starting capital for an SpA is â¬50,000.[34] The capital is divided into shares (azioni) that can be transferred by endorsement or bought and sold on stock exchange. Only SpAs can be quoted in stock exchange market, issue corporate bonds, and other financial instruments. SpA form and a higher capital are required by law to operate in protected businesses (i.e. banks, leasing companies, etc.).
SocietÃ  a responsabilitÃ  limitata (Srl): the minimum required starting capital for an Srl is â¬10,000. Its capital is divided into stakes (quote) which can be bought or sold just by notarial act. Srls can issue corporate bonds but are subject to many limitations. Similar to the Srl is the SocietÃ  Cooperativa a ResponsabilitÃ  Limitata (Scarl) whose scope is not making profit but give benefits to stakes' holders.
SocietÃ  in accomandita per azioni (Sapa): the minimum required starting capital for a Sapa is â¬120,000 divided into shares. Sapas have a mixed liability scheme, where standard shareholders have limited liability while managing shareholders have full liability. Except this, SAPAs are exactly like SPAs even if uncommon.

Companies append the corresponding abbreviation to their company names.
Japan[edit]
Japan passed legislation in 1996 creating a new type of business organization, godo kaisha (J-LLC), a close variant of the American LLC.[citation needed] Japanese Tax authority does not consider J-LLC (Godo-Kaisha) a pass-through entity, but as a taxable entity.
Macedonia, Republic of[edit]
Macedonian legislation contemplates LLCs as ÐÑÑÑÑÐ²Ð¾ ÑÐ¾ Ð¾Ð³ÑÐ°Ð½Ð¸ÑÐµÐ½Ð° Ð¾Ð´Ð³Ð¾Ð²Ð¾ÑÐ½Ð¾ÑÑ (Drushtvo so ogranichena odgovornost). Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation Ð´.Ð¾.Ð¾. (d.o.o.) to their name. The minimum required starting capital for a d.o.o. is â¬5,000.
Mexico[edit]
Mexican legislation contemplates LLCs as Sociedades de Responsabilidad Limitada, also known for their abbreviation "S. de R.L.". S. de R.L.'s award limited liability to its members up to their contribution in the company (i.e., contribution of capital) and also act as pass-through or flow-through entities whereby profits are "passed-through" to its members, avoiding double taxation. This type of company is widely used by foreign investors in Mexico because of its "pass-through" modality and its "check the box" capability under the IRC (Internal Revenue Code of the U.S.).[citation needed]
Moldova[edit]
Moldovan legislation contemplates LLCs as Societate cu RÄspundere LimitatÄ, abbreviated "S.R.L.", and are regulated member(s)-founder(s), and other non-founder members, minimum one member-founder and maximum total of 50 members, at least one of them must be the founder of the company, but all of the 50 could be also founders.[citation needed]
Norway[edit]
In Norway, the closest to an LLC is probably the kommandittselskap (KS). In a K/S there are two types of participants, one komplementar which is fully liable, and one or more kommandittist, with limited liability. There are minimum capital requirements. The KS is a tax-transparent company, which means the income "passes through" the company directly to the shareholders.
Pakistan[edit]
In Pakistan, LLCs are known as private companies that end (Local Liability Company) with Pvt. Ltd. They should have at least Rs. 100,000 as their minimum paid up capital.
The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has made it mandatory for all listed companies to file their documents, returns, accounts and applications through the commission's eServices online filing facility, earlier, this requirement was only applicable to the companies, which had been incorporated through eServices online filing facility.[35]
Peru[edit]
There is no direct equivalent of an LLC in Peru, but some similar corporate forms include:

Sociedad anÃ³nima cerrada (SAC), a corporation which must have at least two and not more than twenty shareholders; its shares may not be offered to the public and cannot be traded on the stock exchange.
Sociedad comercial de responsabilidad limitada (SRL), a commercial partnership divided in equal participations which may not be called "shares". It must have at least two and not more than twenty partners.
Sociedad civil de responsabilidad limitada (S civil de RL), a professional partnership of at least two and not more than thirty individuals, with co-owner participation in the form of capital, of professional contribution, or of any combination of both.
Empresa individual de responsabilidad limitada (EIRL), a legal entity with one single owner.

The capital for any of the above entities is freely determined by its statutes. There is no minimum requirement except for entities with certain types of activities, mainly in the financial markets, and then irrespective of their type.[36]
Poland[edit]
In Poland, a limited liability company is referred to literally as âcompany with limited liabilityâ (spÃ³Åka z ograniczonÄ odpowiedzialnoÅciÄ, legally abbreviated as sp. z o.o. (or sometimes Sp. z o.o. in particular names). Informally, in the Polish speaking slang, it is abbreviated as spÃ³Åka zoo (pronounced with a long "o", as in "tow."). However, sp. z o.o. has a (separate from its owners) legal personality, which gives it the ability to do certain actions under law, and it is considered a "corporation".
The minimum start capital is 5,000 PLN (since 2009; until then, 50,000 PLN).
Portugal[edit]
In Portugal, LLCs are called "Sociedades de Responsabilidade Limitada", that is, "company of limited responsibility", usually abbreviated Lda.. They are tax subject, and company shares cannot be sold in a public market, since 2006 the transference of them is not required to be done in the presence of a civil law notary, except if the company owns buildings, in the same way other major properties have to be sold. Nonetheless, the responsibility of the partners is limited to the capital share they hold, and the minimum capital required by law for a Lda. of â¬5000. (In 2006 the PS Government, led by JosÃ© Socrates, did reduce the minimum capital to â¬1, but in 2011 the new PSD Government, led by Pedro Passos Coelho, reinstated the â¬5000 minimum capital.) The capital is not required to be deposited at the time of the registration of the company, instead the share holders have until 31 December of the year the registry was made.[citation needed]
Romania[edit]
Romania recognizes the limited liability company since 1990 under the name of societate cu rÄspundere limitatÄ (S.R.L.), in which the owners are personally liable for the company obligations within the limit of their contribution to social capital. The minimum start capital is 200 RON which currently amounts to less than â¬50.[37]
Russia[edit]
In Russia and certain other former Soviet countries, an entity with a somewhat similar structure is known as ÐÐ±ÑÐµÑÑÐ²Ð¾ Ñ Ð¾Ð³ÑÐ°Ð½Ð¸ÑÐµÐ½Ð½Ð¾Ð¹ Ð¾ÑÐ²ÐµÑÑÑÐ²ÐµÐ½Ð½Ð¾ÑÑÑÑ (Obshchestvo s ogranichennoy otvetstvennost'yu) (lit., "company with limited liability"), usually abbreviated OOO, or in some CIS countries as OÑOO.[citation needed]
Although a Russian limited liability company shares the same name with an American LLC, it is different in many ways. Most importantly, a Russian LLC is not tax transparent: the company is taxed at the corporate level, and then, upon distribution of dividends, shareholders pay income tax (personal or corporate).[citation needed]
A limited liability company is the most popular form of legal undertaking in Russia for simple shareholding structures.[38]
The minimum capital required is 10,000 Russian rubles.
Serbia[edit]
Serbian legislation contemplates LLCs as druÅ¡tvo sa ograniÄenom odgovornoÅ¡Äu. Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation d.o.o. or DOO to their name same as in Croatia. As in the Czech Republic, a d.o.o. is not technically comparable to an LLC because the profits are still subject to double taxation.[citation needed] In Kosovo a company does not need to provide proof for payment of capital.[39]
Slovakia[edit]
In Slovakia, the law contemplates spoloÄnosÅ¥ s ruÄenÃ­m obmedzenÃ½m (abbreviation spol. s r. o. or s. r. o.) or as the rough equivalent of a limited liability company. It is very popular form of business organization due to ensurance of limited liability in exchange for a relatively small investment into the registered capital. From one to 50 associates can found it through a founding agreement with minimum registered capital of â¬5000, minimum â¬750 per person, in money or other property. (Â§ 105â153 of Act. No 513/1991 Coll. â Commercial Code as amended.)[40][41]
Slovenia[edit]
Slovenian legislation contemplates LLCs as druÅ¾ba z omejeno odgovornostjo. Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation d. o. o. to their name. The minimum required starting capital for a d. o. o. is â¬7,500. Due to the high cost and complicated bookkeeping of a real corporation, this is a more widespread form.[citation needed]
Spain[edit]
In Spain, LLCs are called Sociedad de responsabilidad limitada (SRL), "company of limited responsibility", or sociedad limitada (SL), or "limited partnership". They are tax subject, and company shares cannot be sold in a public market, the transference of them having to be done compulsorily in the presence of a civil law notary, in the same way other major properties have to be sold. Nonetheless, the responsibility of the partners is limited to the capital share they hold, and the minimum capital required by law for a S.L. is at least â¬3,000.
Sweden[edit]
Sweden has no equivalent of an LLC. The closest company form is the handelsbolag (lit.: "trade company"). The Swedish AB (aktiebolag; lit.: "share company"), like the handelsbolag, is a tax subject and is more similar to a US C Corporation than an LLC. The minimum capital required by law in a private company, privat aktiebolag, is SEK 50,000, although this may be in the form of assets as well as capital. It should be noted that the AB structure requires shareholders, a Board of Directors, and regular meetings of both, together with complete accounts once per year. Depending on the size of the AB, the accounts may have to be audited. Creation or purchase "off-the-shelf" of an AB is relatively cheap and tax effective, but liquidation of a created aktiebolag can be an expensive and time-consuming operation.[42] Creation of public limited liability companies, or publikt aktiebolag, which can raise capital from the public, requires a minimum capitalization of SEK 500,000, however the overall regulation of public companies in Sweden, especially regarding accounting methods and taxes, is thorough and detailed.[43]
Switzerland[edit]
The Swiss Code of Obligations[44] provides for different kinds of companies with limited liability, the two most commonly used are:
Swiss Limited Liability Company:[45][46] The terms for this kind of company used in the three official languages of the Swiss Confederation are as follows: In German Gesellschaft mit beschrÃ¤nkter Haftung (abbreviation: GmbH), in French SociÃ©tÃ© Ã  responsabilitÃ© limitÃ©e (abbreviation: S.Ã  r.l. or SARL) and in Italian SocietÃ  a Garanzia Limitata (abbreviation: SaGL). A Swiss LLC is similar to an LLC with respect to various matters, including the following: Members may also be natural persons, corporations, partnerships or other LLCs,[47] the liability of a member of a Swiss LLC to pay for the LLC's obligations is limited to its capital contribution,[48] a Swiss LLC may be either member-managed or manager-managed,[49] and, unless otherwise provided for in the operating agreement, the membersâ right to control or manage a Swiss LLC is proportionate to their individual membership interest.[50] The membership interests in a Swiss LLC have to be registered[51] and, thus, they may only be issued in the name of a member but not to the bearer.
Swiss Corporation[46][52] (in English common law context usually translated as company limited by shares): The terms for this kind of company used in the three official languages of the Swiss Confederation are as follows: In German Aktiengesellschaft (abbreviation: AG), in French SociÃ©tÃ© Anonyme (abbreviation: SA) and in Italian SocietÃ  Anonima (abbreviation: SA). A Swiss corporation is with respect to various matters different from an LLC (including a Swiss LLC): Most important is that a Swiss corporation may, neither by default nor by exercising any respective option provided by the Swiss law, be member-managed like an LLC, as the respective mandatory provisions of Swiss law provide that the board of directors has certain non-transferable duties.[53] Furthermore, the shares of a Swiss corporation may also be issued to the bearer (bearer shares)[54] and, thus, not only in the name of a holder (registered shares), which, however, applies to the membership interests in a Swiss LLC, which may only be registered.
Tajikistan[edit]
In Tajikistan, the same as in Russia, an entity with a somewhat similar structure is known as "Ò¶Ð°Ð¼ÑÐ¸ÑÑÐ¸ Ð´Ð¾ÑÐ¾Ð¸ Ð¼Ð°ÑÑÑÐ»Ð¸ÑÑÐ¸ Ð¼Ð°Ò³Ð´ÑÐ´", Chamiyti Doroi Masuliyti Machdud, abbreviated as "Ò¶ÐÐÐ".
Turkey[edit]
Minimum capital should be 10,000 TL. That capital could be the minimum total capital of company. Number of founding shareholders (real persons or legal entities) could be minimum 1 and maximum 50. All or some of the shareholders could be foreign nationals. There is no issued stock certificates and all shareholders liability is limited to their registered capital amount. 1/4 of capital should be blocked in a Bank until procedure of registration ends. The equivalent of LLC for Turkish is Ltd. Åti. (Which means Limited Åirketi.)
Ukraine[edit]
This type of entity has existed in Ukraine since the 1990s. LLC is the most common type of business entity in Ukraine.[55] In Ukrainian, it is spelled "Ð¢Ð¾Ð²Ð°ÑÐ¸ÑÑÐ²Ð¾ Ð· Ð¾Ð±Ð¼ÐµÐ¶ÐµÐ½Ð¾Ñ Ð²ÑÐ´Ð¿Ð¾Ð²ÑÐ´Ð°Ð»ÑÐ½ÑÑÑÑ" (abbreviated â TÐÐ, TÐ·ÐÐ), in transliteration "Tovarystvo z Obmezhenoyu Vidpovidalnistyu," that is, "company with limited liability".
By Ukrainian law LLC is a legal person. Authorized capital of LLC is divided into shares (or stakes), the amount of which is determined by the charter. LLC is responsible to the creditors only with its assets. Legal entities (foreign or Ukrainian companies) individuals, regardless of their country of citizenship or residency can be the founders (participants) of LLC. Limited liability company can be formed either by one person or by several individuals or legal entities (corporations). Maximum number of participants (founders) of LLC in Ukraine is 100. Since 2014 registration procedure has been significantly simplified in Ukraine. Minimum amount of authorised capital is 1 (one) hryvnia (less than 0,04 US cents). There is no state fee for LLC formation.
By Ukrainian Law LLC dividend payment is possible after the declaration of companyâs income or profit to the fiscal/tax authorities and the approval of the income statement.[56] Thus, regardless of the tax system, LLC can make dividend payments up to 4 times a year, or one time a quarter.
Taxation. LLC can be registered:
â as corporate/profit tax (18% rate) with or without VAT (up to 20% rate, depends on product or service) tax payer;
â fixed tax rate (in transliteration "yediniy podatok" or "sproschena sistema opodatkuvannia") is a 5% rate from revenue, with or without (on request) VAT registration.
United Arab Emirates[edit]
A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is the most common type of registration in the UAE and is recommended where the purpose of the entity is to make sales within the region. However, it should be noted that 100% foreign ownership of such an entity is not permitted. Under the UAE Commercial Companies Law (CCL), foreign investors are permitted to hold up to 49 per cent equity ownership in UAE companies and 51 per cent of the equity must be held at all times by one or more UAE nationals. In accordance with Article (218) of the CCL a Limited Liability Company can be formed by a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 50 shareholders whose liability is limited to their shares in the capital of the company. Recent amendments to Article (217) of the CCL that came into force in June 2009 removed the requirement for minimum share capital (previously AED 300,000 in Dubai and AED 150,000 in other Emirates) allowing founders of a limited liability company the freedom to determine the companyâs share capital which could be less than the earlier prescribed bottom line. Shares of an LLC are not open for subscription by the public.[57] Despite the split in shareholdings, profits may be divided in other ratios agreed upon, taking into consideration efforts of foreign partners in management, provision of technology or expertise. Responsibility for the management of a LLC can be vested in the foreign partner or UAE national partners or a third party. A LLC must appoint a minimum of one manager and up to a maximum of five managers for the business. Managers must be appointed by a Memorandum of Association or by a management contract, for a fixed term or an unlimited term. Unless the Memorandum of Association states otherwise, the manager has full powers of administration and management of the LLC. LLC is not allowed to practice its activities in the UAE without a Trade License and Commercial Registration Certificate.
[58]
United Kingdom[edit]
The new form of limited liability partnership (LLP), created in 2000, is similar to a US LLC in being tax neutral: member partners are taxed at the partner level, but the LLP itself pays no tax. It is treated as a body corporate for all other purposes including VAT. Otherwise, all companies, including limited companies and US LLCs, are treated as bodies corporate subject to United Kingdom corporation tax if the profits of the entity belong to the entity and not to its members.
United States[edit]
A limited liability company (LLC) is a relatively new business structure authorized by state statutes.[59] The LLC is chiefly inspired by the GmbH ("Company with limited liability"), a type of business organization in Germany, and by the limitada, a type of business organization available in many Latin American countries.[29]
In the United States, the first limited liability company act appeared in Wyoming in 1977 as special interest[60] legislation for an oil company.[61] In 1980, the Internal Revenue Service issued a private letter ruling to an LLC formed under the Wyoming LLC Act, indicating that the IRS would treat the LLC as a partnership for federal tax purposes.[62] However, later that year, the IRS proposed regulations that would deny partnership classification to any business entity in which no member bore personal responsibility for the entity's liabilities.[63] In 1982, Florida adopted an LLC act modeled on Wyoming's LLC Act.[64] Due to uncertainty over the tax treatment of LLCs, no other states introduced LLC legislation until after 1988.[65] In 1988, the IRS issued a revenue ruling stating that it would treat a Wyoming-style LLC as a partnership for tax purposes.[66] By 1996, nearly every state had enacted an LLC statute.[67] The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws adopted the Uniform Limited Liability Company Act in 1996 and revised it in 2006.[68]
A potential disadvantage specific to the United States is that LLCs are not considered to be corporations for the purposes of federal civil procedure; they are instead treated as partnerships. This affects the applicability of diversity jurisdiction in cases involving LLCs, barring application of diversity jurisdiction when even one member of the LLC is a citizen of the same state as one of the opposing parties. Should one member of an LLC be a citizen of a state of which one of the opposing parties is a citizen, any case between the LLC and those parties must be heard in that state's courts; corporations enjoy a more complete legal personhood that only denies diversity jurisdiction when the opposing party is a citizen of the state in which the corporation is incorporated (most commonly Delaware for large corporations, which has a small population) or has its principal place of business.
AOL was set up as an LLC during its ownership by Time Warner from 2001 to 2008. There is a similar setup for BMW's American subsidiary, BMW of North America, LLC. Chrysler has been an LLC since restructuring during the auto industry bailout of 2009, owned by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V..

A limited liability company (LLC) is the United States-specific form of a private limited company. It is a business structure that combines the pass-through taxation of a partnership or sole proprietorship with the limited liability of a corporation.[1][2] An LLC is not a corporation; it is a legal form of a company that provides limited liability to its owners in many jurisdictions. LLCs do not need to be organized for profit.[3] In certain U.S. states (for example, Texas), businesses that provide professional services requiring a state professional license, such as legal or medical services, may not be allowed to form an LLC but may be required to form a similar entity called a professional limited liability company (PLLC).[4]

Overview[edit]
A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is a hybrid business entity having certain characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership or sole proprietorship (depending on how many owners there are). An LLC, although a business entity, is a type of unincorporated association and is not a corporation. The primary characteristic an LLC shares with a corporation is limited liability, and the primary characteristic it shares with a partnership is the availability of pass-through income taxation. It is often more flexible than a corporation, and it is well-suited for companies with a single owner.
In the absence of express statutory guidance, most American courts have held that LLC members are subject to the same common law alter ego piercing theories as corporate shareholders. However, it is more difficult to pierce the LLC veil because LLCs do not have many formalities to maintain. So long as the LLC and the members do not commingle funds, it would be difficult to pierce this veil.[5] Membership interests in LLCs and partnership interests are also afforded a significant level of protection through the charging order mechanism. The charging order limits the creditor of a debtor-partner or a debtor-member to the debtor's share of distributions, without conferring on the creditor any voting or management rights.[citation needed] Limited liability company members may, in certain circumstances, also incur a personal liability in cases where distributions to members render the LLC insolvent.[6]
Flexibility and default rules[edit]
The phrase "unless otherwise provided for in the operating agreement" (or its equivalent) is found throughout all existing LLC statutes[citation needed] and is responsible for the flexibility the members of the LLC have in deciding how their LLC will be governed (provided it does not go outside legal bounds). State statutes typically provide automatic or "default" rules for how an LLC will be governed unless the operating agreement provides otherwise.
Similarly, the phrase "unless otherwise provided for in the by laws" is also found in all corporation law statutes[citation needed] but often refers only to a narrower range of matters.
The limited liability company ("LLC") has grown to become one of the most prevalent business forms in the United States. As the LLC's popularity has surged, unforeseen issues have emerged in these new statutes, particularly around single-member LLCs in Florida, New York, California, Colorado, and Georgia, where personal asset protection has been subverted.[7]
Effective August 1, 2013, the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act provides that the managers and controlling members of a limited liability company owe fiduciary duties of care and loyalty to the limited liability company and its members. Under the amendment (prompted by the Delaware Supreme Court's decision in Gatz Properties, LLC v. Auriga Capital Corp, November 2012), parties to an LLC remain free to expand, restrict, or eliminate fiduciary duties in their LLC agreements (subject to the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing).[8]
Under 6 Del. C. Section 18-101(7), a Delaware LLC operating agreement can be written, oral or implied. It sets forth member capital contributions, ownership percentages, and management structure. Like a prenuptial agreement, an operating agreement can avoid future disputes between members by addressing buy-out rights, valuation formulas, and transfer restrictions. A written LLC operating agreement should be signed by all of its members.[9]
Income tax[edit]
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, an LLC is treated by default as a pass-through entity.[10] If there is only one member in the company, the LLC is treated as a âdisregarded entityâ for tax purposes, and an individual owner would report the LLC's income or loss on Schedule C of his or her individual tax return. Thus, income from the LLC is taxed at the individual tax rates. The default tax status for LLCs with multiple members is as a partnership, which is required to report income and loss on IRS Form 1065. Under partnership tax treatment, each member of the LLC, as is the case for all partners of a partnership, annually receives a Form K-1 reporting the member's distributive share of the LLC's income or loss that is then reported on the member's individual income tax return. On the other hand, income from corporations is taxed twice, once at the corporate entity level and again when distributed to shareholders, thus more tax savings often result if a business formed as an LLC rather than a corporation.[11]
An LLC with either single or multiple members may elect to be taxed as a corporation through the filing of IRS Form 8832.[12] After electing corporate tax status, an LLC may further elect to be treated as a regular C corporation (taxation of the entity's income prior to any dividends or distributions to the members and then taxation of the dividends or distributions once received as income by the members) or as an S corporation (entity level income and loss passes through to the members). Some commentators have recommended an LLC taxed as a S-corporation as the best possible small business structure. It combines the simplicity and flexibility of an LLC with the tax benefits of an S-corporation (self-employment tax savings).[13]
Advantages[edit]

Choice of tax regime. An LLC can elect to be taxed as a sole proprietor, partnership, S corporation or C corporation (as long as they would otherwise qualify for such tax treatment), providing for a great deal of flexibility.
A limited liability company with multiple members that elects to be taxed as partnership may specially allocate the members' distributive share of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit via the company operating agreement on a basis other than the ownership percentage of each member so long as the rules contained in Treasury Regulation (26 CFR) 1.704-1 are met. S corporations may not specially allocate profits, losses and other tax items under US tax law.
The owners of the LLC, called "members", are protected from some or all liability for acts and debts of the LLC, depending on state shield laws.
In the United States, an S corporation has a limited number of stockholders, and all of them must be U.S. citizens; an LLC may have an unlimited number of members, and there is no citizenship restriction.
Much less administrative paperwork and record-keeping than a corporation.
Pass-through taxation (i.e., no double taxation), unless the LLC elects to be taxed as a C corporation.
Using default tax classification, profits are taxed personally at the member level, not at the LLC level.
LLCs in most states are treated as entities separate from their members. However, in some jurisdictions such as Connecticut, case law has determined that owners were not required to plead facts sufficient to pierce the corporate veil and LLC members can be personally liable for operation of the LLC (see, for example, the case of Sturm v. Harb Development[14]).
LLCs in some states can be set up with just one natural person involved.
Less risk of being "stolen" by fire-sale acquisitions (more protection against "hungry" investors).
For real estate companies, each separate property can be owned by its own individual LLC, thereby shielding not only the owners but their other properties from cross-liability.

Disadvantages[edit]
Although there is no statutory requirement for an operating agreement in most jurisdictions, members of a multiple member LLC who operate without one may encounter problems. Unlike state laws regarding stock corporations, which are very well developed and provide for a variety of governance and protective provisions for the corporation and its shareholders, most states do not dictate detailed governance and protective provisions for the members of a limited liability company. Thus, in the absence of such statutory provisions, the members of an LLC must establish governance and protective provisions pursuant to an operating agreement or similar governing document.

It may be more difficult to raise financial capital for an LLC as investors may be more comfortable investing funds in the better-understood corporate form with a view toward an eventual IPO. One possible solution may be to form a new corporation and merge into it, dissolving the LLC and converting into a corporation.
Many jurisdictionsâincluding Alabama, California, Kentucky, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Texasâlevy a franchise tax or capital values tax on LLCs. In essence, this franchise or business privilege tax is the fee the LLC pays the state for the benefit of limited liability. The franchise tax can be an amount based on revenue, an amount based on profits, or an amount based on the number of owners or the amount of capital employed in the state, or some combination of those factors, or simply a flat fee, as in Delaware.

Effective in Texas for 2007 the franchise tax is replaced with the Texas Business Margin Tax. This is paid as: tax payable = revenues minus some expenses with an apportionment factor. In most states, however, the fee is nominal and only a handful charge a tax comparable to the tax imposed on corporations.
In California, both foreign and domestic LLCs, corporations, and trusts, whether for-profit or non-profitâunless the entity is tax exemptâmust at least pay a minimum income tax of $800 per year to the Franchise Tax Board; and no foreign LLC, corporation or trust may conduct business in California unless it is duly registered with the California Secretary of State.


The District of Columbia considers LLCs to be taxable entities, thus eliminating the benefit of pass-through taxesâsubjecting members to double taxation.[15] Typically, LLCs will choose to be taxed as a partnership to avoid double taxation, which occurs in corporations. This allows companies to distribute their income among members who then report it on their personal tax returns.
Renewal fees may also be higher. Maryland, for example, charges a stock or nonstock corporation $120 for the initial charter, and $100 for an LLC. The fee for filing the annual report the following year is $300 for stock-corporations and LLCs. The fee is zero for non-stock corporations. In addition, certain states, such as New York, impose a publication requirement upon formation of the LLC which requires that the members of the LLC publish a notice in newspapers in the geographic region that the LLC will be located that it is being formed. For LLCs located in major metropolitan areas (e.g., New York City), the cost of publication can be significant.
The management structure of an LLC may not be clearly stated. Unlike corporations, they are not required to have a board of directors or officers. (This could also be seen as an advantage to some.)
Taxing jurisdictions outside the US are likely to treat a US LLC as a corporation, regardless of its treatment for US tax purposesâfor example a US LLC doing business outside the US or as a resident of a foreign jurisdiction.[16] This is very likely where the country (such as Canada) does not recognize LLCs as an authorized form of business entity in that country.
The principals of LLCs use many different titlesâe.g., member, manager, managing member, managing director, chief executive officer, president, and partner. As such, it can be difficult to determine who actually has the authority to enter into a contract on the LLC's behalf.

Variations[edit]

A Professional Limited Liability Company (PLLC, P.L.L.C., or P.L.) is a limited liability company organized for the purpose of providing professional services. Usually, professions where the state requires a license to provide services, such as a doctor, chiropractor, lawyer, accountant, architect, landscape architect, or engineer, require the formation of a PLLC.[17] However, some states, such as California, do not permit LLCs to engage in the practice of a licensed profession. Exact requirements of PLLCs vary from state to state. Typically, a PLLC's members must all be professionals practicing the same profession. In addition, the limitation of personal liability of members does not extend to professional malpractice claims.
A Series LLC is a special form of a Limited liability company that allows a single LLC to segregate its assets into separate series. For example, a series LLC that purchases separate pieces of real estate may put each in a separate series so if the lender forecloses on one piece of property, the others are not affected.
An L3C is a for-profit, social enterprise venture that has a stated goal of performing a socially beneficial purpose, not maximizing income. It is a hybrid structure that combines the legal and tax flexibility of a traditional LLC, the social benefits of a nonprofit organization, and the branding and market positioning advantages of a social enterprise.
An Anonymous Limited Liability Company is a LLC where ownership information is not made publicly available by the state where the LLC is registered. This is done by using a third-party to act as the organizer and registered agent of the LLC. Level of anonymity varies with different states.[18]

International equivalents[edit]





It has been suggested that this section be merged into Private limited company. (Discuss) Proposed since December 2014.


Companies with limited liability exist in business law worldwide. However, the limited liability company is a specific legal structure defined by the laws of U.S. states, with quite distinct characteristics. Many other countries have similar structures.
Albania[edit]
In Albania a limited liability company (Albanian: ShoqÃ«ri me pÃ«rgjegjÃ«si tÃ« kufizuar Sh.p.k) is a commercial company founded by persons of physical or judicial status, who are not liable for the company and personally bear losses only up to the outstanding contribution agreements. Partners' contributions constitute the registered capital of a limited liability company. Each partner has his quota in the company in proportion to the contribution of the capital so the registered capital of the company is divided between the partners based on the proportional ratio of their contribution. In Albania a limited liability company may not have a capital of less than 100 lek.[19]
Argentina[edit]
Although not an exact equivalent, the Argentine variant of the LLC is called Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada (S.R.L.) and it limits the liability of its members up to their capital contribution in the company. The equity is divided into equal stakes (can not be called "shares"), each one of which represents a percentage of the company and that can not be traded on the stock exchange. Their by-laws are regulated by law NÂ° 19550[20] and the commercial partnership is limited to a maximum of 50 partners.
Bosnia and Herzegovina[edit]
Bosnian and Herzegovinian legislation, similarly to that in Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia contemplates LLCs as druÅ¡tvo s ograniÄenom odgovornoÅ¡Äu (d.o.o.). Companies using this structure append the abbreviation d.o.o. to their company name. A shareholder or member in a d.o.o. is only personally liable up to the value of the memberâs investment in the company.[21]
Brazil[edit]
The corporate structure in Brazilian law most similar to the American LLC is the Sociedade Limitada (âLtda.â), under the new Brazilian Civil Code of 2002. The sociedade limitada is the new name of the sociedade por quotas de responsabilidade limitada, and it can be organized as empresÃ¡ria or simples, under this new code, roughly corresponding to the form types of comercial (âcommercialâ) and civil (ânon commercialâ) of the Commercial Code. A new law in Brazil has made it legal to obtain an LLC by a sole-proprietor called Empresa Individual de Responsabilidade Limitada (Eireli for short). The main requirement is a capital of 100 times the current minimum wage,[22] R$ 78.800,00 [23](US$26.267.00) as of 2015.
Bulgaria[edit]
Bulgarian legislation contemplates LLCs as ÐÑÑÐ¶ÐµÑÑÐ²Ð¾ Ñ Ð¾Ð³ÑÐ°Ð½Ð¸ÑÐµÐ½Ð° Ð¾ÑÐ³Ð¾Ð²Ð¾ÑÐ½Ð¾ÑÑ (Druzhestvo s ogranichena otgovornost; Limited liability company). Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation ÐÐÐ (OOD) to their name. In case of an LLC with individual owner it is contemplated as ÐÐ´Ð½Ð¾Ð»Ð¸ÑÐ½Ð¾ Ð´ÑÑÐ¶ÐµÑÑÐ²Ð¾ Ñ Ð¾Ð³ÑÐ°Ð½Ð¸ÑÐµÐ½Ð° Ð¾ÑÐ³Ð¾Ð²Ð¾ÑÐ½Ð¾ÑÑ (Ednolichno druzhestvo s ogranichena otgovornost; One-man/ Single-member limited liability company) and abbreviated as ÐÐÐÐ (EOOD).[24]
Chile[edit]
Chilean law contemplates a certain form of LLC known as "Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada" (Limited Liability Association). Also (LLC) These companies are regulated by law NÂ° 3.918. Among their most important characteristics we can say that:

They can pursue a commercial or non-commercial purpose (Sociedad Comercial de Responsabilidad Limitada / Sociedad Civil de Responsabilidad Limitada).
They must be formed by two or more partners and can hold up to a maximum of fifty.
Their equity is divided into "cuotas" (not shares) each one of which represents a percentage of the company.
They can be managed by one or more managers (external if need be), or by a board of directors.
Their by-laws can't be modified, nor their partners be changed, without the consent of all the other partners.
In tax considerations, they differ from the LLC's because they pay a corporate tax for their income, amount that can be deducted by their owners as a credit against the taxes they pay.

Chilean law also contemplates a very special kind of individual owner LLC called Empresa Individual de Responsabilidad Limitada (Limited Liability Individual Company), which uses the E.I.R.L. abbreviation.
Colombia[edit]
Colombian legislation contemplates a very similar structure as mentioned above in the Chilean case. The Ltda. abbreviation is also used in Colombia.[25]
Croatia[edit]
In Croatia, a private limited liability company is termed druÅ¡tvo s ograniÄenom odgovornoÅ¡Äu (literal: limited liability company), abbreviated d.o.o.. A public limited liability company is termed a dioniÄko druÅ¡tvo (literal: joint stock company) abbreviated d.d..[26]
Czech Republic[edit]
Czech legislation contemplates LLCs as spoleÄnost s ruÄenÃ­m omezenÃ½m (s.r.o. or spol. s r.o.). An s.r.o. is not technically comparable to an LLC because the profits are still subject to double taxation. Czech law does not offer a possibility to start up a limited company without the possibility of avoiding double taxation. As of 2014 the liability is not limited in Czech, since managing director (jednatel, mandatory board member in Czech LLCs) bears full liability that extends to all of his/her property, including private one.
Denmark[edit]
The Danish form of the LLC is the kommanditselskab (K/S). There is no minimum capital requirements. In a K/S there are two types of shareholders, the komplementar which is fully liable, and the kommanditist which liability is limited. The K/S is a tax-transparent company, which means the income "passes through" the company directly to the shareholders.
Dominican Republic[edit]
Dominican Republic legislation contemplates LLCs as Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada, also known by their abbreviation S.R.L.;; S.R.L.s award limited liability to their members up to their contribution in the company (i.e., contribution of capital). This type of company began after the law number 479 of the year 2008.
Estonia[edit]
In Estonia, a limited liability company is referred to as osaÃ¼hing (OÃ). The type of entity is also required to be identified in the name. An OÃ is taxed as a corporation. The minimum capital required by law is â¬2,500.
Finland[edit]
Although not an exact equivalent, the Finnish version of the LLC is the Oy (osakeyhtiÃ¶) or in Swedish Ab (aktiebolag). An Oy is taxed as a corporation. The minimum capital required by law is â¬2,500.[27]
Germany[edit]
Because of its hybrid characteristics it is very difficult to determine the German equivalent. On one hand it is possible to consider it as a kind of Gesellschaft mit beschrÃ¤nkter Haftung (GmbH) because it has aspects of a corporation; on the other hand it could be considered to be a kind of Kommanditgesellschaft (KG), which is the German equivalent of a limited partnership. Based on the literal translation of the word "company", an LLC should be considered to be a kind of KG without any liable partner. The German equivalent that comes closest to LLC, is GmbH & Co KG, a nested Kommanditgesellschaft (KG) where a Gesellschaft mit beschrÃ¤nkter Haftung (GmbH) takes the role of the fully liable partner. For the purpose of taxation, the Bundesfinanzministerium (German Federal Ministry of Finance) gives detailed guidelines of the circumstances under which an LLC is to be considered to be a "corporation" or as a "limited partnership".[28] It is useful to note, however, that the original LLC statutes of Wyoming and other US states were more or less explicitly modeled after the GmbH.[29]
Greece[edit]
A limited liability company (LLC) in Greece is synonymous to an EPE (ÎÎ Î - ÎÏÎ±Î¹ÏÎµÎ¯Î± Î ÎµÏÎ¹Î¿ÏÎ¹ÏÎ¼Î­Î½Î·Ï ÎÏÎ¸ÏÎ½Î·Ï).[30]
Hong Kong[edit]
In Hong Kong, the Limited Company is the most commonly incorporated type of company[31] and bears the characteristics of a Limited Liability Company. The core characteristics of a Hong Kong Limited Company include: i) it requires a minimum of one shareholder and one director (can be the same person), ii) a Hong Kong company requires a company secretary resident in HK, iii) foreign ownership is allowed, iv) company shareholders have limited liability and v) the company must have registered HK address.
Entrepreneurs who register a company in Hong Kong can choose a Hong Kong offshore company. This company structure is basically a HK Limited Company but all business is conducted outside of Hong Kong. The advantage of this structure is that all business income that is sourced outside of Hong Kong is tax exempt.
Hungary[edit]
Hungarian legislation contemplates LLCs as KorlÃ¡tolt felelÅssÃ©gÅ± tÃ¡rsasÃ¡g. Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation Kft. to their name.[32] Hungarian LLCs are required to have a 3 million HUF (Hungarian Forint) (approx. 11,000 USD) starting capital. The time of formation by the new electronic formation option has been reduced from 2 weeks to 2 hours, additional cost of formation is around 100,000 HUF (approx. 540 USD). Kft.s can be formed by the cooperation of lawyers.
The Hungarian Kft. is the most common form of doing business in Hungary. As being part of the European Union (EU), Hungarian Kft.s can now obtain an EU VAT registration number for doing business across the EU. The Hungarian EU-VAT reg. number starts with "HU". This way the existence of the subject company, VAT issues and the cross-check is available on the common EU website for companies.[citation needed]
Iceland[edit]
According to Icelandic legislation, there are two types of LLC forms, private and public held limited liability forms. Private LLC is abbreviated "Ehf." The minimum capital of 500,000 Icelandic krÃ³nas (kr.). Public LLC is abbreviated "Hf." with minimum capital of 4,000,000 kr and goes to LLC.
India[edit]
Commonly used business forms in India are:
(a) Public and Private Limited Companies - Incorporated entities with limited liabilities. These are very similar to "Corporations" under U.S law.
(b) Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs) - Incorporated entities with limited liability. The LLPs are organized as partnerships - they do not have a Board of Directors as such. LLP has lesser compliance requirements compared to Private limited companies. There is no maximum limit for the no. of partners in LLP. In the private limited company shareholders are limited to the extent of 200 shareholders.[33]
The above entities are treated as taxable entities ("persons"), and as such are liable to tax on their incomes. These entities do not offer "pass-through" taxation benefits, unlike LLCs in the USA.
India vide Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008 introduced concept of LLP and it got implemented in 2009. 2 persons are required to Incorporate LLP in India and they are called designated partners. This form is very organised in India and controlled under Ministry of Corporate Affairs. There is no specific minimum capital requirement. Foreign Direct Investment too allowed in LLP. Essential part is one of the 2 promoters must be Indian Resident.
Iran[edit]
As of 2015, there are seven types of companies which can be registered under Iran's company registration law. One of these seven types of companies and partnerships refers to LLPs. Like many other countries, two persons are required to form an LLP in Iran. Each person has his/her own shares and is responsible for business liability equivalent to his/her share percentage. LLPs in Iran are named according to the format illustrated by the following example: "Sherkat Ba Masooliyate Mahdood" translates as "Sherkat Ø´Ø±Ú©Øª Company" + "Mahdood ÙØ­Ø¯ÙØ¯ Limited" + "Masooliyat ÙØ³Ø¦ÙÙÛØª Liability".
Italy[edit]
The Italian Civil Code, approved in 1942 and as amended by the Government Act 6/2003 and furthers modifications, mainly provides three forms of limited liability company:

SocietÃ  per azioni (S.p.A.): the minimum required starting capital for an SpA is â¬50,000.[34] The capital is divided into shares (azioni) that can be transferred by endorsement or bought and sold on stock exchange. Only SpAs can be quoted in stock exchange market, issue corporate bonds, and other financial instruments. SpA form and a higher capital are required by law to operate in protected businesses (i.e. banks, leasing companies, etc.).
SocietÃ  a responsabilitÃ  limitata (Srl): the minimum required starting capital for an Srl is â¬10,000. Its capital is divided into stakes (quote) which can be bought or sold just by notarial act. Srls can issue corporate bonds but are subject to many limitations. Similar to the Srl is the SocietÃ  Cooperativa a ResponsabilitÃ  Limitata (Scarl) whose scope is not making profit but give benefits to stakes' holders.
SocietÃ  in accomandita per azioni (Sapa): the minimum required starting capital for a Sapa is â¬120,000 divided into shares. Sapas have a mixed liability scheme, where standard shareholders have limited liability while managing shareholders have full liability. Except this, SAPAs are exactly like SPAs even if uncommon.

Companies append the corresponding abbreviation to their company names.
Japan[edit]
Japan passed legislation in 1996 creating a new type of business organization, godo kaisha (J-LLC), a close variant of the American LLC.[citation needed] Japanese Tax authority does not consider J-LLC (Godo-Kaisha) a pass-through entity, but as a taxable entity.
Macedonia, Republic of[edit]
Macedonian legislation contemplates LLCs as ÐÑÑÑÑÐ²Ð¾ ÑÐ¾ Ð¾Ð³ÑÐ°Ð½Ð¸ÑÐµÐ½Ð° Ð¾Ð´Ð³Ð¾Ð²Ð¾ÑÐ½Ð¾ÑÑ (Drushtvo so ogranichena odgovornost). Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation Ð´.Ð¾.Ð¾. (d.o.o.) to their name. The minimum required starting capital for a d.o.o. is â¬5,000.
Mexico[edit]
Mexican legislation contemplates LLCs as Sociedades de Responsabilidad Limitada, also known for their abbreviation "S. de R.L.". S. de R.L.'s award limited liability to its members up to their contribution in the company (i.e., contribution of capital) and also act as pass-through or flow-through entities whereby profits are "passed-through" to its members, avoiding double taxation. This type of company is widely used by foreign investors in Mexico because of its "pass-through" modality and its "check the box" capability under the IRC (Internal Revenue Code of the U.S.).[citation needed]
Moldova[edit]
Moldovan legislation contemplates LLCs as Societate cu RÄspundere LimitatÄ, abbreviated "S.R.L.", and are regulated member(s)-founder(s), and other non-founder members, minimum one member-founder and maximum total of 50 members, at least one of them must be the founder of the company, but all of the 50 could be also founders.[citation needed]
Norway[edit]
In Norway, the closest to an LLC is probably the kommandittselskap (KS). In a K/S there are two types of participants, one komplementar which is fully liable, and one or more kommandittist, with limited liability. There are minimum capital requirements. The KS is a tax-transparent company, which means the income "passes through" the company directly to the shareholders.
Pakistan[edit]
In Pakistan, LLCs are known as private companies that end (Local Liability Company) with Pvt. Ltd. They should have at least Rs. 100,000 as their minimum paid up capital.
The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has made it mandatory for all listed companies to file their documents, returns, accounts and applications through the commission's eServices online filing facility, earlier, this requirement was only applicable to the companies, which had been incorporated through eServices online filing facility.[35]
Peru[edit]
There is no direct equivalent of an LLC in Peru, but some similar corporate forms include:

Sociedad anÃ³nima cerrada (SAC), a corporation which must have at least two and not more than twenty shareholders; its shares may not be offered to the public and cannot be traded on the stock exchange.
Sociedad comercial de responsabilidad limitada (SRL), a commercial partnership divided in equal participations which may not be called "shares". It must have at least two and not more than twenty partners.
Sociedad civil de responsabilidad limitada (S civil de RL), a professional partnership of at least two and not more than thirty individuals, with co-owner participation in the form of capital, of professional contribution, or of any combination of both.
Empresa individual de responsabilidad limitada (EIRL), a legal entity with one single owner.

The capital for any of the above entities is freely determined by its statutes. There is no minimum requirement except for entities with certain types of activities, mainly in the financial markets, and then irrespective of their type.[36]
Poland[edit]
In Poland, a limited liability company is referred to literally as âcompany with limited liabilityâ (spÃ³Åka z ograniczonÄ odpowiedzialnoÅciÄ, legally abbreviated as sp. z o.o. (or sometimes Sp. z o.o. in particular names). Informally, in the Polish speaking slang, it is abbreviated as spÃ³Åka zoo (pronounced with a long "o", as in "tow."). However, sp. z o.o. has a (separate from its owners) legal personality, which gives it the ability to do certain actions under law, and it is considered a "corporation".
The minimum start capital is 5,000 PLN (since 2009; until then, 50,000 PLN).
Portugal[edit]
In Portugal, LLCs are called "Sociedades de Responsabilidade Limitada", that is, "company of limited responsibility", usually abbreviated Lda.. They are tax subject, and company shares cannot be sold in a public market, since 2006 the transference of them is not required to be done in the presence of a civil law notary, except if the company owns buildings, in the same way other major properties have to be sold. Nonetheless, the responsibility of the partners is limited to the capital share they hold, and the minimum capital required by law for a Lda. of â¬5000. (In 2006 the PS Government, led by JosÃ© Socrates, did reduce the minimum capital to â¬1, but in 2011 the new PSD Government, led by Pedro Passos Coelho, reinstated the â¬5000 minimum capital.) The capital is not required to be deposited at the time of the registration of the company, instead the share holders have until 31 December of the year the registry was made.[citation needed]
Romania[edit]
Romania recognizes the limited liability company since 1990 under the name of societate cu rÄspundere limitatÄ (S.R.L.), in which the owners are personally liable for the company obligations within the limit of their contribution to social capital. The minimum start capital is 200 RON which currently amounts to less than â¬50.[37]
Russia[edit]
In Russia and certain other former Soviet countries, an entity with a somewhat similar structure is known as ÐÐ±ÑÐµÑÑÐ²Ð¾ Ñ Ð¾Ð³ÑÐ°Ð½Ð¸ÑÐµÐ½Ð½Ð¾Ð¹ Ð¾ÑÐ²ÐµÑÑÑÐ²ÐµÐ½Ð½Ð¾ÑÑÑÑ (Obshchestvo s ogranichennoy otvetstvennost'yu) (lit., "company with limited liability"), usually abbreviated OOO, or in some CIS countries as OÑOO.[citation needed]
Although a Russian limited liability company shares the same name with an American LLC, it is different in many ways. Most importantly, a Russian LLC is not tax transparent: the company is taxed at the corporate level, and then, upon distribution of dividends, shareholders pay income tax (personal or corporate).[citation needed]
A limited liability company is the most popular form of legal undertaking in Russia for simple shareholding structures.[38]
The minimum capital required is 10,000 Russian rubles.
Serbia[edit]
Serbian legislation contemplates LLCs as druÅ¡tvo sa ograniÄenom odgovornoÅ¡Äu. Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation d.o.o. or DOO to their name same as in Croatia. As in the Czech Republic, a d.o.o. is not technically comparable to an LLC because the profits are still subject to double taxation.[citation needed] In Kosovo a company does not need to provide proof for payment of capital.[39]
Slovakia[edit]
In Slovakia, the law contemplates spoloÄnosÅ¥ s ruÄenÃ­m obmedzenÃ½m (abbreviation spol. s r. o. or s. r. o.) or as the rough equivalent of a limited liability company. It is very popular form of business organization due to ensurance of limited liability in exchange for a relatively small investment into the registered capital. From one to 50 associates can found it through a founding agreement with minimum registered capital of â¬5000, minimum â¬750 per person, in money or other property. (Â§ 105â153 of Act. No 513/1991 Coll. â Commercial Code as amended.)[40][41]
Slovenia[edit]
Slovenian legislation contemplates LLCs as druÅ¾ba z omejeno odgovornostjo. Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation d. o. o. to their name. The minimum required starting capital for a d. o. o. is â¬7,500. Due to the high cost and complicated bookkeeping of a real corporation, this is a more widespread form.[citation needed]
Spain[edit]
In Spain, LLCs are called Sociedad de responsabilidad limitada (SRL), "company of limited responsibility", or sociedad limitada (SL), or "limited partnership". They are tax subject, and company shares cannot be sold in a public market, the transference of them having to be done compulsorily in the presence of a civil law notary, in the same way other major properties have to be sold. Nonetheless, the responsibility of the partners is limited to the capital share they hold, and the minimum capital required by law for a S.L. is at least â¬3,000.
Sweden[edit]
Sweden has no equivalent of an LLC. The closest company form is the handelsbolag (lit.: "trade company"). The Swedish AB (aktiebolag; lit.: "share company"), like the handelsbolag, is a tax subject and is more similar to a US C Corporation than an LLC. The minimum capital required by law in a private company, privat aktiebolag, is SEK 50,000, although this may be in the form of assets as well as capital. It should be noted that the AB structure requires shareholders, a Board of Directors, and regular meetings of both, together with complete accounts once per year. Depending on the size of the AB, the accounts may have to be audited. Creation or purchase "off-the-shelf" of an AB is relatively cheap and tax effective, but liquidation of a created aktiebolag can be an expensive and time-consuming operation.[42] Creation of public limited liability companies, or publikt aktiebolag, which can raise capital from the public, requires a minimum capitalization of SEK 500,000, however the overall regulation of public companies in Sweden, especially regarding accounting methods and taxes, is thorough and detailed.[43]
Switzerland[edit]
The Swiss Code of Obligations[44] provides for different kinds of companies with limited liability, the two most commonly used are:
Swiss Limited Liability Company:[45][46] The terms for this kind of company used in the three official languages of the Swiss Confederation are as follows: In German Gesellschaft mit beschrÃ¤nkter Haftung (abbreviation: GmbH), in French SociÃ©tÃ© Ã  responsabilitÃ© limitÃ©e (abbreviation: S.Ã  r.l. or SARL) and in Italian SocietÃ  a Garanzia Limitata (abbreviation: SaGL). A Swiss LLC is similar to an LLC with respect to various matters, including the following: Members may also be natural persons, corporations, partnerships or other LLCs,[47] the liability of a member of a Swiss LLC to pay for the LLC's obligations is limited to its capital contribution,[48] a Swiss LLC may be either member-managed or manager-managed,[49] and, unless otherwise provided for in the operating agreement, the membersâ right to control or manage a Swiss LLC is proportionate to their individual membership interest.[50] The membership interests in a Swiss LLC have to be registered[51] and, thus, they may only be issued in the name of a member but not to the bearer.
Swiss Corporation[46][52] (in English common law context usually translated as company limited by shares): The terms for this kind of company used in the three official languages of the Swiss Confederation are as follows: In German Aktiengesellschaft (abbreviation: AG), in French SociÃ©tÃ© Anonyme (abbreviation: SA) and in Italian SocietÃ  Anonima (abbreviation: SA). A Swiss corporation is with respect to various matters different from an LLC (including a Swiss LLC): Most important is that a Swiss corporation may, neither by default nor by exercising any respective option provided by the Swiss law, be member-managed like an LLC, as the respective mandatory provisions of Swiss law provide that the board of directors has certain non-transferable duties.[53] Furthermore, the shares of a Swiss corporation may also be issued to the bearer (bearer shares)[54] and, thus, not only in the name of a holder (registered shares), which, however, applies to the membership interests in a Swiss LLC, which may only be registered.
Tajikistan[edit]
In Tajikistan, the same as in Russia, an entity with a somewhat similar structure is known as "Ò¶Ð°Ð¼ÑÐ¸ÑÑÐ¸ Ð´Ð¾ÑÐ¾Ð¸ Ð¼Ð°ÑÑÑÐ»Ð¸ÑÑÐ¸ Ð¼Ð°Ò³Ð´ÑÐ´", Chamiyti Doroi Masuliyti Machdud, abbreviated as "Ò¶ÐÐÐ".
Turkey[edit]
Minimum capital should be 10,000 TL. That capital could be the minimum total capital of company. Number of founding shareholders (real persons or legal entities) could be minimum 1 and maximum 50. All or some of the shareholders could be foreign nationals. There is no issued stock certificates and all shareholders liability is limited to their registered capital amount. 1/4 of capital should be blocked in a Bank until procedure of registration ends. The equivalent of LLC for Turkish is Ltd. Åti. (Which means Limited Åirketi.)
Ukraine[edit]
This type of entity has existed in Ukraine since the 1990s. LLC is the most common type of business entity in Ukraine.[55] In Ukrainian, it is spelled "Ð¢Ð¾Ð²Ð°ÑÐ¸ÑÑÐ²Ð¾ Ð· Ð¾Ð±Ð¼ÐµÐ¶ÐµÐ½Ð¾Ñ Ð²ÑÐ´Ð¿Ð¾Ð²ÑÐ´Ð°Ð»ÑÐ½ÑÑÑÑ" (abbreviated â TÐÐ, TÐ·ÐÐ), in transliteration "Tovarystvo z Obmezhenoyu Vidpovidalnistyu," that is, "company with limited liability".
By Ukrainian law LLC is a legal person. Authorized capital of LLC is divided into shares (or stakes), the amount of which is determined by the charter. LLC is responsible to the creditors only with its assets. Legal entities (foreign or Ukrainian companies) individuals, regardless of their country of citizenship or residency can be the founders (participants) of LLC. Limited liability company can be formed either by one person or by several individuals or legal entities (corporations). Maximum number of participants (founders) of LLC in Ukraine is 100. Since 2014 registration procedure has been significantly simplified in Ukraine. Minimum amount of authorised capital is 1 (one) hryvnia (less than 0,04 US cents). There is no state fee for LLC formation.
By Ukrainian Law LLC dividend payment is possible after the declaration of companyâs income or profit to the fiscal/tax authorities and the approval of the income statement.[56] Thus, regardless of the tax system, LLC can make dividend payments up to 4 times a year, or one time a quarter.
Taxation. LLC can be registered:
â as corporate/profit tax (18% rate) with or without VAT (up to 20% rate, depends on product or service) tax payer;
â fixed tax rate (in transliteration "yediniy podatok" or "sproschena sistema opodatkuvannia") is a 5% rate from revenue, with or without (on request) VAT registration.
United Arab Emirates[edit]
A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is the most common type of registration in the UAE and is recommended where the purpose of the entity is to make sales within the region. However, it should be noted that 100% foreign ownership of such an entity is not permitted. Under the UAE Commercial Companies Law (CCL), foreign investors are permitted to hold up to 49 per cent equity ownership in UAE companies and 51 per cent of the equity must be held at all times by one or more UAE nationals. In accordance with Article (218) of the CCL a Limited Liability Company can be formed by a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 50 shareholders whose liability is limited to their shares in the capital of the company. Recent amendments to Article (217) of the CCL that came into force in June 2009 removed the requirement for minimum share capital (previously AED 300,000 in Dubai and AED 150,000 in other Emirates) allowing founders of a limited liability company the freedom to determine the companyâs share capital which could be less than the earlier prescribed bottom line. Shares of an LLC are not open for subscription by the public.[57] Despite the split in shareholdings, profits may be divided in other ratios agreed upon, taking into consideration efforts of foreign partners in management, provision of technology or expertise. Responsibility for the management of a LLC can be vested in the foreign partner or UAE national partners or a third party. A LLC must appoint a minimum of one manager and up to a maximum of five managers for the business. Managers must be appointed by a Memorandum of Association or by a management contract, for a fixed term or an unlimited term. Unless the Memorandum of Association states otherwise, the manager has full powers of administration and management of the LLC. LLC is not allowed to practice its activities in the UAE without a Trade License and Commercial Registration Certificate.
[58]
United Kingdom[edit]
The new form of limited liability partnership (LLP), created in 2000, is similar to a US LLC in being tax neutral: member partners are taxed at the partner level, but the LLP itself pays no tax. It is treated as a body corporate for all other purposes including VAT. Otherwise, all companies, including limited companies and US LLCs, are treated as bodies corporate subject to United Kingdom corporation tax if the profits of the entity belong to the entity and not to its members.
United States[edit]
A limited liability company (LLC) is a relatively new business structure authorized by state statutes.[59] The LLC is chiefly inspired by the GmbH ("Company with limited liability"), a type of business organization in Germany, and by the limitada, a type of business organization available in many Latin American countries.[29]
In the United States, the first limited liability company act appeared in Wyoming in 1977 as special interest[60] legislation for an oil company.[61] In 1980, the Internal Revenue Service issued a private letter ruling to an LLC formed under the Wyoming LLC Act, indicating that the IRS would treat the LLC as a partnership for federal tax purposes.[62] However, later that year, the IRS proposed regulations that would deny partnership classification to any business entity in which no member bore personal responsibility for the entity's liabilities.[63] In 1982, Florida adopted an LLC act modeled on Wyoming's LLC Act.[64] Due to uncertainty over the tax treatment of LLCs, no other states introduced LLC legislation until after 1988.[65] In 1988, the IRS issued a revenue ruling stating that it would treat a Wyoming-style LLC as a partnership for tax purposes.[66] By 1996, nearly every state had enacted an LLC statute.[67] The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws adopted the Uniform Limited Liability Company Act in 1996 and revised it in 2006.[68]
A potential disadvantage specific to the United States is that LLCs are not considered to be corporations for the purposes of federal civil procedure; they are instead treated as partnerships. This affects the applicability of diversity jurisdiction in cases involving LLCs, barring application of diversity jurisdiction when even one member of the LLC is a citizen of the same state as one of the opposing parties. Should one member of an LLC be a citizen of a state of which one of the opposing parties is a citizen, any case between the LLC and those parties must be heard in that state's courts; corporations enjoy a more complete legal personhood that only denies diversity jurisdiction when the opposing party is a citizen of the state in which the corporation is incorporated (most commonly Delaware for large corporations, which has a small population) or has its principal place of business.
AOL was set up as an LLC during its ownership by Time Warner from 2001 to 2008. There is a similar setup for BMW's American subsidiary, BMW of North America, LLC. Chrysler has been an LLC since restructuring during the auto industry bailout of 2009, owned by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V..

A limited liability company (LLC) is the United States-specific form of a private limited company. It is a business structure that combines the pass-through taxation of a partnership or sole proprietorship with the limited liability of a corporation.[1][2] An LLC is not a corporation; it is a legal form of a company that provides limited liability to its owners in many jurisdictions. LLCs do not need to be organized for profit.[3] In certain U.S. states (for example, Texas), businesses that provide professional services requiring a state professional license, such as legal or medical services, may not be allowed to form an LLC but may be required to form a similar entity called a professional limited liability company (PLLC).[4]

Overview[edit]
A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is a hybrid business entity having certain characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership or sole proprietorship (depending on how many owners there are). An LLC, although a business entity, is a type of unincorporated association and is not a corporation. The primary characteristic an LLC shares with a corporation is limited liability, and the primary characteristic it shares with a partnership is the availability of pass-through income taxation. It is often more flexible than a corporation, and it is well-suited for companies with a single owner.
In the absence of express statutory guidance, most American courts have held that LLC members are subject to the same common law alter ego piercing theories as corporate shareholders. However, it is more difficult to pierce the LLC veil because LLCs do not have many formalities to maintain. So long as the LLC and the members do not commingle funds, it would be difficult to pierce this veil.[5] Membership interests in LLCs and partnership interests are also afforded a significant level of protection through the charging order mechanism. The charging order limits the creditor of a debtor-partner or a debtor-member to the debtor's share of distributions, without conferring on the creditor any voting or management rights.[citation needed] Limited liability company members may, in certain circumstances, also incur a personal liability in cases where distributions to members render the LLC insolvent.[6]
Flexibility and default rules[edit]
The phrase "unless otherwise provided for in the operating agreement" (or its equivalent) is found throughout all existing LLC statutes[citation needed] and is responsible for the flexibility the members of the LLC have in deciding how their LLC will be governed (provided it does not go outside legal bounds). State statutes typically provide automatic or "default" rules for how an LLC will be governed unless the operating agreement provides otherwise.
Similarly, the phrase "unless otherwise provided for in the by laws" is also found in all corporation law statutes[citation needed] but often refers only to a narrower range of matters.
The limited liability company ("LLC") has grown to become one of the most prevalent business forms in the United States. As the LLC's popularity has surged, unforeseen issues have emerged in these new statutes, particularly around single-member LLCs in Florida, New York, California, Colorado, and Georgia, where personal asset protection has been subverted.[7]
Effective August 1, 2013, the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act provides that the managers and controlling members of a limited liability company owe fiduciary duties of care and loyalty to the limited liability company and its members. Under the amendment (prompted by the Delaware Supreme Court's decision in Gatz Properties, LLC v. Auriga Capital Corp, November 2012), parties to an LLC remain free to expand, restrict, or eliminate fiduciary duties in their LLC agreements (subject to the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing).[8]
Under 6 Del. C. Section 18-101(7), a Delaware LLC operating agreement can be written, oral or implied. It sets forth member capital contributions, ownership percentages, and management structure. Like a prenuptial agreement, an operating agreement can avoid future disputes between members by addressing buy-out rights, valuation formulas, and transfer restrictions. A written LLC operating agreement should be signed by all of its members.[9]
Income tax[edit]
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, an LLC is treated by default as a pass-through entity.[10] If there is only one member in the company, the LLC is treated as a âdisregarded entityâ for tax purposes, and an individual owner would report the LLC's income or loss on Schedule C of his or her individual tax return. Thus, income from the LLC is taxed at the individual tax rates. The default tax status for LLCs with multiple members is as a partnership, which is required to report income and loss on IRS Form 1065. Under partnership tax treatment, each member of the LLC, as is the case for all partners of a partnership, annually receives a Form K-1 reporting the member's distributive share of the LLC's income or loss that is then reported on the member's individual income tax return. On the other hand, income from corporations is taxed twice, once at the corporate entity level and again when distributed to shareholders, thus more tax savings often result if a business formed as an LLC rather than a corporation.[11]
An LLC with either single or multiple members may elect to be taxed as a corporation through the filing of IRS Form 8832.[12] After electing corporate tax status, an LLC may further elect to be treated as a regular C corporation (taxation of the entity's income prior to any dividends or distributions to the members and then taxation of the dividends or distributions once received as income by the members) or as an S corporation (entity level income and loss passes through to the members). Some commentators have recommended an LLC taxed as a S-corporation as the best possible small business structure. It combines the simplicity and flexibility of an LLC with the tax benefits of an S-corporation (self-employment tax savings).[13]
Advantages[edit]

Choice of tax regime. An LLC can elect to be taxed as a sole proprietor, partnership, S corporation or C corporation (as long as they would otherwise qualify for such tax treatment), providing for a great deal of flexibility.
A limited liability company with multiple members that elects to be taxed as partnership may specially allocate the members' distributive share of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit via the company operating agreement on a basis other than the ownership percentage of each member so long as the rules contained in Treasury Regulation (26 CFR) 1.704-1 are met. S corporations may not specially allocate profits, losses and other tax items under US tax law.
The owners of the LLC, called "members", are protected from some or all liability for acts and debts of the LLC, depending on state shield laws.
In the United States, an S corporation has a limited number of stockholders, and all of them must be U.S. citizens; an LLC may have an unlimited number of members, and there is no citizenship restriction.
Much less administrative paperwork and record-keeping than a corporation.
Pass-through taxation (i.e., no double taxation), unless the LLC elects to be taxed as a C corporation.
Using default tax classification, profits are taxed personally at the member level, not at the LLC level.
LLCs in most states are treated as entities separate from their members. However, in some jurisdictions such as Connecticut, case law has determined that owners were not required to plead facts sufficient to pierce the corporate veil and LLC members can be personally liable for operation of the LLC (see, for example, the case of Sturm v. Harb Development[14]).
LLCs in some states can be set up with just one natural person involved.
Less risk of being "stolen" by fire-sale acquisitions (more protection against "hungry" investors).
For real estate companies, each separate property can be owned by its own individual LLC, thereby shielding not only the owners but their other properties from cross-liability.

Disadvantages[edit]
Although there is no statutory requirement for an operating agreement in most jurisdictions, members of a multiple member LLC who operate without one may encounter problems. Unlike state laws regarding stock corporations, which are very well developed and provide for a variety of governance and protective provisions for the corporation and its shareholders, most states do not dictate detailed governance and protective provisions for the members of a limited liability company. Thus, in the absence of such statutory provisions, the members of an LLC must establish governance and protective provisions pursuant to an operating agreement or similar governing document.

It may be more difficult to raise financial capital for an LLC as investors may be more comfortable investing funds in the better-understood corporate form with a view toward an eventual IPO. One possible solution may be to form a new corporation and merge into it, dissolving the LLC and converting into a corporation.
Many jurisdictionsâincluding Alabama, California, Kentucky, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Texasâlevy a franchise tax or capital values tax on LLCs. In essence, this franchise or business privilege tax is the fee the LLC pays the state for the benefit of limited liability. The franchise tax can be an amount based on revenue, an amount based on profits, or an amount based on the number of owners or the amount of capital employed in the state, or some combination of those factors, or simply a flat fee, as in Delaware.

Effective in Texas for 2007 the franchise tax is replaced with the Texas Business Margin Tax. This is paid as: tax payable = revenues minus some expenses with an apportionment factor. In most states, however, the fee is nominal and only a handful charge a tax comparable to the tax imposed on corporations.
In California, both foreign and domestic LLCs, corporations, and trusts, whether for-profit or non-profitâunless the entity is tax exemptâmust at least pay a minimum income tax of $800 per year to the Franchise Tax Board; and no foreign LLC, corporation or trust may conduct business in California unless it is duly registered with the California Secretary of State.


The District of Columbia considers LLCs to be taxable entities, thus eliminating the benefit of pass-through taxesâsubjecting members to double taxation.[15] Typically, LLCs will choose to be taxed as a partnership to avoid double taxation, which occurs in corporations. This allows companies to distribute their income among members who then report it on their personal tax returns.
Renewal fees may also be higher. Maryland, for example, charges a stock or nonstock corporation $120 for the initial charter, and $100 for an LLC. The fee for filing the annual report the following year is $300 for stock-corporations and LLCs. The fee is zero for non-stock corporations. In addition, certain states, such as New York, impose a publication requirement upon formation of the LLC which requires that the members of the LLC publish a notice in newspapers in the geographic region that the LLC will be located that it is being formed. For LLCs located in major metropolitan areas (e.g., New York City), the cost of publication can be significant.
The management structure of an LLC may not be clearly stated. Unlike corporations, they are not required to have a board of directors or officers. (This could also be seen as an advantage to some.)
Taxing jurisdictions outside the US are likely to treat a US LLC as a corporation, regardless of its treatment for US tax purposesâfor example a US LLC doing business outside the US or as a resident of a foreign jurisdiction.[16] This is very likely where the country (such as Canada) does not recognize LLCs as an authorized form of business entity in that country.
The principals of LLCs use many different titlesâe.g., member, manager, managing member, managing director, chief executive officer, president, and partner. As such, it can be difficult to determine who actually has the authority to enter into a contract on the LLC's behalf.

Variations[edit]

A Professional Limited Liability Company (PLLC, P.L.L.C., or P.L.) is a limited liability company organized for the purpose of providing professional services. Usually, professions where the state requires a license to provide services, such as a doctor, chiropractor, lawyer, accountant, architect, landscape architect, or engineer, require the formation of a PLLC.[17] However, some states, such as California, do not permit LLCs to engage in the practice of a licensed profession. Exact requirements of PLLCs vary from state to state. Typically, a PLLC's members must all be professionals practicing the same profession. In addition, the limitation of personal liability of members does not extend to professional malpractice claims.
A Series LLC is a special form of a Limited liability company that allows a single LLC to segregate its assets into separate series. For example, a series LLC that purchases separate pieces of real estate may put each in a separate series so if the lender forecloses on one piece of property, the others are not affected.
An L3C is a for-profit, social enterprise venture that has a stated goal of performing a socially beneficial purpose, not maximizing income. It is a hybrid structure that combines the legal and tax flexibility of a traditional LLC, the social benefits of a nonprofit organization, and the branding and market positioning advantages of a social enterprise.
An Anonymous Limited Liability Company is a LLC where ownership information is not made publicly available by the state where the LLC is registered. This is done by using a third-party to act as the organizer and registered agent of the LLC. Level of anonymity varies with different states.[18]

International equivalents[edit]





It has been suggested that this section be merged into Private limited company. (Discuss) Proposed since December 2014.


Companies with limited liability exist in business law worldwide. However, the limited liability company is a specific legal structure defined by the laws of U.S. states, with quite distinct characteristics. Many other countries have similar structures.
Albania[edit]
In Albania a limited liability company (Albanian: ShoqÃ«ri me pÃ«rgjegjÃ«si tÃ« kufizuar Sh.p.k) is a commercial company founded by persons of physical or judicial status, who are not liable for the company and personally bear losses only up to the outstanding contribution agreements. Partners' contributions constitute the registered capital of a limited liability company. Each partner has his quota in the company in proportion to the contribution of the capital so the registered capital of the company is divided between the partners based on the proportional ratio of their contribution. In Albania a limited liability company may not have a capital of less than 100 lek.[19]
Argentina[edit]
Although not an exact equivalent, the Argentine variant of the LLC is called Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada (S.R.L.) and it limits the liability of its members up to their capital contribution in the company. The equity is divided into equal stakes (can not be called "shares"), each one of which represents a percentage of the company and that can not be traded on the stock exchange. Their by-laws are regulated by law NÂ° 19550[20] and the commercial partnership is limited to a maximum of 50 partners.
Bosnia and Herzegovina[edit]
Bosnian and Herzegovinian legislation, similarly to that in Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia contemplates LLCs as druÅ¡tvo s ograniÄenom odgovornoÅ¡Äu (d.o.o.). Companies using this structure append the abbreviation d.o.o. to their company name. A shareholder or member in a d.o.o. is only personally liable up to the value of the memberâs investment in the company.[21]
Brazil[edit]
The corporate structure in Brazilian law most similar to the American LLC is the Sociedade Limitada (âLtda.â), under the new Brazilian Civil Code of 2002. The sociedade limitada is the new name of the sociedade por quotas de responsabilidade limitada, and it can be organized as empresÃ¡ria or simples, under this new code, roughly corresponding to the form types of comercial (âcommercialâ) and civil (ânon commercialâ) of the Commercial Code. A new law in Brazil has made it legal to obtain an LLC by a sole-proprietor called Empresa Individual de Responsabilidade Limitada (Eireli for short). The main requirement is a capital of 100 times the current minimum wage,[22] R$ 78.800,00 [23](US$26.267.00) as of 2015.
Bulgaria[edit]
Bulgarian legislation contemplates LLCs as ÐÑÑÐ¶ÐµÑÑÐ²Ð¾ Ñ Ð¾Ð³ÑÐ°Ð½Ð¸ÑÐµÐ½Ð° Ð¾ÑÐ³Ð¾Ð²Ð¾ÑÐ½Ð¾ÑÑ (Druzhestvo s ogranichena otgovornost; Limited liability company). Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation ÐÐÐ (OOD) to their name. In case of an LLC with individual owner it is contemplated as ÐÐ´Ð½Ð¾Ð»Ð¸ÑÐ½Ð¾ Ð´ÑÑÐ¶ÐµÑÑÐ²Ð¾ Ñ Ð¾Ð³ÑÐ°Ð½Ð¸ÑÐµÐ½Ð° Ð¾ÑÐ³Ð¾Ð²Ð¾ÑÐ½Ð¾ÑÑ (Ednolichno druzhestvo s ogranichena otgovornost; One-man/ Single-member limited liability company) and abbreviated as ÐÐÐÐ (EOOD).[24]
Chile[edit]
Chilean law contemplates a certain form of LLC known as "Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada" (Limited Liability Association). Also (LLC) These companies are regulated by law NÂ° 3.918. Among their most important characteristics we can say that:

They can pursue a commercial or non-commercial purpose (Sociedad Comercial de Responsabilidad Limitada / Sociedad Civil de Responsabilidad Limitada).
They must be formed by two or more partners and can hold up to a maximum of fifty.
Their equity is divided into "cuotas" (not shares) each one of which represents a percentage of the company.
They can be managed by one or more managers (external if need be), or by a board of directors.
Their by-laws can't be modified, nor their partners be changed, without the consent of all the other partners.
In tax considerations, they differ from the LLC's because they pay a corporate tax for their income, amount that can be deducted by their owners as a credit against the taxes they pay.

Chilean law also contemplates a very special kind of individual owner LLC called Empresa Individual de Responsabilidad Limitada (Limited Liability Individual Company), which uses the E.I.R.L. abbreviation.
Colombia[edit]
Colombian legislation contemplates a very similar structure as mentioned above in the Chilean case. The Ltda. abbreviation is also used in Colombia.[25]
Croatia[edit]
In Croatia, a private limited liability company is termed druÅ¡tvo s ograniÄenom odgovornoÅ¡Äu (literal: limited liability company), abbreviated d.o.o.. A public limited liability company is termed a dioniÄko druÅ¡tvo (literal: joint stock company) abbreviated d.d..[26]
Czech Republic[edit]
Czech legislation contemplates LLCs as spoleÄnost s ruÄenÃ­m omezenÃ½m (s.r.o. or spol. s r.o.). An s.r.o. is not technically comparable to an LLC because the profits are still subject to double taxation. Czech law does not offer a possibility to start up a limited company without the possibility of avoiding double taxation. As of 2014 the liability is not limited in Czech, since managing director (jednatel, mandatory board member in Czech LLCs) bears full liability that extends to all of his/her property, including private one.
Denmark[edit]
The Danish form of the LLC is the kommanditselskab (K/S). There is no minimum capital requirements. In a K/S there are two types of shareholders, the komplementar which is fully liable, and the kommanditist which liability is limited. The K/S is a tax-transparent company, which means the income "passes through" the company directly to the shareholders.
Dominican Republic[edit]
Dominican Republic legislation contemplates LLCs as Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada, also known by their abbreviation S.R.L.;; S.R.L.s award limited liability to their members up to their contribution in the company (i.e., contribution of capital). This type of company began after the law number 479 of the year 2008.
Estonia[edit]
In Estonia, a limited liability company is referred to as osaÃ¼hing (OÃ). The type of entity is also required to be identified in the name. An OÃ is taxed as a corporation. The minimum capital required by law is â¬2,500.
Finland[edit]
Although not an exact equivalent, the Finnish version of the LLC is the Oy (osakeyhtiÃ¶) or in Swedish Ab (aktiebolag). An Oy is taxed as a corporation. The minimum capital required by law is â¬2,500.[27]
Germany[edit]
Because of its hybrid characteristics it is very difficult to determine the German equivalent. On one hand it is possible to consider it as a kind of Gesellschaft mit beschrÃ¤nkter Haftung (GmbH) because it has aspects of a corporation; on the other hand it could be considered to be a kind of Kommanditgesellschaft (KG), which is the German equivalent of a limited partnership. Based on the literal translation of the word "company", an LLC should be considered to be a kind of KG without any liable partner. The German equivalent that comes closest to LLC, is GmbH & Co KG, a nested Kommanditgesellschaft (KG) where a Gesellschaft mit beschrÃ¤nkter Haftung (GmbH) takes the role of the fully liable partner. For the purpose of taxation, the Bundesfinanzministerium (German Federal Ministry of Finance) gives detailed guidelines of the circumstances under which an LLC is to be considered to be a "corporation" or as a "limited partnership".[28] It is useful to note, however, that the original LLC statutes of Wyoming and other US states were more or less explicitly modeled after the GmbH.[29]
Greece[edit]
A limited liability company (LLC) in Greece is synonymous to an EPE (ÎÎ Î - ÎÏÎ±Î¹ÏÎµÎ¯Î± Î ÎµÏÎ¹Î¿ÏÎ¹ÏÎ¼Î­Î½Î·Ï ÎÏÎ¸ÏÎ½Î·Ï).[30]
Hong Kong[edit]
In Hong Kong, the Limited Company is the most commonly incorporated type of company[31] and bears the characteristics of a Limited Liability Company. The core characteristics of a Hong Kong Limited Company include: i) it requires a minimum of one shareholder and one director (can be the same person), ii) a Hong Kong company requires a company secretary resident in HK, iii) foreign ownership is allowed, iv) company shareholders have limited liability and v) the company must have registered HK address.
Entrepreneurs who register a company in Hong Kong can choose a Hong Kong offshore company. This company structure is basically a HK Limited Company but all business is conducted outside of Hong Kong. The advantage of this structure is that all business income that is sourced outside of Hong Kong is tax exempt.
Hungary[edit]
Hungarian legislation contemplates LLCs as KorlÃ¡tolt felelÅssÃ©gÅ± tÃ¡rsasÃ¡g. Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation Kft. to their name.[32] Hungarian LLCs are required to have a 3 million HUF (Hungarian Forint) (approx. 11,000 USD) starting capital. The time of formation by the new electronic formation option has been reduced from 2 weeks to 2 hours, additional cost of formation is around 100,000 HUF (approx. 540 USD). Kft.s can be formed by the cooperation of lawyers.
The Hungarian Kft. is the most common form of doing business in Hungary. As being part of the European Union (EU), Hungarian Kft.s can now obtain an EU VAT registration number for doing business across the EU. The Hungarian EU-VAT reg. number starts with "HU". This way the existence of the subject company, VAT issues and the cross-check is available on the common EU website for companies.[citation needed]
Iceland[edit]
According to Icelandic legislation, there are two types of LLC forms, private and public held limited liability forms. Private LLC is abbreviated "Ehf." The minimum capital of 500,000 Icelandic krÃ³nas (kr.). Public LLC is abbreviated "Hf." with minimum capital of 4,000,000 kr and goes to LLC.
India[edit]
Commonly used business forms in India are:
(a) Public and Private Limited Companies - Incorporated entities with limited liabilities. These are very similar to "Corporations" under U.S law.
(b) Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs) - Incorporated entities with limited liability. The LLPs are organized as partnerships - they do not have a Board of Directors as such. LLP has lesser compliance requirements compared to Private limited companies. There is no maximum limit for the no. of partners in LLP. In the private limited company shareholders are limited to the extent of 200 shareholders.[33]
The above entities are treated as taxable entities ("persons"), and as such are liable to tax on their incomes. These entities do not offer "pass-through" taxation benefits, unlike LLCs in the USA.
India vide Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008 introduced concept of LLP and it got implemented in 2009. 2 persons are required to Incorporate LLP in India and they are called designated partners. This form is very organised in India and controlled under Ministry of Corporate Affairs. There is no specific minimum capital requirement. Foreign Direct Investment too allowed in LLP. Essential part is one of the 2 promoters must be Indian Resident.
Iran[edit]
As of 2015, there are seven types of companies which can be registered under Iran's company registration law. One of these seven types of companies and partnerships refers to LLPs. Like many other countries, two persons are required to form an LLP in Iran. Each person has his/her own shares and is responsible for business liability equivalent to his/her share percentage. LLPs in Iran are named according to the format illustrated by the following example: "Sherkat Ba Masooliyate Mahdood" translates as "Sherkat Ø´Ø±Ú©Øª Company" + "Mahdood ÙØ­Ø¯ÙØ¯ Limited" + "Masooliyat ÙØ³Ø¦ÙÙÛØª Liability".
Italy[edit]
The Italian Civil Code, approved in 1942 and as amended by the Government Act 6/2003 and furthers modifications, mainly provides three forms of limited liability company:

SocietÃ  per azioni (S.p.A.): the minimum required starting capital for an SpA is â¬50,000.[34] The capital is divided into shares (azioni) that can be transferred by endorsement or bought and sold on stock exchange. Only SpAs can be quoted in stock exchange market, issue corporate bonds, and other financial instruments. SpA form and a higher capital are required by law to operate in protected businesses (i.e. banks, leasing companies, etc.).
SocietÃ  a responsabilitÃ  limitata (Srl): the minimum required starting capital for an Srl is â¬10,000. Its capital is divided into stakes (quote) which can be bought or sold just by notarial act. Srls can issue corporate bonds but are subject to many limitations. Similar to the Srl is the SocietÃ  Cooperativa a ResponsabilitÃ  Limitata (Scarl) whose scope is not making profit but give benefits to stakes' holders.
SocietÃ  in accomandita per azioni (Sapa): the minimum required starting capital for a Sapa is â¬120,000 divided into shares. Sapas have a mixed liability scheme, where standard shareholders have limited liability while managing shareholders have full liability. Except this, SAPAs are exactly like SPAs even if uncommon.

Companies append the corresponding abbreviation to their company names.
Japan[edit]
Japan passed legislation in 1996 creating a new type of business organization, godo kaisha (J-LLC), a close variant of the American LLC.[citation needed] Japanese Tax authority does not consider J-LLC (Godo-Kaisha) a pass-through entity, but as a taxable entity.
Macedonia, Republic of[edit]
Macedonian legislation contemplates LLCs as ÐÑÑÑÑÐ²Ð¾ ÑÐ¾ Ð¾Ð³ÑÐ°Ð½Ð¸ÑÐµÐ½Ð° Ð¾Ð´Ð³Ð¾Ð²Ð¾ÑÐ½Ð¾ÑÑ (Drushtvo so ogranichena odgovornost). Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation Ð´.Ð¾.Ð¾. (d.o.o.) to their name. The minimum required starting capital for a d.o.o. is â¬5,000.
Mexico[edit]
Mexican legislation contemplates LLCs as Sociedades de Responsabilidad Limitada, also known for their abbreviation "S. de R.L.". S. de R.L.'s award limited liability to its members up to their contribution in the company (i.e., contribution of capital) and also act as pass-through or flow-through entities whereby profits are "passed-through" to its members, avoiding double taxation. This type of company is widely used by foreign investors in Mexico because of its "pass-through" modality and its "check the box" capability under the IRC (Internal Revenue Code of the U.S.).[citation needed]
Moldova[edit]
Moldovan legislation contemplates LLCs as Societate cu RÄspundere LimitatÄ, abbreviated "S.R.L.", and are regulated member(s)-founder(s), and other non-founder members, minimum one member-founder and maximum total of 50 members, at least one of them must be the founder of the company, but all of the 50 could be also founders.[citation needed]
Norway[edit]
In Norway, the closest to an LLC is probably the kommandittselskap (KS). In a K/S there are two types of participants, one komplementar which is fully liable, and one or more kommandittist, with limited liability. There are minimum capital requirements. The KS is a tax-transparent company, which means the income "passes through" the company directly to the shareholders.
Pakistan[edit]
In Pakistan, LLCs are known as private companies that end (Local Liability Company) with Pvt. Ltd. They should have at least Rs. 100,000 as their minimum paid up capital.
The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has made it mandatory for all listed companies to file their documents, returns, accounts and applications through the commission's eServices online filing facility, earlier, this requirement was only applicable to the companies, which had been incorporated through eServices online filing facility.[35]
Peru[edit]
There is no direct equivalent of an LLC in Peru, but some similar corporate forms include:

Sociedad anÃ³nima cerrada (SAC), a corporation which must have at least two and not more than twenty shareholders; its shares may not be offered to the public and cannot be traded on the stock exchange.
Sociedad comercial de responsabilidad limitada (SRL), a commercial partnership divided in equal participations which may not be called "shares". It must have at least two and not more than twenty partners.
Sociedad civil de responsabilidad limitada (S civil de RL), a professional partnership of at least two and not more than thirty individuals, with co-owner participation in the form of capital, of professional contribution, or of any combination of both.
Empresa individual de responsabilidad limitada (EIRL), a legal entity with one single owner.

The capital for any of the above entities is freely determined by its statutes. There is no minimum requirement except for entities with certain types of activities, mainly in the financial markets, and then irrespective of their type.[36]
Poland[edit]
In Poland, a limited liability company is referred to literally as âcompany with limited liabilityâ (spÃ³Åka z ograniczonÄ odpowiedzialnoÅciÄ, legally abbreviated as sp. z o.o. (or sometimes Sp. z o.o. in particular names). Informally, in the Polish speaking slang, it is abbreviated as spÃ³Åka zoo (pronounced with a long "o", as in "tow."). However, sp. z o.o. has a (separate from its owners) legal personality, which gives it the ability to do certain actions under law, and it is considered a "corporation".
The minimum start capital is 5,000 PLN (since 2009; until then, 50,000 PLN).
Portugal[edit]
In Portugal, LLCs are called "Sociedades de Responsabilidade Limitada", that is, "company of limited responsibility", usually abbreviated Lda.. They are tax subject, and company shares cannot be sold in a public market, since 2006 the transference of them is not required to be done in the presence of a civil law notary, except if the company owns buildings, in the same way other major properties have to be sold. Nonetheless, the responsibility of the partners is limited to the capital share they hold, and the minimum capital required by law for a Lda. of â¬5000. (In 2006 the PS Government, led by JosÃ© Socrates, did reduce the minimum capital to â¬1, but in 2011 the new PSD Government, led by Pedro Passos Coelho, reinstated the â¬5000 minimum capital.) The capital is not required to be deposited at the time of the registration of the company, instead the share holders have until 31 December of the year the registry was made.[citation needed]
Romania[edit]
Romania recognizes the limited liability company since 1990 under the name of societate cu rÄspundere limitatÄ (S.R.L.), in which the owners are personally liable for the company obligations within the limit of their contribution to social capital. The minimum start capital is 200 RON which currently amounts to less than â¬50.[37]
Russia[edit]
In Russia and certain other former Soviet countries, an entity with a somewhat similar structure is known as ÐÐ±ÑÐµÑÑÐ²Ð¾ Ñ Ð¾Ð³ÑÐ°Ð½Ð¸ÑÐµÐ½Ð½Ð¾Ð¹ Ð¾ÑÐ²ÐµÑÑÑÐ²ÐµÐ½Ð½Ð¾ÑÑÑÑ (Obshchestvo s ogranichennoy otvetstvennost'yu) (lit., "company with limited liability"), usually abbreviated OOO, or in some CIS countries as OÑOO.[citation needed]
Although a Russian limited liability company shares the same name with an American LLC, it is different in many ways. Most importantly, a Russian LLC is not tax transparent: the company is taxed at the corporate level, and then, upon distribution of dividends, shareholders pay income tax (personal or corporate).[citation needed]
A limited liability company is the most popular form of legal undertaking in Russia for simple shareholding structures.[38]
The minimum capital required is 10,000 Russian rubles.
Serbia[edit]
Serbian legislation contemplates LLCs as druÅ¡tvo sa ograniÄenom odgovornoÅ¡Äu. Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation d.o.o. or DOO to their name same as in Croatia. As in the Czech Republic, a d.o.o. is not technically comparable to an LLC because the profits are still subject to double taxation.[citation needed] In Kosovo a company does not need to provide proof for payment of capital.[39]
Slovakia[edit]
In Slovakia, the law contemplates spoloÄnosÅ¥ s ruÄenÃ­m obmedzenÃ½m (abbreviation spol. s r. o. or s. r. o.) or as the rough equivalent of a limited liability company. It is very popular form of business organization due to ensurance of limited liability in exchange for a relatively small investment into the registered capital. From one to 50 associates can found it through a founding agreement with minimum registered capital of â¬5000, minimum â¬750 per person, in money or other property. (Â§ 105â153 of Act. No 513/1991 Coll. â Commercial Code as amended.)[40][41]
Slovenia[edit]
Slovenian legislation contemplates LLCs as druÅ¾ba z omejeno odgovornostjo. Companies working under this structure append the abbreviation d. o. o. to their name. The minimum required starting capital for a d. o. o. is â¬7,500. Due to the high cost and complicated bookkeeping of a real corporation, this is a more widespread form.[citation needed]
Spain[edit]
In Spain, LLCs are called Sociedad de responsabilidad limitada (SRL), "company of limited responsibility", or sociedad limitada (SL), or "limited partnership". They are tax subject, and company shares cannot be sold in a public market, the transference of them having to be done compulsorily in the presence of a civil law notary, in the same way other major properties have to be sold. Nonetheless, the responsibility of the partners is limited to the capital share they hold, and the minimum capital required by law for a S.L. is at least â¬3,000.
Sweden[edit]
Sweden has no equivalent of an LLC. The closest company form is the handelsbolag (lit.: "trade company"). The Swedish AB (aktiebolag; lit.: "share company"), like the handelsbolag, is a tax subject and is more similar to a US C Corporation than an LLC. The minimum capital required by law in a private company, privat aktiebolag, is SEK 50,000, although this may be in the form of assets as well as capital. It should be noted that the AB structure requires shareholders, a Board of Directors, and regular meetings of both, together with complete accounts once per year. Depending on the size of the AB, the accounts may have to be audited. Creation or purchase "off-the-shelf" of an AB is relatively cheap and tax effective, but liquidation of a created aktiebolag can be an expensive and time-consuming operation.[42] Creation of public limited liability companies, or publikt aktiebolag, which can raise capital from the public, requires a minimum capitalization of SEK 500,000, however the overall regulation of public companies in Sweden, especially regarding accounting methods and taxes, is thorough and detailed.[43]
Switzerland[edit]
The Swiss Code of Obligations[44] provides for different kinds of companies with limited liability, the two most commonly used are:
Swiss Limited Liability Company:[45][46] The terms for this kind of company used in the three official languages of the Swiss Confederation are as follows: In German Gesellschaft mit beschrÃ¤nkter Haftung (abbreviation: GmbH), in French SociÃ©tÃ© Ã  responsabilitÃ© limitÃ©e (abbreviation: S.Ã  r.l. or SARL) and in Italian SocietÃ  a Garanzia Limitata (abbreviation: SaGL). A Swiss LLC is similar to an LLC with respect to various matters, including the following: Members may also be natural persons, corporations, partnerships or other LLCs,[47] the liability of a member of a Swiss LLC to pay for the LLC's obligations is limited to its capital contribution,[48] a Swiss LLC may be either member-managed or manager-managed,[49] and, unless otherwise provided for in the operating agreement, the membersâ right to control or manage a Swiss LLC is proportionate to their individual membership interest.[50] The membership interests in a Swiss LLC have to be registered[51] and, thus, they may only be issued in the name of a member but not to the bearer.
Swiss Corporation[46][52] (in English common law context usually translated as company limited by shares): The terms for this kind of company used in the three official languages of the Swiss Confederation are as follows: In German Aktiengesellschaft (abbreviation: AG), in French SociÃ©tÃ© Anonyme (abbreviation: SA) and in Italian SocietÃ  Anonima (abbreviation: SA). A Swiss corporation is with respect to various matters different from an LLC (including a Swiss LLC): Most important is that a Swiss corporation may, neither by default nor by exercising any respective option provided by the Swiss law, be member-managed like an LLC, as the respective mandatory provisions of Swiss law provide that the board of directors has certain non-transferable duties.[53] Furthermore, the shares of a Swiss corporation may also be issued to the bearer (bearer shares)[54] and, thus, not only in the name of a holder (registered shares), which, however, applies to the membership interests in a Swiss LLC, which may only be registered.
Tajikistan[edit]
In Tajikistan, the same as in Russia, an entity with a somewhat similar structure is known as "Ò¶Ð°Ð¼ÑÐ¸ÑÑÐ¸ Ð´Ð¾ÑÐ¾Ð¸ Ð¼Ð°ÑÑÑÐ»Ð¸ÑÑÐ¸ Ð¼Ð°Ò³Ð´ÑÐ´", Chamiyti Doroi Masuliyti Machdud, abbreviated as "Ò¶ÐÐÐ".
Turkey[edit]
Minimum capital should be 10,000 TL. That capital could be the minimum total capital of company. Number of founding shareholders (real persons or legal entities) could be minimum 1 and maximum 50. All or some of the shareholders could be foreign nationals. There is no issued stock certificates and all shareholders liability is limited to their registered capital amount. 1/4 of capital should be blocked in a Bank until procedure of registration ends. The equivalent of LLC for Turkish is Ltd. Åti. (Which means Limited Åirketi.)
Ukraine[edit]
This type of entity has existed in Ukraine since the 1990s. LLC is the most common type of business entity in Ukraine.[55] In Ukrainian, it is spelled "Ð¢Ð¾Ð²Ð°ÑÐ¸ÑÑÐ²Ð¾ Ð· Ð¾Ð±Ð¼ÐµÐ¶ÐµÐ½Ð¾Ñ Ð²ÑÐ´Ð¿Ð¾Ð²ÑÐ´Ð°Ð»ÑÐ½ÑÑÑÑ" (abbreviated â TÐÐ, TÐ·ÐÐ), in transliteration "Tovarystvo z Obmezhenoyu Vidpovidalnistyu," that is, "company with limited liability".
By Ukrainian law LLC is a legal person. Authorized capital of LLC is divided into shares (or stakes), the amount of which is determined by the charter. LLC is responsible to the creditors only with its assets. Legal entities (foreign or Ukrainian companies) individuals, regardless of their country of citizenship or residency can be the founders (participants) of LLC. Limited liability company can be formed either by one person or by several individuals or legal entities (corporations). Maximum number of participants (founders) of LLC in Ukraine is 100. Since 2014 registration procedure has been significantly simplified in Ukraine. Minimum amount of authorised capital is 1 (one) hryvnia (less than 0,04 US cents). There is no state fee for LLC formation.
By Ukrainian Law LLC dividend payment is possible after the declaration of companyâs income or profit to the fiscal/tax authorities and the approval of the income statement.[56] Thus, regardless of the tax system, LLC can make dividend payments up to 4 times a year, or one time a quarter.
Taxation. LLC can be registered:
â as corporate/profit tax (18% rate) with or without VAT (up to 20% rate, depends on product or service) tax payer;
â fixed tax rate (in transliteration "yediniy podatok" or "sproschena sistema opodatkuvannia") is a 5% rate from revenue, with or without (on request) VAT registration.
United Arab Emirates[edit]
A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is the most common type of registration in the UAE and is recommended where the purpose of the entity is to make sales within the region. However, it should be noted that 100% foreign ownership of such an entity is not permitted. Under the UAE Commercial Companies Law (CCL), foreign investors are permitted to hold up to 49 per cent equity ownership in UAE companies and 51 per cent of the equity must be held at all times by one or more UAE nationals. In accordance with Article (218) of the CCL a Limited Liability Company can be formed by a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 50 shareholders whose liability is limited to their shares in the capital of the company. Recent amendments to Article (217) of the CCL that came into force in June 2009 removed the requirement for minimum share capital (previously AED 300,000 in Dubai and AED 150,000 in other Emirates) allowing founders of a limited liability company the freedom to determine the companyâs share capital which could be less than the earlier prescribed bottom line. Shares of an LLC are not open for subscription by the public.[57] Despite the split in shareholdings, profits may be divided in other ratios agreed upon, taking into consideration efforts of foreign partners in management, provision of technology or expertise. Responsibility for the management of a LLC can be vested in the foreign partner or UAE national partners or a third party. A LLC must appoint a minimum of one manager and up to a maximum of five managers for the business. Managers must be appointed by a Memorandum of Association or by a management contract, for a fixed term or an unlimited term. Unless the Memorandum of Association states otherwise, the manager has full powers of administration and management of the LLC. LLC is not allowed to practice its activities in the UAE without a Trade License and Commercial Registration Certificate.
[58]
United Kingdom[edit]
The new form of limited liability partnership (LLP), created in 2000, is similar to a US LLC in being tax neutral: member partners are taxed at the partner level, but the LLP itself pays no tax. It is treated as a body corporate for all other purposes including VAT. Otherwise, all companies, including limited companies and US LLCs, are treated as bodies corporate subject to United Kingdom corporation tax if the profits of the entity belong to the entity and not to its members.
United States[edit]
A limited liability company (LLC) is a relatively new business structure authorized by state statutes.[59] The LLC is chiefly inspired by the GmbH ("Company with limited liability"), a type of business organization in Germany, and by the limitada, a type of business organization available in many Latin American countries.[29]
In the United States, the first limited liability company act appeared in Wyoming in 1977 as special interest[60] legislation for an oil company.[61] In 1980, the Internal Revenue Service issued a private letter ruling to an LLC formed under the Wyoming LLC Act, indicating that the IRS would treat the LLC as a partnership for federal tax purposes.[62] However, later that year, the IRS proposed regulations that would deny partnership classification to any business entity in which no member bore personal responsibility for the entity's liabilities.[63] In 1982, Florida adopted an LLC act modeled on Wyoming's LLC Act.[64] Due to uncertainty over the tax treatment of LLCs, no other states introduced LLC legislation until after 1988.[65] In 1988, the IRS issued a revenue ruling stating that it would treat a Wyoming-style LLC as a partnership for tax purposes.[66] By 1996, nearly every state had enacted an LLC statute.[67] The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws adopted the Uniform Limited Liability Company Act in 1996 and revised it in 2006.[68]
A potential disadvantage specific to the United States is that LLCs are not considered to be corporations for the purposes of federal civil procedure; they are instead treated as partnerships. This affects the applicability of diversity jurisdiction in cases involving LLCs, barring application of diversity jurisdiction when even one member of the LLC is a citizen of the same state as one of the opposing parties. Should one member of an LLC be a citizen of a state of which one of the opposing parties is a citizen, any case between the LLC and those parties must be heard in that state's courts; corporations enjoy a more complete legal personhood that only denies diversity jurisdiction when the opposing party is a citizen of the state in which the corporation is incorporated (most commonly Delaware for large corporations, which has a small population) or has its principal place of business.
AOL was set up as an LLC during its ownership by Time Warner from 2001 to 2008. There is a similar setup for BMW's American subsidiary, BMW of North America, LLC. Chrysler has been an LLC since restructuring during the auto industry bailout of 2009, owned by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V..

Understanding Farm General Liability Insurance


As a farmer or rancher, you should consider four primary areas of liability:
Premises liability
You may be held responsible if someone is injured or sustains property damage as a result of the physical condition of your farm or ranch. A common example is a visitor who slips and falls on your property. 

Operations liability
You may also be held responsible for injury or property damage caused by some aspect of your farm or ranch operations. A prime example is an incident caused by farm machinery on a roadway. 

Pollution liability
This is liability for injury or property damage that results from the escape of pollutants directly from your farm or while in transit. Government regulations also consider you responsible for pollution cleanup.Insurance coverage options vary by state and jurisdiction. In most states, optional coverage is available to provide protection for some of your pollution exposures. 

Product liability
Product liability applies when injury or property damage occur as a result of the use of one of your products. One example would be bodily injury caused by the consumption of an edible product.AgriChoiceÂ® provides general liability protection (subject to exclusions and policy conditions) for premises and operations liability. It also provides some limited coverage for product liability. 

Umbrella insurance
Umbrella insurance provides broad coverage above your standard farm and ranch insurance. An umbrella policy gives you additional liability coverage and higher coverage limits for all policies that fall underneath it. It can be a cost-effective way to provide you with additional protection against the liability risks you may face. 

Make sure your agritourism business is protected
One area of premises liability that deserves special consideration is agritourism. Generally, activities that go along with agritourism are not covered by your farm or ranch policy. Nationwide offers coverage supplemental to your farm or ranch policy that can provide protection for most types of agritourism.
Talk to your agent about all of the activities that take place on your farm or ranch to make sure your operation is properly covered. 
Farm and ranch products are not available in: Alaska, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Oklahoma.

When beginning a business, you must decide what form of business entity to establish. Your form of business determines which income tax return form you have to file. The most common forms of business are the sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, and S corporation. A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is a business structure allowed by state statute. Legal and tax considerations enter into selecting a business structure.

Types of Business Insurance 






 


Insurance coverage is available for every conceivable risk your business might face. Cost and amount of coverage of policies vary among insurers. You should discuss your specific business risks and the types of insurance available with your insurance agent or broker. Your agency can advise you on the exact types of insurance you should consider purchasing.
General Liability Insurance
Business owners purchase general liability insurance to cover legal hassles due to accident, injuries and claims of negligence. These policies protect against payments as the result of bodily injury, property damage, medical expenses, libel, slander, the cost of defending lawsuits, and settlement bonds or judgments required during an appeal procedure.
Product Liability Insurance
Companies that manufacture, wholesale, distribute, and retail a product may be liable for its safety. Product liability insurance protects against financial loss as a result of a defect product that causes injury or bodily harm. The amount of insurance you should purchase depends on the products you sell or manufacture. A clothing store would have far less risk than a small appliance store, for example.
Professional Liability Insurance
Business owners providing services should consider having professional liability insurance (also known as errors and omissions insurance). This type of liability coverage protects your business against malpractice, errors, and negligence in provision of services to your customers. Depending on your profession, you may be required by your state government to carry such a policy. For example, physicians are required to purchase malpractice insurance as a condition of practicing in certain states.
Commercial Property Insurance
Property insurance covers everything related to the loss and damage of company property due to a wide-variety of events such as fire, smoke, wind and hail storms, civil disobedience and vandalism. The definition of "property" is broad, and includes lost income, business interruption, buildings, computers, company papers and money.
Property insurance policies come in two basic forms: (1) all-risk policies covering a wide-range of incidents and perils except those noted in the policy; (2) peril-specific policies that cover losses from only those perils listed in the policy. Examples of peril-specific policies include fire, flood, crime and business interruption insurance. All-risk policies generally cover risks faced by the average small business, while peril-specific policies are usually purchased when there is high risk of peril in a certain area. Consult your insurance agent or broker about the type of business property insurance best suited for your small business.
Home-Based Business Insurance
Contrary to popular belief, homeowners' insurance policies do not generally cover home-based business losses. Depending on risks to your business, you may add riders to your homeowners' policy to cover normal business risks such as property damage. However, homeowners' policies only go so far in covering home-based businesses and you may need to purchase additional policies to cover other risks, such as general and professional liability.

LLC Insurance



        How to Find LLC Insurance










One of the key reasons for starting a limited liability company (LLC) is to separate your personal liability from your business operations. As a business owner, you want your personal assets to be protected in case your business is taken to the mat with a liability insurance claim, or worse â a lawsuit.

Itâs essential that you find the right LLC insurance to protect your business against coverage gaps. A Trusted ChoiceÂ® member agent can help you find LLC insurance coverage that meets your needs. Local member agents are familiar with your state regulations and LLC insurance requirements and will work with you to tailor a policy that meets your business needs. For professional assistance, contact a Trusted Choice member agent today.






         Limited Liability Exceptions


You can be held responsible ("liable") for things you do while performing work for your limited liability company. For example, your LLC will most likely not protect you if:

You personally injure someone

You personally guarantee a business loan or debt

You donât manage your business taxes correctly

You intentionally commit a crime or engage in fraudulent or reckless behavior that damages the company

Rather than treating your company as a separate business entity, you mix business and personal accounts or expenses







        Does a Limited Liability Company Act as LLC Insurance?


Starting an LLC does not protect you from all threats. For example, a fire can break out and can damage equipment and other business property. This means that while an LLC designation can provide important protection, it does not act as insurance.
It is also important to understand a concept called "piercing the corporate veil." You can think of an LLC as a kind of barrier between your business operations and your personal finances. However, certain errors you make can allow the legal system to break through that barrier. For example, if a limited liability company takes on excessive business debt, a legal team can sometimes hold the business owners accountable for those debts.
Consulting in depth with both your independent agent and your attorney about your personal risks with regard to your LLC activities is wise, and can help to ensure both you and your business are protected.





        LLC Insurance Requirements Vary by State


LLC insurance requirements are set by the state government, so make sure youâre complying with state business insurance laws when you begin operation. Your required coverage may include:

Workers compensation: All states require this coverage, regardless of whether the business is a limited liability company. But the specific requirements vary by state. Some states require workers compensation whether or not a company hires staff members, and some require it if the business has a certain number of employees, such as three or more.
Disability insurance: Some states require businesses to contribute to disability insurance. Whereas workers compensation covers work-related injuries and illnesses, disability insurance covers non-work-related incidents and illness that prevent a worker from returning to work.
Unemployment insurance tax: Check with your state to determine if this tax is required. It is designed to help cover the costs of unemployment insurance for workers who lose their jobs. You may need to register your company with the state workforce agency as well.






        Property Insurance Coverage for LLCs 


Property insurance is one of the critical forms of business insurance that all companies operating from a business site should purchase. This coverage protects your business property from damage or loss due to a covered cause, such as fire. A good commercial property policy will include coverage a variety of things, ranging from the structure of your building to your personal property stored at the business site. Be sure to examine your policy closely for any exclusions.
This type of insurance is typically offered in three forms:

Basic: Similar to your homeowner policy, this will cover a list of perils including fire, certain natural disasters, and vandalism. However, it may not cover theft.
Broad: This expands the list of perils so that you have added coverage.
Special form: Instead of naming the things that are covered, this policy provides the most protection and only lists perils that arenât covered.

Note that flooding is rarely covered by a commercial property policy.





        Liability Insurance For LLCs


Although there are many forms of commercial liability insurance, not all will protect you or your business if youâre held responsible for certain errors. Be sure to talk with a knowledgeable independent agent who can help assess your risks and choose the appropriate coverage for your commercial operation.

Just how extensive your liability needs are depend on the type of business you operate and the risks you face. There are a few different liability insurance options for LLCs:

General liability: If a customer is injured while on your property or youâre accused of slander, this policy will help take care of medical expenses, legal defense costs, and judgements/settlements. Setting the right coverage limit will be the key to protecting your LLC.
Product liability: If youâre active in any step of product manufacturing or product sales, you need this coverage. You can be held liable if the product causes injury or property damage.
Professional liability: Also known as errors and omissions insurance, or "E & O," this is best for LLCs that provide professional services. For example, a doctor will need a form of professional liability known as malpractice insurance, which is specialized for the medical field, while an investment firm needs E & O coverage for advice provided to clients that can potentially result in a financial loss.
Directors and officers liability: Also called "D & O," this liability coverage protects your company in the event that legal action is brought against one or more of your directors or officers due to accusations of negligence or wrongdoing.

Of course, there are many other forms of LLC insurance coverage that you may need. If you have a fleet of vehicles, for example, you will need to purchase commercial vehicle insurance that covers all employee drivers, vehicle damage and your company's liability in the event that you or a staff member is at fault for an accident.
Additionally, you may also want to invest in business interruption insurance, which can help cover the expenses it takes to keep running your business if youâre displaced due to a building fire or natural disaster.





        How Much Does LLC Insurance Cost?


Costs for the insurance package you need to protect your company will vary widely based on factors such as the type of business you run and the specific types of coverages you need. Additionally, your specific LLC insurance costs will depend on how many employees you have and whether you work in a litigation-prone industry. For this reason, it's a good idea to compare LLC insurance quotes based on your unique business and risks.

Whereas a small business with few risks may only need to pay a few hundred dollars per year for adequate protection, a larger corporation can easily require protection in excess of $500,000 annually. To get accurate LLC insurance quotes that are tailored to your business risks, work with an independent agent in the Trusted Choice network who can fully assess your needs and find the right coverage at an affordable rate.






        Protecting Your LLC


Trusted Choice member agents who specialize in commercial coverage can work with you to determine what forms of LLC insurance are best suited to your business. Donât overpay for coverage that you donât need. Your member agent will assist with setting the right coverage limits and finding competitive LLC insurance based on your risk factors. Find an independent agent in the Trusted Choice network today for personal assistance.

Multiple Types Of Attorneys Available For Your NeedsInjury AttorneysDealing with personal injuries can already be stressful. Getting the right representation doesn't have to be. Youâve got legal rights to compensation and that has nothing to do with your healthcare benefits from your employer, it is a legal right. Naturally, in case your injuries are the results of carelessness or neglect on the part of your employer or another employee, youâre entitled to considerably more compensation than if it was your own fault.You almost certainly need assistance to locate the appropriate personal injury lawyer to represent your case, since they will have work cut out for them. Certainly one of their duties is to look for and identify guilt and this is done by reconstructing the chain of events leading up to your injury. Occasionally proving that guilt can be pretty evident and be a cinch to prove but other times it could take extra effort to prove the guilt.Malpractice AttorneysThe challenging part for you may be to find a malpractice attorney to represent you in the city you reside in. The one thing you donât want to do is base your decision entirely on cost. You might find a very cheap lawyer but the reason they may be cheap may very well be because they are new or inexperienced with this type of law, and in that situation, your odds of winning your case are considerably lower. You need to find the best malpractice lawyer that you can who has several years of experience with this kind of law, who will give you a far better overall chance of winning your lawsuit. Your time and money is precious, don't waste on a lawyer that doesn't care about you. Give us a call today for more information.Tax AttorneysAre you at risk for receiving an audit on your taxes or is your refund being withheld? We can help.
