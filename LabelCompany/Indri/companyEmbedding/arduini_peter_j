Blood Thinner Might Be Tied to More Deaths
Posted by morganwrites on March 1, 2008

(NYT) – Amid indications that more people may have died or been harmed after being  given a brand of the blood thinner heparin, federal drug regulators said  Thursday that they had found “potential deficiencies” at a Chinese plant that  supplied much of the active ingredient for the drug.

Changzhou SPL Plant near Shanghai – notice the American Flag.
Baxter International, which makes the brand of heparin associated with the  problems, and buys supplies from the Chinese plant, announced that it was  expanding a recall to include virtually all its heparin products. Though Baxter  produces much of the heparin used in the United States, regulators said the  other major supplier would be able to meet the demand.
The Food  and Drug Administration said the number of deaths possibly associated with  the drug, made from pig intestines, had risen to 21 from 4. But it cautioned  that many of those patients were already seriously ill and that the drug might  not have caused their deaths.
The FDA emphasized that it had yet to identify the root cause of the  problem, and that it had not concluded that the Chinese plant was responsible.  The agency also said it was investigating two Chinese wholesalers — also called  consolidators — that supplied crude heparin to the Chinese plant, Changzhou SPL,  as well as those that sold raw ingredients to the consolidators.
The New York Times reported Thursday that at least one of the consolidators  received supplies from small, unregulated family workshops that scraped mucous  membrane from pig intestines and cooked it, eventually producing a dry substance  known as crude heparin.
The FDA admitted this month that it had violated its own policy by failing  to inspect SPL, located west of Shanghai, before the factory began shipping the  heparin ingredient to Baxter in 2004. China’s drug agency also did not inspect  the plant.
Last week, the FDA sent inspectors to the plant. Among the potential  problems they found was a failure to properly follow the steps for identifying  impurities and deficiencies related to manufacturing equipment. According to a  redacted inspection report released by the agency, the SPL plant appeared to  have made at least some heparin with “material from an unacceptable workshop  vendor.” The vendor was not identified.
Scientific Protein Laboratories, a Wisconsin company that is the majority  owner of the Chinese plant, issued a statement Thursday saying the FDA’s  finding did not represent its final determination as to whether the plant  complied with federal regulatory rules.  SPL, the statement said, is committed  to finding the root cause of the adverse reactions.
Erin Gardiner, a spokeswoman for Baxter, said the company was reviewing the  FDA’s report. “We expect SPL to respond to those observations thoroughly  and promptly,” Ms. Gardiner said. “The observations are important and need to be  addressed promptly but they are not necessarily indicative of the root  cause.”
The FDA’s concern about heparin had previously centered on Baxter’s  multidose vials, but on Thursday Baxter agreed to voluntarily recall not only  the multi-dose vials but also single-dose vials and a diluted solution of  heparin used to keep blood clots from forming in intravenous lines. There have  been no adverse reaction reports involving the latter product, called Hep-Lock  heparin flush products.
“We have assurance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that there is  an adequate supply in the market to meet the demand for these critical and  lifesaving drugs,” Peter J. Arduini, president of Baxter’s Medication Delivery  business, said in a statement released by the company.
The only heparin products made by Baxter that are still on the market are  premixed bags of intravenous solutions, the Food and Drug Administration  said.
“We at the FDA understand how unsettling this whole situation with heparin  is,” said Dr. Sandra Kweder, the agency’s deputy director, Office of New Drugs,  Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “We are determined to get to the root  cause.”
The FDA estimates that more than one million multidose vials of heparin  are sold per month in the United States, about half of which are manufactured  and distributed by Baxter.
The problems with heparin, which is used to prevent blood clotting during  dialysis and after some surgery, were first reported last month at a hospital in  Missouri. Since then, the number of reported adverse reactions has risen to 448,  the F.D.A. said. “Yes, we have gotten more and we are continuing to evaluate  those reports,” Dr. Kweder said.
At first, the agency said it believed that four people had died after  allergic reactions to the drug. On Thursday, officials said as many as 17 more  people may have died, but they described the links to heparin as more tenuous.
The adverse reactions have included decreased or low blood pressure and fast  heart rate. Not all of them are known to involve Baxter products, but the drug  agency did not issue warnings involving any other products.
The Chinese heparin market has been in turmoil over the last year, as pig  disease has swept through the country, depleting stocks, leading some farmers to  sell sick pigs into the market and forcing heparin producers to scramble for new  sources of raw material.
As a result, even big companies have been turning increasingly to small  village workshops, which are often unsanitary. In interviews this week at some  of these workshops, employees told The Times that they had not been inspected by  the government.
Scientific Protein Laboratories said it responded to the disease outbreak by  buying less raw material in China. Its president, David Strunce, said in an  interview this week that the Chinese plant bought supplies only from two  reputable consolidators, and that its suppliers were audited.
The FDA has already finished inspecting one of the consolidators and is  still looking at the second one, an agency spokeswoman said. The agency also  plans, if necessary, to look at some of the small workshops that supply the  consolidators.
“We will go where the investigation takes us,” an agency official  said.
Isn’t that just special.  When will the U.S. Government step in and abolish all imports from countries, especially China, unless they’ve been thoroughly inspected?  Probably never – as big business cares little about our safety – it’s all about currying to stock holders and the honchos who run these companies.  Hope it all comes back and bites them in the ass.

	"I want to express my great appreciation to Gerry from all of us on Integra's management team and the Board of Directors," said Mr. Essig. "His contributions have strengthened our leadership team and increased our ability to execute on key operating objectives. Gerry has focused the company on growth opportunities for our existing products and technologies and in the integration of newly acquired businesses.  For seven years, he has driven our mission to lead in the development of innovative medical devices. He has been a great partner at Integra."

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.
