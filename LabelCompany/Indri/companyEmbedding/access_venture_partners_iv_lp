Polaris Venture Partners IV, L.P. Overview
  Polaris Venture Partners IV, L.P. filed as a Foreign Limited Partnership (LP) in the State of Texas and is no longer active. This corporate entity was filed approximately sixteen years ago on Monday, August 13, 2001 as recorded in documents filed with Texas Secretary of State. It is important to note that this is a foreign filing. A foreign filing is when an existing corporate entity files in a state other than the one they originally filed in. This does not necessarily mean that they are from outside the United States.
