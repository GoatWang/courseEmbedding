Process
Our process is based on a rigorous, disciplined decision-making framework. Communication, collaboration, and teamwork are all key elements.

Applications for candidates to participate in the upcoming summer program are reviewed in December. At the end of the internship program candidates are formally reviewed and considered for full-time hiring based on performance and manager need across our locations. 


Investment Team
Carlson Capital offers full-time employment to both talented recent graduates and experienced investment professionals. Positions within portfolio management, research, trading and risk management may become available throughout the year and hiring is generally based on need.

Carlson Capital, L.P.

 




This financial client selected Structure Tone Southwest as the general contractor to provide the interior fit-out of 40,000sf of space. The project scope of work included demolition and the interior fit-out of the top two floors (18th & 19th) in the occupied building. 




The project involved the construction of both the general and executive office spaces, trading floors with approximately 30 desks, conference rooms with A/V capabilities, boardroom, reception area and elevator lobby.
Some of the custom finishes throughout the facility included stained wood flooring in the boardroom, elevator lobbies and reception area. These areas also included a custom chiseled stone reception desk; color broadloom carpet throughout the office area with glass and stainless steel room fronts; metallic finish porcelain tile in the break-rooms; open structure overhead with pendant lighting and internally lined spiral ductwork; zebrawood and bamboo millwork accent ceilings and walls throughout.
The facility had special features such as the addition of a custom stainless steel staircase which included custom wood treads and glass handrails; the elevator lobby included new finishes with distressed and detailed plaster walls to replicate cast in place concrete exposed structure of the building. Since every aspect of the project was customized and required extensive on-site installation labor, the aggressive schedule was extremely challenging. Additionally, all noisy, dusty and disruptive work was done during after-hours and on weekends. Challenges aside, the project was completed within three months while working double shifts most of the duration of the job.
