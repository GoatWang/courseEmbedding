The role of a product manager is challenging, complex and often misunderstood.
Across the high-tech industry, the "product manager" title is used in many ways to describe drastically different duties and responsibilities. Diverse interpretations regarding the role of the product manager have created an untenable situation for some, who therefore struggle to define their own role.
Properly defining and structuring the roles and responsibilities of the product management team would enable the team members to be more efficient and productive, leading to better revenues and higher-quality products that meet customer needs.
This article explores the challenges faced by modern high-tech product managers and proposes a solution to formalize and structure the responsibilities and makeup of the product management team.
What's Your Role?







Job titles are important, and the role one plays in an organization is often identified by one's job title. But often this is not the case in the world of product management. The myriad interpretations of product management job titles, especially the product manager title, make it very difficult to ascertain what roles and responsibilities are associated with a specific product management job title.
Ask several product managers what their responsibilities are, and you will get a variety of answers and descriptions. Even if working in the same company and department, they may provide very different perspectives on their position.
Most people accept that "product management" is a term used to describe the sum of diverse activities performed in the interest of delivering a particular product to market. Such a broad definition, used by many companies today, is the root of much grief because it dilutes the professional focus necessary to achieve successful results and allows virtually any product-related task to be assigned to the product manager.
Jack of All Roles, Master of None
Multitasking is challenging for humans, who prefer to focus on performing one task or sequentially performing a few select tasks. The inherent difficulty of multitasking hinges principally on humans' limited ability to maintain a high level of intellectual focus when confronted with a multitude of dynamic issues. To a lesser degree, fatigue and a lack of resources (primarily time) are also contributing factors.
Performing the diverse product management activities outlined above is the epitome of multitasking. Product management assignments are particularly challenging because they require a multitude of complimentary or differing skills. In addition, when product managers have several products to manage, the multitasking becomes profoundly more complex.
Such a broad definition of the product management profession is the culmination of individual and industry interpretations. They, in turn, have invariably led to the ever-familiar challenges that the majority of product managers now encounter daily, caused by ambiguous role definition, imbalanced relationships with other departments, an overwhelming volume of activities, a lack of or poorly defined processes, no definitive methodology and a shortage of uniform work tools in the profession.
The overall perceived obstacle that the typical product manager encounters is the pervasive lack of professional focus. One can be adequate at many things, but it is difficult to excel at many. Many product managers therefore view themselves as trapped in a never-ending juggling routine. Having too many tasks to juggle eventually leads to tasks being dropped; the outcome is poor overall performance by the product manager, which is detrimental for the company.
The title of product manager has proven more harmful than helpful. Other official and unofficial product management title variations (such as Product CEO or Product Champion or Product Executive) have failed. The reason is that they are often accompanied by a blurred, wide-scoped job description that defines or implies the product manager as owner�and, as a result, responsible for the product's commercial success. Being labeled or treated as a "Product CEO" can be daunting, since it nearly always means operating without the authority and resources available to an actual CEO.
When a job title has an overly broad set of diverse activities (roles and responsibilities) associated with it, there is a high probability that the attempt to perform to the expectations of that job title will result in failure.
Obviously, a semantic change is needed, and this change is based on the definition of professional�i.e., focused on a particular domain or discipline.
Breaking It Down
The two main disciplines residing in the product management domain are product planning and product marketing, which are very different from each other. But due to the collaboration between these two disciplines, some companies erroneously perceive them as one discipline�which they call product management.
If done carefully, it is possible to functionally divide the product management domain into product planning and product marketing, yet retain the required synergy between the two.
Product planning is the ongoing process of identifying and articulating market requirements that define a product's feature set. Product marketing is an outbound activity aimed at generating product awareness, differentiation and demand.
Product planning and product marketing are different and distinct professional disciplines, because they foster different roles and different quality goals.
With such a conceptualization, it is easy to address the respective tasks of product planning and product marketing as belonging to the roles of a product planner and a product marketer.
Whether these two roles are handled by two individuals or performed by one person is actually irrelevant. Indeed, there are cases where both disciplines are assumed by one person, or by two people sitting in one room, or by different departments that collaborate.
The point is that there must be a clear and unambiguous link between the job title and the job responsibilities.
It should also be clear that the disciplines of product planning and product marketing are inextricably linked, because companies design product functionality for the user and market the product's value to the buyer.
To clarify: an intuitive example of this is a child's toy. The parent is the buyer and has an interest in whether the toy is safe to use, will help the child grow smarter, will keep the child occupied and is reasonably priced. Product value is therefore marketed to the buyer, the parent.
The child cares only about product functionality, such as whether the toy is fun, engaging and visually pleasing, and whether it will do what he/she wants. The toy's functionality is designed for the user�the child�and not for the buyer.
The same approach is necessary with high-tech products, where buyers are often not the users; and this approach means distinct product management roles that separately analyze and address buyer and user needs.
The recent fast-paced growth of high-tech industries and the shifting interpretations of product management created skewed responsibility sets for product managers. The already-problematic, broad definition of product management was further complicated when tactical activities were added to a product manager's job definition.
Tactical activities are assignments, usually self-contained and specific, that fulfill short-term business needs. Those assignments�such as delivering a presentation, writing collateral material or assisting a salesperson�are time-consuming and demand a disproportionate allocation of individual resources (mental focus, time and physical effort) in relation to their overall importance.
By monopolizing the scope of work, tactical activities detract from the product managers' ability to fulfill the strategic responsibilities assigned to them.
A strategy aims to establish and plan the overall and long-term course of action a company should engage in to achieve corporate objectives.
The strategic mission for the product marketer would primarily involve evaluating market opportunities and writing marketing plans/programs that address those opportunities. For the product planner, the mission is to identify market needs so as to deliver winning products that help a company become a market leader, market follower or an innovator.
Roles and Goals
Executive managers have very clear work goals that primarily center on achieving corporate profitability. Software developers, for example, also know what they aim for�usually, generating lean and efficient programming code.
However, many product managers provide widely different answers when asked what their job goal is. They also find it difficult to provide a definitive answer. Obviously, this situation stems from an overly broad and task-oriented (not goal-oriented) job description.
By breaking down the product management domain into its two disciplines, it becomes feasible to clearly define the roles and goals of each.
The product planner determines and defines product functionality, and therefore the prime goal is to have product buyers and users who are satisfied with the product. This means (1) contentment with the product's ability to solve business or consumer problems and satisfy needs and (2) satisfaction with the intangible aspects of product ownership, such as service, price, warrantee, status or prestige.
The product marketer's goal is to have a satisfied sales force. This goal is somewhat indirect to the marketing actions being performed, but it is an excellent predictor of how effective the product marketer's actions are in generating awareness, differentiation and demand for the product.
Salespeople have a relatively easy job when product marketers perform their roles well. The market environment created by the product marketer leads to a favorable situation in which the market actively buys the product rather than the salespeople having to actively sell the product. Salespeople are very happy when "the product sells itself," which really means that the sale cycle is minimal or reduced because of quality marketing by product marketers.
In short, product planning's quality goal is satisfied customers, and product marketing's quality goal is a satisfied sales force. After defining the strategic roles of the key disciplines within the product management domain, there is a need for a cooperative scheme�a team concept�to maximize the effectiveness of these strategic roles through collaboration and complement them with outbound tactical support functions.
Product management is not accomplished successfully by only one person but by a product management team, the members of which fulfill various roles and functions.
The Product Management Team Model
The product management team is a task group that organizationally resides in the Product Management department and has four distinct roles: product planner, product marketer, sales engineer and marketing communications (marcom) manager.
These four roles are the basic providers of the planning, deliverables and actions that guide the inbound-oriented product definition and the outbound marketing efforts:   The primary responsibility of the product planner is to constantly research the market and identify market needs, which are later translated into market requirements that will foster new products or new features to existing products. The product planner prepares the documents that profoundly impact the product's success. These documents include the Market Requirements Document (MRD), product use cases, product road map and the pricing model.  The primary responsibility of the product marketer is to analyze product-oriented business opportunities, formulate plans that evaluate those business opportunities, and plan and guide the subsequent marketing efforts. For example, the product marketer prepares the product business case and following approval, writes the marketing plan, launch plan and communications plan.  The sales engineer is primarily responsible for outbound product-centric activities, such as presale support and product demonstrations. Relying on their technical skills, sales engineers help customers understand how the product delivers the necessary value and functionality that address the customers' business or consumer problem. The sales engineer's other objective is to provide critical input to product planners on customer needs and problems.Sales engineers often operate under titles such as product evangelist, technical evangelist, technical sales support, presale engineer, outbound product manager or technical product manager; yet, regardless of title, all perform a relatively similar set of tasks.  The marcom manager is primarily responsible for creating interest and demand for products through the conception and copywriting of all collateral material, advertising, direct response mail, Web and other types of communications media. This person is also tasked with maintaining a consistent company image and positioning in the marketplace, according to messages and directives provided by the product marketer. 
The product management team is managed by the director of product management, or vice president of product management, who provides overall product vision, product line strategy and team management. Other titles are sometimes used to designate this leadership position, such as director of products or vice-president of products, in order to indicate the encompassing nature of this role.
This person provides guidance to team members and is responsible for furnishing them with resources, tools and uniform processes to do their jobs. On the strategic level, this role is responsible for formulating the company's product line strategy and driving its implementation, while balancing corporate goals with long-term market trends and opportunities.

The Odd Couple(s)
In startups, it is common to see one individual assume all four roles listed in the product management team model. That person will do market planning, deliver product demonstrations, formulate market requirements and write collateral material.
Clearly, Product Manager is a title assigned to a person who performs a single role or a combination of the four roles listed in the product management team model. At some point, usually as the company grows, the roles are delegated to other individuals who specialize in the role assigned to them.
However, for a variety of reasons and reasoning, two roles are often coupled together and entrusted to one person.
Frequently, the product planner and sales engineer roles are combined into one position, in which the person is charged with doing product demonstrations and providing presale support because he/she is also defining the product and thus has more expertise and in-depth product knowledge than the average salesperson.
Another possibility is the product marketer and marcom manager combination: one individual does all tasks that upper management may perceive as "marketing." This usually consists of actual market planning, writing copy and managing advertising.
A prevalent situation in high-tech industries, such as the software development industry, is the combining of the product marketer and product planner roles. Corporate job descriptions for open positions that prefer candidates with a technical undergraduate degree and an MBA with an emphasis in marketing are a clear indication that the company views the position as a combination of the two roles.
It does make sense, to a certain degree, to have these two roles cooperate with each other. Product success hinges on understanding customer behavior and the business aspects of the industry in order to build value into a product. Complementing that ability is in-depth product knowledge, which is used to plan marketing actions that deliver meaningful messages about the product.
The problem is that both of these roles (or capabilities) are strategic and demand expertise that can only be achieved by professional focus.
In addition, people come from different educational or professional backgrounds and therefore naturally gravitate toward their "comfort zone," eventually causing one of two roles to receive more attention than the other. Underperforming, or in the worst case, not performing some of the product management team roles, may dramatically impede the product's chances of marketplace success.
Roles and Activities
Any of the various couplings of roles, outlined above, can create workflow obstacles for the following reasons, which are conceptual.
Having one person simultaneously perform both strategic and tactical roles and activities, such as with the product marketer and marcom manager combination, is highly inefficient because tactical activities will always monopolize the person's time, and they will demand increasingly more effort.
On the other hand, having one individual perform two strategic roles, as with the product marketer and product planner combination, can be equally debilitating since each role demands an acute learning curve and full devotion.
Admittedly, the joining of roles is justifiable under various circumstances�such as budget limitations, personnel quotas, company or department formulation, and product complexity. However, role coupling should always be regarded as a temporary or evolutionary measure�not as a permanent arrangement.
The Solution
Product management is a domain that encompasses various disciplines. Accordingly, it is extremely difficult, often impossible, to specialize in and excel at all the tasks that product management entails, because the attempt often results in a lack of professional focus.
Adding to the situational difficulty is the product manager's expansive job description, which leads to being assigned various tactical activities, often simply because others do not want to do them. Tactical activities significantly impair the product manager's ability to perform crucial strategic tasks.
In some companies, the product marketing manager and product manager are interchangeable titles as they both relate to the same function and individual. This inconsistency further causes functional problems within companies and across industries.
This problematic reality is not planned and is seldom the result of malicious intent. It is just that some companies believe in the laissez-faire approach, with internal politics and forces shaping corporate processes, responsibilities and even organizational structure.
There is some advantage to having role ambiguity, because it allows individuals to be proactive and define their role as they want it to be. People can work within the ambiguity and chart their way to a desired job description. Unfortunately, more often than not, the fast-paced world of high-tech is not supportive of this approach because there is just too much inherent ambiguity or variance associated with the title of product manager.
Therefore, the solution is to abolish the title product manager from the corporate lexicon and use the clearer, more understandable and uniform titles of product planner and product marketer. And, accordingly, a different organizational approach would be required:   Under the charge of the vice-president or director of product management would be the corporate product management department that holds product management teams. Each team, whether real or virtual, holds four roles (as described in the product management team model), with the intent of having these roles eventually assigned to four individuals.  Tactical activities and logistics formerly imposed on the product manager now go to the program manager or release manager, thus relieving those in product management from the tactical overload they routinely experience.  The program manager, a role outside Product Management, is essentially the project manager for the entire product delivery project and is tasked with applying a suitable product delivery process that ensures deliverables from all contributing corporate functions.  The release manager, also a role outside Product Management, is responsible for handling all logistical and operational matters that pertain to the delivery of the product. 
Properly defining and structuring the roles and responsibilities of the product management team would enable the team members to be more efficient and productive. The result? Better products, better marketing and higher revenues.
In Closing
Product management is a domain, not a role, and it changes and evolves with the organization. It is a multifaceted and multi-disciplined domain; therefore, there will always be some ambiguity involved, but it can be significantly mitigated by applying a proper product management team concept and structure, with well-defined roles and responsibilities. Doing so is crucial�whether the company is building or rebuilding the corporate product management function.
As a result of the team restructuring and the redefinition of roles, the newly attained occupational focus helps build professional expertise.
The product planner can now devote time and effort to excel as a market expert and problem-teller whose role is to perform customer advocacy better than everyone else in the company, while backing assertions with quantitative market/customer data.
The product marketer is now focused on becoming a process expert, perfecting corporate competency in using tools and executing techniques, processes and tasks; that promotes winning products in the marketplace.
All this decreases departmental rivalry and allows the engineers to develop their professional expertise as technology experts and problem solvers.
Doing the right things and doing things right, especially in the early stages of company inception, will help those in product management to professionally grow and contribute fully according to their potential. Undoubtedly, companies will also benefit because members of the product management team would be able to generate long-term value for their company by focusing more on strategy formulation.
The final inference is that those involved in product management must be provided with clear job descriptions (roles, responsibilities and goals) as well as focused goals and objectives. All talk and effort can prove quite futile without this basic premise.

A simple, easy to use and setup project management with asp and ms access.



ASP Project
Download Full Source for ASP Project
A very simple online project management tool. I was looking for an easy way to keep track of things I was working on, everything else was way over complicated. I quickly created this simple task management solution with ASP and MS Access.
Copy all the files to your web server. The database path is set using the mappath statement, so if you would like to place your database in a different place, then edit line 55 in common.asp.
from: 
dbPath = Server.MapPath("projectdb.mdb")
to your path (example):
dbPath = "C:\inetpub\data\projectdb.mdb"
Once setup, the defaut login is "admin", with a password of "1234".

You will see the project list, each heading is sortable desc or asc by clicking on the title, easily change the order of the projects by changing the number and clicking "update order", this will loop through each project and update the sort value. Sample code below.
trFormList = Request.Form("projorder")
strIDList = request.form("id")
if strFormList = "" then
    Response.Write "<p>Error</p>"
    response.redirect("projects.asp?order=error")
Else

    'on Error resume next
    FormList = split(strFormList, ",")
    IDList = split(strIDList, ",")

    For iLoop = LBound(FormList) to UBound(FormList)

        pageorder = Trim(FormList(iLoop))
        'make sure value is a number
            if not IsNumeric(pageorder) then
            pageorder = "1"
            end if

        id = Trim(IDList(iLoop))
            'make sure value is a number
            if not IsNumeric(id) then
            response.write "<p>Error, not a valid number</p>"
            response.end
            end if

        if pageorder > 0 then
        set Conn = server.createobject("adodb.connection")
        Conn.Open "PROVIDER=MICROSOFT.JET.OLEDB.4.0;DATA SOURCE=" & dbPath
        mySQL = "UPDATE tblproj SET projorder = " & pageorder & " WHERE ID = " & ID & ";"
        conn.execute(mySQL)
        end if

    Next

end if
Simply click on the project name to view and edit the project details

Categories and status values can be edited easily to match your needs.



Users can also me added and changed as needed.

That's it, nothing fancy, but if you need a quick and simple way to keep track of tasks/projects, then give it a try.

Oldies but goodies

Very straight forward. It's a good alternative from our Jumptree ASP.NET project management If it can be implemented in .NET, then we can really do a simpler version of our software but open source community.

Hi aa2max,

I was after a easy to use web based project management system that would allow people to track project's history and found your application which would suit my requirements perfectly. I would be implementing the application in a commercial environment and would be applying a few changes and additions to it to suit our specific requirements and was wondering if you agree for me to use your application? I will acknowledge that the application was developed and is owned by you and I'm happy to include any copyright statement you might have in the source code. I also understand that you cannot and will not provide any guarantees relating to the application.

This is a great application.

Thanks.

Francois

Auth Error

aa2max,

Nice program.  I'm not strong on ASP, but do OK in the access department.  My question:
I get this error when attempting to login admin/1234.

Provider error '80040e4d' 
Authentication failed. 
/ProjectM/login_action.asp, line 22 

I changed the common.asp to include:
Dim db_path
Dim db_dir
db_dir = Server.MapPath("access_db")
db_path = db_dir & "\projectdb.mdb"

Am I missing something..

Thanks,
Chas2002

Good outline for taskmanager 
Nic Roche19-Apr-05  19:02
Nic Roche19-Apr-05  19:02 










Thanks for sharing your insights. As the projects cant be drilled into the app is probably better suited as a Task Manager than a Project Manager.

Just add change Project to Task and add Resources/Projects/Areas...

Yes, you are right. As of now it really is a task manager, I am planning to add "tasks" to a project in the near future which will help it evolve into more of a project manager that I would like it to be.

Depends entirely on the company.  Microsoft, for instance, has its own rather unusual definitions:

Program Manager = one of the members of the core technical staff (alongside developers and testers).  Typically responsible for designing & specifying features, planning release cycles, triaging bugs, presenting at technical conferences, managing compliance with technical regulations (internal & governmental), connecting with online communities, and more.
Product Manager = basically a synonym for "marketing suit."  They design the product's ad campaigns, sales website, and related swag.  More generally, they define the "message" that they hope people (mainstream media, word-of-mouth, and everything in between) will associate with each release.  

Both positions gather a lot of data about where the market is heading -- Program Managers from their relationship with the technical community, Product Managers from their industry & media contacts -- but the ultimate decisions about what to build are made by someone higher in the chain.  (not the nitty gritty, of course; Program Managers & UX designers are the experts at specifying the details.  thinking more of "vision" / "value props" that individual product subunits then go "align" themselves toward)

The difference is usually that the program manager handles the whole series of related products, their schedules, budgets, etc, and the product manager handles just the internals of a particular product such as scheduling of individual components and dividing team tasks, as well as leading the particular product team.
Usually, product managers report to the program manager, and the program manager has the final say on budgeting for each product team and the scheduling. The product manager then takes the resources he or she has and divides them amongst the team, coordinating the team's efforts.

AIPMM and PMI, two professional organizations in these fields, have both defined unique knowledge areas (KA) associated with their professions that can answer this question.  Both product and program managers must master their unique KAs and manage the activities and deliverables associated with them in order to successfully complete their products or programs.
PMI has defined 9 unique project management KAs required to manage projects and programs.  They are: Integration, Scope, Time, Cost, Quality, Resources, Communication, Risk and Procurement.  Programs are collections of related projects but still require mastery of the 9 unique project management KAs.
AIPMM has defined 6 unique product management KAs as part of a universal, cross-industry Product Management Framework (PMF) required to manage products.  They are: Customer, Strategy, Product, Market, Business, and Program. The Program KA involves the management those cross-functional projects required to bring products to market.  (and very often the Program Manager is a member of the cross functional product management core team).
Hopefully this explanation has introduced some clarity and consistency into the discussion.  For more information on the AIPMM unique KAs and the PMF, go to the www.AIPMM.com web site and download the APMF whitepaper.

I vote for you...the answer is already accepted. Our industry is full of vague job titles, and PMI AIPMM are just trying to solve that mire the title soup. there is a very clear difference between a product manager and a program manager. and that is certainly not reflected by the accepted answer.

My trick is to change "manager" to expert and see how the titles work. So a product manager becomes a product expert; a project manager is a project expert. See "managers as experts" at http://www.pragmaticmarketing.com/publications/topics/06/0603sj
A product manager ensure product profitability by finding and quantifying market problems. He or she defines the business, technical, and marketing artifacts to move an idea to the market and to profitably revenue.

They're different. But definitions will vary between companies.
Generally a product manager has ownership for a specific product. He or she is responsible for working with the customers, sales people, engineers and sr management to figure out what is the best product to be created, determining the time schedule, features, etc.
The program manager is often more of a support person, keeping all the wheels turning, especially working with specialized groups such as manufacturing.
In other firms, the program manager is senior to the product managers, with responsibility across a series of products.

At a former employee of mine that did both defense contracting and product development, program managers and product managers had a peer relationship on the organizational chart and were both subclasses of "project manager". 

Program managers were project managers that managed the projects associated with on-going government programs with which we either had direct contracts or were working as subcontractors under another organization.  A large enough program could have multiple project managers working under the direction of a program manager.
Product managers were project managers that managed work associated with product development -- this included the "product owner" role associated with Scrum.

Product managers are the voice of the customer and are accountable to two things: profit & loss of a product or product line and positioning. Product managers are a horizontal role and work as mini-CEO for their product. 
Since a product is "what people think you sell," product managers generally have influence over anything that impacts that idea from customer experience to technical definition. 
Program managers are project managers that are responsible for several projects related to a specific initiative.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

The LegalZoom 3-step process was developed by attorneys from some of the most prestigious law firms in America. There are no complex instructions to follow and nothing to download or print. Simply answer a few questions and get started on
              setting up your corporation.

Here's how it works:

Complete the Incorporation Questionnaire
						Complete our simple questionnaire. With LegalZoom, you can choose to form a new corporation or incorporate an existing business. You can also select provisions to help you guard against personal liability.
We Create and File Your Incorporation Papers
						We create and file the Articles of Incorporation (or, in some states, the "Certificate of Formation" or "Certificate of Incorporation") with the Secretary of State (or in some states, the "Department of State" or "Corporation Commission"). We even create company-specific bylaws and organizational minutes.
Final Wrap-Up
						When we receive your filed Articles of Incorporation back from the state, we send them to you along with the rest of your formation documents, as well as easy instructions regarding next steps.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
