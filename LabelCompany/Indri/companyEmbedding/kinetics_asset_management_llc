Disclosure
The Paradigm Fund is classified as a non-diversified fund. Therefore, the value of its shares may fluctuate more than shares invested in a broader range of industries. You should consult the Fund’s prospectus for a complete list of risks associated with your investment.
You should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund carefully before investing.  For a free copy of the fund’s prospectus, which contains this and other information, you may click here or call us at 1-800-930-3828.  You should read the prospectus carefully before you invest.
S&P 500 Index statistics data is based on the iShares S&P 500 Index Fund for market cap, price to book, price to earnings, return on equity, and active share. iShares is a product of BlackRock, Inc.
The MSCI ACWI (All Country World Index) Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is designed to measure the equity market performance of developed and emerging markets. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index represents an unmanaged, broad-based basket of stocks. It is typically used as a proxy for overall market performance. The S&P 500 Index returns assume that dividends are reinvested. An investor cannot invest directly in an index.
The Growth of $10,000 chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in No Load Class shares commencement of operations (12/31/99). It assumes reinvestment of capital gains and dividends. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance.
Holdings are expressed as a percentage of total net investments and may vary over time. Equity holdings are subject to change, and may not be indicative of actual market position due to the use of call and put options.
The Top 10 Sectors displayed represent a percentage of the net assets and excludes cash equivalents and other assets in excess of liabilities.
Assets represent the total net assets for the specified portfolio, which includes all fund classes.
Gross expense ratio listed for No-Load Class, Advisor Class A, Advisor Class C and Institutional Class are referenced in the April 30, 2016 respective prospectus.
The Fund’s adviser, Kinetics Asset Management LLC, has voluntarily agreed to waive management fees and reimburse fund expenses so that net annual fund operating expenses of the No Load Class do not exceed certain levels through May 1, 2017 and may be discontinued at any time by the Fund’s adviser after May 1, 2017.
Definitions:
Beta: A statistic that measures the volatility of the fund, as compared to the overall market. The market’s beta is set at 1.00; therefore a beta higher than 1.00 is considered to be more volatile than the market, while a beta lower than 1.00 is considered to be less volatile. It is important to note that a low beta for a fund does not necessarily imply that the fund has a low level of volatility, a low beta signifies only that the fund’s market-related risk is low.  The Beta has been calculated since inception.
Standard Deviation: A statistical measure of portfolio risk used to measure variability of total return around an average, over a specified period of time. The greater the standard deviation over the period, the wider the variability or range of returns and hence, the greater the fund’s volatility. The standard deviation has been calculated since inception.
Up Market Capture Ratio: A statistical measure of an investment manager’s overall performance in up-markets. The up-market capture ratio is used to evaluate how well an investment manager performed relative to an index during periods when that index has risen. The up-market capture ratio has been calculated since inception.
Down Market Capture Ratio: A statistical measure of an investment manager’s overall performance in down-markets. The down-market capture ratio is used to evaluate how well or poorly an investment manager performed relative to an index during periods when that index has dropped. The down-market capture ratio has been calculated since inception.
Sharpe Ratio: A statistical measure that uses standard deviation and excess return to determine reward per unit of risk. A higher Sharpe ratio implies a better historical risk-adjusted performance. The Sharpe ratio has been calculated since inception using the 3-month treasury bill for the risk-free rate of return.
Weighted Avg. Mkt. Cap: The mean market capitalization (value of outstanding shares) of a basket of stocks, taking into account the relative weight of each investment.
Median Market Capitalization: The median market capitalization (value of outstanding shares) of a basket of stocks.
Price to Book Ratio: The harmonic weighted average of the price/book (P/B) ratios of the equity securities referenced. The ratio calculated by dividing the current price of the stock by the company’s book value per share (assets minus liabilities).
Price to Earnings Ratio: The harmonic weighted average of the price/earnings (P/E) ratios of the equity securities referenced. The P/E ratio is calculated by dividing the current price of the stock by the trailing one year earnings.
Return on Equity: The amount of net income returned as a percentage of shareholders equity. Return on equity measures a corporation’s profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested.
Turnover Ratio: A measure of how frequently assets within a fund are bought and sold by the managers represented over a one year period.
Active share: A measure of the percentage of holdings in a portfolio that differ from a benchmark index.  It is calculated by taking the sum of the differences of the weight of each holding in the portfolio and the weight of each holding in the benchmark index and dividing by two. Active Share Ratio: Active share is measured against the iShares S&P 500 ETF.

Disclosure
The Medical Fund is classified as a non-diversified fund. Therefore, the value of its shares may fluctuate more than shares invested in a broader range of industries. You should consult the Fund’s prospectus for a complete list of risks associated with your investment.
You should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund carefully before investing.  For a free copy of the fund’s prospectus, which contains this and other information, you may click here or call us at 1-800-930-3828.  You should read the prospectus carefully before you invest.
S&P 500 Index statistics data is based on the iShares S&P 500 Index Fund for market cap, price to book, price to earnings, return on equity, and active share. iShares is a product of BlackRock, Inc.
The NASDAQ Composite (NASDAQ) and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500) each represent an unmanaged, broad-based basket of stocks. They are typically used as a proxy for overall market performance. NASDAQ Composite returns stated above do NOT include reinvested dividends, while the S&P 500 Index returns assume that dividends are reinvested. An investor cannot invest directly in an index.
The Growth of $10,000 chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in No Load Class shares commencement of operations (9/30/99). It assumes reinvestment of capital gains and dividends. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance.
Holdings are expressed as a percentage of total net investments and may vary over time. Equity holdings are subject to change, and may not be indicative of actual market position due to the use of call and put options.
The Top Industries displayed represent a percentage of the net assets and excludes cash equivalents and other assets in excess of liabilities.
Assets represent the total net assets for the specified portfolio, which includes all fund classes.
Gross expense ratio listed for No-Load Class, Advisor Class A and Advisor Class C Class are referenced in the April 30, 2016 respective prospectus.
The Fund’s adviser, Kinetics Asset Management LLC, has voluntarily agreed to waive management fees and reimburse fund expenses so that net annual fund operating expenses of the No Load Class do not exceed certain levels through May 1, 2017 and may be discontinued at any time by the Fund’s adviser after May 1, 2017.
Definitions:
Beta: A statistic that measures the volatility of the fund, as compared to the overall market. The market’s beta is set at 1.00; therefore a beta higher than 1.00 is considered to be more volatile than the market, while a beta lower than 1.00 is considered to be less volatile. It is important to note that a low beta for a fund does not necessarily imply that the fund has a low level of volatility, a low beta signifies only that the fund’s market-related risk is low.  The Beta has been calculated since inception.
Standard Deviation: A statistical measure of portfolio risk used to measure variability of total return around an average, over a specified period of time. The greater the standard deviation over the period, the wider the variability or range of returns and hence, the greater the fund’s volatility. The standard deviation has been calculated since inception.
Up Market Capture Ratio: A statistical measure of an investment manager’s overall performance in up-markets. The up-market capture ratio is used to evaluate how well an investment manager performed relative to an index during periods when that index has risen. The up-market capture ratio has been calculated since inception.
Down Market Capture Ratio: A statistical measure of an investment manager’s overall performance in down-markets. The down-market capture ratio is used to evaluate how well or poorly an investment manager performed relative to an index during periods when that index has dropped. The down-market capture ratio has been calculated since inception.
Sharpe Ratio: A statistical measure that uses standard deviation and excess return to determine reward per unit of risk. A higher Sharpe ratio implies a better historical risk-adjusted performance. The Sharpe ratio has been calculated since inception using the 3-month treasury bill for the risk-free rate of return.
Weighted Avg. Mkt. Cap: The mean market capitalization (value of outstanding shares) of a basket of stocks, taking into account the relative weight of each investment.
Median Market Capitalization: The median market capitalization (value of outstanding shares) of a basket of stocks.
Price to Book Ratio: The harmonic weighted average of the price/book (P/B) ratios of the equity securities referenced. The ratio calculated by dividing the current price of the stock by the company’s book value per share (assets minus liabilities).
Price to Earnings Ratio: The harmonic weighted average of the price/earnings (P/E) ratios of the equity securities referenced. The P/E ratio is calculated by dividing the current price of the stock by the trailing one year earnings.
Return on Equity: The amount of net income returned as a percentage of shareholders equity. Return on equity measures a corporation’s profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested.
Turnover Ratio: A measure of how frequently assets within a fund are bought and sold by the managers represented over a one year period.
Active share: A measure of the percentage of holdings in a portfolio that differ from a benchmark index. It is calculated by taking the sum of the differences of the weight of each holding in the portfolio and the weight of each holding in the benchmark index and dividing by two. Active Share Ratio: Active share is measured against the iShares S&P 500 ETF.
