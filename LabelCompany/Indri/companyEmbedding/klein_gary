                            BOSS Gary Klein’s ORIGINAL                                            










This is what started it all the original flipping jig. Own your own piece of history!! This is the jig that Gary Klein designed more than 30 years ago. Many anglers have said that this design changed everything! -The oval shaped head design in the closed mouth of a bass almost always creates up right hook rotation during the exit. Which leads to a higher percent of hook ups in the upper part of the mouth. -The flat eye allowed Gary to create a perfect smooth transition from the line, to the knot, to the bottom side of the jig. This design made a jig that an angler could fish in the heaviest of cover. Sizes 1/4 oz. 4/0 hook, 3/8 oz. 4/0 hook, 1/2 oz. 4/0 hook, and 5/8 oz. 5/0 hook.  Mustad heavy wire ultra-point hooks. 4 per pack.

                            BOSS Gary Klein’s Heavy Cover                                            










1. Recessed line tie  2. Smooth transition from line to bottom side of jig.  3. Head design that will upright itself on hook set.   4. My personal round bend needle point hook design.   5. Painted with the highest quality paint.  6. Top grade weed guard All jigs are not created equal. In fact most anglers do not realize just how versatile they really are! Lets take a look at my GK Flip Jig. This jig was designed to be fished with a flipping stick using heavy line in thick cover. If you look at the jig head you will notice the weight being distributed behind the eye of the hook. The recessed line tie allows the jig to be fished in heavy cover with out getting hung up. The jig’s head design creates an upright rotation upon hook set. This leads to a high percentage of hook ups in the upper part of the fish’s mouth. The hook that is used in this jig is my personal round bend needle point 5/0 hook design. This hook is only available in the BOSS Jig Line. I have put a lot of time into designing this jig and hope it improves your day on the water!  Gary Klein

Gary Klein (producer) - Wikipedia





















 






Gary Klein (producer)

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

This article is about the producer. For other people of the same name, see Gary Klein (disambiguation).
Gary Klein (born September 28, 1942 in Brooklyn, New York) is an American songwriter and Grammy nominated record producer. He graduated from Long Island University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Music.
In the era which included classic rock, pop, punk, disco, country, record producer Gary Klein was well known for working across genres and often crossing over genres such as country music legends Dolly Party and Glen Campbell with "Here You Come Again" and "Southern Nights," arguably the beginnings of country music being accepted by mainstream pop audiences.
In 1962, he co-wrote the pop hit song "Bobby’s Girl".[1] While continuing songwriting, Klein became more interested in producing records.
In 1968, Klein produced Tim Hardin 3 Live in Concert. In 1969, Klein produced the Hardin album Suite for Susan Moore and Damion: We Are One, One, All in One.
In 1974, Mac Davis, while working on a new album wrote the song "Stop and Smell the Roses". This was a phrase Doc Severinsen had mentioned to Davis who co-credited Doc as writer of the song. However, the song was not proving an easy recording and as a young record producer Klein was asked by Columbia if he'd like to give it a shot at recording the song. Thus, the song was produced by two producers. Ultimately the Klein version won out. It went to #1 on Billboard Magazine's Adult Contemporary charts and was a top 10 pop hit.
In 1975, Klein recorded Johnny Cash's album John R. Cash. In an attempt to try something new and revive his career the "Columbia bosses" wanted Cash to record other people's material, covers. It did not prove successful. Cash later blamed it on the "bosses," finding no fault in the production. He mentioned he'd work again with Klein down the line.
In 1976-1977, Klein began working with Glen Campbell. This resulted in the pop and country #1 hit "Southern Nights". Upon Campbell's crossover to the pop charts, Dolly Parton and RCA Records wondered if he could do the same for her.
In 1977, Klein produced Dolly Parton's classic pop hit album Here You Come Again. It was the first of three albums he'd produce for Parton resulting in country and pop hit records.
In 1976, Barbra Streisand had just won an Academy Award for her song "Evergreen". Klein began working with Streisand in 1977 on Streisand Superman. "My Heart Belongs to Me" hit #1 on the Adult Contemporary charts and #4 on Billboard's top 100.
In 1978, Streisand's Songbird album was released. It proved another double platinum album and at this point, Streisand was doing an album a year with Klein.
In 1979-80 Klein produced Streisand's Wet album. This included the #1 single "Enough is Enough", a smash-hit duet with Donna Summer, which in its own way was the end of the disco era. Gary Klein is the only record producer to work on more than one album with Barbra Streisand (three).

The following are some of the artists Klein was credited as a producer, composer, or writer:
Barbra Streisand ("Streisand Superman" "Enough is Enough" w/Donna Summer, "Songbird," "Wet")

Description


Additional information



Product Description
The Gary Klein Creature series Swim Jig is designed to swim around boat docks, emergent weed beds such as water willows, and anytime bass are feeding near the surface. The head design allows the jig to be worked in a swimming motion by holding the rod high and making quick short hops with the rod tip. Gary has selected his favorite colors in the Boss Creature Skirt and paired them with a matching painted head.

Parent
Trek Bicycle Corporation


Klein Bikes was a bicycle company founded by Gary Klein that pioneered the use of large diameter aluminium alloy tubes for greater stiffness and lower weight.
Klein produced his first bicycle frames while a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the 1970s, and full production runs of frames began in the 1980s. In 1995 the company was purchased by the Trek Bicycle Corporation, and the original Klein factory at Chehalis, Washington, closed in 2002 as production moved to the Trek headquarters at Waterloo, Wisconsin. Widespread distribution in the United States stopped in 2007, and ceased altogether in the rest of the world in 2009.

Gary Klein, born (1952-06-09) June 9, 1952 (age 65), attended the University of California at Davis before transferring to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).[1][2] During the Independent Activities Period in 1973, a group of students including Klein worked together under Professor Buckley to produce an aluminum framed bicycle.[3] After analyzing a number of contemporary steel frames, and examining ones that had broken in use, they were able to determine the stresses placed on a bicycle frame.[3] Faced with limited available types of aluminum alloy tubing, the students chose to construct frames from 6061 aluminium alloy seamless drawn tube; alternatives such as the stronger 7075 aluminum alloy were discarded because of the tubing dimensions.[3]
After graduating from MIT in 1974 with a degree in chemical engineering, Klein took a business course for entrepreneurs.[4] As a keen road racer, in 1975, he started a business project with three other people and built a limited run of aluminum alloy framed bikes at the MIT Innovation Center, using a US$20,000 grant provided by MIT and US$1,000 of capital from each partner.[1][2] The prototypes, with larger diameter tubes and thinner walls than those produced in 1973, were displayed at the International cycle show in New York in February 1975.[3]

The next year, he relocated to some disused buildings on his parents' farm in San Martin, California, that had previously been used for dehydrating prunes.[3][4] In 1977, he patented use of large diameter aluminum alloy tubes to increase stiffness,[5] and in 1980, he moved from San Jose, California, to Chehalis, Washington.[4][6] He started production runs of road bicycles in the early 1980s and mountain bikes in the mid 1980s.[3]
While Klein's use of aluminium for a bicycle frames was not entirely novel, his use of large diameter tubes was.[1][4][note 1] Aluminium alloys have a Young's modulus around a third that of steel, but with thicker tubes he was able to make a bicycle that weighed around 15% less than a conventional model.[1][7]
In 1995, Trek bought Klein bikes, after Klein found it hard to compete without the sales network of a larger company in place.[6][8][9]
At its peak, around 250 people worked at the Chehalis plant, but operation gradually moved to the main Trek factory in Wisconsin.[8] In 2001, a workforce of around 70 people produced 15,000 to 20,000 frames a year.[6] In 2002, all production moved to the Trek headquarters at Waterloo, Wisconsin.[10] Bikes were still sold under the Klein name until around 2009 in Japan, but widespread distribution ceased circa 2007 in the United States.[8][11]

Some off-road models featured two designs of one-piece welded stem-bar combination, marketed as "Mission Control" (MC), that eliminated clamping bolts and excess material.[13] The original version, MC1, used a quill stem and required a 1 inch (25 mm) threaded steerer.[14] MC2 used a locknut tightening against a collet that sat between the fork steerer and the stem, and a special eight pointed wrench was required to remove it.[13][15] The steerer had to be cut to the correct length in order to adjust the height of the stem.[13] MC3 was a third version that was only the stem, thus the handlebar was not welded.[13]
Klein held a patent (US 5433465 ) for an improved method of routing cables through the frame of a bicycle, that reduced aerodynamic drag and stress on the frame.[2][note 2] The front and rear derailleur cables were routed through the down tube, and the rear brake cable through the top tube, although some models changed in 2002 to top tube cable routing for greater harmonisation with Shimano components.[2][13]
In the 2002 model year, Klein replaced 6061 aluminium alloy with a new alloy called ZR 9000, that used zirconium in place of chromium; the new alloy had not been assigned an industry number and it was named after the unused 9000 series.[2][16][17] Advertised improvements included a 190 grams (6.7 oz) decrease in weight per frame and a fatigue life five times longer than the 2001 model year frames.[2]
Techniques[edit]
Klein bicycles were famous for their paintwork, and offered a large number of custom colours and patterns.[13][18] The paint used was a Durethane enamel non-metallic paint that cost up to US$1,800 per gallon.[13] The Klein logo was debossed into the frame by painting the frame in the colour of the logo, then applying a mask and painting the pattern.[13]
Beginning with the MC2 frames, Klein used "Gradient tubing", where the wall thickness varied along the length and diameter of the tube.[2][13] Highly manipulated chainstays on mountain bikes allowed a tighter rear triangle to accommodate large off-road tyres, and facilitated efficient transfer of power.[19]
Welded aluminium needed heat treating to restore strength lost in welding.[2] After the treatment, frames were required to be aligned to within 0.004 inches (0.10 mm) on all alignment surfaces, and were then machined to within 0.0002 inches (0.0051 mm).[2]
Models[edit]
Klein produced both mountain bikes and road bikes.[20]

Klein Bikes was a bicycle company founded by Gary Klein that pioneered the use of large diameter aluminium alloy tubes for greater stiffness and lower weight.
Klein produced his first bicycle frames while a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the 1970s, and full production runs of frames began in the 1980s. In 1995 the company was purchased by the Trek Bicycle Corporation, and the original Klein factory at Chehalis, Washington, closed in 2002 as production moved to the Trek headquarters at Waterloo, Wisconsin. Widespread distribution in the United States stopped in 2007, and ceased altogether in the rest of the world in 2009.

Gary Klein, born (1952-06-09) June 9, 1952 (age 65), attended the University of California at Davis before transferring to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).[1][2] During the Independent Activities Period in 1973, a group of students including Klein worked together under Professor Buckley to produce an aluminum framed bicycle.[3] After analyzing a number of contemporary steel frames, and examining ones that had broken in use, they were able to determine the stresses placed on a bicycle frame.[3] Faced with limited available types of aluminum alloy tubing, the students chose to construct frames from 6061 aluminium alloy seamless drawn tube; alternatives such as the stronger 7075 aluminum alloy were discarded because of the tubing dimensions.[3]

Parent
Trek Bicycle Corporation


Klein Bikes was a bicycle company founded by Gary Klein that pioneered the use of large diameter aluminium alloy tubes for greater stiffness and lower weight.
Klein produced his first bicycle frames while a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the 1970s, and full production runs of frames began in the 1980s. In 1995 the company was purchased by the Trek Bicycle Corporation, and the original Klein factory at Chehalis, Washington, closed in 2002 as production moved to the Trek headquarters at Waterloo, Wisconsin. Widespread distribution in the United States stopped in 2007, and ceased altogether in the rest of the world in 2009.

History[edit]




Seat tube badge on a Klein Quantum


Gary Klein, born (1952-06-09) June 9, 1952 (age 65), attended the University of California at Davis before transferring to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).[1][2] During the Independent Activities Period in 1973, a group of students including Klein worked together under Professor Buckley to produce an aluminum framed bicycle.[3] After analyzing a number of contemporary steel frames, and examining ones that had broken in use, they were able to determine the stresses placed on a bicycle frame.[3] Faced with limited available types of aluminum alloy tubing, the students chose to construct frames from 6061 aluminium alloy seamless drawn tube; alternatives such as the stronger 7075 aluminum alloy were discarded because of the tubing dimensions.[3]
After graduating from MIT in 1974 with a degree in chemical engineering, Klein took a business course for entrepreneurs.[4] As a keen road racer, in 1975, he started a business project with three other people and built a limited run of aluminum alloy framed bikes at the MIT Innovation Center, using a US$20,000 grant provided by MIT and US$1,000 of capital from each partner.[1][2] The prototypes, with larger diameter tubes and thinner walls than those produced in 1973, were displayed at the International cycle show in New York in February 1975.[3]

The next year, he relocated to some disused buildings on his parents' farm in San Martin, California, that had previously been used for dehydrating prunes.[3][4] In 1977, he patented use of large diameter aluminum alloy tubes to increase stiffness,[5] and in 1980, he moved from San Jose, California, to Chehalis, Washington.[4][6] He started production runs of road bicycles in the early 1980s and mountain bikes in the mid 1980s.[3]
While Klein's use of aluminium for a bicycle frames was not entirely novel, his use of large diameter tubes was.[1][4][note 1] Aluminium alloys have a Young's modulus around a third that of steel, but with thicker tubes he was able to make a bicycle that weighed around 15% less than a conventional model.[1][7]
In 1995, Trek bought Klein bikes, after Klein found it hard to compete without the sales network of a larger company in place.[6][8][9]
At its peak, around 250 people worked at the Chehalis plant, but operation gradually moved to the main Trek factory in Wisconsin.[8] In 2001, a workforce of around 70 people produced 15,000 to 20,000 frames a year.[6] In 2002, all production moved to the Trek headquarters at Waterloo, Wisconsin.[10] Bikes were still sold under the Klein name until around 2009 in Japan, but widespread distribution ceased circa 2007 in the United States.[8][11]
A green Klein mountain bike can be seen hanging on the wall in Jerry Seinfeld's apartment in the television show Seinfeld.[12]
Innovations[edit]

Some off-road models featured two designs of one-piece welded stem-bar combination, marketed as "Mission Control" (MC), that eliminated clamping bolts and excess material.[13] The original version, MC1, used a quill stem and required a 1 inch (25 mm) threaded steerer.[14] MC2 used a locknut tightening against a collet that sat between the fork steerer and the stem, and a special eight pointed wrench was required to remove it.[13][15] The steerer had to be cut to the correct length in order to adjust the height of the stem.[13] MC3 was a third version that was only the stem, thus the handlebar was not welded.[13]
Klein held a patent (US 5433465 ) for an improved method of routing cables through the frame of a bicycle, that reduced aerodynamic drag and stress on the frame.[2][note 2] The front and rear derailleur cables were routed through the down tube, and the rear brake cable through the top tube, although some models changed in 2002 to top tube cable routing for greater harmonisation with Shimano components.[2][13]
In the 2002 model year, Klein replaced 6061 aluminium alloy with a new alloy called ZR 9000, that used zirconium in place of chromium; the new alloy had not been assigned an industry number and it was named after the unused 9000 series.[2][16][17] Advertised improvements included a 190 grams (6.7 oz) decrease in weight per frame and a fatigue life five times longer than the 2001 model year frames.[2]
Techniques[edit]
Klein bicycles were famous for their paintwork, and offered a large number of custom colours and patterns.[13][18] The paint used was a Durethane enamel non-metallic paint that cost up to US$1,800 per gallon.[13] The Klein logo was debossed into the frame by painting the frame in the colour of the logo, then applying a mask and painting the pattern.[13]
Beginning with the MC2 frames, Klein used "Gradient tubing", where the wall thickness varied along the length and diameter of the tube.[2][13] Highly manipulated chainstays on mountain bikes allowed a tighter rear triangle to accommodate large off-road tyres, and facilitated efficient transfer of power.[19]
Welded aluminium needed heat treating to restore strength lost in welding.[2] After the treatment, frames were required to be aligned to within 0.004 inches (0.10 mm) on all alignment surfaces, and were then machined to within 0.0002 inches (0.0051 mm).[2]
Models[edit]
Klein produced both mountain bikes and road bikes.[20]

Models are sourced from the official catalogue for that particular year. Years marked in red are incomplete due to a lack of reliable source information.

Sponsored teams[edit]
Klein made custom bikes for San Francisco's Lombardi team, which were ridden in 2001.[46] German cycling team Gerolsteiner rode Klein Quantum frames before 2003, when Gerolsteiner changed their bike sponsor to Wilier Triestina.[47][48] For the 2004 season, Klein sponsored the Jittery Joe's cycling team.[49]
Notes[edit]



^ Aluminum had been used previously in Monarch bicycles produced in the 1940s and by ALAN of Italy.[3]
^ Earlier patents for internal cables, such as US 4585246 , also exist, and the Klein patent specifically covers the entry and exit points of the cable.
^ The earlier Adept models were hardtails; in the 1992 catalog it is described as "multi-use."[21] The ones produced in 2001 and 2002 were full suspension mountain bikes.
^ The Agile was a modified Adept, with a drop bar for cyclocross use. Only a very small number (two or three) were ever made for Klein team racers.[22]
^ The earlier Karma produced in 1998 was a full suspension mountain bike, whereas the later ones were commuter bicycles.
^ Distinct from the Q-Pro Carbon
^ The Top Gun was renamed the Rascal after Paramount Pictures objected to the name, shared by the 1986 film Top Gun.[23]

Klein Bikes was a bicycle company founded by Gary Klein that pioneered the use of large diameter aluminium alloy tubes for greater stiffness and lower weight.
Klein produced his first bicycle frames while a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the 1970s, and full production runs of frames began in the 1980s. In 1995 the company was purchased by the Trek Bicycle Corporation, and the original Klein factory at Chehalis, Washington, closed in 2002 as production moved to the Trek headquarters at Waterloo, Wisconsin. Widespread distribution in the United States stopped in 2007, and ceased altogether in the rest of the world in 2009.

History[edit]




Seat tube badge on a Klein Quantum


Gary Klein, born (1952-06-09) June 9, 1952 (age 65), attended the University of California at Davis before transferring to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).[1][2] During the Independent Activities Period in 1973, a group of students including Klein worked together under Professor Buckley to produce an aluminum framed bicycle.[3] After analyzing a number of contemporary steel frames, and examining ones that had broken in use, they were able to determine the stresses placed on a bicycle frame.[3] Faced with limited available types of aluminum alloy tubing, the students chose to construct frames from 6061 aluminium alloy seamless drawn tube; alternatives such as the stronger 7075 aluminum alloy were discarded because of the tubing dimensions.[3]
After graduating from MIT in 1974 with a degree in chemical engineering, Klein took a business course for entrepreneurs.[4] As a keen road racer, in 1975, he started a business project with three other people and built a limited run of aluminum alloy framed bikes at the MIT Innovation Center, using a US$20,000 grant provided by MIT and US$1,000 of capital from each partner.[1][2] The prototypes, with larger diameter tubes and thinner walls than those produced in 1973, were displayed at the International cycle show in New York in February 1975.[3]

The next year, he relocated to some disused buildings on his parents' farm in San Martin, California, that had previously been used for dehydrating prunes.[3][4] In 1977, he patented use of large diameter aluminum alloy tubes to increase stiffness,[5] and in 1980, he moved from San Jose, California, to Chehalis, Washington.[4][6] He started production runs of road bicycles in the early 1980s and mountain bikes in the mid 1980s.[3]
While Klein's use of aluminium for a bicycle frames was not entirely novel, his use of large diameter tubes was.[1][4][note 1] Aluminium alloys have a Young's modulus around a third that of steel, but with thicker tubes he was able to make a bicycle that weighed around 15% less than a conventional model.[1][7]
In 1995, Trek bought Klein bikes, after Klein found it hard to compete without the sales network of a larger company in place.[6][8][9]
At its peak, around 250 people worked at the Chehalis plant, but operation gradually moved to the main Trek factory in Wisconsin.[8] In 2001, a workforce of around 70 people produced 15,000 to 20,000 frames a year.[6] In 2002, all production moved to the Trek headquarters at Waterloo, Wisconsin.[10] Bikes were still sold under the Klein name until around 2009 in Japan, but widespread distribution ceased circa 2007 in the United States.[8][11]

Innovations[edit]

Some off-road models featured two designs of one-piece welded stem-bar combination, marketed as "Mission Control" (MC), that eliminated clamping bolts and excess material.[13] The original version, MC1, used a quill stem and required a 1 inch (25 mm) threaded steerer.[14] MC2 used a locknut tightening against a collet that sat between the fork steerer and the stem, and a special eight pointed wrench was required to remove it.[13][15] The steerer had to be cut to the correct length in order to adjust the height of the stem.[13] MC3 was a third version that was only the stem, thus the handlebar was not welded.[13]
Klein held a patent (US 5433465 ) for an improved method of routing cables through the frame of a bicycle, that reduced aerodynamic drag and stress on the frame.[2][note 2] The front and rear derailleur cables were routed through the down tube, and the rear brake cable through the top tube, although some models changed in 2002 to top tube cable routing for greater harmonisation with Shimano components.[2][13]
In the 2002 model year, Klein replaced 6061 aluminium alloy with a new alloy called ZR 9000, that used zirconium in place of chromium; the new alloy had not been assigned an industry number and it was named after the unused 9000 series.[2][16][17] Advertised improvements included a 190 grams (6.7 oz) decrease in weight per frame and a fatigue life five times longer than the 2001 model year frames.[2]
Techniques[edit]
Klein bicycles were famous for their paintwork, and offered a large number of custom colours and patterns.[13][18] The paint used was a Durethane enamel non-metallic paint that cost up to US$1,800 per gallon.[13] The Klein logo was debossed into the frame by painting the frame in the colour of the logo, then applying a mask and painting the pattern.[13]
Beginning with the MC2 frames, Klein used "Gradient tubing", where the wall thickness varied along the length and diameter of the tube.[2][13] Highly manipulated chainstays on mountain bikes allowed a tighter rear triangle to accommodate large off-road tyres, and facilitated efficient transfer of power.[19]
Welded aluminium needed heat treating to restore strength lost in welding.[2] After the treatment, frames were required to be aligned to within 0.004 inches (0.10 mm) on all alignment surfaces, and were then machined to within 0.0002 inches (0.0051 mm).[2]
Models[edit]
Klein produced both mountain bikes and road bikes.[20]

Gary Klein, born (1952-06-09) June 9, 1952 (age 65), attended the University of California at Davis before transferring to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).[1][2] During the Independent Activities Period in 1973, a group of students including Klein worked together under Professor Buckley to produce an aluminum framed bicycle.[3] After analyzing a number of contemporary steel frames, and examining ones that had broken in use, they were able to determine the stresses placed on a bicycle frame.[3] Faced with limited available types of aluminum alloy tubing, the students chose to construct frames from 6061 aluminium alloy seamless drawn tube; alternatives such as the stronger 7075 aluminum alloy were discarded because of the tubing dimensions.[3]

Parent
Trek Bicycle Corporation


Klein Bikes was a bicycle company founded by Gary Klein that pioneered the use of large diameter aluminium alloy tubes for greater stiffness and lower weight.
Klein produced his first bicycle frames while a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the 1970s, and full production runs of frames began in the 1980s. In 1995 the company was purchased by the Trek Bicycle Corporation, and the original Klein factory at Chehalis, Washington, closed in 2002 as production moved to the Trek headquarters at Waterloo, Wisconsin. Widespread distribution in the United States stopped in 2007, and ceased altogether in the rest of the world in 2009.

History[edit]




Seat tube badge on a Klein Quantum


Gary Klein, born (1952-06-09) June 9, 1952 (age 65), attended the University of California at Davis before transferring to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).[1][2] During the Independent Activities Period in 1973, a group of students including Klein worked together under Professor Buckley to produce an aluminum framed bicycle.[3] After analyzing a number of contemporary steel frames, and examining ones that had broken in use, they were able to determine the stresses placed on a bicycle frame.[3] Faced with limited available types of aluminum alloy tubing, the students chose to construct frames from 6061 aluminium alloy seamless drawn tube; alternatives such as the stronger 7075 aluminum alloy were discarded because of the tubing dimensions.[3]
After graduating from MIT in 1974 with a degree in chemical engineering, Klein took a business course for entrepreneurs.[4] As a keen road racer, in 1975, he started a business project with three other people and built a limited run of aluminum alloy framed bikes at the MIT Innovation Center, using a US$20,000 grant provided by MIT and US$1,000 of capital from each partner.[1][2] The prototypes, with larger diameter tubes and thinner walls than those produced in 1973, were displayed at the International cycle show in New York in February 1975.[3]

The next year, he relocated to some disused buildings on his parents' farm in San Martin, California, that had previously been used for dehydrating prunes.[3][4] In 1977, he patented use of large diameter aluminum alloy tubes to increase stiffness,[5] and in 1980, he moved from San Jose, California, to Chehalis, Washington.[4][6] He started production runs of road bicycles in the early 1980s and mountain bikes in the mid 1980s.[3]
While Klein's use of aluminium for a bicycle frames was not entirely novel, his use of large diameter tubes was.[1][4][note 1] Aluminium alloys have a Young's modulus around a third that of steel, but with thicker tubes he was able to make a bicycle that weighed around 15% less than a conventional model.[1][7]
In 1995, Trek bought Klein bikes, after Klein found it hard to compete without the sales network of a larger company in place.[6][8][9]
At its peak, around 250 people worked at the Chehalis plant, but operation gradually moved to the main Trek factory in Wisconsin.[8] In 2001, a workforce of around 70 people produced 15,000 to 20,000 frames a year.[6] In 2002, all production moved to the Trek headquarters at Waterloo, Wisconsin.[10] Bikes were still sold under the Klein name until around 2009 in Japan, but widespread distribution ceased circa 2007 in the United States.[8][11]
A green Klein mountain bike can be seen hanging on the wall in Jerry Seinfeld's apartment in the television show Seinfeld.[12]
Innovations[edit]

Some off-road models featured two designs of one-piece welded stem-bar combination, marketed as "Mission Control" (MC), that eliminated clamping bolts and excess material.[13] The original version, MC1, used a quill stem and required a 1 inch (25 mm) threaded steerer.[14] MC2 used a locknut tightening against a collet that sat between the fork steerer and the stem, and a special eight pointed wrench was required to remove it.[13][15] The steerer had to be cut to the correct length in order to adjust the height of the stem.[13] MC3 was a third version that was only the stem, thus the handlebar was not welded.[13]
Klein held a patent (US 5433465 ) for an improved method of routing cables through the frame of a bicycle, that reduced aerodynamic drag and stress on the frame.[2][note 2] The front and rear derailleur cables were routed through the down tube, and the rear brake cable through the top tube, although some models changed in 2002 to top tube cable routing for greater harmonisation with Shimano components.[2][13]
In the 2002 model year, Klein replaced 6061 aluminium alloy with a new alloy called ZR 9000, that used zirconium in place of chromium; the new alloy had not been assigned an industry number and it was named after the unused 9000 series.[2][16][17] Advertised improvements included a 190 grams (6.7 oz) decrease in weight per frame and a fatigue life five times longer than the 2001 model year frames.[2]
Techniques[edit]
Klein bicycles were famous for their paintwork, and offered a large number of custom colours and patterns.[13][18] The paint used was a Durethane enamel non-metallic paint that cost up to US$1,800 per gallon.[13] The Klein logo was debossed into the frame by painting the frame in the colour of the logo, then applying a mask and painting the pattern.[13]
Beginning with the MC2 frames, Klein used "Gradient tubing", where the wall thickness varied along the length and diameter of the tube.[2][13] Highly manipulated chainstays on mountain bikes allowed a tighter rear triangle to accommodate large off-road tyres, and facilitated efficient transfer of power.[19]
Welded aluminium needed heat treating to restore strength lost in welding.[2] After the treatment, frames were required to be aligned to within 0.004 inches (0.10 mm) on all alignment surfaces, and were then machined to within 0.0002 inches (0.0051 mm).[2]
Models[edit]
Klein produced both mountain bikes and road bikes.[20]

Models are sourced from the official catalogue for that particular year. Years marked in red are incomplete due to a lack of reliable source information.

Sponsored teams[edit]
Klein made custom bikes for San Francisco's Lombardi team, which were ridden in 2001.[46] German cycling team Gerolsteiner rode Klein Quantum frames before 2003, when Gerolsteiner changed their bike sponsor to Wilier Triestina.[47][48] For the 2004 season, Klein sponsored the Jittery Joe's cycling team.[49]
Notes[edit]



^ Aluminum had been used previously in Monarch bicycles produced in the 1940s and by ALAN of Italy.[3]
^ Earlier patents for internal cables, such as US 4585246 , also exist, and the Klein patent specifically covers the entry and exit points of the cable.
^ The earlier Adept models were hardtails; in the 1992 catalog it is described as "multi-use."[21] The ones produced in 2001 and 2002 were full suspension mountain bikes.
^ The Agile was a modified Adept, with a drop bar for cyclocross use. Only a very small number (two or three) were ever made for Klein team racers.[22]
^ The earlier Karma produced in 1998 was a full suspension mountain bike, whereas the later ones were commuter bicycles.
^ Distinct from the Q-Pro Carbon
^ The Top Gun was renamed the Rascal after Paramount Pictures objected to the name, shared by the 1986 film Top Gun.[23]
