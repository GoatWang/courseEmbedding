About Alexion













About Alexion
Alexion is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and delivering life-transforming therapies for patients with devastating and rare diseases.
Patients with these life-threatening diseases often have no effective treatment options, and they and their families suffer with little hope. Our goal is to deliver medical breakthroughs where none currently exist. We are driven because we know people's lives depend on our work.
Our breakthrough products
Alexion developed Soliris® (eculizumab), the world's first approved terminal complement inhibitor, from the laboratory through commercialization.
Today, Soliris is approved in nearly 50 countries for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and in more than 40 countries for the treatment of patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) — two life-threatening, ultra-rare disorders caused by uncontrolled complement activation.
As the global leader in complement inhibition, Alexion is strengthening and broadening its portfolio of complement inhibitors, including evaluating potential indications for eculizumab in additional severe and ultra-rare disorders.
Alexion's metabolic franchise includes two highly innovative enzyme replacement therapies for patients with life-threatening and ultra-rare disorders: Strensiq® (asfotase alfa) is approved for patients with hypophosphatasia (HPP) and Kanuma® (sebelipase alfa) is approved for patients with lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D).
A global leader in rare diseases 
Alexion was established in the U.S. in 1992 and became a public company in 1996 (NASDAQ: ALXN). We were added to the NASDAQ-100 Index in 2011 and to the Standard & Poor's 500 Index in 2012. Our global headquarters and research operations are in New Haven, Conn. Alexion's approximately 3,000 employees around the world serve patients in 50 countries.
As we continue to expand our operations to serve more patients in additional countries, Alexion has emerged as one of the world's leading rare disease companies. Today, Alexion is advancing its rare disease pipeline, which, in addition to our complement and metabolic clinical programs, includes diverse preclinical programs across a range of therapeutic modalities.

About Alexion













About Alexion
Alexion is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and delivering life-transforming therapies for patients with devastating and rare diseases.
Patients with these life-threatening diseases often have no effective treatment options, and they and their families suffer with little hope. Our goal is to deliver medical breakthroughs where none currently exist. We are driven because we know people's lives depend on our work.
Our breakthrough products
Alexion developed Soliris® (eculizumab), the world's first approved terminal complement inhibitor, from the laboratory through commercialization.
Today, Soliris is approved in nearly 50 countries for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and in more than 40 countries for the treatment of patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) — two life-threatening, ultra-rare disorders caused by uncontrolled complement activation.
As the global leader in complement inhibition, Alexion is strengthening and broadening its portfolio of complement inhibitors, including evaluating potential indications for eculizumab in additional severe and ultra-rare disorders.
Alexion's metabolic franchise includes two highly innovative enzyme replacement therapies for patients with life-threatening and ultra-rare disorders: Strensiq® (asfotase alfa) is approved for patients with hypophosphatasia (HPP) and Kanuma® (sebelipase alfa) is approved for patients with lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D).
A global leader in rare diseases 
Alexion was established in the U.S. in 1992 and became a public company in 1996 (NASDAQ: ALXN). We were added to the NASDAQ-100 Index in 2011 and to the Standard & Poor's 500 Index in 2012. Our global headquarters and research operations are in New Haven, Conn. Alexion's approximately 3,000 employees around the world serve patients in 50 countries.
As we continue to expand our operations to serve more patients in additional countries, Alexion has emerged as one of the world's leading rare disease companies. Today, Alexion is advancing its rare disease pipeline, which, in addition to our complement and metabolic clinical programs, includes diverse preclinical programs across a range of therapeutic modalities.

This investigation is: Open
Latest Disclosure Date:
April 27, 2017
Date of Original Disclosure:
May 22, 2015


Agencies involved: U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
Countries involved: Brazil, Colombia, Japan, Russia, Turkey
Industry: Healthcare, Pharmaceutical
SEC Form: 10-K/A, 10-Q, S-4



Text of Disclosure:
April 27, 2017 Form 10-Q
In May 2015, we received a subpoena in connection with an investigation by the Enforcement Division of the SEC requesting information related to our grant-making activities and compliance with the FCPA in various countries. In addition, in October 2015, we received a request from the DOJ for the voluntary production of documents and other information pertaining to Alexion’s compliance with FCPA. The SEC and DOJ also seek information related to Alexion’s recalls of specific lots of Soliris and related securities disclosures. Alexion is cooperating with these investigations.
The investigations have focused on operations in various countries, including Brazil, Colombia, Japan, Russia and Turkey, and Alexion’s compliance with the FCPA and other applicable laws.
At this time, Alexion is unable to predict the duration, scope or outcome of these investigations. While it is possible that a loss related to these matters may be incurred, given the ongoing nature of these investigations, management cannot reasonably estimate the potential magnitude of any such loss or range of loss, or the cost of the ongoing investigation. Any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with existing laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines, civil and criminal penalties, equitable remedies, including disgorgement, injunctive relief, and/or other sanctions against us, and remediation of any such findings could have an adverse effect on our business operations.
Alexion is committed to strengthening its compliance program and has initiated a comprehensive company-wide transformation plan to enhance and remediate its business processes, structures, controls, training, talent and systems across Alexion’s global operations. For information concerning the risks associated with the investigation, see our Risk Factor – “If we fail to comply with laws or regulations, we may be subject to investigations and civil or criminal penalties and our business could be adversely affected.”


January 19, 2017 Form 10-K/A
In May 2015, we received a subpoena in connection with an investigation by the Enforcement Division of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requesting information related to our grant-making activities and compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) in various countries. The SEC also seeks information related to Alexion’s recalls of specific lots of Soliris and related securities disclosures. In addition, in October 2015, Alexion received a request from the U.S. Department of Justice for the voluntary production of documents and other information pertaining to Alexion’s compliance with the FCPA. Alexion is cooperating with these investigations. At this time, Alexion is unable to predict the duration, scope or outcome of these investigations. Given the ongoing nature of these investigations, management does not currently believe a loss related to these matters is probable or that the potential magnitude of such loss or range of loss, if any, can be reasonably estimated.


May 22, 2015 Form S-4
On May 8, 2015, Alexion received a subpoena in connection with an investigation by the Enforcement Division of the SEC requesting information related to Alexion’s grant-making activities and compliance with the FCPA. While the subpoena seeks information related to Alexion’s activities and policies and procedures worldwide, it notes in particular Japan, Brazil, Turkey and Russia. The subpoena also seeks information related to Alexion’s recalls of specific lots of Soliris and related securities disclosures. Alexion is committed to compliance with applicable laws and regulations and strives to operate at the highest ethical standards in all of its markets. Alexion is cooperating with the SEC’s investigation, which is in its early stages. At this time, Alexion is unable to predict the duration, scope or outcome of the SEC investigation.
Any determination that Alexion’s operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with existing United States or foreign laws or regulations, including by the SEC pursuant to its investigation of Alexion’s compliance with the FCPA and other matters, could result in the imposition of a broad range of civil and criminal sanctions against Alexion and certain of its directors, officers and/or employees, including injunctive relief, disgorgement, substantial fines or penalties, imprisonment, interruptions of business, debarment from government contracts, loss of supplier, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits, and other legal or equitable sanctions. Other internal or government investigations or legal or regulatory proceedings, including lawsuits brought by private litigants, may also follow as a consequence. Violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions, which could disrupt Alexion’s business and result in a material adverse effect on its reputation, business, results of operations or financial condition. Cooperating with and responding to the SEC in connection with its investigation of Alexion’s FCPA practices and other matters, as well as responding to any future U.S. or foreign governmental investigation or whistleblower lawsuit, could result in substantial expenses, and could divert management’s attention from other business concerns and could have a material adverse effect on Alexion’s business and financial condition and growth prospects.

History[edit]
Alexion Pharmaceuticals was founded in 1992 at Science Park in New Haven, Connecticut by Leonard Bell.[6] Bell would serve as the company's CEO until 2015.[7] In 2000, Alexion moved its headquarters from New Haven to Cheshire, Connecticut. Alexion moved back to New Haven following the completion of New Haven's Downtown Crossing project in December 2015 - Alexion's new headquarters are located at 100 College Street
Since 2006, Alexion has been a supporter of Healthcare Research and Quality studies at Duke University for aspirin and Clopidogrel (trade name Plavix).[6]
Alexion received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for Soliris in 2007. It was initially approved to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a rare blood disorder.[4] In 2010, there was an outbreak of hemolytic-uremic syndrome caused by Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) in Germany. Soliris was considered as a treatment option due to its effectiveness in treating Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, an illness similar to the one caused by the EHEC infection. As a result, Alexion's German subsidiary provided an unspecified number of Soliris doses at no charge to physicians who requested it.[8]
In April 2011, Alexion was added to the NASDAQ-100, a group composed of the 100 largest non-financial stocks traded on the Nasdaq; with a market value of USD 8.5 billion it replaced Genzyme Corporation.[9]
In April 2015, Bell was replaced as CEO by David Hallal.[7] In 2016, the company became a member of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA).[10]
In December 2016, Alexion's board of directors announced new leadership. The board identified David Brennan, formerly of AZ and a current board member as the interim CEO to replace David Hallal. David Anderson, formerly the CFO of Honeywell, was appointed as the new CFO replacing Vikas Sinha.[11] In March 2017, Alexion named Ludwig N. Hantson as its new CEO.[12]
Acquisitions[edit]
In 2000, Alexion purchased Proliferon Inc., a San Diego, California based development-stage biopharmaceutical firm, for US$41 million in Alexion stock. Alexion CEO, Leonard Bell, cited Proliferon's ability to produce an "unlimited amount of antibodies" as the reason for the acquisition. At the time Proliferon's annual revenue was about $2.5 million and its assets were valued at $2.1 million.[13][14] The company has since been renamed Alexion Antibody Technologies Inc.
In December 2011, Alexion acquired Montreal-based Enobia Pharma Corp for $610 million upfront and up to another $470 million later, contingent on company sales and regulatory goals. The $610 million includes $300 million in bank debt. Enobia is the developer of asfotase alpha, a drug used to treat the genetic disorder hypophosphatasia.[15]
In May 2015, Alexion announced plans to purchase the Lexington firm Synageva BioPharma, a maker of rare disease treatments run by ex-Genzyme executive Sanj Patel, who negotiated an $8.4 billion stock-and-cash deal.[16] In the deal, each share of Synageva, which is traded on NASDAQ, will be exchanged for $115 in cash and 0.6581 shares of Alexion stock. The price represented more than a 135% premium over Synageva's market cap at the time.[7] It also represents a valuation of about ten times projected peak sales, double what is typical for the biotech industry.[17] Analysis by The Wall Street Journal suggested the large premium was due to the perceived value of rare disease treatments which usually are very expensive when compared to treatments for more common diseases.[7] Alexion is thus seeking a stronger position in the lucrative rare disease market, and is willing to pay a premium to obtain that position. The rare disease market is seen as desirable because insurers have minimal motive to deny claims (due to small population sizes of patients) and are unable to negotiate better drug prices due to lack of competition.[18]
Alexion said it expects to save $150 million in costs by the end of 2017 by combining with Synageva. It does not expect revenue and earnings per share to increase until 2018. The deal would give Alexion a total of eight drugs in clinical trials, and 30 others in preclinical trials. Synageva's main drug, Kanuma, could receive approval in the United States and Europe as early as the third quarter of 2015.[7] The boards of both companies have approved the merger which is expected to complete in mid-2015.[18] Alexion shares fell 8.9% the day after the deal was announced.[7]

Products[edit]
Specialty drugs[edit]
Main article: Specialty drugs
Alexion has employed a strategy of developing drugs to combat rare diseases. Since the targeted user base is small for such drugs, clinical drugs tend to be quicker and cheaper than those for mass market drugs. Additionally, big pharmaceutical companies have tended to ignore these markets, creating a niche with minimal competition for Alexion. Insurance companies have generally been willing to pay high prices for such drugs; since few of their customers need the drugs, a high price does not significantly impact the insurance companies outlays.[17] "The success of specialty drugs for rare diseases comes at a time when the traditional drug business of selling medicines to the masses is in decline...Specialty drugs have gotten more expensive than anyone imagined."[20]
Soliris[edit]
Main article: Eculizumab
Alexion's first drug, Soliris, used to treat the rare disorders atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).[3] It has been approved for use in Canada, the European Union, Japan, and the United States; however, availability in Canada is limited. In Canada, access to the drug is mostly through private clinics; groups such as the Canadian Association of PNH Patients are lobbying to change that.[21] The drug costs roughly $450,000 a year, and is considered the world's most expensive drug.[4][7] The price of the drug is so high that very few individuals can pay the price. As a result, Alexion hires public relations firms to help families institute campaigns to pressure their governments to pay for the drug. Alexion is putting pressure on to governments to receive their payments from the public purse. The prices charged have a very high margin above the cost price. In addition, much of the research for the development of Soliris originates from publicly funded universities. There is an ethical question as to the pricing of the drug and the ethics of the drug manufacturer. Alexion is well on the way to developing a second very high price and high margined drug.[22]
In September 2011, the FDA officially approved the use of Soliris as a treatment for atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome in both adults and children. More than half of people with aHUS end up dying of it as a result of damage to vital organs/organ failure (usually involving the kidneys) caused by uncontrolled complement activation. The FDA's decision to grant approval received a positive response from the medical community with the director of Pediatric Nephrology at Atlanta's Children's hospital calling it "the most important advance that has been made for patients and families with this disease".[23]
By 2010 Soliris was considered to be the most expensive drug in the world.[20] It costs £340,200 per year for treatment in the UK[24][25] and $500,000 a year in Canada.[24][25][26] and US$409,500 a year in the United States (2010).[20] In the case of the rarest diseases that afflict fewer than 10,000 people, biotech companies who own the only approved drugs to treat those diseases "can charge pretty much whatever they want." "Before testing Soliris for PNH, Alexion tested the drug for rheumatoid arthritis, which afflicts 1 million Americans. The trials failed. But if it had worked for arthritis, Alexion would likely have had to charge a much lower price for this use, as it would have to compete against drugs that cost a mere $20,000." Alexion started selling Soliris in 2008 making $295 million in 2007 with its stock price rising to 130% in 2010.[26]
In April and May 2013, a controversy arose in Belgium when the media revealed that the government had refused to pay for a seven-year-old boy's treatment because Soliris was too expensive. The boy's medicine cost 9,000 euros every two weeks.[27] On May 4, 2013, De Standaard reported that a press relations (PR) agency working for Alexion had helped the boy's parents communicate their story to the press.[28] It was also reported that the parents had believed their benefactor was a Dutch organization for patients, and that the PR agency acted with permission from Alexion.[29][30] Several politicians stated that the company was attempting to 'blackmail' the government, charges which Alexion denied.[31] By May 7, 2013 an agreement had been reached to reimburse the medicine.[32][33]
Pharma, the Belgian pharmaceutical industry's association, opened an internal investigation into the affair, for possible breach of the association's ethical standards by Alexion. However, on June 12, Alexion received a court gag order against Pharma, preventing it from communicating its investigation. At the same time, Pharma opened a court case against Alexion Pharma Belgium. The gag order was revoked by the end of September 2013,[34] but the case was still pending in March 2015.[33]
Strensiq[edit]
In October 2015, Alexion's second drug, Strensiq (asfotase alfa), was approved by the US FDA. It is used to treat hypophosphatasia, a rare metabolic disorder.
Kanuma[edit]
Kanuma, which Alexion acquired in its acquisition of Synageva, was approved in 2015 to treat Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency, a fatal genetic disorder that cause fatty material to build up in blood vessel walls, the liver, and other tissues.[7] Alexion estimates that the drug could eventually have annual sales of more than $1 billion.[18]
Financials[edit]
In 2013, 36% Alexion's sales originated in the US, down from 37% the previous year; 33% came from Europe, down from 35%; Japan accounted for just over 10%. Revenue was impacted by higher unit volumes for Soliris (up 40%), and a decreased average price related to rebates in Europe. Acquisition related costs fell significantly from $22 million to just $5 million.[35] R&D spending reached a record high of $317 million in 2013 up 83% from the previous year.[6]
When Soliris was first approved, peak annual sales were estimated at $150 million.[17] However, by September 2013 quarterly sales of Soliris topped $400 million. Sales during the first quarter of 2015 were just over US$600 million, and are still on the rise.[7][17]
Before the Synageva purchase announcement, Alexion was valued at $34 billion.[7] The stock is up roughly 800% in the last five years and is currently trading at 46 times estimated earnings. Due to the niche nature of its market and the high cost of Soliris, the company has enjoyed a high profit margin.[17]

In December 2016, Alexion's board of directors announced new leadership. The board identified David Brennan, formerly of AZ and a current board member as the interim CEO to replace David Hallal. David Anderson, formerly the CFO of Honeywell, was appointed as the new CFO replacing Vikas Sinha.[11] In March 2017, Alexion named Ludwig N. Hantson as its new CEO.[12]
Acquisitions[edit]
In 2000, Alexion purchased Proliferon Inc., a San Diego, California based development-stage biopharmaceutical firm, for US$41 million in Alexion stock. Alexion CEO, Leonard Bell, cited Proliferon's ability to produce an "unlimited amount of antibodies" as the reason for the acquisition. At the time Proliferon's annual revenue was about $2.5 million and its assets were valued at $2.1 million.[13][14] The company has since been renamed Alexion Antibody Technologies Inc.
In December 2011, Alexion acquired Montreal-based Enobia Pharma Corp for $610 million upfront and up to another $470 million later, contingent on company sales and regulatory goals. The $610 million includes $300 million in bank debt. Enobia is the developer of asfotase alpha, a drug used to treat the genetic disorder hypophosphatasia.[15]
In May 2015, Alexion announced plans to purchase the Lexington firm Synageva BioPharma, a maker of rare disease treatments run by ex-Genzyme executive Sanj Patel, who negotiated an $8.4 billion stock-and-cash deal.[16] In the deal, each share of Synageva, which is traded on NASDAQ, will be exchanged for $115 in cash and 0.6581 shares of Alexion stock. The price represented more than a 135% premium over Synageva's market cap at the time.[7] It also represents a valuation of about ten times projected peak sales, double what is typical for the biotech industry.[17] Analysis by The Wall Street Journal suggested the large premium was due to the perceived value of rare disease treatments which usually are very expensive when compared to treatments for more common diseases.[7] Alexion is thus seeking a stronger position in the lucrative rare disease market, and is willing to pay a premium to obtain that position. The rare disease market is seen as desirable because insurers have minimal motive to deny claims (due to small population sizes of patients) and are unable to negotiate better drug prices due to lack of competition.[18]
Alexion said it expects to save $150 million in costs by the end of 2017 by combining with Synageva. It does not expect revenue and earnings per share to increase until 2018. The deal would give Alexion a total of eight drugs in clinical trials, and 30 others in preclinical trials. Synageva's main drug, Kanuma, could receive approval in the United States and Europe as early as the third quarter of 2015.[7] The boards of both companies have approved the merger which is expected to complete in mid-2015.[18] Alexion shares fell 8.9% the day after the deal was announced.[7]

Products[edit]
Specialty drugs[edit]
Main article: Specialty drugs
Alexion has employed a strategy of developing drugs to combat rare diseases. Since the targeted user base is small for such drugs, clinical drugs tend to be quicker and cheaper than those for mass market drugs. Additionally, big pharmaceutical companies have tended to ignore these markets, creating a niche with minimal competition for Alexion. Insurance companies have generally been willing to pay high prices for such drugs; since few of their customers need the drugs, a high price does not significantly impact the insurance companies outlays.[17] "The success of specialty drugs for rare diseases comes at a time when the traditional drug business of selling medicines to the masses is in decline...Specialty drugs have gotten more expensive than anyone imagined."[20]
Soliris[edit]
Main article: Eculizumab
Alexion's first drug, Soliris, used to treat the rare disorders atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).[3] It has been approved for use in Canada, the European Union, Japan, and the United States; however, availability in Canada is limited. In Canada, access to the drug is mostly through private clinics; groups such as the Canadian Association of PNH Patients are lobbying to change that.[21] The drug costs roughly $450,000 a year, and is considered the world's most expensive drug.[4][7] The price of the drug is so high that very few individuals can pay the price. As a result, Alexion hires public relations firms to help families institute campaigns to pressure their governments to pay for the drug. Alexion is putting pressure on to governments to receive their payments from the public purse. The prices charged have a very high margin above the cost price. In addition, much of the research for the development of Soliris originates from publicly funded universities. There is an ethical question as to the pricing of the drug and the ethics of the drug manufacturer. Alexion is well on the way to developing a second very high price and high margined drug.[22]
In September 2011, the FDA officially approved the use of Soliris as a treatment for atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome in both adults and children. More than half of people with aHUS end up dying of it as a result of damage to vital organs/organ failure (usually involving the kidneys) caused by uncontrolled complement activation. The FDA's decision to grant approval received a positive response from the medical community with the director of Pediatric Nephrology at Atlanta's Children's hospital calling it "the most important advance that has been made for patients and families with this disease".[23]
By 2010 Soliris was considered to be the most expensive drug in the world.[20] It costs £340,200 per year for treatment in the UK[24][25] and $500,000 a year in Canada.[24][25][26] and US$409,500 a year in the United States (2010).[20] In the case of the rarest diseases that afflict fewer than 10,000 people, biotech companies who own the only approved drugs to treat those diseases "can charge pretty much whatever they want." "Before testing Soliris for PNH, Alexion tested the drug for rheumatoid arthritis, which afflicts 1 million Americans. The trials failed. But if it had worked for arthritis, Alexion would likely have had to charge a much lower price for this use, as it would have to compete against drugs that cost a mere $20,000." Alexion started selling Soliris in 2008 making $295 million in 2007 with its stock price rising to 130% in 2010.[26]
In April and May 2013, a controversy arose in Belgium when the media revealed that the government had refused to pay for a seven-year-old boy's treatment because Soliris was too expensive. The boy's medicine cost 9,000 euros every two weeks.[27] On May 4, 2013, De Standaard reported that a press relations (PR) agency working for Alexion had helped the boy's parents communicate their story to the press.[28] It was also reported that the parents had believed their benefactor was a Dutch organization for patients, and that the PR agency acted with permission from Alexion.[29][30] Several politicians stated that the company was attempting to 'blackmail' the government, charges which Alexion denied.[31] By May 7, 2013 an agreement had been reached to reimburse the medicine.[32][33]
Pharma, the Belgian pharmaceutical industry's association, opened an internal investigation into the affair, for possible breach of the association's ethical standards by Alexion. However, on June 12, Alexion received a court gag order against Pharma, preventing it from communicating its investigation. At the same time, Pharma opened a court case against Alexion Pharma Belgium. The gag order was revoked by the end of September 2013,[34] but the case was still pending in March 2015.[33]
Strensiq[edit]
In October 2015, Alexion's second drug, Strensiq (asfotase alfa), was approved by the US FDA. It is used to treat hypophosphatasia, a rare metabolic disorder.
Kanuma[edit]
Kanuma, which Alexion acquired in its acquisition of Synageva, was approved in 2015 to treat Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency, a fatal genetic disorder that cause fatty material to build up in blood vessel walls, the liver, and other tissues.[7] Alexion estimates that the drug could eventually have annual sales of more than $1 billion.[18]
Financials[edit]
In 2013, 36% Alexion's sales originated in the US, down from 37% the previous year; 33% came from Europe, down from 35%; Japan accounted for just over 10%. Revenue was impacted by higher unit volumes for Soliris (up 40%), and a decreased average price related to rebates in Europe. Acquisition related costs fell significantly from $22 million to just $5 million.[35] R&D spending reached a record high of $317 million in 2013 up 83% from the previous year.[6]
When Soliris was first approved, peak annual sales were estimated at $150 million.[17] However, by September 2013 quarterly sales of Soliris topped $400 million. Sales during the first quarter of 2015 were just over US$600 million, and are still on the rise.[7][17]
Before the Synageva purchase announcement, Alexion was valued at $34 billion.[7] The stock is up roughly 800% in the last five years and is currently trading at 46 times estimated earnings. Due to the niche nature of its market and the high cost of Soliris, the company has enjoyed a high profit margin.[17]

History[edit]
Alexion Pharmaceuticals was founded in 1992 at Science Park in New Haven, Connecticut by Leonard Bell.[6] Bell would serve as the company's CEO until 2015.[7] In 2000, Alexion moved its headquarters from New Haven to Cheshire, Connecticut. Alexion moved back to New Haven following the completion of New Haven's Downtown Crossing project in December 2015 - Alexion's new headquarters are located at 100 College Street
Since 2006, Alexion has been a supporter of Healthcare Research and Quality studies at Duke University for aspirin and Clopidogrel (trade name Plavix).[6]
Alexion received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for Soliris in 2007. It was initially approved to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a rare blood disorder.[4] In 2010, there was an outbreak of hemolytic-uremic syndrome caused by Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) in Germany. Soliris was considered as a treatment option due to its effectiveness in treating Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, an illness similar to the one caused by the EHEC infection. As a result, Alexion's German subsidiary provided an unspecified number of Soliris doses at no charge to physicians who requested it.[8]
In April 2011, Alexion was added to the NASDAQ-100, a group composed of the 100 largest non-financial stocks traded on the Nasdaq; with a market value of USD 8.5 billion it replaced Genzyme Corporation.[9]
In April 2015, Bell was replaced as CEO by David Hallal.[7] In 2016, the company became a member of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA).[10]
In December 2016, Alexion's board of directors announced new leadership. The board identified David Brennan, formerly of AZ and a current board member as the interim CEO to replace David Hallal. David Anderson, formerly the CFO of Honeywell, was appointed as the new CFO replacing Vikas Sinha.[11] In March 2017, Alexion named Ludwig N. Hantson as its new CEO.[12]
Acquisitions[edit]
In 2000, Alexion purchased Proliferon Inc., a San Diego, California based development-stage biopharmaceutical firm, for US$41 million in Alexion stock. Alexion CEO, Leonard Bell, cited Proliferon's ability to produce an "unlimited amount of antibodies" as the reason for the acquisition. At the time Proliferon's annual revenue was about $2.5 million and its assets were valued at $2.1 million.[13][14] The company has since been renamed Alexion Antibody Technologies Inc.
In December 2011, Alexion acquired Montreal-based Enobia Pharma Corp for $610 million upfront and up to another $470 million later, contingent on company sales and regulatory goals. The $610 million includes $300 million in bank debt. Enobia is the developer of asfotase alpha, a drug used to treat the genetic disorder hypophosphatasia.[15]
In May 2015, Alexion announced plans to purchase the Lexington firm Synageva BioPharma, a maker of rare disease treatments run by ex-Genzyme executive Sanj Patel, who negotiated an $8.4 billion stock-and-cash deal.[16] In the deal, each share of Synageva, which is traded on NASDAQ, will be exchanged for $115 in cash and 0.6581 shares of Alexion stock. The price represented more than a 135% premium over Synageva's market cap at the time.[7] It also represents a valuation of about ten times projected peak sales, double what is typical for the biotech industry.[17] Analysis by The Wall Street Journal suggested the large premium was due to the perceived value of rare disease treatments which usually are very expensive when compared to treatments for more common diseases.[7] Alexion is thus seeking a stronger position in the lucrative rare disease market, and is willing to pay a premium to obtain that position. The rare disease market is seen as desirable because insurers have minimal motive to deny claims (due to small population sizes of patients) and are unable to negotiate better drug prices due to lack of competition.[18]
Alexion said it expects to save $150 million in costs by the end of 2017 by combining with Synageva. It does not expect revenue and earnings per share to increase until 2018. The deal would give Alexion a total of eight drugs in clinical trials, and 30 others in preclinical trials. Synageva's main drug, Kanuma, could receive approval in the United States and Europe as early as the third quarter of 2015.[7] The boards of both companies have approved the merger which is expected to complete in mid-2015.[18] Alexion shares fell 8.9% the day after the deal was announced.[7]

Kanuma[edit]
Kanuma, which Alexion acquired in its acquisition of Synageva, was approved in 2015 to treat Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency, a fatal genetic disorder that cause fatty material to build up in blood vessel walls, the liver, and other tissues.[7] Alexion estimates that the drug could eventually have annual sales of more than $1 billion.[18]

Revenue was impacted by higher unit volumes for Soliris (up 40%), and a decreased average price related to rebates in Europe. Acquisition related costs fell significantly from $22 million to just $5 million.[35] R&D spending reached a record high of $317 million in 2013 up 83% from the previous year.[6]
When Soliris was first approved, peak annual sales were estimated at $150 million.[17] However, by September 2013 quarterly sales of Soliris topped $400 million. Sales during the first quarter of 2015 were just over US$600 million, and are still on the rise.[7][17]
Before the Synageva purchase announcement, Alexion was valued at $34 billion.[7] The stock is up roughly 800% in the last five years and is currently trading at 46 times estimated earnings. Due to the niche nature of its market and the high cost of Soliris, the company has enjoyed a high profit margin.[17]

History[edit]
Alexion Pharmaceuticals was founded in 1992 at Science Park in New Haven, Connecticut by Leonard Bell.[6] Bell would serve as the company's CEO until 2015.[7] In 2000, Alexion moved its headquarters from New Haven to Cheshire, Connecticut. Alexion moved back to New Haven following the completion of New Haven's Downtown Crossing project in December 2015 - Alexion's new headquarters are located at 100 College Street
Since 2006, Alexion has been a supporter of Healthcare Research and Quality studies at Duke University for aspirin and Clopidogrel (trade name Plavix).[6]
Alexion received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for Soliris in 2007. It was initially approved to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a rare blood disorder.[4] In 2010, there was an outbreak of hemolytic-uremic syndrome caused by Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) in Germany. Soliris was considered as a treatment option due to its effectiveness in treating Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, an illness similar to the one caused by the EHEC infection. As a result, Alexion's German subsidiary provided an unspecified number of Soliris doses at no charge to physicians who requested it.[8]
In April 2011, Alexion was added to the NASDAQ-100, a group composed of the 100 largest non-financial stocks traded on the Nasdaq; with a market value of USD 8.5 billion it replaced Genzyme Corporation.[9]
In April 2015, Bell was replaced as CEO by David Hallal.[7] In 2016, the company became a member of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA).[10]
In December 2016, Alexion's board of directors announced new leadership. The board identified David Brennan, formerly of AZ and a current board member as the interim CEO to replace David Hallal. David Anderson, formerly the CFO of Honeywell, was appointed as the new CFO replacing Vikas Sinha.[11] In March 2017, Alexion named Ludwig N. Hantson as its new CEO.[12]
Acquisitions[edit]
In 2000, Alexion purchased Proliferon Inc., a San Diego, California based development-stage biopharmaceutical firm, for US$41 million in Alexion stock. Alexion CEO, Leonard Bell, cited Proliferon's ability to produce an "unlimited amount of antibodies" as the reason for the acquisition. At the time Proliferon's annual revenue was about $2.5 million and its assets were valued at $2.1 million.[13][14] The company has since been renamed Alexion Antibody Technologies Inc.
In December 2011, Alexion acquired Montreal-based Enobia Pharma Corp for $610 million upfront and up to another $470 million later, contingent on company sales and regulatory goals. The $610 million includes $300 million in bank debt. Enobia is the developer of asfotase alpha, a drug used to treat the genetic disorder hypophosphatasia.[15]
In May 2015, Alexion announced plans to purchase the Lexington firm Synageva BioPharma, a maker of rare disease treatments run by ex-Genzyme executive Sanj Patel, who negotiated an $8.4 billion stock-and-cash deal.[16] In the deal, each share of Synageva, which is traded on NASDAQ, will be exchanged for $115 in cash and 0.6581 shares of Alexion stock. The price represented more than a 135% premium over Synageva's market cap at the time.[7] It also represents a valuation of about ten times projected peak sales, double what is typical for the biotech industry.[17] Analysis by The Wall Street Journal suggested the large premium was due to the perceived value of rare disease treatments which usually are very expensive when compared to treatments for more common diseases.[7] Alexion is thus seeking a stronger position in the lucrative rare disease market, and is willing to pay a premium to obtain that position. The rare disease market is seen as desirable because insurers have minimal motive to deny claims (due to small population sizes of patients) and are unable to negotiate better drug prices due to lack of competition.[18]
Alexion said it expects to save $150 million in costs by the end of 2017 by combining with Synageva. It does not expect revenue and earnings per share to increase until 2018. The deal would give Alexion a total of eight drugs in clinical trials, and 30 others in preclinical trials. Synageva's main drug, Kanuma, could receive approval in the United States and Europe as early as the third quarter of 2015.[7] The boards of both companies have approved the merger which is expected to complete in mid-2015.[18] Alexion shares fell 8.9% the day after the deal was announced.[7]

Products[edit]
Specialty drugs[edit]
Main article: Specialty drugs
Alexion has employed a strategy of developing drugs to combat rare diseases. Since the targeted user base is small for such drugs, clinical drugs tend to be quicker and cheaper than those for mass market drugs. Additionally, big pharmaceutical companies have tended to ignore these markets, creating a niche with minimal competition for Alexion. Insurance companies have generally been willing to pay high prices for such drugs; since few of their customers need the drugs, a high price does not significantly impact the insurance companies outlays.[17] "The success of specialty drugs for rare diseases comes at a time when the traditional drug business of selling medicines to the masses is in decline...Specialty drugs have gotten more expensive than anyone imagined."[20]
Soliris[edit]
Main article: Eculizumab
Alexion's first drug, Soliris, used to treat the rare disorders atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).[3] It has been approved for use in Canada, the European Union, Japan, and the United States; however, availability in Canada is limited. In Canada, access to the drug is mostly through private clinics; groups such as the Canadian Association of PNH Patients are lobbying to change that.[21] The drug costs roughly $450,000 a year, and is considered the world's most expensive drug.[4][7] The price of the drug is so high that very few individuals can pay the price. As a result, Alexion hires public relations firms to help families institute campaigns to pressure their governments to pay for the drug. Alexion is putting pressure on to governments to receive their payments from the public purse. The prices charged have a very high margin above the cost price. In addition, much of the research for the development of Soliris originates from publicly funded universities. There is an ethical question as to the pricing of the drug and the ethics of the drug manufacturer. Alexion is well on the way to developing a second very high price and high margined drug.[22]
In September 2011, the FDA officially approved the use of Soliris as a treatment for atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome in both adults and children. More than half of people with aHUS end up dying of it as a result of damage to vital organs/organ failure (usually involving the kidneys) caused by uncontrolled complement activation. The FDA's decision to grant approval received a positive response from the medical community with the director of Pediatric Nephrology at Atlanta's Children's hospital calling it "the most important advance that has been made for patients and families with this disease".[23]
By 2010 Soliris was considered to be the most expensive drug in the world.[20] It costs £340,200 per year for treatment in the UK[24][25] and $500,000 a year in Canada.[24][25][26] and US$409,500 a year in the United States (2010).[20] In the case of the rarest diseases that afflict fewer than 10,000 people, biotech companies who own the only approved drugs to treat those diseases "can charge pretty much whatever they want." "Before testing Soliris for PNH, Alexion tested the drug for rheumatoid arthritis, which afflicts 1 million Americans. The trials failed. But if it had worked for arthritis, Alexion would likely have had to charge a much lower price for this use, as it would have to compete against drugs that cost a mere $20,000." Alexion started selling Soliris in 2008 making $295 million in 2007 with its stock price rising to 130% in 2010.[26]
In April and May 2013, a controversy arose in Belgium when the media revealed that the government had refused to pay for a seven-year-old boy's treatment because Soliris was too expensive. The boy's medicine cost 9,000 euros every two weeks.[27] On May 4, 2013, De Standaard reported that a press relations (PR) agency working for Alexion had helped the boy's parents communicate their story to the press.[28] It was also reported that the parents had believed their benefactor was a Dutch organization for patients, and that the PR agency acted with permission from Alexion.[29][30] Several politicians stated that the company was attempting to 'blackmail' the government, charges which Alexion denied.[31] By May 7, 2013 an agreement had been reached to reimburse the medicine.[32][33]
Pharma, the Belgian pharmaceutical industry's association, opened an internal investigation into the affair, for possible breach of the association's ethical standards by Alexion. However, on June 12, Alexion received a court gag order against Pharma, preventing it from communicating its investigation. At the same time, Pharma opened a court case against Alexion Pharma Belgium. The gag order was revoked by the end of September 2013,[34] but the case was still pending in March 2015.[33]
Strensiq[edit]
In October 2015, Alexion's second drug, Strensiq (asfotase alfa), was approved by the US FDA. It is used to treat hypophosphatasia, a rare metabolic disorder.
Kanuma[edit]
Kanuma, which Alexion acquired in its acquisition of Synageva, was approved in 2015 to treat Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency, a fatal genetic disorder that cause fatty material to build up in blood vessel walls, the liver, and other tissues.[7] Alexion estimates that the drug could eventually have annual sales of more than $1 billion.[18]
Financials[edit]
In 2013, 36% Alexion's sales originated in the US, down from 37% the previous year; 33% came from Europe, down from 35%; Japan accounted for just over 10%. Revenue was impacted by higher unit volumes for Soliris (up 40%), and a decreased average price related to rebates in Europe. Acquisition related costs fell significantly from $22 million to just $5 million.[35] R&D spending reached a record high of $317 million in 2013 up 83% from the previous year.[6]
When Soliris was first approved, peak annual sales were estimated at $150 million.[17] However, by September 2013 quarterly sales of Soliris topped $400 million. Sales during the first quarter of 2015 were just over US$600 million, and are still on the rise.[7][17]
Before the Synageva purchase announcement, Alexion was valued at $34 billion.[7] The stock is up roughly 800% in the last five years and is currently trading at 46 times estimated earnings. Due to the niche nature of its market and the high cost of Soliris, the company has enjoyed a high profit margin.[17]

History[edit]
Alexion Pharmaceuticals was founded in 1992 at Science Park in New Haven, Connecticut by Leonard Bell.[6] Bell would serve as the company's CEO until 2015.[7] In 2000, Alexion moved its headquarters from New Haven to Cheshire, Connecticut. Alexion moved back to New Haven following the completion of New Haven's Downtown Crossing project in December 2015 - Alexion's new headquarters are located at 100 College Street
Since 2006, Alexion has been a supporter of Healthcare Research and Quality studies at Duke University for aspirin and Clopidogrel (trade name Plavix).[6]
Alexion received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for Soliris in 2007. It was initially approved to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a rare blood disorder.[4] In 2010, there was an outbreak of hemolytic-uremic syndrome caused by Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) in Germany. Soliris was considered as a treatment option due to its effectiveness in treating Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, an illness similar to the one caused by the EHEC infection. As a result, Alexion's German subsidiary provided an unspecified number of Soliris doses at no charge to physicians who requested it.[8]
In April 2011, Alexion was added to the NASDAQ-100, a group composed of the 100 largest non-financial stocks traded on the Nasdaq; with a market value of USD 8.5 billion it replaced Genzyme Corporation.[9]
In April 2015, Bell was replaced as CEO by David Hallal.[7] In 2016, the company became a member of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA).[10]
In December 2016, Alexion's board of directors announced new leadership. The board identified David Brennan, formerly of AZ and a current board member as the interim CEO to replace David Hallal. David Anderson, formerly the CFO of Honeywell, was appointed as the new CFO replacing Vikas Sinha.[11] In March 2017, Alexion named Ludwig N. Hantson as its new CEO.[12]
Acquisitions[edit]
In 2000, Alexion purchased Proliferon Inc., a San Diego, California based development-stage biopharmaceutical firm, for US$41 million in Alexion stock. Alexion CEO, Leonard Bell, cited Proliferon's ability to produce an "unlimited amount of antibodies" as the reason for the acquisition. At the time Proliferon's annual revenue was about $2.5 million and its assets were valued at $2.1 million.[13][14] The company has since been renamed Alexion Antibody Technologies Inc.
In December 2011, Alexion acquired Montreal-based Enobia Pharma Corp for $610 million upfront and up to another $470 million later, contingent on company sales and regulatory goals. The $610 million includes $300 million in bank debt. Enobia is the developer of asfotase alpha, a drug used to treat the genetic disorder hypophosphatasia.[15]
In May 2015, Alexion announced plans to purchase the Lexington firm Synageva BioPharma, a maker of rare disease treatments run by ex-Genzyme executive Sanj Patel, who negotiated an $8.4 billion stock-and-cash deal.[16] In the deal, each share of Synageva, which is traded on NASDAQ, will be exchanged for $115 in cash and 0.6581 shares of Alexion stock. The price represented more than a 135% premium over Synageva's market cap at the time.[7] It also represents a valuation of about ten times projected peak sales, double what is typical for the biotech industry.[17] Analysis by The Wall Street Journal suggested the large premium was due to the perceived value of rare disease treatments which usually are very expensive when compared to treatments for more common diseases.[7] Alexion is thus seeking a stronger position in the lucrative rare disease market, and is willing to pay a premium to obtain that position. The rare disease market is seen as desirable because insurers have minimal motive to deny claims (due to small population sizes of patients) and are unable to negotiate better drug prices due to lack of competition.[18]
Alexion said it expects to save $150 million in costs by the end of 2017 by combining with Synageva. It does not expect revenue and earnings per share to increase until 2018. The deal would give Alexion a total of eight drugs in clinical trials, and 30 others in preclinical trials. Synageva's main drug, Kanuma, could receive approval in the United States and Europe as early as the third quarter of 2015.[7] The boards of both companies have approved the merger which is expected to complete in mid-2015.[18] Alexion shares fell 8.9% the day after the deal was announced.[7]

Products[edit]
Specialty drugs[edit]
Main article: Specialty drugs
Alexion has employed a strategy of developing drugs to combat rare diseases. Since the targeted user base is small for such drugs, clinical drugs tend to be quicker and cheaper than those for mass market drugs. Additionally, big pharmaceutical companies have tended to ignore these markets, creating a niche with minimal competition for Alexion. Insurance companies have generally been willing to pay high prices for such drugs; since few of their customers need the drugs, a high price does not significantly impact the insurance companies outlays.[17] "The success of specialty drugs for rare diseases comes at a time when the traditional drug business of selling medicines to the masses is in decline...Specialty drugs have gotten more expensive than anyone imagined."[20]
Soliris[edit]
Main article: Eculizumab
Alexion's first drug, Soliris, used to treat the rare disorders atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).[3] It has been approved for use in Canada, the European Union, Japan, and the United States; however, availability in Canada is limited. In Canada, access to the drug is mostly through private clinics; groups such as the Canadian Association of PNH Patients are lobbying to change that.[21] The drug costs roughly $450,000 a year, and is considered the world's most expensive drug.[4][7] The price of the drug is so high that very few individuals can pay the price. As a result, Alexion hires public relations firms to help families institute campaigns to pressure their governments to pay for the drug. Alexion is putting pressure on to governments to receive their payments from the public purse. The prices charged have a very high margin above the cost price. In addition, much of the research for the development of Soliris originates from publicly funded universities. There is an ethical question as to the pricing of the drug and the ethics of the drug manufacturer. Alexion is well on the way to developing a second very high price and high margined drug.[22]
In September 2011, the FDA officially approved the use of Soliris as a treatment for atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome in both adults and children. More than half of people with aHUS end up dying of it as a result of damage to vital organs/organ failure (usually involving the kidneys) caused by uncontrolled complement activation. The FDA's decision to grant approval received a positive response from the medical community with the director of Pediatric Nephrology at Atlanta's Children's hospital calling it "the most important advance that has been made for patients and families with this disease".[23]
By 2010 Soliris was considered to be the most expensive drug in the world.[20] It costs £340,200 per year for treatment in the UK[24][25] and $500,000 a year in Canada.[24][25][26] and US$409,500 a year in the United States (2010).[20] In the case of the rarest diseases that afflict fewer than 10,000 people, biotech companies who own the only approved drugs to treat those diseases "can charge pretty much whatever they want." "Before testing Soliris for PNH, Alexion tested the drug for rheumatoid arthritis, which afflicts 1 million Americans. The trials failed. But if it had worked for arthritis, Alexion would likely have had to charge a much lower price for this use, as it would have to compete against drugs that cost a mere $20,000." Alexion started selling Soliris in 2008 making $295 million in 2007 with its stock price rising to 130% in 2010.[26]
In April and May 2013, a controversy arose in Belgium when the media revealed that the government had refused to pay for a seven-year-old boy's treatment because Soliris was too expensive. The boy's medicine cost 9,000 euros every two weeks.[27] On May 4, 2013, De Standaard reported that a press relations (PR) agency working for Alexion had helped the boy's parents communicate their story to the press.[28] It was also reported that the parents had believed their benefactor was a Dutch organization for patients, and that the PR agency acted with permission from Alexion.[29][30] Several politicians stated that the company was attempting to 'blackmail' the government, charges which Alexion denied.[31] By May 7, 2013 an agreement had been reached to reimburse the medicine.[32][33]
Pharma, the Belgian pharmaceutical industry's association, opened an internal investigation into the affair, for possible breach of the association's ethical standards by Alexion. However, on June 12, Alexion received a court gag order against Pharma, preventing it from communicating its investigation. At the same time, Pharma opened a court case against Alexion Pharma Belgium. The gag order was revoked by the end of September 2013,[34] but the case was still pending in March 2015.[33]
Strensiq[edit]
In October 2015, Alexion's second drug, Strensiq (asfotase alfa), was approved by the US FDA. It is used to treat hypophosphatasia, a rare metabolic disorder.
Kanuma[edit]
Kanuma, which Alexion acquired in its acquisition of Synageva, was approved in 2015 to treat Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency, a fatal genetic disorder that cause fatty material to build up in blood vessel walls, the liver, and other tissues.[7] Alexion estimates that the drug could eventually have annual sales of more than $1 billion.[18]
Financials[edit]
In 2013, 36% Alexion's sales originated in the US, down from 37% the previous year; 33% came from Europe, down from 35%; Japan accounted for just over 10%. Revenue was impacted by higher unit volumes for Soliris (up 40%), and a decreased average price related to rebates in Europe. Acquisition related costs fell significantly from $22 million to just $5 million.[35] R&D spending reached a record high of $317 million in 2013 up 83% from the previous year.[6]
When Soliris was first approved, peak annual sales were estimated at $150 million.[17] However, by September 2013 quarterly sales of Soliris topped $400 million. Sales during the first quarter of 2015 were just over US$600 million, and are still on the rise.[7][17]
Before the Synageva purchase announcement, Alexion was valued at $34 billion.[7] The stock is up roughly 800% in the last five years and is currently trading at 46 times estimated earnings. Due to the niche nature of its market and the high cost of Soliris, the company has enjoyed a high profit margin.[17]

"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight.

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

History[edit]
Alexion Pharmaceuticals was founded in 1992 at Science Park in New Haven, Connecticut by Leonard Bell.[6] Bell would serve as the company's CEO until 2015.[7] In 2000, Alexion moved its headquarters from New Haven to Cheshire, Connecticut. Alexion moved back to New Haven following the completion of New Haven's Downtown Crossing project in December 2015 - Alexion's new headquarters are located at 100 College Street
Since 2006, Alexion has been a supporter of Healthcare Research and Quality studies at Duke University for aspirin and Clopidogrel (trade name Plavix).[6]
Alexion received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for Soliris in 2007. It was initially approved to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a rare blood disorder.[4] In 2010, there was an outbreak of hemolytic-uremic syndrome caused by Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) in Germany. Soliris was considered as a treatment option due to its effectiveness in treating Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, an illness similar to the one caused by the EHEC infection. As a result, Alexion's German subsidiary provided an unspecified number of Soliris doses at no charge to physicians who requested it.[8]
In April 2011, Alexion was added to the NASDAQ-100, a group composed of the 100 largest non-financial stocks traded on the Nasdaq; with a market value of USD 8.5 billion it replaced Genzyme Corporation.[9]
In April 2015, Bell was replaced as CEO by David Hallal.[7] In 2016, the company became a member of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA).[10]
In December 2016, Alexion's board of directors announced new leadership. The board identified David Brennan, formerly of AZ and a current board member as the interim CEO to replace David Hallal. David Anderson, formerly the CFO of Honeywell, was appointed as the new CFO replacing Vikas Sinha.[11] In March 2017, Alexion named Ludwig N. Hantson as its new CEO.[12]
Acquisitions[edit]
In 2000, Alexion purchased Proliferon Inc., a San Diego, California based development-stage biopharmaceutical firm, for US$41 million in Alexion stock. Alexion CEO, Leonard Bell, cited Proliferon's ability to produce an "unlimited amount of antibodies" as the reason for the acquisition. At the time Proliferon's annual revenue was about $2.5 million and its assets were valued at $2.1 million.[13][14] The company has since been renamed Alexion Antibody Technologies Inc.
In December 2011, Alexion acquired Montreal-based Enobia Pharma Corp for $610 million upfront and up to another $470 million later, contingent on company sales and regulatory goals. The $610 million includes $300 million in bank debt. Enobia is the developer of asfotase alpha, a drug used to treat the genetic disorder hypophosphatasia.[15]
In May 2015, Alexion announced plans to purchase the Lexington firm Synageva BioPharma, a maker of rare disease treatments run by ex-Genzyme executive Sanj Patel, who negotiated an $8.4 billion stock-and-cash deal.[16] In the deal, each share of Synageva, which is traded on NASDAQ, will be exchanged for $115 in cash and 0.6581 shares of Alexion stock. The price represented more than a 135% premium over Synageva's market cap at the time.[7] It also represents a valuation of about ten times projected peak sales, double what is typical for the biotech industry.[17] Analysis by The Wall Street Journal suggested the large premium was due to the perceived value of rare disease treatments which usually are very expensive when compared to treatments for more common diseases.[7] Alexion is thus seeking a stronger position in the lucrative rare disease market, and is willing to pay a premium to obtain that position. The rare disease market is seen as desirable because insurers have minimal motive to deny claims (due to small population sizes of patients) and are unable to negotiate better drug prices due to lack of competition.[18]
Alexion said it expects to save $150 million in costs by the end of 2017 by combining with Synageva. It does not expect revenue and earnings per share to increase until 2018. The deal would give Alexion a total of eight drugs in clinical trials, and 30 others in preclinical trials. Synageva's main drug, Kanuma, could receive approval in the United States and Europe as early as the third quarter of 2015.[7] The boards of both companies have approved the merger which is expected to complete in mid-2015.[18] Alexion shares fell 8.9% the day after the deal was announced.[7]

Products[edit]
Specialty drugs[edit]
Main article: Specialty drugs
Alexion has employed a strategy of developing drugs to combat rare diseases. Since the targeted user base is small for such drugs, clinical drugs tend to be quicker and cheaper than those for mass market drugs. Additionally, big pharmaceutical companies have tended to ignore these markets, creating a niche with minimal competition for Alexion. Insurance companies have generally been willing to pay high prices for such drugs; since few of their customers need the drugs, a high price does not significantly impact the insurance companies outlays.[17] "The success of specialty drugs for rare diseases comes at a time when the traditional drug business of selling medicines to the masses is in decline...Specialty drugs have gotten more expensive than anyone imagined."[20]
Soliris[edit]
Main article: Eculizumab
Alexion's first drug, Soliris, used to treat the rare disorders atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).[3] It has been approved for use in Canada, the European Union, Japan, and the United States; however, availability in Canada is limited. In Canada, access to the drug is mostly through private clinics; groups such as the Canadian Association of PNH Patients are lobbying to change that.[21] The drug costs roughly $450,000 a year, and is considered the world's most expensive drug.[4][7] The price of the drug is so high that very few individuals can pay the price. As a result, Alexion hires public relations firms to help families institute campaigns to pressure their governments to pay for the drug. Alexion is putting pressure on to governments to receive their payments from the public purse. The prices charged have a very high margin above the cost price. In addition, much of the research for the development of Soliris originates from publicly funded universities. There is an ethical question as to the pricing of the drug and the ethics of the drug manufacturer. Alexion is well on the way to developing a second very high price and high margined drug.[22]
In September 2011, the FDA officially approved the use of Soliris as a treatment for atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome in both adults and children. More than half of people with aHUS end up dying of it as a result of damage to vital organs/organ failure (usually involving the kidneys) caused by uncontrolled complement activation. The FDA's decision to grant approval received a positive response from the medical community with the director of Pediatric Nephrology at Atlanta's Children's hospital calling it "the most important advance that has been made for patients and families with this disease".[23]
By 2010 Soliris was considered to be the most expensive drug in the world.[20] It costs £340,200 per year for treatment in the UK[24][25] and $500,000 a year in Canada.[24][25][26] and US$409,500 a year in the United States (2010).[20] In the case of the rarest diseases that afflict fewer than 10,000 people, biotech companies who own the only approved drugs to treat those diseases "can charge pretty much whatever they want." "Before testing Soliris for PNH, Alexion tested the drug for rheumatoid arthritis, which afflicts 1 million Americans. The trials failed. But if it had worked for arthritis, Alexion would likely have had to charge a much lower price for this use, as it would have to compete against drugs that cost a mere $20,000." Alexion started selling Soliris in 2008 making $295 million in 2007 with its stock price rising to 130% in 2010.[26]
In April and May 2013, a controversy arose in Belgium when the media revealed that the government had refused to pay for a seven-year-old boy's treatment because Soliris was too expensive. The boy's medicine cost 9,000 euros every two weeks.[27] On May 4, 2013, De Standaard reported that a press relations (PR) agency working for Alexion had helped the boy's parents communicate their story to the press.[28] It was also reported that the parents had believed their benefactor was a Dutch organization for patients, and that the PR agency acted with permission from Alexion.[29][30] Several politicians stated that the company was attempting to 'blackmail' the government, charges which Alexion denied.[31] By May 7, 2013 an agreement had been reached to reimburse the medicine.[32][33]
Pharma, the Belgian pharmaceutical industry's association, opened an internal investigation into the affair, for possible breach of the association's ethical standards by Alexion. However, on June 12, Alexion received a court gag order against Pharma, preventing it from communicating its investigation. At the same time, Pharma opened a court case against Alexion Pharma Belgium. The gag order was revoked by the end of September 2013,[34] but the case was still pending in March 2015.[33]
Strensiq[edit]
In October 2015, Alexion's second drug, Strensiq (asfotase alfa), was approved by the US FDA. It is used to treat hypophosphatasia, a rare metabolic disorder.
Kanuma[edit]
Kanuma, which Alexion acquired in its acquisition of Synageva, was approved in 2015 to treat Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency, a fatal genetic disorder that cause fatty material to build up in blood vessel walls, the liver, and other tissues.[7] Alexion estimates that the drug could eventually have annual sales of more than $1 billion.[18]
Financials[edit]
In 2013, 36% Alexion's sales originated in the US, down from 37% the previous year; 33% came from Europe, down from 35%; Japan accounted for just over 10%. Revenue was impacted by higher unit volumes for Soliris (up 40%), and a decreased average price related to rebates in Europe. Acquisition related costs fell significantly from $22 million to just $5 million.[35] R&D spending reached a record high of $317 million in 2013 up 83% from the previous year.[6]
When Soliris was first approved, peak annual sales were estimated at $150 million.[17] However, by September 2013 quarterly sales of Soliris topped $400 million. Sales during the first quarter of 2015 were just over US$600 million, and are still on the rise.[7][17]
Before the Synageva purchase announcement, Alexion was valued at $34 billion.[7] The stock is up roughly 800% in the last five years and is currently trading at 46 times estimated earnings. Due to the niche nature of its market and the high cost of Soliris, the company has enjoyed a high profit margin.[17]

History[edit]
Alexion Pharmaceuticals was founded in 1992 at Science Park in New Haven, Connecticut by Leonard Bell.[6] Bell would serve as the company's CEO until 2015.[7] In 2000, Alexion moved its headquarters from New Haven to Cheshire, Connecticut. Alexion moved back to New Haven following the completion of New Haven's Downtown Crossing project in December 2015 - Alexion's new headquarters are located at 100 College Street
Since 2006, Alexion has been a supporter of Healthcare Research and Quality studies at Duke University for aspirin and Clopidogrel (trade name Plavix).[6]
Alexion received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for Soliris in 2007. It was initially approved to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a rare blood disorder.[4] In 2010, there was an outbreak of hemolytic-uremic syndrome caused by Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) in Germany. Soliris was considered as a treatment option due to its effectiveness in treating Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, an illness similar to the one caused by the EHEC infection. As a result, Alexion's German subsidiary provided an unspecified number of Soliris doses at no charge to physicians who requested it.[8]
In April 2011, Alexion was added to the NASDAQ-100, a group composed of the 100 largest non-financial stocks traded on the Nasdaq; with a market value of USD 8.5 billion it replaced Genzyme Corporation.[9]
In April 2015, Bell was replaced as CEO by David Hallal.[7] In 2016, the company became a member of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA).[10]
In December 2016, Alexion's board of directors announced new leadership. The board identified David Brennan, formerly of AZ and a current board member as the interim CEO to replace David Hallal. David Anderson, formerly the CFO of Honeywell, was appointed as the new CFO replacing Vikas Sinha.[11] In March 2017, Alexion named Ludwig N. Hantson as its new CEO.[12]
Acquisitions[edit]
In 2000, Alexion purchased Proliferon Inc., a San Diego, California based development-stage biopharmaceutical firm, for US$41 million in Alexion stock. Alexion CEO, Leonard Bell, cited Proliferon's ability to produce an "unlimited amount of antibodies" as the reason for the acquisition. At the time Proliferon's annual revenue was about $2.5 million and its assets were valued at $2.1 million.[13][14] The company has since been renamed Alexion Antibody Technologies Inc.
In December 2011, Alexion acquired Montreal-based Enobia Pharma Corp for $610 million upfront and up to another $470 million later, contingent on company sales and regulatory goals. The $610 million includes $300 million in bank debt. Enobia is the developer of asfotase alpha, a drug used to treat the genetic disorder hypophosphatasia.[15]
In May 2015, Alexion announced plans to purchase the Lexington firm Synageva BioPharma, a maker of rare disease treatments run by ex-Genzyme executive Sanj Patel, who negotiated an $8.4 billion stock-and-cash deal.[16] In the deal, each share of Synageva, which is traded on NASDAQ, will be exchanged for $115 in cash and 0.6581 shares of Alexion stock. The price represented more than a 135% premium over Synageva's market cap at the time.[7] It also represents a valuation of about ten times projected peak sales, double what is typical for the biotech industry.[17] Analysis by The Wall Street Journal suggested the large premium was due to the perceived value of rare disease treatments which usually are very expensive when compared to treatments for more common diseases.[7] Alexion is thus seeking a stronger position in the lucrative rare disease market, and is willing to pay a premium to obtain that position. The rare disease market is seen as desirable because insurers have minimal motive to deny claims (due to small population sizes of patients) and are unable to negotiate better drug prices due to lack of competition.[18]
Alexion said it expects to save $150 million in costs by the end of 2017 by combining with Synageva. It does not expect revenue and earnings per share to increase until 2018. The deal would give Alexion a total of eight drugs in clinical trials, and 30 others in preclinical trials. Synageva's main drug, Kanuma, could receive approval in the United States and Europe as early as the third quarter of 2015.[7] The boards of both companies have approved the merger which is expected to complete in mid-2015.[18] Alexion shares fell 8.9% the day after the deal was announced.[7]

Products[edit]
Specialty drugs[edit]
Main article: Specialty drugs
Alexion has employed a strategy of developing drugs to combat rare diseases. Since the targeted user base is small for such drugs, clinical drugs tend to be quicker and cheaper than those for mass market drugs. Additionally, big pharmaceutical companies have tended to ignore these markets, creating a niche with minimal competition for Alexion. Insurance companies have generally been willing to pay high prices for such drugs; since few of their customers need the drugs, a high price does not significantly impact the insurance companies outlays.[17] "The success of specialty drugs for rare diseases comes at a time when the traditional drug business of selling medicines to the masses is in decline...Specialty drugs have gotten more expensive than anyone imagined."[20]
Soliris[edit]
Main article: Eculizumab
Alexion's first drug, Soliris, used to treat the rare disorders atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).[3] It has been approved for use in Canada, the European Union, Japan, and the United States; however, availability in Canada is limited. In Canada, access to the drug is mostly through private clinics; groups such as the Canadian Association of PNH Patients are lobbying to change that.[21] The drug costs roughly $450,000 a year, and is considered the world's most expensive drug.[4][7] The price of the drug is so high that very few individuals can pay the price. As a result, Alexion hires public relations firms to help families institute campaigns to pressure their governments to pay for the drug. Alexion is putting pressure on to governments to receive their payments from the public purse. The prices charged have a very high margin above the cost price. In addition, much of the research for the development of Soliris originates from publicly funded universities. There is an ethical question as to the pricing of the drug and the ethics of the drug manufacturer. Alexion is well on the way to developing a second very high price and high margined drug.[22]
In September 2011, the FDA officially approved the use of Soliris as a treatment for atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome in both adults and children. More than half of people with aHUS end up dying of it as a result of damage to vital organs/organ failure (usually involving the kidneys) caused by uncontrolled complement activation. The FDA's decision to grant approval received a positive response from the medical community with the director of Pediatric Nephrology at Atlanta's Children's hospital calling it "the most important advance that has been made for patients and families with this disease".[23]
By 2010 Soliris was considered to be the most expensive drug in the world.[20] It costs £340,200 per year for treatment in the UK[24][25] and $500,000 a year in Canada.[24][25][26] and US$409,500 a year in the United States (2010).[20] In the case of the rarest diseases that afflict fewer than 10,000 people, biotech companies who own the only approved drugs to treat those diseases "can charge pretty much whatever they want." "Before testing Soliris for PNH, Alexion tested the drug for rheumatoid arthritis, which afflicts 1 million Americans. The trials failed. But if it had worked for arthritis, Alexion would likely have had to charge a much lower price for this use, as it would have to compete against drugs that cost a mere $20,000." Alexion started selling Soliris in 2008 making $295 million in 2007 with its stock price rising to 130% in 2010.[26]
In April and May 2013, a controversy arose in Belgium when the media revealed that the government had refused to pay for a seven-year-old boy's treatment because Soliris was too expensive. The boy's medicine cost 9,000 euros every two weeks.[27] On May 4, 2013, De Standaard reported that a press relations (PR) agency working for Alexion had helped the boy's parents communicate their story to the press.[28] It was also reported that the parents had believed their benefactor was a Dutch organization for patients, and that the PR agency acted with permission from Alexion.[29][30] Several politicians stated that the company was attempting to 'blackmail' the government, charges which Alexion denied.[31] By May 7, 2013 an agreement had been reached to reimburse the medicine.[32][33]
Pharma, the Belgian pharmaceutical industry's association, opened an internal investigation into the affair, for possible breach of the association's ethical standards by Alexion. However, on June 12, Alexion received a court gag order against Pharma, preventing it from communicating its investigation. At the same time, Pharma opened a court case against Alexion Pharma Belgium. The gag order was revoked by the end of September 2013,[34] but the case was still pending in March 2015.[33]
Strensiq[edit]
In October 2015, Alexion's second drug, Strensiq (asfotase alfa), was approved by the US FDA. It is used to treat hypophosphatasia, a rare metabolic disorder.
Kanuma[edit]
Kanuma, which Alexion acquired in its acquisition of Synageva, was approved in 2015 to treat Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency, a fatal genetic disorder that cause fatty material to build up in blood vessel walls, the liver, and other tissues.[7] Alexion estimates that the drug could eventually have annual sales of more than $1 billion.[18]
Financials[edit]
In 2013, 36% Alexion's sales originated in the US, down from 37% the previous year; 33% came from Europe, down from 35%; Japan accounted for just over 10%. Revenue was impacted by higher unit volumes for Soliris (up 40%), and a decreased average price related to rebates in Europe. Acquisition related costs fell significantly from $22 million to just $5 million.[35] R&D spending reached a record high of $317 million in 2013 up 83% from the previous year.[6]
When Soliris was first approved, peak annual sales were estimated at $150 million.[17] However, by September 2013 quarterly sales of Soliris topped $400 million. Sales during the first quarter of 2015 were just over US$600 million, and are still on the rise.[7][17]
Before the Synageva purchase announcement, Alexion was valued at $34 billion.[7] The stock is up roughly 800% in the last five years and is currently trading at 46 times estimated earnings. Due to the niche nature of its market and the high cost of Soliris, the company has enjoyed a high profit margin.[17]

History[edit]
Alexion Pharmaceuticals was founded in 1992 at Science Park in New Haven, Connecticut by Leonard Bell.[6] Bell would serve as the company's CEO until 2015.[7] In 2000, Alexion moved its headquarters from New Haven to Cheshire, Connecticut. Alexion moved back to New Haven following the completion of New Haven's Downtown Crossing project in December 2015 - Alexion's new headquarters are located at 100 College Street
Since 2006, Alexion has been a supporter of Healthcare Research and Quality studies at Duke University for aspirin and Clopidogrel (trade name Plavix).[6]
Alexion received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for Soliris in 2007. It was initially approved to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a rare blood disorder.[4] In 2010, there was an outbreak of hemolytic-uremic syndrome caused by Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) in Germany. Soliris was considered as a treatment option due to its effectiveness in treating Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, an illness similar to the one caused by the EHEC infection. As a result, Alexion's German subsidiary provided an unspecified number of Soliris doses at no charge to physicians who requested it.[8]
In April 2011, Alexion was added to the NASDAQ-100, a group composed of the 100 largest non-financial stocks traded on the Nasdaq; with a market value of USD 8.5 billion it replaced Genzyme Corporation.[9]
In April 2015, Bell was replaced as CEO by David Hallal.[7] In 2016, the company became a member of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA).[10]
In December 2016, Alexion's board of directors announced new leadership. The board identified David Brennan, formerly of AZ and a current board member as the interim CEO to replace David Hallal. David Anderson, formerly the CFO of Honeywell, was appointed as the new CFO replacing Vikas Sinha.[11] In March 2017, Alexion named Ludwig N. Hantson as its new CEO.[12]
Acquisitions[edit]
In 2000, Alexion purchased Proliferon Inc., a San Diego, California based development-stage biopharmaceutical firm, for US$41 million in Alexion stock. Alexion CEO, Leonard Bell, cited Proliferon's ability to produce an "unlimited amount of antibodies" as the reason for the acquisition. At the time Proliferon's annual revenue was about $2.5 million and its assets were valued at $2.1 million.[13][14] The company has since been renamed Alexion Antibody Technologies Inc.
In December 2011, Alexion acquired Montreal-based Enobia Pharma Corp for $610 million upfront and up to another $470 million later, contingent on company sales and regulatory goals. The $610 million includes $300 million in bank debt. Enobia is the developer of asfotase alpha, a drug used to treat the genetic disorder hypophosphatasia.[15]
In May 2015, Alexion announced plans to purchase the Lexington firm Synageva BioPharma, a maker of rare disease treatments run by ex-Genzyme executive Sanj Patel, who negotiated an $8.4 billion stock-and-cash deal.[16] In the deal, each share of Synageva, which is traded on NASDAQ, will be exchanged for $115 in cash and 0.6581 shares of Alexion stock. The price represented more than a 135% premium over Synageva's market cap at the time.[7] It also represents a valuation of about ten times projected peak sales, double what is typical for the biotech industry.[17] Analysis by The Wall Street Journal suggested the large premium was due to the perceived value of rare disease treatments which usually are very expensive when compared to treatments for more common diseases.[7] Alexion is thus seeking a stronger position in the lucrative rare disease market, and is willing to pay a premium to obtain that position. The rare disease market is seen as desirable because insurers have minimal motive to deny claims (due to small population sizes of patients) and are unable to negotiate better drug prices due to lack of competition.[18]
Alexion said it expects to save $150 million in costs by the end of 2017 by combining with Synageva. It does not expect revenue and earnings per share to increase until 2018. The deal would give Alexion a total of eight drugs in clinical trials, and 30 others in preclinical trials. Synageva's main drug, Kanuma, could receive approval in the United States and Europe as early as the third quarter of 2015.[7] The boards of both companies have approved the merger which is expected to complete in mid-2015.[18] Alexion shares fell 8.9% the day after the deal was announced.[7]

Products[edit]
Specialty drugs[edit]
Main article: Specialty drugs
Alexion has employed a strategy of developing drugs to combat rare diseases. Since the targeted user base is small for such drugs, clinical drugs tend to be quicker and cheaper than those for mass market drugs. Additionally, big pharmaceutical companies have tended to ignore these markets, creating a niche with minimal competition for Alexion. Insurance companies have generally been willing to pay high prices for such drugs; since few of their customers need the drugs, a high price does not significantly impact the insurance companies outlays.[17] "The success of specialty drugs for rare diseases comes at a time when the traditional drug business of selling medicines to the masses is in decline...Specialty drugs have gotten more expensive than anyone imagined."[20]
Soliris[edit]
Main article: Eculizumab
Alexion's first drug, Soliris, used to treat the rare disorders atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).[3] It has been approved for use in Canada, the European Union, Japan, and the United States; however, availability in Canada is limited. In Canada, access to the drug is mostly through private clinics; groups such as the Canadian Association of PNH Patients are lobbying to change that.[21] The drug costs roughly $450,000 a year, and is considered the world's most expensive drug.[4][7] The price of the drug is so high that very few individuals can pay the price. As a result, Alexion hires public relations firms to help families institute campaigns to pressure their governments to pay for the drug. Alexion is putting pressure on to governments to receive their payments from the public purse. The prices charged have a very high margin above the cost price. In addition, much of the research for the development of Soliris originates from publicly funded universities. There is an ethical question as to the pricing of the drug and the ethics of the drug manufacturer. Alexion is well on the way to developing a second very high price and high margined drug.[22]
In September 2011, the FDA officially approved the use of Soliris as a treatment for atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome in both adults and children. More than half of people with aHUS end up dying of it as a result of damage to vital organs/organ failure (usually involving the kidneys) caused by uncontrolled complement activation. The FDA's decision to grant approval received a positive response from the medical community with the director of Pediatric Nephrology at Atlanta's Children's hospital calling it "the most important advance that has been made for patients and families with this disease".[23]
By 2010 Soliris was considered to be the most expensive drug in the world.[20] It costs £340,200 per year for treatment in the UK[24][25] and $500,000 a year in Canada.[24][25][26] and US$409,500 a year in the United States (2010).[20] In the case of the rarest diseases that afflict fewer than 10,000 people, biotech companies who own the only approved drugs to treat those diseases "can charge pretty much whatever they want." "Before testing Soliris for PNH, Alexion tested the drug for rheumatoid arthritis, which afflicts 1 million Americans. The trials failed. But if it had worked for arthritis, Alexion would likely have had to charge a much lower price for this use, as it would have to compete against drugs that cost a mere $20,000." Alexion started selling Soliris in 2008 making $295 million in 2007 with its stock price rising to 130% in 2010.[26]
In April and May 2013, a controversy arose in Belgium when the media revealed that the government had refused to pay for a seven-year-old boy's treatment because Soliris was too expensive. The boy's medicine cost 9,000 euros every two weeks.[27] On May 4, 2013, De Standaard reported that a press relations (PR) agency working for Alexion had helped the boy's parents communicate their story to the press.[28] It was also reported that the parents had believed their benefactor was a Dutch organization for patients, and that the PR agency acted with permission from Alexion.[29][30] Several politicians stated that the company was attempting to 'blackmail' the government, charges which Alexion denied.[31] By May 7, 2013 an agreement had been reached to reimburse the medicine.[32][33]
Pharma, the Belgian pharmaceutical industry's association, opened an internal investigation into the affair, for possible breach of the association's ethical standards by Alexion. However, on June 12, Alexion received a court gag order against Pharma, preventing it from communicating its investigation. At the same time, Pharma opened a court case against Alexion Pharma Belgium. The gag order was revoked by the end of September 2013,[34] but the case was still pending in March 2015.[33]
Strensiq[edit]
In October 2015, Alexion's second drug, Strensiq (asfotase alfa), was approved by the US FDA. It is used to treat hypophosphatasia, a rare metabolic disorder.
Kanuma[edit]
Kanuma, which Alexion acquired in its acquisition of Synageva, was approved in 2015 to treat Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency, a fatal genetic disorder that cause fatty material to build up in blood vessel walls, the liver, and other tissues.[7] Alexion estimates that the drug could eventually have annual sales of more than $1 billion.[18]
Financials[edit]
In 2013, 36% Alexion's sales originated in the US, down from 37% the previous year; 33% came from Europe, down from 35%; Japan accounted for just over 10%. Revenue was impacted by higher unit volumes for Soliris (up 40%), and a decreased average price related to rebates in Europe. Acquisition related costs fell significantly from $22 million to just $5 million.[35] R&D spending reached a record high of $317 million in 2013 up 83% from the previous year.[6]
When Soliris was first approved, peak annual sales were estimated at $150 million.[17] However, by September 2013 quarterly sales of Soliris topped $400 million. Sales during the first quarter of 2015 were just over US$600 million, and are still on the rise.[7][17]
Before the Synageva purchase announcement, Alexion was valued at $34 billion.[7] The stock is up roughly 800% in the last five years and is currently trading at 46 times estimated earnings. Due to the niche nature of its market and the high cost of Soliris, the company has enjoyed a high profit margin.[17]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).
