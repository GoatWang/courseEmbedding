Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

The Business Gold Rewards Card from American Express OPEN


                                            Approached at airport to sign up for this card. Already had a few. Signed up anyway as some pressure applied.

Bed Bath & Beyond® Credit Card


                                            The Bed Bath & Beyond Mastercard was purchased from US Bank in October 2016. My advice: If you have been with US Bank and made the transition to Comenity - check your credit report. Comenity reports twice and never reports the old account closed, so it looks like you have 2...show more

Woodforest National Bank


                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

Veridian Credit Union


                                            i love banking with veridian, but the new updated online banking is garbage.10x harder to navigate than before staring from the log in page. Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

                                            You will never get a credit line increase. I have good credit and zero late payments and get turned down every time. I don't have this problem with any of my other credit accounts. Had my account over a year in good standing. Paid it down to zero twice. What a joke!
