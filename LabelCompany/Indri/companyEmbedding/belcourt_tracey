    Between 2010 and 2013, Hubert led the European and Global Coffee category for Mondelēz International, overseeing the expansion of the Tassimo multi-beverage system and new product launches such as Millicano whole-bean instant coffee. Under his tenure, the Coffee category grew by around 5% annually, propelled by around 25% year-on-year growth in Tassimo. The category fully embraced the trend among European consumers for on-demand coffee and realized its ambition to become a truly global business, with an 11% share of the global market and the number two global market position.

In 2012, Hubert launched a multi-year USD 200 million commitment to coffee, called Coffee Made Happy that builds on the sustainable coffee sourcing commitment and aims to create one million coffee entrepreneurs by the year 2020. Alongside his dedication to sustainability, Hubert’s focus on people and teams has prompted his ongoing campaign for a radical simplification of processes and systems in the European business, calling for the organization to “keep it simple” and to free up resources to focus on the essentials.

    A graduate in economics and business, Hubert studied at the University of Stuttgart-Hohenheim. Married with two children, his passion for food extends to his private interest in cooking and entertaining. He lives in Zurich.
