Explanation of Responses:
1. This sale was effected pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan adopted by the reporting person on August 31, 2016 to satisfy the reporting person's tax withholding obligation upon scheduled vesting of restricted stock units granted on October 1, 2014.
2. This transaction was executed in multiple trades at prices ranging from $39.23 to $39.98. The price reported in Column 4 is a weighted average price. The reporting person hereby undertakes to provide upon request to the SEC staff, the issuer or a security holder of the issuer full information regarding the number of shares and prices at which the transaction were effected.
3. Each performance restricted stock unit ("PRSU") represents a contingent right to receive one share of Issuer common stock. A percentage of PRSUs will vest upon the achievement of annual revenue goals and non-GAAP net income (loss) goals during the period of January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016. Vesting of the PRSUs will accelerate upon death or disability in an amount equal to the proportion of days in the performance period worked. Vesting of PRSUs may also accelerate in certain circumstances if there is a change in control of the Issuer during the performance period.
4. Each performance restricted stock unit ("PRSU") represents a contingent right to receive one share of Issuer common stock.  PRSUs vest upon the achievement of adjusted EBITDA and compounded annual revenue growth rate goals during the period of January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2017.  Vesting of the target level PRSUs will accelerate upon death or disability in an amount equal to the proportion of days in the performance period worked. Vesting of target PRSUs may also accelerate in certain circumstances if there is a change in control of the Issuer during the performance period.

To the Eickstedt Family: My family and I would like to express our deepest sympathyover the loss of Raymond. He will be missedby everyone who knew him. When we read Genesis 1:28 and 31, we find that sickness anddeath were not a part of God's original purpose. How thankful we are thatour grand Creator plans to restore his original purpose and make it possiblefor all mankind (including resurrected loved ones we have lost in death) tolive forever under perfect conditions.
