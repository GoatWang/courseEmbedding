Products > Business Phone Systems > Features > Hosted PBX



Hosted PBX. Virtual PBX.
 Cloud PBX.

A virtual PBX is the modern alternative to costly, clunky PBX equipment that is tied to one location. Unite your whole company with a virtual PBX in the cloud.


Hosted PBX. Virtual PBX. Cloud PBX. What does it really mean? Instead of that ungainly PBX box in the telecom closet, 8x8 delivers all hosted PBX phone services right over your Internet connection using VoIP technology. With 8x8, your virtual PBX phone service is affordable, simple to manage and gives your whole company access to enterprise-class features that other providers charge extra for.
8x8 Hosted PBX Business Phone Service Benefits

Lose the big box and the big fees—No need to buy, lease, or pay maintenance fees on a complex PBX system at your office; your hosted PBX solution is delivered right over your Internet connection.
Save a lot—We usually save businesses about 50% off their phone bill and up to 90% off what it would cost them to invest in a traditional PBX system.
Simplify with one company—Get everything you need from one company: your phones, all your calling features, and your local, long distance and international calls.
Put all employees under the same phone system—Distributed locations, office workers, home-based employees and traveling staff all share the same virtual PBX features; so no matter where they are located, they are only an extension call away from each other.
Grow at your own pace—Order as many extensions as you need now; add more extensions, fax lines, anytime.

How a Virtual PBX Helps Your Business
You get an amazing business phone system that works exactly like you would expect it to. But it’s virtual. All you need are phones and an Internet connection. Meanwhile, we own and manage all the virtual PBX equipment, software, and upgrades behind the scenes so you don’t have to.

Introduction to Business VoIPChances are, you already use some form of VoIP or internet phone service through your business phone line. If you’ve ever used Skype or WhatsApp, or any kind of Internet phone to make a call, you’re experiencing the power of Voice Over IP, or to put it simply-making calls over the internet. When it comes to integrating VoIP into your business line, there are some factors to consider before you choose a provider. The top VoIP providers can help you lower costs, reach more customers, and even enhance your mobility and productivity. The wrong VoIP companies could be too expensive for you or simply not understand the importance of this tool in your business.Benefits of Having a Businesses VoIP Phone SystemThe full benefits of having a Voice over IP business phone will depend on the size and type of business you own. However, loosely speaking, many business benefit from:Lower Costs - Businesses on average see a reduction in costs of between 50% and 75% after switching to VoIP. This is a combination of reduced communication expenses and logistical benefits.Productivity - Investing in internet phone allows companies to let their employees work remotely, which can increase productivity by almost 20%. Also, employees will be able to reach each other more easily, thus saving time.Reliability - Because of QoS (Quality of service) protocols, common issues like jitter, latency or delay are monitored for a satisfactory standard for business practice. In a recent study, less than 0.5% of survey respondents reported being dissatisfied with VoIP call quality.Customer Satisfaction - Unsatisfied customers would rather switch services than complain, so customer service needs to be more on top of visitors needs than ever before. Giving your customers more ways to reach your business is simple with the help of VoIP. This could be helping employees work remotely, increasing ‘office hours’ or just offering the customers a number to call when a problem arises.VoIP FeaturesVoice over IP companies will differ greatly from one to the next. Some of the most popular features are:Call routingCall recordingMigration of your current numbersVoicemail transcriptionSoftware Phone24/7 Tech supportSIP phone supportToll-Free optionsSpeed dialSMS MessagingE911 servicesGroup callingVideo ConferencingVoicemail to EmailTypes of VoIP SystemsThe biggest difference in costs is going to be dependent on the type of VoIP service you choose for your business. There are three main types of VoIP systems available:Hosted System. Similar to a website hosting plan, this means that the vendor owns the hardware, and your business leases or buys the phones. Maintenance will be handled by the vendor, too. Companies will usually charge a subscription to use the internet business phone system. This includes lower costs up-front, and no maintenance, so it works well for businesses without their own IT staff. However, it is less customizable and reliant on the vendor’s servers.On Premise System. In this scenario, your business owns the hardware, and that means that you are responsible for any upgrades or maintenance work. You’ll of course have a higher initial cost, but if you’re a larger business who wants the best options for customization and security-it could be a good choice.Managed System. The business still owns the equipment, but the vendor takes responsibility of the hard work like set up and maintenance. This is a great ‘best of both worlds’ option, allowing you the good things about both on premise and hosted solutions. The costs are higher, and your downtime is more likely than if you went with a hosted solution.What to KnowHere are some of the most common VoIP related terms made simple:PBX: Private Branch Exchange is like a private telephone network which works within a company or organization. This might be in one building, across multiple offices, or even globally across many countries and time zones. The users of the system can easily communicate with one another on one private and secure business phone network. If your VoIP provider offers a PBX, this will be using your LAN or WAN data network rather than the traditional telephone network. There are many VoIP services which offer a PBX system, including some of the top providers on the market.VoIP and Call Centers: Traditional call centers have been completely revolutionized by VoIP technology. Customer service is improved by having ‘always on’ support, with better quality and efficiency. Customers can be immediately routed to the right technician for their query, improving technical support at every stage of the game. A Voice over IP system for a virtual call center means that you can integrate headquarters, remote offices and even outsourced locations seamlessly. You can even include agents who are working from home.Web Conferencing: VoIP can help your company make meetings easier and more efficient. Arrange for entire teams to meet ‘face to face’ without spending a cent on flights or managing dozens of schedules. Look for solutions which are multi-channel and don’t need specific hardware for a certain OS. Of course, you will need audio, video and chat capabilities. You might also want screen-sharing, uploading files, and recording functionality, too. If you’re looking to streamline your business, than web conferencing software might be for you.How to Choose a VoIP Provider for BusinessThere’s certainly a lot to think about! To help you make the best choice, and ensure you get all the features you need for the most competitive price on the market, our experts have done a lot of the hard work for you. Check out our comprehensive reviews to learn all about the features, pricing, and benefits of each of the best VoIP phone systems out there. You can also learn more about what a VoIP service can do for your business in our business VoIP blog.

Vik Verma loves to take complex technology and create products and services that deliver value for customers worldwide. For his work at Savi Technology on RFID and the Internet of Things—which revolutionized container tracking and security—the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2003 named Vik one of 40 “Technology Pioneers.” Now, Vik focuses on revolutionizing enterprise communications, with 8x8’s ground-breaking cloud unified communications and contact center technology.
Vik began his 26-year executive career with startup Savi Technology, where he was one of its first employees. He joined the company as a design engineer straight out of Stanford and then quickly rose through the ranks, first as VP of Engineering and then COO. As COO, he played a leading role in negotiating the sale of Savi to Texas Instruments. Subsequently promoted to CEO, Vik in partnership with leading VCs from Silicon Valley and Asia, led the management buyout of the company. Later, he re-engineered the business, quadrupled its size, executed a joint venture with Hutchison Whampoa and sold it to Lockheed Martin. At Lockheed Martin, as President of Strategic Venture Development, Vik focused on turning the company’s military technologies and programs into global commercial ventures ranging from seabed mining to nanomaterials.
Vik earned engineering degrees from the Florida Institute of Technology, the University of Michigan and Stanford University. He completed the trifecta of top management schools earning graduate executive credentials from Stanford, Harvard and the University of California at Berkeley. He also has been awarded 8 patents and was named a Tau Beta Pi Williams Fellow. His motto: “Use technology to cost effectively solve real world problems. The rest takes care of itself.”

History[edit]
8x8 was founded in 1987 by Dr. Chi-Shin Wang and Dr. Y.W. Sing formerly of Weitek as Integrated Information Technology, Inc., or IIT. The name was changed in the early 1990s.[3] They began IIT as a fabless vendor of semiconductor products for the math coprocessor and graphics chipset markets.[4] The company produced x87 floating point coprocessor for the 286, 386 and 486 generations of microprocessors as well as graphics accelerator chips for the personal computer market during the late 1980s and early 1990s.
In 1992 the company began shipping a lossless data compression product called Xtradrive. In the early 1990s IIT began producing chips, software and other technologies for the videoconferencing market. The company changed its name to 8x8 and began marketing its own set-top videoconferencing systems for consumers under the ViaTV brand. 8x8 went public on the NASDAQ market in 1997, trading under the ticker symbol EGHT.[5]
In January 1999, 8x8 launched a family of Voice over IP (VoIP) chips and software that were sold to IP phone, IP/PSTN gateway and other manufacturers of VoIP equipment. 8x8 acquired two companies (Odisei[6] and U|Force[7]), to acquire network/server VoIP technologies, and began selling an end-to-end VoIP services technology solution to service providers in 1999.
In 2002, the company relaunched itself as a VoIP service provider under the Packet8 brand. In 2003, it launched its first consumer videophone services on the Packet8 network. In 2004, the company became the first VoIP service provider to offer replacement, E-911 services to its subscribers.[8] It also launched a suite of business services called Packet8 Virtual Office. In July 2007, 8x8 "entered an agreement … to accept" the 200,000 customers who abruptly lost phone service when VoIP startup SunRocket was liquidated. At the time, the Washington Post described Packet8 as "the third-largest independent Internet-phone service provider with 181,000 customers."[9]
On 25 July 2002, 8x8 announced that its application for listing on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market had been approved. 8x8 retained its ticker symbol of EGHT, and began trading on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market on Friday, 26 July 2002.
On September 1, 2004, the company began selling their product at Fry's stores. 8x8 finished a series of TV commercials featuring San Francisco 49ers players.[10] In 2009, 8x8 added Unified Communications to their portfolio and a contact center solution and mobile solutions in 2011.
8x8 has been awarded 128 patents[11] related to semiconductors, computer architecture, video processing algorithms, videophones and communications technologies and security. In October 2014, 8x8 reported a customer base of more than 40,434 businesses.[12]
Acquisitions[edit]
In May 2010, 8x8 acquired Central Host, a California-based managed hosting company and began offering cloud-based hosting services.[13] In June 2011, 8x8 announced the acquisition of Zerigo, a Colorado-based cloud services company and began offering cloud servers and managed DNS services.[14] In September 2011, 8x8 acquired Contactual, a hosted contact center company. In 2013, 8x8 acquired UK-based Voicenet, a cloud services company and expanded its offering of the 8x8 portfolio of cloud communications services in the UK.[15]
In May 2015 8x8 acquired privately held UK-based DXI Ltd., a cloud-based contact center solutions vendor for $26 million in cash and stock. In June 2015 8x8 acquired assets of the privately held Delray Beach, Florida based Quality Software Corp. (QSC) as well as two affiliated companies.[16]
Recognition[edit]
In August 2014, Gartner positioned 8x8 in the Leaders Quadrant of its Magic Quadrant for UCaaS (Unified Communications as a Service) for the third consecutive year.[17]
In May, 2015, Infonetics Research named 8x8 as the #1 cloud unified communications provider in its 2015 Cloud UC North American Service Provider Scorecard.[18]

History[edit]
8x8 was founded in 1987 by Dr. Chi-Shin Wang and Dr. Y.W. Sing formerly of Weitek as Integrated Information Technology, Inc., or IIT. The name was changed in the early 1990s.[3] They began IIT as a fabless vendor of semiconductor products for the math coprocessor and graphics chipset markets.[4] The company produced x87 floating point coprocessor for the 286, 386 and 486 generations of microprocessors as well as graphics accelerator chips for the personal computer market during the late 1980s and early 1990s.
In 1992 the company began shipping a lossless data compression product called Xtradrive. In the early 1990s IIT began producing chips, software and other technologies for the videoconferencing market. The company changed its name to 8x8 and began marketing its own set-top videoconferencing systems for consumers under the ViaTV brand. 8x8 went public on the NASDAQ market in 1997, trading under the ticker symbol EGHT.[5]
In January 1999, 8x8 launched a family of Voice over IP (VoIP) chips and software that were sold to IP phone, IP/PSTN gateway and other manufacturers of VoIP equipment. 8x8 acquired two companies (Odisei[6] and U|Force[7]), to acquire network/server VoIP technologies, and began selling an end-to-end VoIP services technology solution to service providers in 1999.
In 2002, the company relaunched itself as a VoIP service provider under the Packet8 brand. In 2003, it launched its first consumer videophone services on the Packet8 network. In 2004, the company became the first VoIP service provider to offer replacement, E-911 services to its subscribers.[8] It also launched a suite of business services called Packet8 Virtual Office. In July 2007, 8x8 "entered an agreement … to accept" the 200,000 customers who abruptly lost phone service when VoIP startup SunRocket was liquidated. At the time, the Washington Post described Packet8 as "the third-largest independent Internet-phone service provider with 181,000 customers."[9]
On 25 July 2002, 8x8 announced that its application for listing on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market had been approved. 8x8 retained its ticker symbol of EGHT, and began trading on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market on Friday, 26 July 2002.

Products > Business Phone Systems > Features > Hosted PBX



Hosted PBX. Virtual PBX.
 Cloud PBX.

A virtual PBX is the modern alternative to costly, clunky PBX equipment that is tied to one location. Unite your whole company with a virtual PBX in the cloud.


Hosted PBX. Virtual PBX. Cloud PBX. What does it really mean? Instead of that ungainly PBX box in the telecom closet, 8x8 delivers all hosted PBX phone services right over your Internet connection using VoIP technology. With 8x8, your virtual PBX phone service is affordable, simple to manage and gives your whole company access to enterprise-class features that other providers charge extra for.
8x8 Hosted PBX Business Phone Service Benefits

Lose the big box and the big fees—No need to buy, lease, or pay maintenance fees on a complex PBX system at your office; your hosted PBX solution is delivered right over your Internet connection.
Save a lot—We usually save businesses about 50% off their phone bill and up to 90% off what it would cost them to invest in a traditional PBX system.
Simplify with one company—Get everything you need from one company: your phones, all your calling features, and your local, long distance and international calls.
Put all employees under the same phone system—Distributed locations, office workers, home-based employees and traveling staff all share the same virtual PBX features; so no matter where they are located, they are only an extension call away from each other.
Grow at your own pace—Order as many extensions as you need now; add more extensions, fax lines, anytime.

How a Virtual PBX Helps Your Business
You get an amazing business phone system that works exactly like you would expect it to. But it’s virtual. All you need are phones and an Internet connection. Meanwhile, we own and manage all the virtual PBX equipment, software, and upgrades behind the scenes so you don’t have to. Learn more about 8x8 Virtual Office, our hosted PBX service.

Introduction to Business VoIPChances are, you already use some form of VoIP or internet phone service through your business phone line. If you’ve ever used Skype or WhatsApp, or any kind of Internet phone to make a call, you’re experiencing the power of Voice Over IP, or to put it simply-making calls over the internet. When it comes to integrating VoIP into your business line, there are some factors to consider before you choose a provider. The top VoIP providers can help you lower costs, reach more customers, and even enhance your mobility and productivity. The wrong VoIP companies could be too expensive for you or simply not understand the importance of this tool in your business.Benefits of Having a Businesses VoIP Phone SystemThe full benefits of having a Voice over IP business phone will depend on the size and type of business you own. However, loosely speaking, many business benefit from:Lower Costs - Businesses on average see a reduction in costs of between 50% and 75% after switching to VoIP. This is a combination of reduced communication expenses and logistical benefits.Productivity - Investing in internet phone allows companies to let their employees work remotely, which can increase productivity by almost 20%. Also, employees will be able to reach each other more easily, thus saving time.Reliability - Because of QoS (Quality of service) protocols, common issues like jitter, latency or delay are monitored for a satisfactory standard for business practice. In a recent study, less than 0.5% of survey respondents reported being dissatisfied with VoIP call quality.Customer Satisfaction - Unsatisfied customers would rather switch services than complain, so customer service needs to be more on top of visitors needs than ever before. Giving your customers more ways to reach your business is simple with the help of VoIP. This could be helping employees work remotely, increasing ‘office hours’ or just offering the customers a number to call when a problem arises.VoIP FeaturesVoice over IP companies will differ greatly from one to the next. Some of the most popular features are:Call routingCall recordingMigration of your current numbersVoicemail transcriptionSoftware Phone24/7 Tech supportSIP phone supportToll-Free optionsSpeed dialSMS MessagingE911 servicesGroup callingVideo ConferencingVoicemail to EmailTypes of VoIP SystemsThe biggest difference in costs is going to be dependent on the type of VoIP service you choose for your business. There are three main types of VoIP systems available:Hosted System. Similar to a website hosting plan, this means that the vendor owns the hardware, and your business leases or buys the phones. Maintenance will be handled by the vendor, too. Companies will usually charge a subscription to use the internet business phone system. This includes lower costs up-front, and no maintenance, so it works well for businesses without their own IT staff. However, it is less customizable and reliant on the vendor’s servers.On Premise System. In this scenario, your business owns the hardware, and that means that you are responsible for any upgrades or maintenance work. You’ll of course have a higher initial cost, but if you’re a larger business who wants the best options for customization and security-it could be a good choice.Managed System. The business still owns the equipment, but the vendor takes responsibility of the hard work like set up and maintenance. This is a great ‘best of both worlds’ option, allowing you the good things about both on premise and hosted solutions. The costs are higher, and your downtime is more likely than if you went with a hosted solution.What to KnowHere are some of the most common VoIP related terms made simple:PBX: Private Branch Exchange is like a private telephone network which works within a company or organization. This might be in one building, across multiple offices, or even globally across many countries and time zones. The users of the system can easily communicate with one another on one private and secure business phone network. If your VoIP provider offers a PBX, this will be using your LAN or WAN data network rather than the traditional telephone network. There are many VoIP services which offer a PBX system, including some of the top providers on the market.VoIP and Call Centers: Traditional call centers have been completely revolutionized by VoIP technology. Customer service is improved by having ‘always on’ support, with better quality and efficiency. Customers can be immediately routed to the right technician for their query, improving technical support at every stage of the game. A Voice over IP system for a virtual call center means that you can integrate headquarters, remote offices and even outsourced locations seamlessly. You can even include agents who are working from home.Web Conferencing: VoIP can help your company make meetings easier and more efficient. Arrange for entire teams to meet ‘face to face’ without spending a cent on flights or managing dozens of schedules. Look for solutions which are multi-channel and don’t need specific hardware for a certain OS. Of course, you will need audio, video and chat capabilities. You might also want screen-sharing, uploading files, and recording functionality, too. If you’re looking to streamline your business, than web conferencing software might be for you.How to Choose a VoIP Provider for BusinessThere’s certainly a lot to think about!
