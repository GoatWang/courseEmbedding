J’ai eu ce privilège de travailler avec Robert de 2014 à 2016. Nous avions à l’époque beaucoup de défis. Je me souviens comment Robert était un beau leader et surtout un bon mentor pour l’équipe. Nous avons atteints nos objectifs constamment et aidé à la croissance de l’équipe. Il est un exemple à suivre pour son service à la clientèle auprès des candidats et clients.

Il m’a aidé beaucoup dans mon développement chez Randstad avec ses conseils, son écoute et son positivisme face aux nombreux défis que nous avons vécu. 

Robert est professionnel, efficace, organisé et surtout il est passionné par son travail et ça parait!

C’était un plaisir de travailler chaque jour avec Robert et définitivement un atout pour l’entreprise.

I met Robert Charlton approximately two months ago when I was in need of filling out a criminal covert surveillance team in southern California. I was immediately impressed with how Robert always went the extra mile in regards to everything he was asked to do. This is almost unheard of now a days. 

I often work with a State Prosecutor’s Office and manage criminal surveillance operations which last up to as much as 3-4 months and require investigators to work as a team for up to 15 hours a day. It was on such an assignment that I met Robert Charlton.  These assignments require team players who are gifted in their ability to receive instruction, be goal oriented and have an ability to get the assignment completed legally, whatever the cost.

I can say this about Robert Charlton, when he commits to an assignment, he is giving 110% every hour of the assignment. Up to this date Robert had never worked for me and I have no idea what I was getting when I hired him. But I can say today that Robert is now a respected member of our southern California TEAM. I find Robert Charlton to be dependable, result oriented and a team player with everyone he works with. I can say this without hesitation; Robert Charlton is always welcome on my TEAM!See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended RobertView Robert’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact Robert directlyView Robert’s Full ProfileNot the Robert you’re looking for?
