Principal Investment Strategies of the Fund 
  Arizona Fund intends to achieve its investment objectives by investing in a portfolio
of high quality, short-term municipal securities and municipal securities issued by or on behalf of the state of Arizona or its agencies, political subdivisions or instrumentalities, or other qualifying issuer, that pay interest that, in the opinion
of bond counsel to the issuer, is excludable from gross income for Federal income tax purposes (but may subject investors to Federal alternative minimum tax) and exempt from any applicable state or local income or other taxes (Arizona
municipal securities). Arizona municipal securities consist principally of municipal notes and commercial paper, short-term municipal bonds, variable rate demand obligations and short-term municipal derivative securities. The Fund may also
invest in repurchase agreements and purchase and sale contracts.    Under
normal circumstances, the Fund will generally invest at least 80% of its assets in Arizona municipal securities.   
Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund 
  Arizona Fund cannot guarantee that it will achieve its objectives. 
 
2 


An investment in the Fund is not a deposit in any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund could lose money if the issuer of an instrument held by the Fund defaults or if short-term interest rates rise sharply in a manner not anticipated by Fund management. Although the Fund
seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the Fund. The following is a summary description of certain risks of investing in the Fund. 
 


n
 
 Credit Enhanced Securities Risk  The Fund may invest more than 25% of its assets in Arizona municipal securities secured by bank letters of
credit. The bank may not be able to meet its obligations under a letter of credit.   


n
 
 Credit Risk  Credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security will not be able to make payments of interest and principal
when due. Changes in an issuers credit rating or the markets perception of an issuers creditworthiness may also affect the value of the Funds investment in that issuer. 
 


n
 
 Income Risk  Income risk is the risk that the Funds yield will vary as short-term securities in its portfolio mature and the proceeds
are reinvested in securities with different interest rates.   


n
 
 Interest Rate Risk  Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a debt security may fall when interest rates rise. In general, the
market price of debt securities with longer maturities will go up or down more in response to changes in interest rates than the market price of shorter term securities. 
 


    
Additionally, securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its agencies, instrumentalities and sponsored enterprises have historically involved little risk of loss of
principal if held to maturity. However, due to fluctuations in interest rates, the market value of such securities may vary during the period shareholders own shares of the Fund. 
 


n
 
 Market Risk and Selection Risk  Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Fund invests will go down in value, including
the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably. Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with
similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may lose money.   


n
 
 Municipal Securities Risks  Municipal securities risks include the ability of the issuer to repay the obligation, the relative lack of
information about certain issuers of municipal securities, and the possibility of future legislative changes which could affect the market for and value of municipal securities. Certain municipal securities, including private activity bonds, are not
backed by the full faith, credit and taxing power of the issuer. Additionally, if events occur after the security is acquired that impact the securitys tax-exempt status, the Fund and its shareholders could be subject to substantial tax
liabilities.   


n
 
 Non-Diversification Risk  The Fund is a non-diversified fund. Because the Fund may invest in securities of a smaller number of issuers, it
may be more exposed to the risks associated with and adverse developments affecting an individual issuer than a fund that invests more widely. 
 


n
 
 Repurchase Agreements and Purchase and Sale Contracts Risks  If the other party to a repurchase agreement or purchase and sale contract
defaults on its obligation under the agreement, the Fund may suffer delays and incur costs or lose money in exercising its rights under the agreement. If the seller fails to repurchase the security in either situation and the market value of the
security declines, the Fund may lose money.   


n
 
 State Specific Risk  The Fund will invest primarily in Arizona municipal securities. As a result, the Fund is more exposed to risks affecting
issuers of Arizona municipal securities.   


n
 
 Taxability Risk  Future laws, regulations, rulings or court decisions may cause interest on municipal securities to be subject, directly or
indirectly, to Federal income taxation or interest on state municipal securities to be subject to state or local income taxation, or the value of state municipal securities to be subject to state or local intangible personal property tax, or may
otherwise prevent the Fund from realizing the full current benefit of the tax-exempt status of such securities. Any such change could also affect the market price of such securities, and thus the value of an investment in the Fund.
  


n
 
 Variable Rate Demand Obligations and Municipal or Tax-Exempt Derivatives Risk  Investments in variable rate demand obligations or short-term
municipal or tax-exempt derivatives involve credit risk with respect to the financial institution providing the Fund with the right to demand payment or put (sell) the security. While the Fund invests only in short-term municipal or tax-exempt
securities of high quality issuers, or which are backed by high quality financial institutions, those issuers or financial institutions may still default on their obligations. Short-term municipal or tax-exempt derivatives present certain unresolved
tax, legal, regulatory and accounting issues not presented by investments in other short-term municipal or tax-exempt securities. These issues might be resolved in a manner adverse to the Fund.

Investment Manager 
  Arizona Funds investment manager is BlackRock Advisors, LLC
(BlackRock). The Funds sub-adviser is BlackRock Investment Management, LLC. Where applicable, BlackRock refers also to the Funds sub-adviser. 
  Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares
   If you are
a Cash Management Account (CMA) service subscriber, there is no minimum initial investment for Fund shares. The minimum assets for the CMA service is $20,000 in cash and/or securities. Other programs may have different minimum asset
requirements. If you are not a CMA service or other Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (Merrill Lynch) central asset account program subscriber, the minimum initial investment for the Fund is $5,000. If you are an
eligible CMA service subscriber and you choose to have your cash balances automatically invested in the Fund, generally cash balances of more than $1 in a CMA account are automatically invested in shares of the Fund daily at the next determined net
asset value on each business day on which both the New York Stock Exchange (the Exchange) and New York banks are open; cash balances of less than $1 will be automatically invested in shares of the Fund at the next determined net asset
value not later than the first business day of each week on which both the Exchange and New York banks are open, which will usually be a Monday. If you are a CMA service or other eligible Merrill Lynch central asset account program subscriber, you
may make manual investments of $1,000 or more at any time in shares of any fund associated with the CMA service not designated as your primary money account. Generally, manual purchases placed through Merrill Lynch will be effective on the day
following the day the order is placed with the Fund, subject to certain timing considerations. However, you may not hold shares of more 
 
4 



than one of BIF Arizona Municipal Money Fund, BIF California Municipal Money Fund, BIF Connecticut Municipal Money Fund, BIF Florida Municipal Money Fund, BIF Massachusetts Municipal Money Fund,
BIF Michigan Municipal Money Fund, BIF New Jersey Municipal Money Fund, BIF New York Municipal Money Fund, BIF North Carolina Municipal Money Fund, BIF Ohio Municipal Money Fund and BIF Pennsylvania Municipal Money Fund at the same time. If you are
a CMA service subscriber, you may redeem your shares by directly submitting a written notice of redemption to Merrill Lynch, which will submit the request to the Funds transfer agent. You may sell shares held at the Funds transfer agent
by writing to Financial Data Services, Inc., P.O. Box 45290, Jacksonville, Florida 32231-5290.   
Tax Information 
  The Fund will distribute dividends of net investment income, if any, daily and net
realized capital gains, if any, at least annually. The Fund anticipates that most of its distributions will be excludable from gross income for Federal income tax purposes, for purposes of the designated states personal income tax and, in
certain instances, local personal income tax. Where applicable, the Fund also intends that the value of its shares will be exempt from state intangible personal property tax and/or local personal property tax in the designated state, although it
cannot guarantee that this will always be the case.    Payments
to Broker/Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries   
If you purchase shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary, the Fund and BlackRock Investments, LLC, the Fund's distributor, or its
affiliates may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other financial intermediary and your individual financial professional to
recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your individual financial professional or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information.

          BIF Liquidates Muni MMFs; Nicholas Closes; MS; PFM Prime Goes Govt
        
          


Jul 15 16


Below, we review yet another batch of money fund changes, including a number of liquidations, closings, conversions and declarations. BlackRock is liquidating its BIF National and State-​Specific Municipal funds, Nicholas Money Market Fund is closing to new investors, a likely precursor to liquidation, and MainStay Money Market Fund designated itself as Retail. We also review filings from Morgan Stanley Investment Management, which involve its Retail fund lineup and strike times for its Institutional funds. Finally, the $​4.​8 billion PFM Prime Series Fund is converting to Government, according to a recent SEC filing. That brings the total of Prime funds either liquidating or converting to Government to $​314.​1 billion (​it moves to over $​350 billion when the conversion of the $​40+ billion Prudential Core to an ultra-​short bond fund is included).
The carnage in the Tax Exempt Money Fund sector continued as the former Merrill Lynch CMA Muni funds liquidated BlackRock'​s BIF filing explains, "On May 19, 2016, the Board of Trustees of BIF Tax-​Exempt Fund approved a proposal to close the Trust to share purchases. Accordingly, effective at the close of business on July 11, 2016, the Trust will no longer accept purchase orders. Also on May 19, 2016, the Board of Trustees of BIF Multi-​State Municipal Series Trust, on behalf of BIF California Municipal Money Fund, BIF Connecticut Municipal Money Fund, BIF Massachusetts Municipal Money Fund, BIF New Jersey Municipal Money Fund, BIF New York Municipal Money Fund and BIF Ohio Municipal Money Fund, approved a proposal to close each Fund to share purchases. Accordingly, effective at the close of business on July 11, 2016, each Fund will no longer accept purchase orders." A note from BlackRock confirmed that each of these funds are indeed liquidating.
Another tiny money fund manager is falling by the wayside too. Nicholas Money Market Fund, an $​89 million Prime fund, is liquidating. Its Prospectus Supplement says, "Effective June 30, 2016, the Fund will be closed to new investors and to additional purchases by existing shareholders. Effective June 30, 2016, the following language has been added to or replaces similar language on the front cover page and inside cover page of the Fund'​s Prospectus, dated April 30, 2016: Nicholas Money Market Fund, Inc. – Closed to Investors." Nicholas is the smallest of the 64 money fund managers Crane Data tracks.
Also, the $​400 million MainStay Money Market Fund was designated as Retail, according to a new filing. It says, "At a meeting held on June 21-​22, 2016, the Board of Trustees of The MainStay Funds approved the designation and operation of the MainStay Money Market Fund as a "​retail money market fund," as such term is defined or interpreted under Rule 2a-​7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. As a "​retail money market fund," effective on or before October 14, 2016, the Fund will adopt, and will work with financial intermediaries to implement, policies and procedures reasonably designed to limit all beneficial owners of the Fund to natural persons."
MainStay continues, "​Effective August 1, 2016, the Fund will be closed to purchases by any new accounts that are not beneficially owned by natural persons. Current accounts that are not beneficially owned by natural persons may continue to purchase shares of the Fund until September 1, 2016. On or about October 1, 2016, the Fund will begin to redeem any Fund shares held in accounts that are not beneficially owned by natural persons."
A new Morgan Stanley filing, under "Summary of Money Market Fund Changes -- Overview of Government and Retail Money Market Funds," says, "The Board has approved, upon the recommendation of Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc., the designation of each of the Active Assets Government Securities Trust, Active Assets Government Trust and Morgan Stanley U.​S. Government Money Market Fund as a "​government money market fund" as defined in Rule 2a-​7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended."
Under "Retail Money Market Funds," it states, "​The Board has approved, upon the recommendation of MSIM, the designation of each of the Active Assets California Tax-​Free Trust, Active Assets Money Trust, Active Assets Prime Trust, Active Assets Tax-​Free Trust, Morgan Stanley California Tax-​Free Daily Income Trust, Morgan Stanley Liquid Asset Fund Inc., Morgan Stanley New York Municipal Money Market Trust and Morgan Stanley Tax-​Free Daily Income Trust as a "​retail money market fund" as defined in Rule 2a-​7 under the 1940 Act, effective on or about October 7, 2016."
It adds, "​On or before the Effective Date, investments in Retail Funds will be limited to accounts beneficially owned by natural persons. Financial Intermediaries will be required to take steps to remove any shareholders on behalf of whom they hold shares in a Retail Fund that are not eligible to be invested in the Fund prior to such date and must notify the Fund of any ineligible shareholders that continue to own shares of the Fund on such date.... Effective July 18, 2016, the Retail Funds reserve the right to redeem shares in any account that they cannot confirm to their satisfaction are beneficially owned by natural persons, after providing advance notice."
A separate filing for Morgan Stanley Institutional Liquidity Funds says, "The Board of Trustees of Morgan Stanley Institutional Liquidity Funds (​the "​Fund") has approved a decrease in the minimum initial investment amount and minimum average balance policy with respect to each share Class of the Portfolio, effective October 1, 2016.... Each share Class of the Portfolio is available to investors who at the time of initial purchase make a minimum purchase of $​10,​000,​000." (​The change is for the previously ultra-​high minimum Money Market Portfolio, which previously had a minimum of $​150 million.)
It continues, "​The Board has approved, upon the recommendation of Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc., the investment adviser of the Fund, the designation of each of the Money Market Portfolio, Prime Portfolio and Tax-​Exempt Portfolio as an "​institutional money market fund" as defined in Rule 2a-​7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended." Money Market Portfolio will have a single strike time of 3pm and Tax-​Exempt a single strike of 1pm, while Prime Portfolio will have multiple strike times of 8am, noon and 3pm <​b:>`​_. (​For more, see our March 17 News, "Morgan Stanley Declares Inst Funds in Filing; BlackRock Fed RRP Fund.")
Finally, PFM'​s fund filing says, "​The following supplements information contained in the Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information of Prime Series and Government Series, each an investment portfolio of PFM Funds. Effective October 3, 2016, Prime Series will operate as a government money market fund and will have a policy of investing at least 99.​5% of its assets in cash, U.​S. government securities (​including securities issued or guaranteed by the U.​S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities) and/​or repurchase agreements that are collateralized fully. This change in the investment program of Prime Series will allow Prime Series to continue to seek to maintain a stable net asset value of $​1.​00 per share after certain new requirements applicable to money market funds and adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission become effective. In view of this new investment policy, the name of Prime Series will be changed to "​Government Select Series" effective October 3, 2016."
It continues, "​Prior to October 3, 2016, Prime Series may continue to invest in money market instruments issued by U.​S. companies, financial institutions and U.​S. municipalities and shares of other money market mutual funds that invest exclusively in the types of obligations in which Prime Series is permitted to invest (​as described in the Prospectus). However, all such investments must have maturity dates that are not later than September 30, 2016, so that Prime Series will be in compliance with its new investment policy when it becomes effective. Effective October 3, 2016, Government Series will have a policy of investing at least 99.​5% of its assets in cash, U.​S. government securities (​including securities issued or guaranteed by the U.​S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities) and/​or repurchase agreements that are collateralized fully."
