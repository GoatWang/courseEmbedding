Careers at inContact
 

It wasn’t easy building a world-class cloud software company. Over the past eighteen years, inContact has been making history within the technology industry and community. This year, we exceeded 1,000 employees and are on track to have another record-breaking year in growth with no plans of slowing down.
In Spring 2016, inContact completed construction of a beautiful, cutting edge headquarters building in Salt Lake City, UT. We also have offices in Columbus, OH, Bolivia and the Philippines.
And… we’re just getting started.


 


Current open positions

Qualified candidates are encouraged to review our open positions and apply online.
 




Who we are

We're proud of the fact that we were the first contact center software company to be 100% cloud.





How we thrive

We're hungry to make a difference, so we expect a lot from our employees. But we make it worth their while.





Who we're looking for

Are you at ease with really smart, passionate people who challenge themselves, and will challenge you, too?









Why inContact?
 

We’re big enough to give you a diverse and challenging career path, but small enough to consult with an executive to pitch an idea. You’ll see the value you’re adding, and how your actions make a difference to the company. We’re in a fast growth, global market, so we want people who will bring big ideas and offer top notch professional practices. You’ll get the opportunity to solve interesting problems and reap the career rewards.

Who We Are
 

We take our work seriously; however, we believe it’s equally important to have fun. We regularly plan employee activities and outings including seasonal parties, trips to the local amusement park with family, and chili cook-offs, just to name a few! We also regularly give back to our community. Every quarter we have various service projects to benefit local non-profit organizations.
Every day, we unleash a little more of the cloud’s immense potential, pushing the technology a little bit further. We solve our customers’ toughest problems and cement our leadership in the world of contact center software.
With more than 2000 customers and 200,000 users in over 100 countries, we never forget how everything we do impacts our customers and their customers. All of these connections make a difference in their day – in their lives, and along the way we make history in cloud technology.

Customer Support








Rapid, Helpful Support When You Need It
Customer Support is one of our most important functions, so we don’t outsource it like some companies. Everyone on our trained and certified team is an inContact employee, which means they deeply understand our technology and their highest priority is to help you. 
We support your contact center with:

Rapid Resolution - We manage your technology 24/7/365 so you don’t have to. We provide system updates and upgrades, a knowledge base with information and training, a single point of contact for each of your issues and use Adaptive Organization methodology to quickly resolve issues and communicate with you.
Pay-As-You-Go – We bill our support just like our contact center solution – as part of your monthly inContact invoice. That means no upfront or annual contracts to deal with.
Proactive Support – Our knowledgeable Technical Account Managers and Key Account Managers (which is an optional service) provide reporting, service calls and advice on implementing call center best practices.
Service and Support Accountability – Our service level agreements provide 99.99% uptime and 80% of calls are answered in 60 seconds or less.
