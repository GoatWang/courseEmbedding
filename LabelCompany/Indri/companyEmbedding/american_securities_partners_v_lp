American Securities Partners VI | Press Release | American Securities
Englishback to newsJune 12, 2012American Securities LLC Closes American Securities Partners VI, L.P. at More Than $3.6 BillionAmerican Securities LLC, a leading U.S. private equity firm, today announced the closing of its sixth private equity investment partnership, American Securities Partners VI, L.P. with total capital commitments of $3.64 billion. The partnership is above its $3 billion target and more than 50% larger than its $2.33 billion predecessor, American Securities Partners V, L.P.
This partnership maintains the unique 25-year investment term established by American Securities in 2007. Investors include some of the world's leading high net worth individuals and families, endowments and foundations, as well as pension funds and sovereign wealth funds.
In announcing the closing of ASP VI, American Securities CEO, Michael G. Fisch, said, "We are delighted to continue investing on behalf of many long-standing relationships. At the same time, we are also pleased to have attracted select new investors. This partnership provides us with equity capital to continue supporting additional strong management teams."
American Securities generally invests in market-leading businesses with $500 million to $2 billion of revenues and $50 million to $200 million of EBITDA. The firm strives to be a long-term, value-added partner to the CEOs and senior management teams of the companies in which it invests. Investments are undertaken with conservative financial structures that typically include only equity and senior debt. The firm aims to invest $150 million to $500 million of equity capital in each portfolio company.
David L. Horing, a Managing Director of American Securities, who along with Mr. Fisch is a Managing Member of ASP VI's general partner, added, "For the past 18 years, we have worked to position American Securities as a preferred partner of management teams. We have delivered on that partnership through our support of each management team behind which we invest, a consistent long-term investment approach, our conservative capital structures, and our value-added Resources Group. We are excited about investing ASP VI into a variety of market-leading companies."
While American Securities traces its roots back to 1947, the firm's initial fund with outside investors was raised in 1994. Thereafter, American Securities has invested in 39 companies in a wide variety of industries, including industrial manufacturing, specialty chemicals, aerospace and defense, energy, business services, healthcare, media, restaurants, and consumer products. Equity invested in 21 existing portfolio companies is valued at over $5 billion. The firm focuses on long-term partnerships with existing management teams.
American Securities is led by a stable team of eight Managing Directors who average more than 15 years together. In addition to Messrs. Fisch and Horing, they are Charles D. Klein, Paul Rossetti, Matthew F. LeBaron, Marc L. Saiontz, Kevin S. Penn, and William Fry. The American Securities team further includes more than 20 investment professionals, as well as more than 20 Resources Group professionals. The Resources Group is comprised of senior executives with functional expertise who are "on call" to help portfolio company CEOs and their management teams, at no cost to the companies, for projects CEOs have prioritized. American Securities is headquartered in New York. The firm also has over a dozen colleagues in its Shanghai office, which was opened in 2006 and, as part of the Resources Group, assists portfolio companies on Asia-Pacific strategy, operations, market entry, as well as product and component sourcing.

American Securities Closes $5 Billion Private Equity Fund at Hard Cap

Jan 13, 2015, 08:30 ET

NEW YORK, Jan. 13, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- American Securities, LLC, a leading U.S. private equity firm, today announced the first and final closing of American Securities Partners VII, L.P. (ASP VII) with total capital commitments of $5 billion.  As a result of strong investor interest, American Securities closed the fund above the $4 billion target and at the hard cap the firm established at the outset of fundraising in September 2014.
"American Securities greatly appreciates the interest expressed in ASP VII by many long-standing relationships, as well as new investors, from the US and global investing community," said Michael G. Fisch, President and CEO of American Securities.  "This new partnership provides us with further equity capital to support management teams in growing their businesses."
American Securities invests in partnership with existing management teams of market-leading businesses, generally having $200 million to $2 billion of revenues and/or $50 million to $200 million of EBITDA.  The firm strives to be a long-term, value-added partner to the CEOs and management teams of the companies in which it is privileged to invest.  In deploying ASP VII, American Securities will pursue the same disciplined investment approach developed over the past 20 years and will aim to invest $200 million to $500 million of equity capital in each situation, although larger investments are also possible.
"ASP VII maintains the 25-year fund life potential of prior American Securities funds, thus permitting American Securities to remain invested in a company for many years and allowing management teams the flexibility to always act in the best long-term interest of their businesses," stated David L. Horing, a Managing Director of American Securities, who along with Mr. Fisch is a Managing Member of ASP VII's general partner. 
American Securities also plans to continue its tradition of investing with conservative financial structures.  CEOs of companies partnered with American Securities often comment that these aspects are beneficial to their businesses.  "We are a company with a long history of employee and management ownership, and American Securities has been a strong partner for us because of their long-term perspective coupled with their willingness to utilize lower leverage, which has provided greater flexibility to our business," said Joe Chlapaty, Chairman and CEO of Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc. (NYSE:   WMS).
The firm is led by an experienced and cohesive team.  The Managing Directors on the Investment Team average more than 13 years at American Securities.  Bill Redmond, former President and CEO of General Chemical Corporation, commented on the capabilities and support that American Securities provides, "During our partnership, we benefitted greatly from the stability and insight of the American Securities team.  They helped us create value for all of our stakeholders."  
In addition to the Investment Team, American Securities supports management teams with the Firm's Resources Group, a team of functional experts available upon request by CEOs.  George Thanopoulos, CEO of Metaldyne Performance Group Inc. (NYSE:   MPG) explained, "American Securities has been a truly value-added partner.  We have been able to continuously access the Resources Group, particularly in the areas of information technology and human capital.  American Securities brought MPG talent and unique capabilities that we've not seen in other private equity firms."  Since 2006, the Resources Group has included a strong China office to support management teams' Asia-Pacific activities.  Dave Brooks, President and CEO of Unifrax Corporation, observed, "We chose to work with American Securities a second time because of the strong relationships we built with their team initially.  In addition, we wanted to expand our footprint in China and felt that American Securities' local team in Shanghai provided valuable specialized expertise."

Buyout Shop American Securities Acquires Arizona Chemical


November 22, 2010







Middle-market buyout shop American Securities has paid an undisclosed amount for a controlling stake in Arizona Chemical. Jacksonville, Fla.-based Arizona Chemical refines pine chemicals for use in printing inks, paints, adhesives and other products. American Securities is based in New York.
PRESS RELEASE
American Securities LLC, a New York-based middle-market private equity firm, today announces it has completed its acquisition of a controlling interest in Arizona Chemical, the world’s leading biorefiner of pine chemicals used in a broad range of end-market applications. Management and current investors will continue to own a meaningful equity position. Headquartered in Jacksonville, Fla., and in Almere, The Netherlands, Arizona Chemical has more than 1,000 employees and state-of-the-art refineries located in six countries on both sides of the Atlantic. Terms of the transaction have not been disclosed. Equity was provided by American Securities Partners V, L.P., a $2.3 billion private equity partnership.
Established in 1930, Arizona Chemical has been dedicated to transforming pine chemicals from pulp and paper into high-value end products. The company refines pine chemicals, crude tall oil and crude sulphate turpentine into high value end-products. Arizona Chemical’s raw materials are environmentally-friendly starting points for manufacturing everyday products for adhesives, printing inks, tires, roadmarkings, decorative paints, personal care and many other markets. 





In commenting on the transaction, Paul Rossetti, a managing director of American Securities, said, “We are pleased to have closed this investment and to formally begin our partnership with Kees Verhaar and the rest of the Arizona Chemical management team. Arizona Chemical has long been committed to bringing new and environmentally sustainable products to the chemical industry. The company is well-poised for continued growth and the team at American Securities looks forward to working with Arizona Chemical’s international team to help management build the business.”
Kees Verhaar, President & CEO of Arizona Chemical, said, “American Securities has a strong history of providing the leadership and resources necessary to ensure that the businesses that are part of their portfolio continue to achieve success. We look forward to continuing to grow our business and strengthen our customer relationships with their support.”
