Why is this contact information displayed?  

Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

In some of his other books like, "Mind Power into the 20th Century" and his most recent work, "Quantum Warrior" John uses a style that is quite interactive and full of great lessons that need to be put into use. In order to gain the benefits of the material in those two books, the reader needs to be quite pro-active and  do the work physically.This book, "The Practice of Happiness", is not only smaller and shorter in length, the style is also different in that it is more of a discourse - not a scientific discourse; rather, it is written from the point of view of somebody who has learned from the school of life.John Kehoe a uses aspects of his personal life mixed in with quotes and aphorisms from many sources to share a  wisdom about happiness that many know, yet so few truly practice. There are many wonderful quotes in the book, but I would like to share something from Mr. Kehoe himself, "Inner harmony and happiness are not just for ourselves: they are gifts that we give to the world. And here a great truth is revealed."If you could use more happiness in your life, this book would be a great place to start.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsBe happyByRaymond Mathiesenon July 29, 2007Format: HardcoverThis little book contains 10 meditative, philosophic essays on happiness.  Each essay talks about a different "practice," or mind set, that can aid in increasing happiness.  In the first essay, for example, we are urged to follow our instincts, our inner desires, rather than dutifully obeying what society and our intellect tells us we must do.Kehoe is not a psychologist so do not expect a scientific approach.  Instead he writes from the perspective of one who has lived a successful and happy life, and who has thought long and read widely about the subject.I recommend reading a chapter a day to give your mind a chance to think over the various messages.  You might even find you want to read the book several times to absorb the material.  The text is certainly not boring, has pertinent quotes scattered through it, and is illustrated with interesting pictures to meditate on.Read more0Comment|

karl – October 20, 2013

A small book with some wonderful insights into happiness
I have read, and enjoyed, several of John Kehoe’s book and this one is no exception. In some of his other books like, “Mind Power into the 20th Century” and his most recent work, “Quantum Warrior” John uses a style that is quite interactive and full of great lessons that need to be put into use. In order to gain the benefits of the material in those two books, the reader needs to be quite pro-active and do the work physically. 
This book, “The Practice of Happiness”, is not only smaller and shorter in length, the style is also different in that it is more of a discourse – not a scientific discourse; rather, it is written from the point of view of somebody who has learned from the school of life. 
John Kehoe a uses aspects of his personal life mixed in with quotes and aphorisms from many sources to share a wisdom about happiness that many know, yet so few truly practice. There are many wonderful quotes in the book, but I would like to share something from Mr. Kehoe himself, “Inner harmony and happiness are not just for ourselves: they are gifts that we give to the world. And here a great truth is revealed.” 
If you could use more happiness in your life, this book would be a great place to start.

deepak_chaudhary – December 14, 2011

This book is so worth reading. It really answers the question of how a homeless street begger in india can be happier then us who have so much more. Physically its a black hardcover book with gold writing on the edges and a gold book mark, it just looked like a lot of love was given to it in putting it together and as soon as I started reading it I felt a need to respect it so I read it slowly and turned the pages carefully, no book has ever had that effect on me. The book starts of with a question “what is the secret to happiness” and that question gets answered in a very satisfying 1 sentence at the end of the book however the middle of the book is all great reading from john keehoes experiances building up to the end so when you finally read the secrete you get it and its a wonderfull revelation. you might think why would I wanna read this guys book how would he know anything about happiness well John Keehoe before he became a best selling author had travelled over 60 countries and learned from monks, indian shamans, african healers and even aboriginal elders and to top it all off he has lived alone in the woods away from everything for three years to study and contemplate on the concepts he had discovered so he knows a thing or two.









brad – January 30, 2011

Life changing book. Very easy to read and very accessible. 
Everyone should read this book, only takes a couple of hours. It can change the way you think.









raymond_mathiesen – July 29, 2007

This little book contains 10 meditative, philosophic essays on happiness. Each essay talks about a different “practice,” or mind set, that can aid in increasing happiness. In the first essay, for example, we are urged to follow our instincts, our inner desires, rather than dutifully obeying what society and our intellect tells us we must do.
Kehoe is not a psychologist so do not expect a scientific approach. Instead he writes from the perspective of one who has lived a successful and happy life, and who has thought long and read widely about the subject.
I recommend reading a chapter a day to give your mind a chance to think over the various messages. You might even find you want to read the book several times to absorb the material. The text is certainly not boring, has pertinent quotes scattered through it, and is illustrated with interesting pictures to meditate on.
