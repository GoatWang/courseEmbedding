US businesses asks for protection over paid leave laws

..... The HR Policy Association says companies don’t need government regulation to be generous with their workers. “While many existing government policies assume employers will only treat their employees fairly if they are required by law to do so, the war for talent negates that assumption,” Merck & Co. executive vice president
Mirian Graddick-Weir, who chairs the association, said in an email. Current laws on the books still assume “that employers were likely to take advantage of employees, so we just need to put lots of protections in place,” said CIT Group chief human resources officer Jim Duffy. .....

The High Cost of Caregiving



Biggest HCM Deal for Infor!



New Evidence on Minimum Wages



 
Mirian Graddick-Weir
Executive Vice President of Human Resources, Merck & Co.,
Whitehouse Station, N.J.
Monday, March 9, 2015













This
article accompanies The Most
Powerful Women in HR.
Mirian Graddick-Weir joined Merck in 2006 from AT&T, where she
was executive vice president of human resources and employee communications for
five years. She is a member of the boards of Yum! Brands Inc., the HR Policy
Association (chair) and the Cornell Center for Advanced Human Resource Studies.
She is also a National Academy of Human Resources Fellow and a member of the
Personnel Roundtable. She has earned many awards throughout her career,
including the Distinguished Psychologist in Management award in 2003, HRE's
HR Executive of the Year award in 2001 and, most recently, the Lifetime
Achievement Award from the University of Michigan in 2012 and the 2014 Academy
of Management's Distinguished HR Executive Award.  
Greatest HR accomplishment: "I'm
particularly proud of the way we implemented our CEO-succession plan several
years ago. There was a strong partnership between the CEO, CHRO and the board,
culminating in a well-executed process and handoff of responsibilities without
business disruption. We all recognize the enormous impact CEO succession can
have on bottom-line results, so doing it well makes a difference."
Greatest HR challenge/obstacle: "I've
found it really tough finding effective ways to dramatically change the culture
of a company with a long history of success -- and no immediate burning
platform -- to take advantage of the current and future marketplace challenges
and opportunities. Changing deep-rooted historical practices and a traditional
mind-set can be daunting and takes time."

Future goals: "I
want to continue to ensure HR has top talent, innovation, market-based
practices and a global service-delivery infrastructure to drive business
results and help the company achieve its mission, vision and long-term goals. I
also want to help children in underserved communities gain greater access to
science, technology, engineering and math education."
