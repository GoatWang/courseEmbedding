Joan Budden
 


Priority Health didn’t need to look very far when naming the replacement for retiring CEO Mike Freed. Effective Jan. 1, Joan Budden, former chief marketing officer, will assume the role of president and CEO, announced Richard Breon, CEO of Spectrum Health, the parent organization of Priority also based in Grand Rapids.
Budden has been with Priority Health since 2009 after holding various executive positions at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan. They included stints in the Blues’ individual consumer division, project management office and corporate strategy departments.
Freed, who had been with Spectrum for more than 20 years, announced his plans to retire in September. He replaced Kim Horn, who is now with Kaiser Permanente, in 2012.
“The future of the health care industry is based on increased competition, consumer choice, innovation and models of care that provide a higher level of quality at lower costs,” Breon said in a statement.
“Given Joan’s extensive experience in the health insurance industry and the results produced under her leadership as chief marketing officer, she is an outstanding choice to lead Priority Health in this new and ever-changing health care environment.”
Budden said she plans to continue Priority’s focus on improving the health of its members.
“We’ll continue to offer products and services that keep our members healthy and ensure they have access to high-quality, affordable care when needed,” said Budden in a statement
Budden has been involved with Priority Health’s individual, group commercial and government programs. She also led the development of Priority’s compliance with the Affordable Care Act, allowing it to be named the state’s first benchmark plan.
Budden holds a bachelor of science degree in business administration from the University of Michigan and a master’s degree from Wayne State University.
