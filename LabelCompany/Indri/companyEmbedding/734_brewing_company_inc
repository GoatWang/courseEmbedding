If you haven't been roaming around our little corner of Depot Town Ypsilanti, you may have missed the change in our facade. The glass is in! Thanks to permits from the Ypsilanti Historic District Commission and a grant from Ypsilanti Downtown Development Authority, our contractor was able to restore the original garage door and add a new glass storefront. Feel free to peek in if you happen to be walking by.  We think we'll be able to leave our sliver of Ypsilanti, Michigan a little better than we found it. Hopefully, you feel the same. 💕🍻全部帖子734 Brewing Company 上传了 2 张新照片。 · 6月6日 · We love working with local businesses, especially since there is so much talent right here in town. Thanks for the meeting, Engrave It LLC! Bobby and Mike Prevost do some pretty sweet engraving work, and they brought us some samples to help us envision how we might use their stuff. There is some exciting potential with these guys! Who else thinks the marble tile on the left would be an awesome coaster?734 Brewing Company · 5月31日 · In case you aren't very familiar with Ypsilanti, we want to take a moment to let you know that we most certainly know what it looks like 😉.  There's no better embodiment of Ypsi's quirky, weird, and rough-around-the-edges attitude than its water tower. We'll have some fun with it in the coming years and hope you find it entertaining. We recommend The Rocket Candy & Novelties or The Eyrie for more water tower / general Ypsi swag.Most Phallic Building contest - WikipediaThe World's Most Phallic Building contest was a contest held in 2003 by Cabinet magazine to find the building which most resembled a human phallus.[1]en.wikipedia.org734 Brewing Company 分享了自己的照片 · 5月30日 · New logo!

We decided to give the entire building a little sprucing up. We hope our neighbors at  Massage Mechanics and our landlord enjoy the facelift. We're glad they put up with our noise today!  This was an optional move for the brewery, but we believe that everyone deserves the best. That includes Ypsi. We and generations of our families have grown up here. For us, Ypsi isn't a trend or a cheaper version of a nicer place to work or call home; it IS our home. We are proud of our little city and we'll do whatever it takes for you to feel the same way about us.  We look forward to welcoming EVERYONE to our unabashedly Ypsi brewery very soon.734 Brewing Company 上传了 2 张新照片。 · 5月27日 · Before and after photos of face lift phase 1!
