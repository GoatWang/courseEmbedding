Commentary

As of June 30, 2017

	Quarter in review


		The JPMorgan Large Cap Value (I Class Shares) outperformed its benchmark, the Russell 1000 Value Index, for the quarter ended June 30, 2017.

		Delta Air Lines, Inc. (2.4% portfolio weighting) shares have performed well amidst an improving industry backdrop and positive commentary from their recent analyst day. Revenue strength is building broadly as business travel markets continue to recover; in addition management expects positive momentum to continue. Delta has demonstrated continued yield improvement, better PRASM results, cost discipline and restrained capacity growth. We view Delta as a high quality industrial with multiple revenue and earnings growth initiatives. We like that it generates significant free cash flow and management returns cash to shareholders through a growing dividend and repurchases.

		Citigroup, Inc. (4.4% portfolio weighting) shares did well under the backdrop of higher rates, which caused sentiment to turn more positive on the financials broadly. The combination of decent loan growth, rising rates, and ample capital/return yield creates a compelling picture for the financials. In the last week of the quarter, stellar Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) results acted as an additional catalyst as Citigroup’s return of capital plan was approved, suggesting that Citigroup has made sufficient progress improving its financial profile. Improvements in the business are a function of management controlling expenses and investing in the card, wealth management and Mexican franchises. Looking ahead, we think there’s room for the additional return of capital to shareholders.

		We originally purchased Macy's, Inc. (0.0% portfolio weighting) because of its attractive valuation, particularly as we considered two factors. First, based on credit card data checks, trends appeared to be better than department store peers. Second, we felt the company had real estate optionality. Our thesis has not played out: Macy’s has underperformed as investors are frustrated with the slow pace of management’s ability to monetize the company’s real estate position. We exited the position since we were similarly disappointed with management’s commentary about its real estate strategy.

		Despite reporting strong quarterly results, the market yawned as investors are more concerned about weakening original equipment manufacturer (OEM) fundamentals, which caused General Motors Co. (3.6% portfolio weighting) to be among the portfolio’s laggards. We own GM because of its superior cost discipline, inventory management and product cycle relative to OEM peers. The valuation is attractive and management is highly focused on driving performance and increasing shareholder value, with a track record of prudent capital allocation.


	Looking ahead


		Our approach leads us to invest in companies with compelling valuations, combined with contrarian sentiment and risk control. We remain overweight in the more cyclical areas of the market and underweight in the bond proxies.

		Three themes that we expect to persist are: 1) downward pressure on oil prices, 2) relative economic strength in Europe, and 3) higher interest rates globally. These macroeconomic views have been reflected in the portfolio by neutralizing our relative underweights to some of the large multinationals in our benchmark.

		We continue to think that higher rates will be a tailwind for financials and we’ve intentionally tilted this exposure to firms with a greater international presence. We continue to be underweight in energy, yet prefer to have exposure to Permian Basin producers.

		The portfolio continues to have large exposures to stocks that are identified as cheap within our dividend discount model, exhibit good free cash flow and strong cash flow return on investment.

Disclaimer1Please refer to the prospectus for additional information about cut-off times. Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The Fund's adviser and/or its affiliates have contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses to the extent Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, dividend and interest expenses related to short sales, interest, taxes, expenses related to litigation and potential litigation and extraordinary expenses) exceed 0.93% for A Shares, 1.45% for C Shares, 0.80% for I Shares, 1.30% for R2 Shares, 0.60% for R5 Shares and 0.55% for R6 Shares of the average daily net assets. The Fund may invest in one or more money market funds advised by the adviser or its affiliates (affiliated money market funds). The Fund's adviser has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses in an amount sufficient to offset the fees and expenses of the affiliated money market funds incurred by the Fund because of the Fund's investment in such money market funds. This waiver is in effect through 10/31/2017 for A Shares, 10/31/2017 for C Shares, 10/31/2017 for I Shares, 10/31/2018 for R2 Shares, 10/31/2017 for R5 Shares and 10/31/2017 for R6 Shares, at which time the adviser and/or its affiliates will determine whether to renew or revise it. The difference between net and gross fees includes all applicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements. The quoted performance of the Fund includes performance of a predecessor fund/share class prior to the Fund's commencement of operations. Please refer to the current prospectus for further information.  Mutual funds have fees that reduce their performance: indexes do not. You cannot invest directly in an index. The Russell 1000 Value Index is an unmanaged index measuring the performance of those Russell 1000 companies with lower price-to-book ratios and lower forecasted growth values. The performance of the Lipper Large-Cap Value Funds Index includes expenses associated with a mutual fund, such as investment management fees. These expenses are not identical to the expenses charged by the Fund. Total return figures (for the fund and any index quoted) assume payment of fees and reinvestment of dividends (after the highest applicable foreign withholding tax) and distributions. Without fee waivers, fund returns would have been lower. Due to rounding, some values may not total 100%. Â©2017, American Bankers Association, CUSIP Database provided by the Standard & Poor's CUSIP Service Bureau, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. All rights reserved.The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10- year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Rankings do not take sales loads into account.The following risks could cause the fund to lose money or perform more poorly than other investments. For more complete risk information, see the prospectus. The prices of equity securities are sensitive to a wide range of factors, from economic to company-specific news, and can fluctuate rapidly and unpredictably, causing an investment to decrease in value.Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The top 10 holdings listed reflect only the Fund's long-term investments. Short-term investments are excluded. Holdings are subject to change. The holdings listed should not be considered recommendations to purchase or sell a particular security. Each individual security is calculated as a percentage of the aggregate market value of the securities held in the Fund and does not include the use of derivative positions, where applicable. P/E ratio: the number by which earnings per share is multiplied to estimate a stock's value.  P/B ratio: the relationship between a stock's price and the book value of that stock. Sharpe ratio measures the fund's excess return compared to a risk-free investment. The higher the Sharpe ratio, the better the returns relative to the risk taken. Tracking Error: The active risk of the portfolio, which determines the annualized standard deviation of the excess returns between the portfolio and the benchmark. Alpha: The relationship between the performance of the Fund and its beta over a three-year period of time. Standard deviation/Volatility: A statistical measure of the degree to which the Fund's returns have varied from its historical average. The higher the standard deviation, the wider the range of returns from its average and the greater the historical volatility. The standard deviation is calculated over a 36-month period based on Fund's monthly returns. The standard deviation shown is based on the Fund's Class A Shares or the oldest share class, where Class A Shares are not available. R2: The percentage of a Fund's movements that result from movements in the index ranging from 0 to 100. A Fund with an R2 of 100 means that 100 percent of the Fund's movement can completely be explained by movements in the Fund's external index benchmark. EPS: Total earnings divided by the number of shares outstanding. Risk measures are calculated based upon the Funds' broad-based index as stated in the prospectus.

During the weekend of August 22/23, our third-party Administrator (The Bank of New York Mellon – BNYM) experienced a technical malfunction resulting in it being unable to calculate timely NAVs for its mutual funds and ETF clients, including the PowerShares ETFs. As we disclosed to you last week, we experienced a delay in the dissemination of the NAV. PowerShares worked aggressively with BNYM to resolve the issue. We are pleased to report that the malfunction has been corrected by the Administrator and that the system is back to normal. The NAV that is being disseminated today is the most recent NAV for the Funds (as of Thursday, September 3).
For primary market participants, please note that, in accordance with the Prospectus and the SAI for each PowerShares ETF, orders received before the cut-off time on any given day were processed at the NAV that was calculated by the Administrator for that day. Given the delay in the calculation and dissemination of the NAV by the Administrator, we expect that most of the orders that the Administrator received last week will settle in the normal settlement cycle. Certain orders may experience (or have experienced) a  delay in settlement. Secondary market transactions were not affected by the delay and  are anticipated to settle in ordinary course.
See detailed list of last week's NAVs  
For additional information please contact PowerShares at 1-800-983-0903.

Ratings are subject to change monthly. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, the Morningstar rating would have been lower. Ratings for other share classes may differ due to different performance characteristics.

Market returns are based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4 p.m. ET and do not represent the returns an investor would receive if shares were traded at other times. Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be higher or lower than performance data quoted. After-tax returns reflect the highest federal income tax rate but exclude state and local taxes. Fund performance reflects applicable fee waivers, absent which, performance data quoted would have been lower. After Tax Held and After Tax Sold are based on NAV. Returns less than one year are cumulative.

Distribution Information



Fund Distributions

Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid either quarterly or monthly, depending on the Fund. For Funds on a quarterly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the third Friday of each March, June, September and December, payable the last business day of the month. For Funds on a monthly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the 15th of each month, payable the last business day of the month. 
The fund distributes its net realized capital gains, if any, to shareholders annually. Prior to paying a distribution of net investment income, the fund has the ability to invest cash generated from investment income into additional securities or money market instruments.
Distributions in cash may be reinvested automatically in additional whole shares of the fund only if the broker through whom you purchased shares makes such option available. Shareholders of the fund may contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation. Brokers may require shareholders to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the fund purchased in the secondary market. 
Taxes on Distributions
In general, your distributions are subject to federal income tax when they are paid, whether you take them in cash or reinvest them in the Fund. Dividends paid out of the Fund’s income and net short-term gains, if any, are taxable as ordinary income. Distributions of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses are taxable as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Shares. Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid quarterly. The Fund may also pay a special distribution at the end of the calendar year to comply with federal tax requirements. 
Under the provisions of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (the “2003 Tax Act”), long-term capital gains tax rates have generally been reduced for individuals to a maximum of 15% for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2009. In addition, some ordinary dividends declared and paid by the Fund to individual shareholders may qualify for taxation at the lower reduced tax rates applicable to long-term capital gains, provided that holding period and other requirements are met by the Fund and the shareholder. 
Distributions in excess of the Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits are treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of your basis in the Shares, and as capital gain thereafter. A distribution will reduce the Fund’s net asset value per Share and may be taxable to you as ordinary income or capital gain even though, from an investment standpoint, the distribution may constitute a return of capital. 
By law, the Fund must withhold a percentage of your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number. The backup withholding rate is currently 28%.

Shareholders may pay more than net asset value when they buy Fund shares and receive less than net asset value when they sell those shares, because shares are bought and sold at current market prices. Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results.

 Fund in Focus 









 Risk & Other Information 
 
Typically, security classifications used in calculating allocation tables are as of the last trading day of the previous month. There are risks involved with investing in ETFs, including possible loss of money. Shares are not actively managed and are subject to risks similar to those of stocks, including those regarding short selling and margin maintenance requirements. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. The Fund's return may not match the return of the Underlying Index. The Fund is subject to certain other risks. Please see the current prospectus for more information regarding the risk associated with an investment in the Fund. A value style of investing is subject to the risk that the valuations never improve or that the returns will trail other styles of investing or the overall stock markets. Investments focused in a particular industry or sector are subject to greater risk, and are more greatly impacted by market volatility, than more diversified investments. Investing in securities of large-cap companies may involve less risk than is customarily associated with investing in stocks of smaller companies. The fund may engage in frequent trading of its portfolio securities in connection with the rebalancing or adjustment of the Underlying Index. The Russell 1000® Value Index is an unmanaged index considered representative of large-cap value stocks. The Russell 1000® Value Index is a trademark/service mark of the Frank Russell Co. Russell® is a trademark of the Frank Russell Co. The Global Industry Classification Standard was developed by and is the exclusive property and a service mark of MSCI, Inc. and Standard & Poor's.

The products are not sponsored or endorsed by NYSE Arca, and NYSE Arca makes no warranty or representation as to the accuracy and/or completeness of the Indexes or results to be obtained by any person from use of the Indexes or the trading of the products. Beta is a measure of risk representing how a security is expected to respond to general market movements. Smart Beta represents an alternative and selection index based methodology that seeks to outperform a benchmark or reduce portfolio risk, or both. Smart beta funds may underperform cap-weighted benchmarks and increase portfolio risk.

The book value of a company is a measure of how much a company&#39;s assets are worth assuming the company&#39;s debts are paid off. Each holding&#39;s P/B is the latest closing price divided by the latest fiscal year&#39;s book value per share. Negative book values are excluded from this calculation.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.


Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined for most ETFs), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.


Index returns are for illustrative purposes only. Index performance returns do not reflect any management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Indexes are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index. Past performance does not guarantee future results.


After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown. The after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.


Certain sectors and markets perform exceptionally well based on current market conditions and iShares Funds can benefit from that performance. Achieving such exceptional returns involves the risk of volatility and investors should not expect that such results will be repeated.


The Funds are distributed by BlackRock Investments, LLC (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”).

Commentary

As of June 30, 2017

	Quarter in review


		The JPMorgan Large Cap Value (I Class Shares) outperformed its benchmark, the Russell 1000 Value Index, for the quarter ended June 30, 2017.

		Delta Air Lines, Inc. (2.4% portfolio weighting) shares have performed well amidst an improving industry backdrop and positive commentary from their recent analyst day. Revenue strength is building broadly as business travel markets continue to recover; in addition management expects positive momentum to continue. Delta has demonstrated continued yield improvement, better PRASM results, cost discipline and restrained capacity growth. We view Delta as a high quality industrial with multiple revenue and earnings growth initiatives. We like that it generates significant free cash flow and management returns cash to shareholders through a growing dividend and repurchases.

		Citigroup, Inc. (4.4% portfolio weighting) shares did well under the backdrop of higher rates, which caused sentiment to turn more positive on the financials broadly. The combination of decent loan growth, rising rates, and ample capital/return yield creates a compelling picture for the financials. In the last week of the quarter, stellar Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) results acted as an additional catalyst as Citigroup’s return of capital plan was approved, suggesting that Citigroup has made sufficient progress improving its financial profile. Improvements in the business are a function of management controlling expenses and investing in the card, wealth management and Mexican franchises. Looking ahead, we think there’s room for the additional return of capital to shareholders.

		We originally purchased Macy's, Inc. (0.0% portfolio weighting) because of its attractive valuation, particularly as we considered two factors. First, based on credit card data checks, trends appeared to be better than department store peers. Second, we felt the company had real estate optionality. Our thesis has not played out: Macy’s has underperformed as investors are frustrated with the slow pace of management’s ability to monetize the company’s real estate position. We exited the position since we were similarly disappointed with management’s commentary about its real estate strategy.

		Despite reporting strong quarterly results, the market yawned as investors are more concerned about weakening original equipment manufacturer (OEM) fundamentals, which caused General Motors Co. (3.6% portfolio weighting) to be among the portfolio’s laggards. We own GM because of its superior cost discipline, inventory management and product cycle relative to OEM peers. The valuation is attractive and management is highly focused on driving performance and increasing shareholder value, with a track record of prudent capital allocation.


	Looking ahead


		Our approach leads us to invest in companies with compelling valuations, combined with contrarian sentiment and risk control. We remain overweight in the more cyclical areas of the market and underweight in the bond proxies.

		Three themes that we expect to persist are: 1) downward pressure on oil prices, 2) relative economic strength in Europe, and 3) higher interest rates globally. These macroeconomic views have been reflected in the portfolio by neutralizing our relative underweights to some of the large multinationals in our benchmark.

		We continue to think that higher rates will be a tailwind for financials and we’ve intentionally tilted this exposure to firms with a greater international presence. We continue to be underweight in energy, yet prefer to have exposure to Permian Basin producers.

		The portfolio continues to have large exposures to stocks that are identified as cheap within our dividend discount model, exhibit good free cash flow and strong cash flow return on investment.

Disclaimer1Please refer to the prospectus for additional information about cut-off times. Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The Fund's adviser and/or its affiliates have contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses to the extent Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, dividend and interest expenses related to short sales, interest, taxes, expenses related to litigation and potential litigation and extraordinary expenses) exceed 0.93% for A Shares, 1.45% for C Shares, 0.80% for I Shares, 1.30% for R2 Shares, 0.60% for R5 Shares and 0.55% for R6 Shares of the average daily net assets. The Fund may invest in one or more money market funds advised by the adviser or its affiliates (affiliated money market funds). The Fund's adviser has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses in an amount sufficient to offset the fees and expenses of the affiliated money market funds incurred by the Fund because of the Fund's investment in such money market funds. This waiver is in effect through 10/31/2017 for A Shares, 10/31/2017 for C Shares, 10/31/2017 for I Shares, 10/31/2018 for R2 Shares, 10/31/2017 for R5 Shares and 10/31/2017 for R6 Shares, at which time the adviser and/or its affiliates will determine whether to renew or revise it. The difference between net and gross fees includes all applicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements. The quoted performance of the Fund includes performance of a predecessor fund/share class prior to the Fund's commencement of operations. Please refer to the current prospectus for further information.  Mutual funds have fees that reduce their performance: indexes do not. You cannot invest directly in an index. The Russell 1000 Value Index is an unmanaged index measuring the performance of those Russell 1000 companies with lower price-to-book ratios and lower forecasted growth values. The performance of the Lipper Large-Cap Value Funds Index includes expenses associated with a mutual fund, such as investment management fees. These expenses are not identical to the expenses charged by the Fund. Total return figures (for the fund and any index quoted) assume payment of fees and reinvestment of dividends (after the highest applicable foreign withholding tax) and distributions. Without fee waivers, fund returns would have been lower. Due to rounding, some values may not total 100%. Â©2017, American Bankers Association, CUSIP Database provided by the Standard & Poor's CUSIP Service Bureau, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. All rights reserved.The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10- year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Rankings do not take sales loads into account.The following risks could cause the fund to lose money or perform more poorly than other investments. For more complete risk information, see the prospectus. The prices of equity securities are sensitive to a wide range of factors, from economic to company-specific news, and can fluctuate rapidly and unpredictably, causing an investment to decrease in value.Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The top 10 holdings listed reflect only the Fund's long-term investments. Short-term investments are excluded. Holdings are subject to change. The holdings listed should not be considered recommendations to purchase or sell a particular security. Each individual security is calculated as a percentage of the aggregate market value of the securities held in the Fund and does not include the use of derivative positions, where applicable. P/E ratio: the number by which earnings per share is multiplied to estimate a stock's value.  P/B ratio: the relationship between a stock's price and the book value of that stock. Sharpe ratio measures the fund's excess return compared to a risk-free investment. The higher the Sharpe ratio, the better the returns relative to the risk taken. Tracking Error: The active risk of the portfolio, which determines the annualized standard deviation of the excess returns between the portfolio and the benchmark. Alpha: The relationship between the performance of the Fund and its beta over a three-year period of time. Standard deviation/Volatility: A statistical measure of the degree to which the Fund's returns have varied from its historical average. The higher the standard deviation, the wider the range of returns from its average and the greater the historical volatility. The standard deviation is calculated over a 36-month period based on Fund's monthly returns. The standard deviation shown is based on the Fund's Class A Shares or the oldest share class, where Class A Shares are not available. R2: The percentage of a Fund's movements that result from movements in the index ranging from 0 to 100. A Fund with an R2 of 100 means that 100 percent of the Fund's movement can completely be explained by movements in the Fund's external index benchmark. EPS: Total earnings divided by the number of shares outstanding. Risk measures are calculated based upon the Funds' broad-based index as stated in the prospectus.

During the weekend of August 22/23, our third-party Administrator (The Bank of New York Mellon – BNYM) experienced a technical malfunction resulting in it being unable to calculate timely NAVs for its mutual funds and ETF clients, including the PowerShares ETFs. As we disclosed to you last week, we experienced a delay in the dissemination of the NAV. PowerShares worked aggressively with BNYM to resolve the issue. We are pleased to report that the malfunction has been corrected by the Administrator and that the system is back to normal. The NAV that is being disseminated today is the most recent NAV for the Funds (as of Thursday, September 3).
For primary market participants, please note that, in accordance with the Prospectus and the SAI for each PowerShares ETF, orders received before the cut-off time on any given day were processed at the NAV that was calculated by the Administrator for that day. Given the delay in the calculation and dissemination of the NAV by the Administrator, we expect that most of the orders that the Administrator received last week will settle in the normal settlement cycle. Certain orders may experience (or have experienced) a  delay in settlement. Secondary market transactions were not affected by the delay and  are anticipated to settle in ordinary course.
See detailed list of last week's NAVs  
For additional information please contact PowerShares at 1-800-983-0903.

Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. ©2017 Morningstar Inc.

Ratings are subject to change monthly. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, the Morningstar rating would have been lower. Ratings for other share classes may differ due to different performance characteristics.

Market returns are based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4 p.m. ET and do not represent the returns an investor would receive if shares were traded at other times. Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be higher or lower than performance data quoted. After-tax returns reflect the highest federal income tax rate but exclude state and local taxes. Fund performance reflects applicable fee waivers, absent which, performance data quoted would have been lower. After Tax Held and After Tax Sold are based on NAV. Returns less than one year are cumulative.

Distribution Information



Fund Distributions

Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid either quarterly or monthly, depending on the Fund. For Funds on a quarterly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the third Friday of each March, June, September and December, payable the last business day of the month. For Funds on a monthly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the 15th of each month, payable the last business day of the month. 
The fund distributes its net realized capital gains, if any, to shareholders annually. Prior to paying a distribution of net investment income, the fund has the ability to invest cash generated from investment income into additional securities or money market instruments.
Distributions in cash may be reinvested automatically in additional whole shares of the fund only if the broker through whom you purchased shares makes such option available. Shareholders of the fund may contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation. Brokers may require shareholders to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the fund purchased in the secondary market. 
Taxes on Distributions
In general, your distributions are subject to federal income tax when they are paid, whether you take them in cash or reinvest them in the Fund. Dividends paid out of the Fund’s income and net short-term gains, if any, are taxable as ordinary income. Distributions of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses are taxable as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Shares. Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid quarterly. The Fund may also pay a special distribution at the end of the calendar year to comply with federal tax requirements. 
Under the provisions of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (the “2003 Tax Act”), long-term capital gains tax rates have generally been reduced for individuals to a maximum of 15% for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2009. In addition, some ordinary dividends declared and paid by the Fund to individual shareholders may qualify for taxation at the lower reduced tax rates applicable to long-term capital gains, provided that holding period and other requirements are met by the Fund and the shareholder. 
Distributions in excess of the Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits are treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of your basis in the Shares, and as capital gain thereafter. A distribution will reduce the Fund’s net asset value per Share and may be taxable to you as ordinary income or capital gain even though, from an investment standpoint, the distribution may constitute a return of capital. 
By law, the Fund must withhold a percentage of your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number. The backup withholding rate is currently 28%.

				Fund Inception:

Shareholders may pay more than net asset value when they buy Fund shares and receive less than net asset value when they sell those shares, because shares are bought and sold at current market prices. Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results.

 Fund in Focus 









 Risk & Other Information 
 
Typically, security classifications used in calculating allocation tables are as of the last trading day of the previous month. There are risks involved with investing in ETFs, including possible loss of money. Shares are not actively managed and are subject to risks similar to those of stocks, including those regarding short selling and margin maintenance requirements. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. The Fund's return may not match the return of the Underlying Index. The Fund is subject to certain other risks. Please see the current prospectus for more information regarding the risk associated with an investment in the Fund. A value style of investing is subject to the risk that the valuations never improve or that the returns will trail other styles of investing or the overall stock markets. Investments focused in a particular industry or sector are subject to greater risk, and are more greatly impacted by market volatility, than more diversified investments. Investing in securities of large-cap companies may involve less risk than is customarily associated with investing in stocks of smaller companies. The fund may engage in frequent trading of its portfolio securities in connection with the rebalancing or adjustment of the Underlying Index. The Russell 1000® Value Index is an unmanaged index considered representative of large-cap value stocks. The Russell 1000® Value Index is a trademark/service mark of the Frank Russell Co. Russell® is a trademark of the Frank Russell Co. The Global Industry Classification Standard was developed by and is the exclusive property and a service mark of MSCI, Inc. and Standard & Poor's.

Beta is a measure of risk representing how a security is expected to respond to general market movements. Smart Beta represents an alternative and selection index based methodology that seeks to outperform a benchmark or reduce portfolio risk, or both. Smart beta funds may underperform cap-weighted benchmarks and increase portfolio risk.

		What I Should Know 
Before Investing




Equity securities are subject to price fluctuation and possible loss of principal. International investments are subject to special risks, including currency fluctuations and social, economic and political uncertainties, which could increase volatility. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. Short selling is a speculative strategy. Unlike the possible loss on a security that is purchased, there is no limit on the amount of loss on an appreciating security that is sold short. Derivatives, such as options and futures, can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses, and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance. The manager’s investment style may become out of favor and/or the manager’s selection process may prove incorrect, which may have a negative impact on the Fund’s performance.

IMPORTANT HOLDINGS INFORMATION: Portfolio holdings are based on total portfolio, and are subject to change at any time. Holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Any negative allocations or allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to unsettled trade activities.
Derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance.








IMPORTANT INFORMATION: Past performance is no guarantee of future results. These portfolios are available as investment options under a variable annuity or variable life contract. Shares of the portfolios are offered only to insurance company separate accounts that fund certain variable annuity or life contracts. These portfolios may not be available in all states and may only be offered in certain variable products. Please refer to the prospectuses. Variable annuities are long-term, tax-deferred investment vehicles designed for retirement purposes. Gains from tax-deferred investments are taxable as ordinary income upon withdrawal. Withdrawals made prior to age 59 1/2 are subject to a 10% IRS penalty charge and/or surrender charges. Investments in a variable annuity are subject to market risks, including loss of principal. Guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the insurer.
VARIABLE ANNUITIES ARE SOLD BY PROSPECTUS ONLY. AN INVESTOR SHOULD CONSIDER THE INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, RISKS, CHARGES AND EXPENSES OF THE INSURANCE CONTRACT AND THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO CAREFULLY BEFORE INVESTING. THE PROSPECTUSES CONTAIN THIS AND OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE INSURANCE CONTRACT AND THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO. FOR A FREE PROSPECTUS ON THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO, PLEASE CLICK ON THE PROSPECTUS LINK. AN INVESTOR SHOULD READ THE PROSPECTUSES CAREFULLY BEFORE INVESTING.

 An XBRL file is not a fund's complete prospectus. XBRL is an interactive data format and is provided in addition to a fund's prospectus and annual and semi-annual reports linked to this page. An XBRL file is not viewable without a viewer tool. A viewer tool is available on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. You can download an XBRL zip file and view it on the SEC website or use the data for analysis with any comparison tool.
FINANCIAL ADVISORS: Please note that not all share classes may be available for sale at your firm. Please call the Legg Mason Sales Desk 1-800-822-5544 or your Legg Mason Sales contact for more information.

Overview 












		    	Investment
		    	
		    	Overview









The ClearBridge Large Cap Value ESG Portfolios are designed for investors seeking long-term growth using a large-capitalization value investment style. The ClearBridge Large Cap Value ESG Portfolios are run by Bob Feitler, Dmitry Khaykin and their team.
 




The ESG Investment Program actively incorporates environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into the fundamental research platform and the stock-selection process. In addition, ongoing company engagement and shareholder advocacy are key components of the Program.
A few examples of the ESG considerations include:

Innovative workplace policies, employee benefits and programs
Environmental management system strength, eco-efficiency and life-cycle analysis 
Community involvement, strategic philanthropy and reputation management 
Strong corporate governance and independence on the board 

ClearBridge is a signatory to the U.N. Principles for Responsible Investment, and it is affiliated with the Investor Network on Climate Risk, the Carbon Disclosure Project, the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, the Global Impact Investing Network, the U.N. Environment Program Finance Initiative, and the U.S. Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment.
 









		    	Investment
		    	
		    	Philosophy










Managers utilize an interactive, research-driven approach to identify companies with strong business franchises and attractive valuations, and which have met our environmental, social and governance [ESG] criteria

Strong business franchises

Proven business models that we understand
Companies with sustainable competitive advantage
Capable of generating solid returns across a range of potential scenarios

Attractive valuations

Timing and probability of cash flows
Discount earnings from emerging business models or products
Evaluate price relative to normalized earnings power

 





Diversification does not guarantee a profit or protect against a loss.
There is no guarantee that the Portfolio's objectives will be met.




 
 






Investment
					 Process
















Develop a macroeconomic outlook



Consider broad economic and financial trends, which helps create a framework for individual security analysis.

















Define the investment universe



Utilize bottom-up analysis to identify best ideas that include companies which we believe have strong franchises and the potential for price appreciation.

















Employ fundamental analysis and identify catalysts



Examine relative valuation, identify favorable entry points and focus on normalized earnings.
Seek to achieve a valuation better than that of the S&P 500 Index.

















Construct portfolio and manage risk



Identify relevant socially aware considerations for each sector and compare management culture, programs and corporate policies.

















Monitor continuously



Select from among these candidates those with attractive valuations that meet ESG sustainable research criteria.

















The investment process may change over time. The characteristics set forth above are intended as a general illustration of some of the criteria the strategy team considers in selecting securities for client portfolios. There is no guarantee investment objectives will be achieved.

		What I Should Know 
Before Investing




All investments involve risk, including loss of principal and there is no guarantee that investment objectives will be met.  Investments may be made in mid-cap companies, which involve a higher degree of risk and volatility than investments in larger, more established companies.  Investments may also be made in ADRs and other securities of non-U.S. companies in developed and emerging markets which involve risks in addition to those ordinarily associated with investing in domestic securities, including the potentially negative effects of currency fluctuation, political and economic developments, foreign taxation and differences in auditing and other financial standards. These  risks are magnified in emerging markets.  









Highlights 


Investment Strategy
Invests primarily in established, large-cap companies with strong franchises and favorable valuations

Investment Objective
Seeks to generate long-term growth of capital while achieving competitive returns through a market cycle

Investment Process
Looks for companies with proven business models and incorporates environmental, social and governance issues into the portfolio construction process

Benchmark
Russell 1000 Value Index

Performance








IMPORTANT INFORMATION: Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Management and performance of individual accounts may vary for reasons that include the existence of different implementation practices and model requirements in different investment programs.
Pure Gross performance shown does not reflect the deduction of investment management fees and certain transaction costs, which will reduce portfolio performance. Net performance includes the deduction of a 3% annual wrap fee for equity and balanced portfolios and a 1.5% annual wrap fee for fixed income portfolios. These deducted fees amounts are the maximum anticipated wrap fees. Actual fees may vary. For fee schedules, contact your financial professional or, if you enter into an agreement directly with Legg Mason Private Portfolio Group, LLC ("LMPPG"), refer to LMPPG's Form ADV disclosure document. Returns reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings.

An investor cannot invest directly in an index. Unmanaged index returns do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges. 
Please see GIPS® endnotes for important additional information regarding the portfolio performance shown and for effects of fees. 

Performance Source: Legg Mason
Hypothetical growth of dollars: For illustrative purposes only. Assumes no withdrawals or contributions. The performance results shown were calculated assuming reinvestment of dividends and income and take into account both realized and unrealized capital gains and losses.

Client portfolios are managed based on investment instructions or advice provided by one or more of the following Legg Mason-affiliated sub-advisers: ClearBridge Investments, and Western Asset Management Company. Management is implemented by LMPPG, the designated sub-adviser or, in the case of certain programs, the program sponsor or its designee.

 Characteristics 






characteristics












Portfolio characteristics (Source: FactSet)


Source: FactSet. Portfolio characteristics are based on a model portfolio, not an actual client account. The model portfolio is a hypothetical portfolio whereby the portfolio characteristics are based on simulated trading and account activity of a client account invested in this strategy. The model portfolio assumes no withdrawals, contributions or client-imposed restrictions.
Portfolio characteristics of individual client accounts may differ from those of the model portfolio as a result of account size, client-imposed restrictions, the timing of client investments, market conditions, contributions, withdrawals and other factors.

*Pure gross of fee returns do not reflect the deduction of any expenses, including transaction costs, and are presented as supplemental to the net of fee returns.
n/m - Information is not statistically meaningful due to an insufficient number of portfolios in the composite for the entire year.
Compliance Statement:
ClearBridge Investments, LLC claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®) and has prepared and presented this report in compliance with the GIPS standards. ClearBridge Investments, LLC has been independently verified for the periods January 1, 1997 - December 31, 2015. The verification reports are available upon request.
Verification assesses whether (1) the firm has complied with all the composite construction requirements of the GIPS standards on a firm-wide basis and (2) the firm's policies and procedures are designed to calculate and present performance in compliance with the GIPS standards. Verification does not ensure the accuracy of any specific composite presentation.
Firm Information:
ClearBridge Investments, LLC ("ClearBridge") is a wholly owned subsidiary of Legg Mason, Inc. ("Legg Mason").  The investment advisory business now known as ClearBridge was registered in September 2005 to facilitate Legg Mason's acquisition of substantially all the equity asset management businesses known as Citigroup Asset Management.  These former businesses serve as the foundation of ClearBridge and its claim of GIPS compliance for institutional accounts through predecessor firms, effective as of January 1997.  In June 2008, ClearBridge combined this business with its retail business to form a single GIPS firm.  As of April 1, 2013 and January 1, 2016, ClearBridge's affiliates, Global Currents Investment Management, LLC, and ClearBridge, LLC, respectively, have become part of the ClearBridge GIPS firm.
Composite Information:
The ClearBridge Large Cap Value ESG SMA composite consists of discretionary wrap accounts with an account minimum of US $25,000.  The managers actively integrate criteria inclusive of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues into the portfolio construction of the strategy.  Accounts within the composite seek long-term capital appreciation by investing in securities with favorable risk-adjusted return characteristics.  Investments are primarily made in large-capitalization U.S. companies but may also invest in mid-capitalization companies.  The main risks of this strategy are General Investment Risk, Mid Cap Risk, ESG Investing Risk, and Non-U.S. Investment Risk.  Prior to June 2008, the minimum was $5,000.  The composite consists of the following percentages of non-fee-paying seed capital: 12/2013 - 11%, 12/2014 - 1.7%, 12/2015 - 1.4%, 12/2016 - 0.8%.
Input and Calculation Data:
The fee schedule currently in effect is 3.00% on all assets.  Net of fee composite returns are calculated by reducing each monthly composite pure gross rate of return by the highest "bundled" fee charged (3.00%) annually, prorated to a monthly ratio.  The "bundled" fee includes transaction costs, investment management, custodial, and other administrative fees.  Effective January 1, 2013, the number of portfolios reflects a change from prior periods due to an aggregation of accounts as reported by one sponsor.  As of January 2014, the internal dispersion of annual returns is measured by the asset-weighted standard deviation of portfolio returns included in the composite for the entire year.  For prior years, the equal-weighted standard deviation was used.  Total firm assets for 2007 represents the CBI-Retail firm.  The composite employed a 10% significant cash flow policy which was discontinued in January 2012.  A list of composite descriptions is available upon request.  Policies for valuing portfolios, calcul ating performance, and preparing compliant presentations are available upon request. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.
Benchmark Information:
The Russell 1000® Value Index measures the performance of the large-cap value segment of the U.S. equity universe






All investments involve risk, including loss of principal. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please see each product’s webpage for specific details regarding investment objective, risks associated with hedge funds, alternative investments and other risks, performance and other important information.

Commentary

As of June 30, 2017

	Quarter in review


		The JPMorgan Large Cap Value (I Class Shares) outperformed its benchmark, the Russell 1000 Value Index, for the quarter ended June 30, 2017.

		Delta Air Lines, Inc. (2.4% portfolio weighting) shares have performed well amidst an improving industry backdrop and positive commentary from their recent analyst day. Revenue strength is building broadly as business travel markets continue to recover; in addition management expects positive momentum to continue. Delta has demonstrated continued yield improvement, better PRASM results, cost discipline and restrained capacity growth. We view Delta as a high quality industrial with multiple revenue and earnings growth initiatives. We like that it generates significant free cash flow and management returns cash to shareholders through a growing dividend and repurchases.

		Citigroup, Inc. (4.4% portfolio weighting) shares did well under the backdrop of higher rates, which caused sentiment to turn more positive on the financials broadly. The combination of decent loan growth, rising rates, and ample capital/return yield creates a compelling picture for the financials. In the last week of the quarter, stellar Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) results acted as an additional catalyst as Citigroup’s return of capital plan was approved, suggesting that Citigroup has made sufficient progress improving its financial profile. Improvements in the business are a function of management controlling expenses and investing in the card, wealth management and Mexican franchises. Looking ahead, we think there’s room for the additional return of capital to shareholders.

		We originally purchased Macy's, Inc. (0.0% portfolio weighting) because of its attractive valuation, particularly as we considered two factors. First, based on credit card data checks, trends appeared to be better than department store peers. Second, we felt the company had real estate optionality. Our thesis has not played out: Macy’s has underperformed as investors are frustrated with the slow pace of management’s ability to monetize the company’s real estate position. We exited the position since we were similarly disappointed with management’s commentary about its real estate strategy.

		Despite reporting strong quarterly results, the market yawned as investors are more concerned about weakening original equipment manufacturer (OEM) fundamentals, which caused General Motors Co. (3.6% portfolio weighting) to be among the portfolio’s laggards. We own GM because of its superior cost discipline, inventory management and product cycle relative to OEM peers. The valuation is attractive and management is highly focused on driving performance and increasing shareholder value, with a track record of prudent capital allocation.


	Looking ahead


		Our approach leads us to invest in companies with compelling valuations, combined with contrarian sentiment and risk control. We remain overweight in the more cyclical areas of the market and underweight in the bond proxies.

		Three themes that we expect to persist are: 1) downward pressure on oil prices, 2) relative economic strength in Europe, and 3) higher interest rates globally. These macroeconomic views have been reflected in the portfolio by neutralizing our relative underweights to some of the large multinationals in our benchmark.

		We continue to think that higher rates will be a tailwind for financials and we’ve intentionally tilted this exposure to firms with a greater international presence. We continue to be underweight in energy, yet prefer to have exposure to Permian Basin producers.

		The portfolio continues to have large exposures to stocks that are identified as cheap within our dividend discount model, exhibit good free cash flow and strong cash flow return on investment.

Disclaimer1Please refer to the prospectus for additional information about cut-off times. Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The Fund's adviser and/or its affiliates have contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses to the extent Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, dividend and interest expenses related to short sales, interest, taxes, expenses related to litigation and potential litigation and extraordinary expenses) exceed 0.93% for A Shares, 1.45% for C Shares, 0.80% for I Shares, 1.30% for R2 Shares, 0.60% for R5 Shares and 0.55% for R6 Shares of the average daily net assets. The Fund may invest in one or more money market funds advised by the adviser or its affiliates (affiliated money market funds). The Fund's adviser has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses in an amount sufficient to offset the fees and expenses of the affiliated money market funds incurred by the Fund because of the Fund's investment in such money market funds. This waiver is in effect through 10/31/2017 for A Shares, 10/31/2017 for C Shares, 10/31/2017 for I Shares, 10/31/2018 for R2 Shares, 10/31/2017 for R5 Shares and 10/31/2017 for R6 Shares, at which time the adviser and/or its affiliates will determine whether to renew or revise it. The difference between net and gross fees includes all applicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements. The quoted performance of the Fund includes performance of a predecessor fund/share class prior to the Fund's commencement of operations. Please refer to the current prospectus for further information.  Mutual funds have fees that reduce their performance: indexes do not. You cannot invest directly in an index. The Russell 1000 Value Index is an unmanaged index measuring the performance of those Russell 1000 companies with lower price-to-book ratios and lower forecasted growth values. The performance of the Lipper Large-Cap Value Funds Index includes expenses associated with a mutual fund, such as investment management fees. These expenses are not identical to the expenses charged by the Fund. Total return figures (for the fund and any index quoted) assume payment of fees and reinvestment of dividends (after the highest applicable foreign withholding tax) and distributions. Without fee waivers, fund returns would have been lower. Due to rounding, some values may not total 100%. Â©2017, American Bankers Association, CUSIP Database provided by the Standard & Poor's CUSIP Service Bureau, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. All rights reserved.The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10- year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Rankings do not take sales loads into account.The following risks could cause the fund to lose money or perform more poorly than other investments. For more complete risk information, see the prospectus. The prices of equity securities are sensitive to a wide range of factors, from economic to company-specific news, and can fluctuate rapidly and unpredictably, causing an investment to decrease in value.Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The top 10 holdings listed reflect only the Fund's long-term investments. Short-term investments are excluded. Holdings are subject to change. The holdings listed should not be considered recommendations to purchase or sell a particular security. Each individual security is calculated as a percentage of the aggregate market value of the securities held in the Fund and does not include the use of derivative positions, where applicable. P/E ratio: the number by which earnings per share is multiplied to estimate a stock's value.  P/B ratio: the relationship between a stock's price and the book value of that stock. Sharpe ratio measures the fund's excess return compared to a risk-free investment. The higher the Sharpe ratio, the better the returns relative to the risk taken. Tracking Error: The active risk of the portfolio, which determines the annualized standard deviation of the excess returns between the portfolio and the benchmark. Alpha: The relationship between the performance of the Fund and its beta over a three-year period of time. Standard deviation/Volatility: A statistical measure of the degree to which the Fund's returns have varied from its historical average. The higher the standard deviation, the wider the range of returns from its average and the greater the historical volatility. The standard deviation is calculated over a 36-month period based on Fund's monthly returns. The standard deviation shown is based on the Fund's Class A Shares or the oldest share class, where Class A Shares are not available. R2: The percentage of a Fund's movements that result from movements in the index ranging from 0 to 100. A Fund with an R2 of 100 means that 100 percent of the Fund's movement can completely be explained by movements in the Fund's external index benchmark. EPS: Total earnings divided by the number of shares outstanding. Risk measures are calculated based upon the Funds' broad-based index as stated in the prospectus.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
