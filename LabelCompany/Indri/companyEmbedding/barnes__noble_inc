Our Founder
Leonard Riggio


            Leonard Riggio is the Founder and Chairman of Barnes & Noble, Inc. (NYSE: BKS), the world’s largest bookseller. The company employs approximately 26,000 booksellers at 633 retail stores nationwide. Mr. Riggio also founded Barnes & Noble College Booksellers, a Barnes & Noble Education company (NYSE: BNED) and a leading operator of college bookstores in the U.S., and GameStop (NYSE: GME), the world’s largest videogame retailer.        






A Commitment to Giving


Beginning with a single college bookstore in 1965, Mr. Riggio built one of the largest enterprises in the history of American retail. He is widely known as a visionary in the bookselling industry, and as a brilliant marketer and entrepreneur. 


 


Mr. Riggio is also devoted to many philanthropic initiatives, having served on nearly two dozen not-for-profit boards. He served as chairman of the Dia Art Foundation for eight years, where he led and funded the effort to build Dia:Beacon, one of the world’s most highly respected and revered contemporary art museums. Since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Mr. Riggio has built homes for families who lost their homes in New Orleans. He and his wife gifted more than 100 homes to displaced families through a not-for-profit he created called Project Home Again.
Mr. Riggio also devotes much of his time to public education. He led the nation’s first-ever private endowment for a public high school, Brooklyn Technical High School, from which he graduated in 1958.
Mr. Riggio has received honorary doctorate degrees from Baruch College of the City University of New York, Bentley College, Adelphi University, Tusculum College, and Long Island University. He has been inducted into the Academy of Distinguished Entrepreneurs at Babson College and the Texas A&M Retail Hall of Fame. Recently he has joined the board of The Fund for Public Schools of New York, which serves to create private/public partnerships designed to enhance the performance of the City’s school system.
Long passionate about helping address what he calls the “Unfinished business of the Civil Rights Movement,” he served on the Board of the Children’s Defense Fund, where he organized and funded the 1996 “Stand for Children” March in Washington. Subsequently, together with his wife Louise, he has supported the Freedom School at Haley Farm in Tennessee, whose mission is to cultivate young community leaders. Two buildings now stand as testimony to their generosity and vision: The Langston Hughes Library (Mr. Riggio’s favorite poet) and The Riggio-Lynch Chapel, jointly named for Mr. Riggio and political activist Bill Lynch. Both were designed by Maya Lin.
His commitment to promoting equality and diversity has earned him numerous awards, including the Ellis Island Medal of Honor and the Frederick Douglass Medallion. In 2002, he received the Americanism Award from the Anti-Defamation League, its highest honor. The award cited his work “to celebrate diversity and make the dream of freedom and equality a reality for so many Americans.”
Mr. Riggio is married and has three children and four grandchildren. 








“To me, a wholesome life should include a commitment to public service. Of course having the means to do so is a plus, but lending a hand requires nothing outside of a good heart.”

Barnes & Noble History | B&N INC








































Heritage
Barnes & Noble has a rich history that can be traced back to 1873 when Charles M. Barnes started the business in his Illinois home. Nearly a century later, Leonard Riggio acquired the flagship Barnes & Noble trade name and over the next four decades transformed the company into the bookselling giant that it is today.

The Company's Origins


Barnes & Noble's beginnings can be traced to 1873, when Charles M. Barnes started a book business from his home in Wheaton, Illinois. In 1917, his son, William, went to New York to join G. Clifford Noble in establishing Barnes & Noble. During the height of the Great Depression, what later became the Barnes & Noble flagship store was opened on Fifth Avenue at 18th Street in New York City. This store developed a worldwide reputation for excellence by serving millions of customers with its comprehensive selection of general trade books, academic titles and textbooks, and medical books. 




Leonard Riggio Acquires Barnes & Noble


Leonard Riggio, the modern-day Founder of the company, began his bookselling career while attending New York University in the early 1960s. Working as a clerk in the university bookstore, he became convinced that he could do a better job serving students, and he opened a competing store of his own. With a small investment, Mr. Riggio established the Student Book Exchange (SBX) in Manhattan's Greenwich Village in 1965. The store quickly became one of New York’s finest bookstores, known for its knowledgeable staff, wide selection and great service.
By the 1970s, Mr. Riggio’s thriving business, which included six other college bookstores, acquired the flagship Barnes & Noble trade name and flagship bookstore in Manhattan. Within a few years, Mr. Riggio transformed the Fifth Avenue store into "The World’s Largest Bookstore," with 150,000 textbook and trade titles. 




Innovations


Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the company made a number of groundbreaking moves. In 1974, Barnes & Noble was the first bookseller in America to advertise on television. Aired in the New York market, the Barnes & Noble “Of Course! Of Course!” commercials won awards and were so memorable that customers still recall them.
In 1975, the company took a bold and audacious step by becoming the first bookseller in America to discount books by offering New York Times bestsellers at 40% off publishers’ list prices. Barnes & Noble expanded on that idea by opening a 40,000-square-foot Sale Annex directly across from its flagship store.
The company began to expand in the New York/Boston markets by opening smaller discount bookstores. In addition, it acquired two local chains, BookMasters and Marboro Books, which were converted to Barnes & Noble discount stores. Initially, these stores were very successful and expanded to 50 locations. They were eventually phased out in favor of the company’s larger-format book superstores. The acquisition of Marboro Books gave Barnes & Noble a foothold in the growing mail-order business, which served as a platform to reach customers nationwide. This business served as a laboratory that revealed undercurrents of demand, prompting Barnes & Noble to begin publishing its own books for sale to its growing mail-order customer base. These titles were primarily out-of-print books that were reissued in high-quality, affordable editions. 




Expansion


Through the 1980s, Barnes & Noble experimented with different store formats and sizes, seeking to develop a suburban superstore version of the original Barnes & Noble store. In 1987, the company made its largest acquisition when it purchased B. Dalton Bookseller from Dayton Hudson. This acquisition of 797 retail bookstores thrust the company onto the national scene, making Barnes & Noble a nationwide retailer overnight and the second-largest bookseller in America. The company also acquired Doubleday Book Shops from the Bertelsmann Company and the rights to the Scribner’s bookstore trade name from Macmillan. To further evolve its superstore strategy, Barnes & Noble purchased BookStop, a company operating discount book superstores in Texas, in 1989. This acquisition gave the company key insights into the ingredients behind a successful superstore strategy, from real estate to operations to marketing and merchandising. 




The Book Superstore


In the early 1990s, the company refined its superstore concept and established the modern generation of Barnes & Noble superstores, which today represent over 96 percent of our retail sales. Barnes & Noble superstores have become the information piazzas of America. They combine a vast and deep selection of book titles with an experienced bookselling staff and a warm, comfortable and spacious atmosphere. They also offer a comprehensive inventory of music (including vinyl), DVDs, gift product, and toys and games. Further enhancing the stores’ appeal as destinations are our cafés, which through an exclusive arrangement with Starbucks, distinguish Barnes & Noble as the only bookseller serving America’s premier coffee brand.
Barnes & Noble became a publicly traded company in 1993. 




Internet Retailing


The company began selling direct to consumers with its mail-order catalogue in the 1970s, but in the late 1980s began experimenting with selling books online in a joint venture between Sears and IBM called Trintex. In the mid-1990s, Barnes & Noble sold books on CompuServe and later opened a full-fledged book superstore on America Online in March 1997. The company’s website, BN.com, was launched in May of that year.
Today, the BN.com website serves as the company’s largest store, enabling customers to order any book any time from anywhere. Customers also have access through BN.com to millions of used and out-of-print book titles from a network of authorized book dealers, as well as a vast selection of music CDs, DVDs, gift product, and toys and games. 




Book Publishing


The company began its publishing efforts by reissuing affordable editions of out-of-print titles. Its editions of The Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense by Suzette Haden Elgin and The Columbia History of the World by John Garrity have sold over 250,000 and 1 million copies, respectively. Over the next decade, Barnes & Noble’s nationwide store base enabled it to expand its publishing operation and become a leader in illustrated book publishing.
In the early 2000s, the company made two acquisitions that expanded its publishing capability. In 2001, Barnes & Noble purchased SparkNotes.com, a leading study aids website, offering free online access to literature notes and more than 1,000 study guides on everything from literature to chemistry to computer science. SparkNotes converted its top study guides into print publications, and they have rapidly become bestsellers. In 2003, Barnes & Noble purchased Sterling Publishing, which has been in business for nearly 70 years and has more than 5,000 titles in print, including educational resources, children’s picture books, puzzles and games, adult fiction, craft and photography, cookbooks, self-help and classics. 




Digital


The company has leveraged its unique assets, iconic brands and reach to compete in the distribution of digital content. In 2009, the company entered the eBook market and launched its NOOK® brand of eReading products, which provide a fun, easy-to-use and immersive digital reading experience. Over the past several years, the company has introduced several devices in the tablet and eReader categories. With NOOK, customers gain access to the expansive NOOK Store® of more than 4 million digital books, plus periodicals and comics. In addition to NOOK devices, the company makes it easy for customers to enjoy content across a wide array of popular devices through Free NOOK Reading Apps™, available for Android™, iOS® and Windows®. 




New Concept Stores


Starting in Fall 2016, Barnes & Noble began introducing a new store concept in several locations across the country featuring a contemporary aesthetic where books remain the hero, an expanded food and beverage offering, including wine and beer, and a major commitment to hospitality featuring table-side service. The new stores also include a special mobile experience for both booksellers and customers, featuring a mobile app that provides a digital layout of the store to facilitate finding books and other merchandise, and the ability for customers to text booksellers for assistance.

Activist Sandell Urges Barnes & Noble Board to Explore a Sale

                Sandell says bookseller could fetch $12 a share or more
            



                Argues there is a thirst for retail stocks by savvy investors
            



Sandell Asset Management Corp., the sometimes-activist hedge fund, is urging Barnes & Noble Inc. to explore a sale amid a hostile environment for retailers.Shares in the bookseller rose 15 percent to $8.17 at 1:41 p.m. in New York after earlier gaining as much as 18 percent, the biggest jump since 2013.The New York-based hedge fund has built a “meaningful position” in Barnes & Noble, it said in a letter to the board on Tuesday. Sandell said the company should explore a sale, which could fetch more than $12 a share, or a 69 percent premium over where shares closed on Monday.








“Stakeholders would be better served if Barnes & Noble were operated as a private company or as a division within a larger company, which would allow management to focus 100 percent of its attention on the company’s underlying operations,” the fund’s Chief Executive Officer Tom Sandell said in the letter.A purchase price of $1 billion, almost double Barnes & Noble’s market value, would be a “rounding error” for internet or media companies looking for a retail presence, Sandell said. Amazon.com Inc.’s agreement to buy Whole Foods Market Inc. and Sycamore Partner’s proposed deal for Staples Inc. are evidence that investors are recognizing “quality” retail stocks are undervalued.“Neither Mr. Sandell nor anyone from his hedge fund has reached out to us yet, but we welcome constructive dialogue with all of our shareholders,” said Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for Barnes & Noble. Barnes & Noble has had an uphill battle against the likes of Amazon as customers do more of their shopping online and products meant to compete with those from the internet giant, such as the Nook e-reader platform, have seen sales slip.The company previously put itself up for sale in 2010 after pressure from activist investor Ron Burkle. Liberty Media Corp. invested $204 million in Barnes & Noble in 2011 after withdrawing a proposal to acquire the whole company.

Sandell Asset Management Corp., the sometimes-activist hedge fund, is urging Barnes & Noble Inc. to explore a sale amid a hostile environment for retailers.Shares in the bookseller rose 15 percent to $8.17 at 1:41 p.m. in New York after earlier gaining as much as 18 percent, the biggest jump since 2013.The New York-based hedge fund has built a “meaningful position” in Barnes & Noble, it said in a letter to the board on Tuesday. Sandell said the company should explore a sale, which could fetch more than $12 a share, or a 69 percent premium over where shares closed on Monday.








“Stakeholders would be better served if Barnes & Noble were operated as a private company or as a division within a larger company, which would allow management to focus 100 percent of its attention on the company’s underlying operations,” the fund’s Chief Executive Officer Tom Sandell said in the letter.A purchase price of $1 billion, almost double Barnes & Noble’s market value, would be a “rounding error” for internet or media companies looking for a retail presence, Sandell said. Amazon.com Inc.’s agreement to buy Whole Foods Market Inc. and Sycamore Partner’s proposed deal for Staples Inc. are evidence that investors are recognizing “quality” retail stocks are undervalued.“Neither Mr. Sandell nor anyone from his hedge fund has reached out to us yet, but we welcome constructive dialogue with all of our shareholders,” said Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for Barnes & Noble. Barnes & Noble has had an uphill battle against the likes of Amazon as customers do more of their shopping online and products meant to compete with those from the internet giant, such as the Nook e-reader platform, have seen sales slip.The company previously put itself up for sale in 2010 after pressure from activist investor Ron Burkle. Liberty Media Corp. invested $204 million in Barnes & Noble in 2011 after withdrawing a proposal to acquire the whole company.

Barnes & Noble, Inc., is a Fortune 500 company, the bookseller with the largest number of retail outlets in the United States, and a retailer of content, digital media, and educational products. As of April 29, 2017, the company operates 633 retail stores in all 50 U.S. states.[4]
Barnes & Noble operates mainly through its Barnes & Noble Booksellers chain of bookstores. The company's headquarters are at 122 Fifth Avenue in New York City.[5]
After a series of mergers and bankruptcies in the American bookstore industry since the 1990s, Barnes & Noble stands alone as the United States' sole remaining national bookstore chain.[6][7] Previously, Barnes and Noble operated the chain of small B. Dalton Booksellers stores in malls until they announced the liquidation of the chain. The company is known for large retail outlets, many of which contain a café serving Starbucks coffee and other consumables, from cannolis to spinach and feta pretzels. Most stores sell books, magazines, newspapers, DVDs, graphic novels, gifts, games, toys, music, and Nook e‑readers and tablets.

History[edit]




Clifford Noble in 1893


1886–1929[edit]
Barnes & Noble originated in 1886 with a bookstore called John Barnes & Company, located in the Cooper Union Building in New York City.[8][9] In the fall of 1886, Gilbert Clifford Noble, a then-recent Harvard graduate from Westfield, Massachusetts, was hired to work there as a clerk.[10] In 1894, Noble was made a partner, and the name of the shop was changed to Hinds & Noble.[11] In 1901, Hinds & Noble moved to 31–35 W. 15th Street.[12]
In 1917, Noble bought out Hinds and entered into a partnership with William Barnes, son of his old friend Charles; the name of the store was changed to Barnes & Noble.[13][14] Charles Barnes had opened a book-printing business in Wheaton, Illinois in 1873; William Barnes divested himself of his ownership interest in his father's firm just before his partnership with Noble and it would go on to become Follett Corporation. Although the flagship store once featured the motto "founded in 1873," the C. M. Barnes-Wilcox Company never had any connection to Barnes & Noble other than the fact that both were partly owned (at different times) by William Barnes.
1930–1969[edit]
In 1930, Noble sold his share of the company to William Barnes' son John Wilcox Barnes.[15] Noble died on June 6, 1936, at the age of 72.[16]




Barnes & Noble's former flagship store at 105 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, New York that operated from 1932 to 2014.


In 1932, at the height of the Great Depression, the bookstore moved to a flagship location on 18th Street and Fifth Avenue,[17] which served as so until its closure in 2014. The Noble family retained ownership of an associated publishing business, and Barnes & Noble opened a new publishing division in 1931.[15] In 1940, the store was one of the first businesses to feature Muzak; it underwent a major renovation the following year.[18] That decade the company opened stores in Brooklyn and Chicago.[19] William Barnes died in 1945, at the age of 78, and his son John Wilcox Barnes assumed full control.[19] The company underwent a significant expansion between the 1950s and the 1960s, opening an additional retail store on 23rd Street in Manhattan, as well as shops near the City University of New York, Harvard, and other Northeast college campuses.[20] John Barnes died in 1964, and the company was sold to the conglomerate Amtel two years later.[21]

1970s[edit]
The business was purchased in 1971, by Leonard Riggio for $1.2 million.[20] By then, it had been badly mismanaged over the prior two years and consisted only of "a significantly reduced wholesale operation and a single retail location—the store at 105 Fifth Avenue."[20] In 1974, Barnes & Noble became the first bookstore chain to advertise on television and a year later, the company became the first bookseller in America to discount books, by selling The New York Times best-selling titles at 40% off the publishers' list price.[22] Between the 1970s and the 1980s, Barnes & Noble opened smaller discount stores, which eventually phased out in favor of larger stores. They also began to publish their own books to be sold to mail-order customers. These titles were primarily affordable reissues of out-of-print titles and selling them through mail-order catalogs allowed Barnes & Noble to reach new customers nationwide.[22]
In November 1974, in response to a question from a member of the studio audience, the British twin brothers Norris McWhirter and Ross McWhirter, who were editors of the British-produced Guinness Book of Records, claimed on the BBC One television programme Record Breakers that the Fifth Avenue store of Barnes and Noble had overtaken that of London's Foyles bookshop to become the world's biggest bookstore.[23]
1980s–1990s[edit]
Barnes & Noble continued to expand throughout the 1980s, and it purchased the primarily shopping mall-based B. Dalton chain from Dayton Hudson in 1986, for an estimated $275 million to $300 million.[24] The last B. Dalton stores were scheduled to close in January 2010.[25] In 1989, Barnes and Noble had purchased the 22-store chain Bookstop. Solveig Robinson, author of The Book in Society: An Introduction to Print Culture, wrote that the purchase "gave [Barnes and Noble] the necessary know-how and infrastructure to create what, in 1992, became the definitive bookselling superstore."[26] The acquisition of the 797 B. Dalton bookstores turned the company into a nationwide retailer, and by the end of fiscal year 1999, the second-largest online bookseller in the United States.[25] B&N's critics claim that it has contributed to the decline of local and independent booksellers.[27]
Before Barnes & Noble created its official website, it sold books directly to customers through mail-order catalogs. It first began selling books online through an early videotex service called "Trintex," a joint venture between Sears and IBM, but the company's website was not launched until May 1997.[28] According to B&N's website, it now carries over 2 million titles.[29]
2000s[edit]
In 2002, Leonard Riggio's brother Stephen Riggio was named Barnes & Noble's CEO, a position he held until 2010.[30] The Barnes & Noble Review, an online literary site, was launched in October 2007. It featured book reviews, columns, and interview from critics and authors such as Michael Dirda, John Freeman, A.C. Grayling, Ezra Klein, Paul LaFarge, Mark Sarvas, Dava Sobel, Neal Stephenson, Stephen King, and Greil Marcus.[31] Music critic Robert Christgau has also written essays for the site.[32]
Video games and related items were sold in the company's GameStop retail outlets from 1999 until late 2004, when the division was spun off by distributing its 59% stake in GameStop to stakeholders of Barnes & Noble's, making it an independent company.[33]
2010s[edit]
Website president William Lynch was named CEO in 2010. He is credited with helping launch the company's electronic book store and overseeing the introduction of its electronic book reader, the Nook. Many observers saw his appointment as underscoring the importance of digital books to Barnes & Noble's future. Steve Riggio stayed on as vice chairman.[34] Lynch resigned in mid-2013,[35] and he was replaced by Chief Financial Officer Michael Huseby early the next year.[36] Following the spinoff of Barnes and Noble Education, Huseby departed to head the new firm; his place was filled in mid-2015 by Ronald Boire,[37][38] who departed one year later.[39]
After the bankruptcy and closure of its chief competitor, Borders Group, in 2011,[40] Barnes & Noble became the last remaining national bookstore chain in America.[6][7] This followed a series of mergers and bankruptcies in the American bookstore industry since the 1990s, which also saw the demise of Waldenbooks, Barnes & Noble's own subsidiary B. Dalton, and Crown Books, among others. Barnes & Noble's largest physical bookstore rival is now Books-A-Million, which does not operate in the Western US. Barnes & Noble also faces competition from general retailers, especially from Amazon.com, and from regional and independent booksellers.
At the same time, Barnes & Noble has reduced its overall presence; it closed its original flagship store in early 2014,[41] and mid-2014 saw it spinning off the Nook Media division.[42]
Publishing[edit]
Barnes & Noble publishes some of the books it sells, inexpensively reprinting non-copyrighted titles or acquiring the U.S. or English language rights from another publisher. In addition, Barnes & Noble commissions reprint anthologies and omnibus editions using in-house editors.[citation needed]
One of these titles, The Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense by Suzette Haden Elgin, has sold over 250,000 copies.[28] The reissued edition of The Columbia History of the World by John Garrity, for example has sold over 1 million copies.[28]
Since then, the company has expanded its publishing operation. This expansion was aided by the company's 2001 acquisition of SparkNotes, an educational website and publishing company.[43] Further expansions of the company's publishing business include the purchase of Sterling Publishing in 2003.[28]
From around 1992 through early 2003, Barnes & Noble released a series of literary classics for adults and children under the imprint Barnes & Noble Classics. Originally available only in hardcover, most titles came in a black or cream-colored dust jacket edition. In 2003, Barnes & Noble revamped and expanded its line of literature classics, releasing books in hardcover, mass market, and trade paperback editions.[citation needed] In addition, Barnes & Noble has a second paperback series called the Barnes & Noble Library of Essential Reading.[44]
Food service[edit]




The Barnes & Noble café in Springfield, New Jersey


The first store to feature a café serving Starbucks beverages was in Springfield, New Jersey, in 1993. Since then, most stores have been amended or constructed specifically to feature a café serving Starbucks beverages, Harney & Sons or Tazo Tea, FIJI Bottled Water, bakery goods from The Cheesecake Factory, candy from Godiva Chocolatiers, sandwiches and other specialty products. Although the cafés are owned and operated by Barnes & Noble, servers follow Starbucks' standards in beverage preparation.[citation needed] The Barnes & Noble membership card is accepted to receive a discount on any café related goods.[45] Starbucks Rewards and gift cards are not accepted at Barnes & Noble cafés.
In 2004, Barnes & Noble began offering Wi-Fi in the café area of selected stores, using SBC FreedomLink (now the AT&T Wi-Fi network). All stores currently offer Wi-Fi, an effort which was completed in 2006. Since July 27, 2009, Wi-Fi is offered for free to all customers.[46]

In 2016, Barnes & Noble announced plans during an investor conference to open four concept stores featuring restaurants twice the size of their cafés that would offer better food, wine, and beer. The restaurants, which are planned to open in fiscal year 2017, are expected to drive sales growth; should sales meet expectations, additional concept stores could open and stores with enough space to accommodate the restaurant could have the restaurants incorporated there as well. Company officials planned to open the first such stores in New York, Minnesota, California, and Virginia.
The Barnes & Noble restaurants are expected to include a waitstaff and a full menu for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.[47]
Community involvement[edit]
Barnes & Noble hires community business development managers to engage in community outreach. These managers' responsibilities include organizing in-store events, such as author appearances, children's storytimes and book groups. Community business development managers also work closely with local schools and groups to promote literacy and the arts. For example, Barnes & Noble sponsors a children's summer reading program that promotes literacy and puts over 2 million books into the hands of the children each year.[48] Barnes & Noble also hosts bookfairs, which raise funds for schools and libraries and an annual holiday book drive to collect books for disadvantaged children. Barnes & Noble stores collected and donated nearly 1.5 million books to more than 650 local charities across the country that provide services to disadvantaged children during the 2014 Holiday Book Drive.[49] To promote nationwide literacy among 1st to 6th graders and encourage more reading during the summer, Barnes & Noble has implemented a summer challenge: if children read eight books and write about their reading, Barnes & Noble will give the reader a free book.[50]
Barnes & Noble Nook[edit]
See also: Barnes & Noble Nook
Barnes & Noble Nook (styled NOOK) is a suite of e-book readers developed by the company,[51] based on the Android platform. The first device was announced in the United States on October 20, 2009 and was released November 30, 2009, for $259.[52] On June 21, 2010, Barnes & Noble reduced the Nook's price to $199, as well as launched a new Wi-Fi-only model, for $149, and released a Nook colored touch screen for $249.[53]
The Nook competes with the Amazon Kindle, Kobo eReader, and other e-reader offerings and color tablets used sometimes as readers, such as Apple's iBooks for iOS devices. Various Nook models feature a 6-inch, 7-inch, or larger touchscreen.[54] Version 1.3 of the Nook introduced Wi-Fi connectivity, a web browser, a dictionary, chess, and sudoku games, and a separate, smaller color touchscreen that serves as the primary input device. The Nook also features a Read in Store capability that allows visitors to stream and read any book for up to one hour while shopping in a Barnes & Noble bookstore. According to a June 2010 CNet article, the company planned to expand this feature to include periodicals in the near future.[55] The color version of the Nook introduced a 7-inch color touchscreen and the ability to view at a portrait or landscape orientation.[56]
On April 30, 2012, Microsoft invested $300 million for a 17.6% stake in Nook, which valued the business at about $1.7 billion.[57]
In November 2012, the technology publications Mashable and Techdirt criticized the license agreement with which Barnes & Noble sells ebooks to consumers, pointing out that the rights to re-download a purchased ebook expire when the customer's credit card expires, and a valid credit card must be added to the account to restore this functionality.[58][59]
In June 2014, Barnes & Noble had previously announced that it would spin off its Nook Digital division into a separate publicly traded company,[42][60] but as of 2016, Nook remains a part of Barnes & Noble. That same month, the company announced a partnership with Samsung Electronics to make Nook tablets, as the bookseller moved forward with plans to revamp its digital business.[61] Samsung and Barnes & Noble introduced the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook 7.0 in August 2014, followed by the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook 10.1 in October 2014. In December 2014, Barnes & Noble announced that it had ended its Nook partnership with Microsoft by buying back its stake.[62] Samsung and Barnes & Noble continue to introduce new Nook tablets.[63]
In March 2016, Barnes & Noble announced it would close the Nook App Store and Nook Video and in the UK close the Nook Store on March 15.[64] It will continue to sell e-books as well as digital magazines and newspapers in the US.
College bookstores[edit]
In August 2015, Barnes & Noble announced the completion of the separation of its Retail and College businesses. Barnes & Noble Education, Inc. is now an independent public company and the parent of Barnes & Noble College, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol, "BNED". Barnes & Noble College Booksellers, previously owned by company chairman Leonard Riggio, operated the self-proclaimed "world's largest bookstore" on Fifth Avenue and 18th Street in New York City, from 1932 to 2014. This flagship store carried a large variety of textbooks, medical and legal books, and medical supplies, in addition to the various trade titles carried at the company's main stores.[65]

Barnes & Noble, Inc., is a Fortune 500 company, the bookseller with the largest number of retail outlets in the United States, and a retailer of content, digital media, and educational products. As of April 29, 2017, the company operates 633 retail stores in all 50 U.S. states.[4]
Barnes & Noble operates mainly through its Barnes & Noble Booksellers chain of bookstores. The company's headquarters are at 122 Fifth Avenue in New York City.[5]
After a series of mergers and bankruptcies in the American bookstore industry since the 1990s, Barnes & Noble stands alone as the United States' sole remaining national bookstore chain.[6][7] Previously, Barnes and Noble operated the chain of small B. Dalton Booksellers stores in malls until they announced the liquidation of the chain. The company is known for large retail outlets, many of which contain a café serving Starbucks coffee and other consumables, from cannolis to spinach and feta pretzels. Most stores sell books, magazines, newspapers, DVDs, graphic novels, gifts, games, toys, music, and Nook e‑readers and tablets.

History[edit]




Clifford Noble in 1893


1886–1929[edit]
Barnes & Noble originated in 1886 with a bookstore called John Barnes & Company, located in the Cooper Union Building in New York City.[8][9] In the fall of 1886, Gilbert Clifford Noble, a then-recent Harvard graduate from Westfield, Massachusetts, was hired to work there as a clerk.[10] In 1894, Noble was made a partner, and the name of the shop was changed to Hinds & Noble.[11] In 1901, Hinds & Noble moved to 31–35 W. 15th Street.[12]
In 1917, Noble bought out Hinds and entered into a partnership with William Barnes, son of his old friend Charles; the name of the store was changed to Barnes & Noble.[13][14] Charles Barnes had opened a book-printing business in Wheaton, Illinois in 1873; William Barnes divested himself of his ownership interest in his father's firm just before his partnership with Noble and it would go on to become Follett Corporation. Although the flagship store once featured the motto "founded in 1873," the C. M. Barnes-Wilcox Company never had any connection to Barnes & Noble other than the fact that both were partly owned (at different times) by William Barnes.
1930–1969[edit]
In 1930, Noble sold his share of the company to William Barnes' son John Wilcox Barnes.[15] Noble died on June 6, 1936, at the age of 72.[16]




Barnes & Noble's former flagship store at 105 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, New York that operated from 1932 to 2014.


In 1932, at the height of the Great Depression, the bookstore moved to a flagship location on 18th Street and Fifth Avenue,[17] which served as so until its closure in 2014. The Noble family retained ownership of an associated publishing business, and Barnes & Noble opened a new publishing division in 1931.[15] In 1940, the store was one of the first businesses to feature Muzak; it underwent a major renovation the following year.[18] That decade the company opened stores in Brooklyn and Chicago.[19] William Barnes died in 1945, at the age of 78, and his son John Wilcox Barnes assumed full control.[19] The company underwent a significant expansion between the 1950s and the 1960s, opening an additional retail store on 23rd Street in Manhattan, as well as shops near the City University of New York, Harvard, and other Northeast college campuses.[20] John Barnes died in 1964, and the company was sold to the conglomerate Amtel two years later.[21]

1970s[edit]
The business was purchased in 1971, by Leonard Riggio for $1.2 million.[20] By then, it had been badly mismanaged over the prior two years and consisted only of "a significantly reduced wholesale operation and a single retail location—the store at 105 Fifth Avenue."[20] In 1974, Barnes & Noble became the first bookstore chain to advertise on television and a year later, the company became the first bookseller in America to discount books, by selling The New York Times best-selling titles at 40% off the publishers' list price.[22] Between the 1970s and the 1980s, Barnes & Noble opened smaller discount stores, which eventually phased out in favor of larger stores. They also began to publish their own books to be sold to mail-order customers. These titles were primarily affordable reissues of out-of-print titles and selling them through mail-order catalogs allowed Barnes & Noble to reach new customers nationwide.[22]
In November 1974, in response to a question from a member of the studio audience, the British twin brothers Norris McWhirter and Ross McWhirter, who were editors of the British-produced Guinness Book of Records, claimed on the BBC One television programme Record Breakers that the Fifth Avenue store of Barnes and Noble had overtaken that of London's Foyles bookshop to become the world's biggest bookstore.[23]
1980s–1990s[edit]
Barnes & Noble continued to expand throughout the 1980s, and it purchased the primarily shopping mall-based B. Dalton chain from Dayton Hudson in 1986, for an estimated $275 million to $300 million.[24] The last B. Dalton stores were scheduled to close in January 2010.[25] In 1989, Barnes and Noble had purchased the 22-store chain Bookstop. Solveig Robinson, author of The Book in Society: An Introduction to Print Culture, wrote that the purchase "gave [Barnes and Noble] the necessary know-how and infrastructure to create what, in 1992, became the definitive bookselling superstore."[26] The acquisition of the 797 B. Dalton bookstores turned the company into a nationwide retailer, and by the end of fiscal year 1999, the second-largest online bookseller in the United States.[25] B&N's critics claim that it has contributed to the decline of local and independent booksellers.[27]
Before Barnes & Noble created its official website, it sold books directly to customers through mail-order catalogs. It first began selling books online through an early videotex service called "Trintex," a joint venture between Sears and IBM, but the company's website was not launched until May 1997.[28] According to B&N's website, it now carries over 2 million titles.[29]
2000s[edit]
In 2002, Leonard Riggio's brother Stephen Riggio was named Barnes & Noble's CEO, a position he held until 2010.[30] The Barnes & Noble Review, an online literary site, was launched in October 2007. It featured book reviews, columns, and interview from critics and authors such as Michael Dirda, John Freeman, A.C. Grayling, Ezra Klein, Paul LaFarge, Mark Sarvas, Dava Sobel, Neal Stephenson, Stephen King, and Greil Marcus.[31] Music critic Robert Christgau has also written essays for the site.[32]
Video games and related items were sold in the company's GameStop retail outlets from 1999 until late 2004, when the division was spun off by distributing its 59% stake in GameStop to stakeholders of Barnes & Noble's, making it an independent company.[33]
2010s[edit]
Website president William Lynch was named CEO in 2010. He is credited with helping launch the company's electronic book store and overseeing the introduction of its electronic book reader, the Nook. Many observers saw his appointment as underscoring the importance of digital books to Barnes & Noble's future. Steve Riggio stayed on as vice chairman.[34] Lynch resigned in mid-2013,[35] and he was replaced by Chief Financial Officer Michael Huseby early the next year.[36] Following the spinoff of Barnes and Noble Education, Huseby departed to head the new firm; his place was filled in mid-2015 by Ronald Boire,[37][38] who departed one year later.[39]
After the bankruptcy and closure of its chief competitor, Borders Group, in 2011,[40] Barnes & Noble became the last remaining national bookstore chain in America.[6][7] This followed a series of mergers and bankruptcies in the American bookstore industry since the 1990s, which also saw the demise of Waldenbooks, Barnes & Noble's own subsidiary B. Dalton, and Crown Books, among others. Barnes & Noble's largest physical bookstore rival is now Books-A-Million, which does not operate in the Western US. Barnes & Noble also faces competition from general retailers, especially from Amazon.com, and from regional and independent booksellers.
At the same time, Barnes & Noble has reduced its overall presence; it closed its original flagship store in early 2014,[41] and mid-2014 saw it spinning off the Nook Media division.[42]
Publishing[edit]
Barnes & Noble publishes some of the books it sells, inexpensively reprinting non-copyrighted titles or acquiring the U.S. or English language rights from another publisher. In addition, Barnes & Noble commissions reprint anthologies and omnibus editions using in-house editors.[citation needed]
One of these titles, The Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense by Suzette Haden Elgin, has sold over 250,000 copies.[28] The reissued edition of The Columbia History of the World by John Garrity, for example has sold over 1 million copies.[28]
Since then, the company has expanded its publishing operation. This expansion was aided by the company's 2001 acquisition of SparkNotes, an educational website and publishing company.[43] Further expansions of the company's publishing business include the purchase of Sterling Publishing in 2003.[28]
From around 1992 through early 2003, Barnes & Noble released a series of literary classics for adults and children under the imprint Barnes & Noble Classics. Originally available only in hardcover, most titles came in a black or cream-colored dust jacket edition. In 2003, Barnes & Noble revamped and expanded its line of literature classics, releasing books in hardcover, mass market, and trade paperback editions.[citation needed] In addition, Barnes & Noble has a second paperback series called the Barnes & Noble Library of Essential Reading.[44]
Food service[edit]




The Barnes & Noble café in Springfield, New Jersey


The first store to feature a café serving Starbucks beverages was in Springfield, New Jersey, in 1993. Since then, most stores have been amended or constructed specifically to feature a café serving Starbucks beverages, Harney & Sons or Tazo Tea, FIJI Bottled Water, bakery goods from The Cheesecake Factory, candy from Godiva Chocolatiers, sandwiches and other specialty products. Although the cafés are owned and operated by Barnes & Noble, servers follow Starbucks' standards in beverage preparation.[citation needed] The Barnes & Noble membership card is accepted to receive a discount on any café related goods.[45] Starbucks Rewards and gift cards are not accepted at Barnes & Noble cafés.
In 2004, Barnes & Noble began offering Wi-Fi in the café area of selected stores, using SBC FreedomLink (now the AT&T Wi-Fi network). All stores currently offer Wi-Fi, an effort which was completed in 2006. Since July 27, 2009, Wi-Fi is offered for free to all customers.[46]

In 2016, Barnes & Noble announced plans during an investor conference to open four concept stores featuring restaurants twice the size of their cafés that would offer better food, wine, and beer. The restaurants, which are planned to open in fiscal year 2017, are expected to drive sales growth; should sales meet expectations, additional concept stores could open and stores with enough space to accommodate the restaurant could have the restaurants incorporated there as well. Company officials planned to open the first such stores in New York, Minnesota, California, and Virginia.
The Barnes & Noble restaurants are expected to include a waitstaff and a full menu for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.[47]
Community involvement[edit]
Barnes & Noble hires community business development managers to engage in community outreach. These managers' responsibilities include organizing in-store events, such as author appearances, children's storytimes and book groups. Community business development managers also work closely with local schools and groups to promote literacy and the arts. For example, Barnes & Noble sponsors a children's summer reading program that promotes literacy and puts over 2 million books into the hands of the children each year.[48] Barnes & Noble also hosts bookfairs, which raise funds for schools and libraries and an annual holiday book drive to collect books for disadvantaged children. Barnes & Noble stores collected and donated nearly 1.5 million books to more than 650 local charities across the country that provide services to disadvantaged children during the 2014 Holiday Book Drive.[49] To promote nationwide literacy among 1st to 6th graders and encourage more reading during the summer, Barnes & Noble has implemented a summer challenge: if children read eight books and write about their reading, Barnes & Noble will give the reader a free book.[50]
Barnes & Noble Nook[edit]
See also: Barnes & Noble Nook
Barnes & Noble Nook (styled NOOK) is a suite of e-book readers developed by the company,[51] based on the Android platform. The first device was announced in the United States on October 20, 2009 and was released November 30, 2009, for $259.[52] On June 21, 2010, Barnes & Noble reduced the Nook's price to $199, as well as launched a new Wi-Fi-only model, for $149, and released a Nook colored touch screen for $249.[53]
The Nook competes with the Amazon Kindle, Kobo eReader, and other e-reader offerings and color tablets used sometimes as readers, such as Apple's iBooks for iOS devices. Various Nook models feature a 6-inch, 7-inch, or larger touchscreen.[54] Version 1.3 of the Nook introduced Wi-Fi connectivity, a web browser, a dictionary, chess, and sudoku games, and a separate, smaller color touchscreen that serves as the primary input device. The Nook also features a Read in Store capability that allows visitors to stream and read any book for up to one hour while shopping in a Barnes & Noble bookstore. According to a June 2010 CNet article, the company planned to expand this feature to include periodicals in the near future.[55] The color version of the Nook introduced a 7-inch color touchscreen and the ability to view at a portrait or landscape orientation.[56]
On April 30, 2012, Microsoft invested $300 million for a 17.6% stake in Nook, which valued the business at about $1.7 billion.[57]
In November 2012, the technology publications Mashable and Techdirt criticized the license agreement with which Barnes & Noble sells ebooks to consumers, pointing out that the rights to re-download a purchased ebook expire when the customer's credit card expires, and a valid credit card must be added to the account to restore this functionality.[58][59]
In June 2014, Barnes & Noble had previously announced that it would spin off its Nook Digital division into a separate publicly traded company,[42][60] but as of 2016, Nook remains a part of Barnes & Noble. That same month, the company announced a partnership with Samsung Electronics to make Nook tablets, as the bookseller moved forward with plans to revamp its digital business.[61] Samsung and Barnes & Noble introduced the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook 7.0 in August 2014, followed by the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook 10.1 in October 2014. In December 2014, Barnes & Noble announced that it had ended its Nook partnership with Microsoft by buying back its stake.[62] Samsung and Barnes & Noble continue to introduce new Nook tablets.[63]
In March 2016, Barnes & Noble announced it would close the Nook App Store and Nook Video and in the UK close the Nook Store on March 15.[64] It will continue to sell e-books as well as digital magazines and newspapers in the US.
College bookstores[edit]
In August 2015, Barnes & Noble announced the completion of the separation of its Retail and College businesses. Barnes & Noble Education, Inc. is now an independent public company and the parent of Barnes & Noble College, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol, "BNED". Barnes & Noble College Booksellers, previously owned by company chairman Leonard Riggio, operated the self-proclaimed "world's largest bookstore" on Fifth Avenue and 18th Street in New York City, from 1932 to 2014. This flagship store carried a large variety of textbooks, medical and legal books, and medical supplies, in addition to the various trade titles carried at the company's main stores.[65]

Barnes & Noble, Inc., is a Fortune 500 company, the bookseller with the largest number of retail outlets in the United States, and a retailer of content, digital media, and educational products. As of April 29, 2017, the company operates 633 retail stores in all 50 U.S. states.[4]
Barnes & Noble operates mainly through its Barnes & Noble Booksellers chain of bookstores. The company's headquarters are at 122 Fifth Avenue in New York City.[5]
After a series of mergers and bankruptcies in the American bookstore industry since the 1990s, Barnes & Noble stands alone as the United States' sole remaining national bookstore chain.[6][7] Previously, Barnes and Noble operated the chain of small B. Dalton Booksellers stores in malls until they announced the liquidation of the chain. The company is known for large retail outlets, many of which contain a café serving Starbucks coffee and other consumables, from cannolis to spinach and feta pretzels. Most stores sell books, magazines, newspapers, DVDs, graphic novels, gifts, games, toys, music, and Nook e‑readers and tablets.

History[edit]




Clifford Noble in 1893


1886–1929[edit]
Barnes & Noble originated in 1886 with a bookstore called John Barnes & Company, located in the Cooper Union Building in New York City.[8][9] In the fall of 1886, Gilbert Clifford Noble, a then-recent Harvard graduate from Westfield, Massachusetts, was hired to work there as a clerk.[10] In 1894, Noble was made a partner, and the name of the shop was changed to Hinds & Noble.[11] In 1901, Hinds & Noble moved to 31–35 W. 15th Street.[12]
In 1917, Noble bought out Hinds and entered into a partnership with William Barnes, son of his old friend Charles; the name of the store was changed to Barnes & Noble.[13][14] Charles Barnes had opened a book-printing business in Wheaton, Illinois in 1873; William Barnes divested himself of his ownership interest in his father's firm just before his partnership with Noble and it would go on to become Follett Corporation. Although the flagship store once featured the motto "founded in 1873," the C. M. Barnes-Wilcox Company never had any connection to Barnes & Noble other than the fact that both were partly owned (at different times) by William Barnes.
1930–1969[edit]
In 1930, Noble sold his share of the company to William Barnes' son John Wilcox Barnes.[15] Noble died on June 6, 1936, at the age of 72.[16]

In 1932, at the height of the Great Depression, the bookstore moved to a flagship location on 18th Street and Fifth Avenue,[17] which served as so until its closure in 2014. The Noble family retained ownership of an associated publishing business, and Barnes & Noble opened a new publishing division in 1931.[15] In 1940, the store was one of the first businesses to feature Muzak; it underwent a major renovation the following year.[18] That decade the company opened stores in Brooklyn and Chicago.[19] William Barnes died in 1945, at the age of 78, and his son John Wilcox Barnes assumed full control.[19] The company underwent a significant expansion between the 1950s and the 1960s, opening an additional retail store on 23rd Street in Manhattan, as well as shops near the City University of New York, Harvard, and other Northeast college campuses.[20] John Barnes died in 1964, and the company was sold to the conglomerate Amtel two years later.[21]

1970s[edit]
The business was purchased in 1971, by Leonard Riggio for $1.2 million.[20] By then, it had been badly mismanaged over the prior two years and consisted only of "a significantly reduced wholesale operation and a single retail location—the store at 105 Fifth Avenue."[20] In 1974, Barnes & Noble became the first bookstore chain to advertise on television and a year later, the company became the first bookseller in America to discount books, by selling The New York Times best-selling titles at 40% off the publishers' list price.[22] Between the 1970s and the 1980s, Barnes & Noble opened smaller discount stores, which eventually phased out in favor of larger stores. They also began to publish their own books to be sold to mail-order customers. These titles were primarily affordable reissues of out-of-print titles and selling them through mail-order catalogs allowed Barnes & Noble to reach new customers nationwide.[22]
In November 1974, in response to a question from a member of the studio audience, the British twin brothers Norris McWhirter and Ross McWhirter, who were editors of the British-produced Guinness Book of Records, claimed on the BBC One television programme Record Breakers that the Fifth Avenue store of Barnes and Noble had overtaken that of London's Foyles bookshop to become the world's biggest bookstore.[23]
1980s–1990s[edit]
Barnes & Noble continued to expand throughout the 1980s, and it purchased the primarily shopping mall-based B. Dalton chain from Dayton Hudson in 1986, for an estimated $275 million to $300 million.[24] The last B. Dalton stores were scheduled to close in January 2010.[25] In 1989, Barnes and Noble had purchased the 22-store chain Bookstop. Solveig Robinson, author of The Book in Society: An Introduction to Print Culture, wrote that the purchase "gave [Barnes and Noble] the necessary know-how and infrastructure to create what, in 1992, became the definitive bookselling superstore."[26] The acquisition of the 797 B. Dalton bookstores turned the company into a nationwide retailer, and by the end of fiscal year 1999, the second-largest online bookseller in the United States.[25] B&N's critics claim that it has contributed to the decline of local and independent booksellers.[27]
Before Barnes & Noble created its official website, it sold books directly to customers through mail-order catalogs. It first began selling books online through an early videotex service called "Trintex," a joint venture between Sears and IBM, but the company's website was not launched until May 1997.[28] According to B&N's website, it now carries over 2 million titles.[29]
2000s[edit]
In 2002, Leonard Riggio's brother Stephen Riggio was named Barnes & Noble's CEO, a position he held until 2010.[30] The Barnes & Noble Review, an online literary site, was launched in October 2007. It featured book reviews, columns, and interview from critics and authors such as Michael Dirda, John Freeman, A.C. Grayling, Ezra Klein, Paul LaFarge, Mark Sarvas, Dava Sobel, Neal Stephenson, Stephen King, and Greil Marcus.[31] Music critic Robert Christgau has also written essays for the site.[32]
Video games and related items were sold in the company's GameStop retail outlets from 1999 until late 2004, when the division was spun off by distributing its 59% stake in GameStop to stakeholders of Barnes & Noble's, making it an independent company.[33]
2010s[edit]
Website president William Lynch was named CEO in 2010. He is credited with helping launch the company's electronic book store and overseeing the introduction of its electronic book reader, the Nook. Many observers saw his appointment as underscoring the importance of digital books to Barnes & Noble's future. Steve Riggio stayed on as vice chairman.[34] Lynch resigned in mid-2013,[35] and he was replaced by Chief Financial Officer Michael Huseby early the next year.[36] Following the spinoff of Barnes and Noble Education, Huseby departed to head the new firm; his place was filled in mid-2015 by Ronald Boire,[37][38] who departed one year later.[39]
After the bankruptcy and closure of its chief competitor, Borders Group, in 2011,[40] Barnes & Noble became the last remaining national bookstore chain in America.[6][7] This followed a series of mergers and bankruptcies in the American bookstore industry since the 1990s, which also saw the demise of Waldenbooks, Barnes & Noble's own subsidiary B. Dalton, and Crown Books, among others. Barnes & Noble's largest physical bookstore rival is now Books-A-Million, which does not operate in the Western US. Barnes & Noble also faces competition from general retailers, especially from Amazon.com, and from regional and independent booksellers.
At the same time, Barnes & Noble has reduced its overall presence; it closed its original flagship store in early 2014,[41] and mid-2014 saw it spinning off the Nook Media division.[42]
Publishing[edit]
Barnes & Noble publishes some of the books it sells, inexpensively reprinting non-copyrighted titles or acquiring the U.S. or English language rights from another publisher. In addition, Barnes & Noble commissions reprint anthologies and omnibus editions using in-house editors.[citation needed]
One of these titles, The Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense by Suzette Haden Elgin, has sold over 250,000 copies.[28] The reissued edition of The Columbia History of the World by John Garrity, for example has sold over 1 million copies.[28]
Since then, the company has expanded its publishing operation. This expansion was aided by the company's 2001 acquisition of SparkNotes, an educational website and publishing company.[43] Further expansions of the company's publishing business include the purchase of Sterling Publishing in 2003.[28]
From around 1992 through early 2003, Barnes & Noble released a series of literary classics for adults and children under the imprint Barnes & Noble Classics. Originally available only in hardcover, most titles came in a black or cream-colored dust jacket edition. In 2003, Barnes & Noble revamped and expanded its line of literature classics, releasing books in hardcover, mass market, and trade paperback editions.[citation needed] In addition, Barnes & Noble has a second paperback series called the Barnes & Noble Library of Essential Reading.[44]
Food service[edit]




The Barnes & Noble café in Springfield, New Jersey


The first store to feature a café serving Starbucks beverages was in Springfield, New Jersey, in 1993. Since then, most stores have been amended or constructed specifically to feature a café serving Starbucks beverages, Harney & Sons or Tazo Tea, FIJI Bottled Water, bakery goods from The Cheesecake Factory, candy from Godiva Chocolatiers, sandwiches and other specialty products. Although the cafés are owned and operated by Barnes & Noble, servers follow Starbucks' standards in beverage preparation.[citation needed] The Barnes & Noble membership card is accepted to receive a discount on any café related goods.[45] Starbucks Rewards and gift cards are not accepted at Barnes & Noble cafés.
In 2004, Barnes & Noble began offering Wi-Fi in the café area of selected stores, using SBC FreedomLink (now the AT&T Wi-Fi network). All stores currently offer Wi-Fi, an effort which was completed in 2006. Since July 27, 2009, Wi-Fi is offered for free to all customers.[46]

In 2016, Barnes & Noble announced plans during an investor conference to open four concept stores featuring restaurants twice the size of their cafés that would offer better food, wine, and beer. The restaurants, which are planned to open in fiscal year 2017, are expected to drive sales growth; should sales meet expectations, additional concept stores could open and stores with enough space to accommodate the restaurant could have the restaurants incorporated there as well. Company officials planned to open the first such stores in New York, Minnesota, California, and Virginia.
The Barnes & Noble restaurants are expected to include a waitstaff and a full menu for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.[47]
Community involvement[edit]
Barnes & Noble hires community business development managers to engage in community outreach. These managers' responsibilities include organizing in-store events, such as author appearances, children's storytimes and book groups. Community business development managers also work closely with local schools and groups to promote literacy and the arts. For example, Barnes & Noble sponsors a children's summer reading program that promotes literacy and puts over 2 million books into the hands of the children each year.[48] Barnes & Noble also hosts bookfairs, which raise funds for schools and libraries and an annual holiday book drive to collect books for disadvantaged children. Barnes & Noble stores collected and donated nearly 1.5 million books to more than 650 local charities across the country that provide services to disadvantaged children during the 2014 Holiday Book Drive.[49] To promote nationwide literacy among 1st to 6th graders and encourage more reading during the summer, Barnes & Noble has implemented a summer challenge: if children read eight books and write about their reading, Barnes & Noble will give the reader a free book.[50]
Barnes & Noble Nook[edit]
See also: Barnes & Noble Nook
Barnes & Noble Nook (styled NOOK) is a suite of e-book readers developed by the company,[51] based on the Android platform. The first device was announced in the United States on October 20, 2009 and was released November 30, 2009, for $259.[52] On June 21, 2010, Barnes & Noble reduced the Nook's price to $199, as well as launched a new Wi-Fi-only model, for $149, and released a Nook colored touch screen for $249.[53]
The Nook competes with the Amazon Kindle, Kobo eReader, and other e-reader offerings and color tablets used sometimes as readers, such as Apple's iBooks for iOS devices. Various Nook models feature a 6-inch, 7-inch, or larger touchscreen.[54] Version 1.3 of the Nook introduced Wi-Fi connectivity, a web browser, a dictionary, chess, and sudoku games, and a separate, smaller color touchscreen that serves as the primary input device. The Nook also features a Read in Store capability that allows visitors to stream and read any book for up to one hour while shopping in a Barnes & Noble bookstore. According to a June 2010 CNet article, the company planned to expand this feature to include periodicals in the near future.[55] The color version of the Nook introduced a 7-inch color touchscreen and the ability to view at a portrait or landscape orientation.[56]
On April 30, 2012, Microsoft invested $300 million for a 17.6% stake in Nook, which valued the business at about $1.7 billion.[57]
In November 2012, the technology publications Mashable and Techdirt criticized the license agreement with which Barnes & Noble sells ebooks to consumers, pointing out that the rights to re-download a purchased ebook expire when the customer's credit card expires, and a valid credit card must be added to the account to restore this functionality.[58][59]
In June 2014, Barnes & Noble had previously announced that it would spin off its Nook Digital division into a separate publicly traded company,[42][60] but as of 2016, Nook remains a part of Barnes & Noble. That same month, the company announced a partnership with Samsung Electronics to make Nook tablets, as the bookseller moved forward with plans to revamp its digital business.[61] Samsung and Barnes & Noble introduced the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook 7.0 in August 2014, followed by the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook 10.1 in October 2014. In December 2014, Barnes & Noble announced that it had ended its Nook partnership with Microsoft by buying back its stake.[62] Samsung and Barnes & Noble continue to introduce new Nook tablets.[63]
In March 2016, Barnes & Noble announced it would close the Nook App Store and Nook Video and in the UK close the Nook Store on March 15.[64] It will continue to sell e-books as well as digital magazines and newspapers in the US.
College bookstores[edit]
In August 2015, Barnes & Noble announced the completion of the separation of its Retail and College businesses. Barnes & Noble Education, Inc. is now an independent public company and the parent of Barnes & Noble College, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol, "BNED". Barnes & Noble College Booksellers, previously owned by company chairman Leonard Riggio, operated the self-proclaimed "world's largest bookstore" on Fifth Avenue and 18th Street in New York City, from 1932 to 2014. This flagship store carried a large variety of textbooks, medical and legal books, and medical supplies, in addition to the various trade titles carried at the company's main stores.[65]

Barnes & Noble, Inc., is a Fortune 500 company, the bookseller with the largest number of retail outlets in the United States, and a retailer of content, digital media, and educational products. As of April 29, 2017, the company operates 633 retail stores in all 50 U.S. states.[4]
Barnes & Noble operates mainly through its Barnes & Noble Booksellers chain of bookstores. The company's headquarters are at 122 Fifth Avenue in New York City.[5]
After a series of mergers and bankruptcies in the American bookstore industry since the 1990s, Barnes & Noble stands alone as the United States' sole remaining national bookstore chain.[6][7] Previously, Barnes and Noble operated the chain of small B. Dalton Booksellers stores in malls until they announced the liquidation of the chain. The company is known for large retail outlets, many of which contain a café serving Starbucks coffee and other consumables, from cannolis to spinach and feta pretzels. Most stores sell books, magazines, newspapers, DVDs, graphic novels, gifts, games, toys, music, and Nook e‑readers and tablets.

Barnes & Noble originated in 1886 with a bookstore called John Barnes & Company, located in the Cooper Union Building in New York City.[8][9] In the fall of 1886, Gilbert Clifford Noble, a then-recent Harvard graduate from Westfield, Massachusetts, was hired to work there as a clerk.[10] In 1894, Noble was made a partner, and the name of the shop was changed to Hinds & Noble.[11] In 1901, Hinds & Noble moved to 31–35 W. 15th Street.[12]
In 1917, Noble bought out Hinds and entered into a partnership with William Barnes, son of his old friend Charles; the name of the store was changed to Barnes & Noble.[13][14] Charles Barnes had opened a book-printing business in Wheaton, Illinois in 1873; William Barnes divested himself of his ownership interest in his father's firm just before his partnership with Noble and it would go on to become Follett Corporation. Although the flagship store once featured the motto "founded in 1873," the C. M. Barnes-Wilcox Company never had any connection to Barnes & Noble other than the fact that both were partly owned (at different times) by William Barnes.
1930–1969[edit]
In 1930, Noble sold his share of the company to William Barnes' son John Wilcox Barnes.[15] Noble died on June 6, 1936, at the age of 72.[16]

In 1932, at the height of the Great Depression, the bookstore moved to a flagship location on 18th Street and Fifth Avenue,[17] which served as so until its closure in 2014. The Noble family retained ownership of an associated publishing business, and Barnes & Noble opened a new publishing division in 1931.[15] In 1940, the store was one of the first businesses to feature Muzak; it underwent a major renovation the following year.[18] That decade the company opened stores in Brooklyn and Chicago.[19] William Barnes died in 1945, at the age of 78, and his son John Wilcox Barnes assumed full control.[19] The company underwent a significant expansion between the 1950s and the 1960s, opening an additional retail store on 23rd Street in Manhattan, as well as shops near the City University of New York, Harvard, and other Northeast college campuses.[20] John Barnes died in 1964, and the company was sold to the conglomerate Amtel two years later.[21]

1970s[edit]
The business was purchased in 1971, by Leonard Riggio for $1.2 million.[20] By then, it had been badly mismanaged over the prior two years and consisted only of "a significantly reduced wholesale operation and a single retail location—the store at 105 Fifth Avenue."[20] In 1974, Barnes & Noble became the first bookstore chain to advertise on television and a year later, the company became the first bookseller in America to discount books, by selling The New York Times best-selling titles at 40% off the publishers' list price.[22] Between the 1970s and the 1980s, Barnes & Noble opened smaller discount stores, which eventually phased out in favor of larger stores. They also began to publish their own books to be sold to mail-order customers. These titles were primarily affordable reissues of out-of-print titles and selling them through mail-order catalogs allowed Barnes & Noble to reach new customers nationwide.[22]
In November 1974, in response to a question from a member of the studio audience, the British twin brothers Norris McWhirter and Ross McWhirter, who were editors of the British-produced Guinness Book of Records, claimed on the BBC One television programme Record Breakers that the Fifth Avenue store of Barnes and Noble had overtaken that of London's Foyles bookshop to become the world's biggest bookstore.[23]
1980s–1990s[edit]
Barnes & Noble continued to expand throughout the 1980s, and it purchased the primarily shopping mall-based B. Dalton chain from Dayton Hudson in 1986, for an estimated $275 million to $300 million.[24] The last B. Dalton stores were scheduled to close in January 2010.[25] In 1989, Barnes and Noble had purchased the 22-store chain Bookstop. Solveig Robinson, author of The Book in Society: An Introduction to Print Culture, wrote that the purchase "gave [Barnes and Noble] the necessary know-how and infrastructure to create what, in 1992, became the definitive bookselling superstore."[26] The acquisition of the 797 B. Dalton bookstores turned the company into a nationwide retailer, and by the end of fiscal year 1999, the second-largest online bookseller in the United States.[25] B&N's critics claim that it has contributed to the decline of local and independent booksellers.[27]
Before Barnes & Noble created its official website, it sold books directly to customers through mail-order catalogs. It first began selling books online through an early videotex service called "Trintex," a joint venture between Sears and IBM, but the company's website was not launched until May 1997.[28] According to B&N's website, it now carries over 2 million titles.[29]
2000s[edit]
In 2002, Leonard Riggio's brother Stephen Riggio was named Barnes & Noble's CEO, a position he held until 2010.[30] The Barnes & Noble Review, an online literary site, was launched in October 2007. It featured book reviews, columns, and interview from critics and authors such as Michael Dirda, John Freeman, A.C. Grayling, Ezra Klein, Paul LaFarge, Mark Sarvas, Dava Sobel, Neal Stephenson, Stephen King, and Greil Marcus.[31] Music critic Robert Christgau has also written essays for the site.[32]
Video games and related items were sold in the company's GameStop retail outlets from 1999 until late 2004, when the division was spun off by distributing its 59% stake in GameStop to stakeholders of Barnes & Noble's, making it an independent company.[33]
2010s[edit]
Website president William Lynch was named CEO in 2010. He is credited with helping launch the company's electronic book store and overseeing the introduction of its electronic book reader, the Nook. Many observers saw his appointment as underscoring the importance of digital books to Barnes & Noble's future. Steve Riggio stayed on as vice chairman.[34] Lynch resigned in mid-2013,[35] and he was replaced by Chief Financial Officer Michael Huseby early the next year.[36] Following the spinoff of Barnes and Noble Education, Huseby departed to head the new firm; his place was filled in mid-2015 by Ronald Boire,[37][38] who departed one year later.[39]
After the bankruptcy and closure of its chief competitor, Borders Group, in 2011,[40] Barnes & Noble became the last remaining national bookstore chain in America.[6][7] This followed a series of mergers and bankruptcies in the American bookstore industry since the 1990s, which also saw the demise of Waldenbooks, Barnes & Noble's own subsidiary B. Dalton, and Crown Books, among others. Barnes & Noble's largest physical bookstore rival is now Books-A-Million, which does not operate in the Western US. Barnes & Noble also faces competition from general retailers, especially from Amazon.com, and from regional and independent booksellers.
At the same time, Barnes & Noble has reduced its overall presence; it closed its original flagship store in early 2014,[41] and mid-2014 saw it spinning off the Nook Media division.[42]
Publishing[edit]
Barnes & Noble publishes some of the books it sells, inexpensively reprinting non-copyrighted titles or acquiring the U.S. or English language rights from another publisher. In addition, Barnes & Noble commissions reprint anthologies and omnibus editions using in-house editors.[citation needed]
One of these titles, The Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense by Suzette Haden Elgin, has sold over 250,000 copies.[28] The reissued edition of The Columbia History of the World by John Garrity, for example has sold over 1 million copies.[28]
Since then, the company has expanded its publishing operation. This expansion was aided by the company's 2001 acquisition of SparkNotes, an educational website and publishing company.[43] Further expansions of the company's publishing business include the purchase of Sterling Publishing in 2003.[28]
From around 1992 through early 2003, Barnes & Noble released a series of literary classics for adults and children under the imprint Barnes & Noble Classics. Originally available only in hardcover, most titles came in a black or cream-colored dust jacket edition. In 2003, Barnes & Noble revamped and expanded its line of literature classics, releasing books in hardcover, mass market, and trade paperback editions.[citation needed] In addition, Barnes & Noble has a second paperback series called the Barnes & Noble Library of Essential Reading.[44]
Food service[edit]




The Barnes & Noble café in Springfield, New Jersey


The first store to feature a café serving Starbucks beverages was in Springfield, New Jersey, in 1993. Since then, most stores have been amended or constructed specifically to feature a café serving Starbucks beverages, Harney & Sons or Tazo Tea, FIJI Bottled Water, bakery goods from The Cheesecake Factory, candy from Godiva Chocolatiers, sandwiches and other specialty products. Although the cafés are owned and operated by Barnes & Noble, servers follow Starbucks' standards in beverage preparation.[citation needed] The Barnes & Noble membership card is accepted to receive a discount on any café related goods.[45] Starbucks Rewards and gift cards are not accepted at Barnes & Noble cafés.
In 2004, Barnes & Noble began offering Wi-Fi in the café area of selected stores, using SBC FreedomLink (now the AT&T Wi-Fi network). All stores currently offer Wi-Fi, an effort which was completed in 2006. Since July 27, 2009, Wi-Fi is offered for free to all customers.[46]

In 2016, Barnes & Noble announced plans during an investor conference to open four concept stores featuring restaurants twice the size of their cafés that would offer better food, wine, and beer. The restaurants, which are planned to open in fiscal year 2017, are expected to drive sales growth; should sales meet expectations, additional concept stores could open and stores with enough space to accommodate the restaurant could have the restaurants incorporated there as well. Company officials planned to open the first such stores in New York, Minnesota, California, and Virginia.
The Barnes & Noble restaurants are expected to include a waitstaff and a full menu for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.[47]
Community involvement[edit]
Barnes & Noble hires community business development managers to engage in community outreach. These managers' responsibilities include organizing in-store events, such as author appearances, children's storytimes and book groups. Community business development managers also work closely with local schools and groups to promote literacy and the arts. For example, Barnes & Noble sponsors a children's summer reading program that promotes literacy and puts over 2 million books into the hands of the children each year.[48] Barnes & Noble also hosts bookfairs, which raise funds for schools and libraries and an annual holiday book drive to collect books for disadvantaged children. Barnes & Noble stores collected and donated nearly 1.5 million books to more than 650 local charities across the country that provide services to disadvantaged children during the 2014 Holiday Book Drive.[49] To promote nationwide literacy among 1st to 6th graders and encourage more reading during the summer, Barnes & Noble has implemented a summer challenge: if children read eight books and write about their reading, Barnes & Noble will give the reader a free book.[50]
Barnes & Noble Nook[edit]
See also: Barnes & Noble Nook
Barnes & Noble Nook (styled NOOK) is a suite of e-book readers developed by the company,[51] based on the Android platform. The first device was announced in the United States on October 20, 2009 and was released November 30, 2009, for $259.[52] On June 21, 2010, Barnes & Noble reduced the Nook's price to $199, as well as launched a new Wi-Fi-only model, for $149, and released a Nook colored touch screen for $249.[53]
The Nook competes with the Amazon Kindle, Kobo eReader, and other e-reader offerings and color tablets used sometimes as readers, such as Apple's iBooks for iOS devices. Various Nook models feature a 6-inch, 7-inch, or larger touchscreen.[54] Version 1.3 of the Nook introduced Wi-Fi connectivity, a web browser, a dictionary, chess, and sudoku games, and a separate, smaller color touchscreen that serves as the primary input device. The Nook also features a Read in Store capability that allows visitors to stream and read any book for up to one hour while shopping in a Barnes & Noble bookstore. According to a June 2010 CNet article, the company planned to expand this feature to include periodicals in the near future.[55] The color version of the Nook introduced a 7-inch color touchscreen and the ability to view at a portrait or landscape orientation.[56]
On April 30, 2012, Microsoft invested $300 million for a 17.6% stake in Nook, which valued the business at about $1.7 billion.[57]
In November 2012, the technology publications Mashable and Techdirt criticized the license agreement with which Barnes & Noble sells ebooks to consumers, pointing out that the rights to re-download a purchased ebook expire when the customer's credit card expires, and a valid credit card must be added to the account to restore this functionality.[58][59]
In June 2014, Barnes & Noble had previously announced that it would spin off its Nook Digital division into a separate publicly traded company,[42][60] but as of 2016, Nook remains a part of Barnes & Noble. That same month, the company announced a partnership with Samsung Electronics to make Nook tablets, as the bookseller moved forward with plans to revamp its digital business.[61] Samsung and Barnes & Noble introduced the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook 7.0 in August 2014, followed by the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook 10.1 in October 2014. In December 2014, Barnes & Noble announced that it had ended its Nook partnership with Microsoft by buying back its stake.[62] Samsung and Barnes & Noble continue to introduce new Nook tablets.[63]
In March 2016, Barnes & Noble announced it would close the Nook App Store and Nook Video and in the UK close the Nook Store on March 15.[64] It will continue to sell e-books as well as digital magazines and newspapers in the US.
College bookstores[edit]
In August 2015, Barnes & Noble announced the completion of the separation of its Retail and College businesses. Barnes & Noble Education, Inc. is now an independent public company and the parent of Barnes & Noble College, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol, "BNED". Barnes & Noble College Booksellers, previously owned by company chairman Leonard Riggio, operated the self-proclaimed "world's largest bookstore" on Fifth Avenue and 18th Street in New York City, from 1932 to 2014. This flagship store carried a large variety of textbooks, medical and legal books, and medical supplies, in addition to the various trade titles carried at the company's main stores.[65]

Barnes & Noble, Inc., is a Fortune 500 company, the bookseller with the largest number of retail outlets in the United States, and a retailer of content, digital media, and educational products. As of April 29, 2017, the company operates 633 retail stores in all 50 U.S. states.[4]
Barnes & Noble operates mainly through its Barnes & Noble Booksellers chain of bookstores. The company's headquarters are at 122 Fifth Avenue in New York City.[5]
After a series of mergers and bankruptcies in the American bookstore industry since the 1990s, Barnes & Noble stands alone as the United States' sole remaining national bookstore chain.[6][7] Previously, Barnes and Noble operated the chain of small B. Dalton Booksellers stores in malls until they announced the liquidation of the chain. The company is known for large retail outlets, many of which contain a café serving Starbucks coffee and other consumables, from cannolis to spinach and feta pretzels. Most stores sell books, magazines, newspapers, DVDs, graphic novels, gifts, games, toys, music, and Nook e‑readers and tablets.

History[edit]




Clifford Noble in 1893


1886–1929[edit]
Barnes & Noble originated in 1886 with a bookstore called John Barnes & Company, located in the Cooper Union Building in New York City.[8][9] In the fall of 1886, Gilbert Clifford Noble, a then-recent Harvard graduate from Westfield, Massachusetts, was hired to work there as a clerk.[10] In 1894, Noble was made a partner, and the name of the shop was changed to Hinds & Noble.[11] In 1901, Hinds & Noble moved to 31–35 W. 15th Street.[12]
In 1917, Noble bought out Hinds and entered into a partnership with William Barnes, son of his old friend Charles; the name of the store was changed to Barnes & Noble.[13][14] Charles Barnes had opened a book-printing business in Wheaton, Illinois in 1873; William Barnes divested himself of his ownership interest in his father's firm just before his partnership with Noble and it would go on to become Follett Corporation. Although the flagship store once featured the motto "founded in 1873," the C. M. Barnes-Wilcox Company never had any connection to Barnes & Noble other than the fact that both were partly owned (at different times) by William Barnes.
1930–1969[edit]
In 1930, Noble sold his share of the company to William Barnes' son John Wilcox Barnes.[15] Noble died on June 6, 1936, at the age of 72.[16]




Barnes & Noble's former flagship store at 105 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, New York that operated from 1932 to 2014.


In 1932, at the height of the Great Depression, the bookstore moved to a flagship location on 18th Street and Fifth Avenue,[17] which served as so until its closure in 2014. The Noble family retained ownership of an associated publishing business, and Barnes & Noble opened a new publishing division in 1931.[15] In 1940, the store was one of the first businesses to feature Muzak; it underwent a major renovation the following year.[18] That decade the company opened stores in Brooklyn and Chicago.[19] William Barnes died in 1945, at the age of 78, and his son John Wilcox Barnes assumed full control.[19] The company underwent a significant expansion between the 1950s and the 1960s, opening an additional retail store on 23rd Street in Manhattan, as well as shops near the City University of New York, Harvard, and other Northeast college campuses.[20] John Barnes died in 1964, and the company was sold to the conglomerate Amtel two years later.[21]

1970s[edit]
The business was purchased in 1971, by Leonard Riggio for $1.2 million.[20] By then, it had been badly mismanaged over the prior two years and consisted only of "a significantly reduced wholesale operation and a single retail location—the store at 105 Fifth Avenue."[20] In 1974, Barnes & Noble became the first bookstore chain to advertise on television and a year later, the company became the first bookseller in America to discount books, by selling The New York Times best-selling titles at 40% off the publishers' list price.[22] Between the 1970s and the 1980s, Barnes & Noble opened smaller discount stores, which eventually phased out in favor of larger stores. They also began to publish their own books to be sold to mail-order customers. These titles were primarily affordable reissues of out-of-print titles and selling them through mail-order catalogs allowed Barnes & Noble to reach new customers nationwide.[22]
In November 1974, in response to a question from a member of the studio audience, the British twin brothers Norris McWhirter and Ross McWhirter, who were editors of the British-produced Guinness Book of Records, claimed on the BBC One television programme Record Breakers that the Fifth Avenue store of Barnes and Noble had overtaken that of London's Foyles bookshop to become the world's biggest bookstore.[23]
1980s–1990s[edit]
Barnes & Noble continued to expand throughout the 1980s, and it purchased the primarily shopping mall-based B. Dalton chain from Dayton Hudson in 1986, for an estimated $275 million to $300 million.[24] The last B. Dalton stores were scheduled to close in January 2010.[25] In 1989, Barnes and Noble had purchased the 22-store chain Bookstop. Solveig Robinson, author of The Book in Society: An Introduction to Print Culture, wrote that the purchase "gave [Barnes and Noble] the necessary know-how and infrastructure to create what, in 1992, became the definitive bookselling superstore."[26] The acquisition of the 797 B. Dalton bookstores turned the company into a nationwide retailer, and by the end of fiscal year 1999, the second-largest online bookseller in the United States.[25] B&N's critics claim that it has contributed to the decline of local and independent booksellers.[27]
Before Barnes & Noble created its official website, it sold books directly to customers through mail-order catalogs. It first began selling books online through an early videotex service called "Trintex," a joint venture between Sears and IBM, but the company's website was not launched until May 1997.[28] According to B&N's website, it now carries over 2 million titles.[29]
2000s[edit]
In 2002, Leonard Riggio's brother Stephen Riggio was named Barnes & Noble's CEO, a position he held until 2010.[30] The Barnes & Noble Review, an online literary site, was launched in October 2007. It featured book reviews, columns, and interview from critics and authors such as Michael Dirda, John Freeman, A.C. Grayling, Ezra Klein, Paul LaFarge, Mark Sarvas, Dava Sobel, Neal Stephenson, Stephen King, and Greil Marcus.[31] Music critic Robert Christgau has also written essays for the site.[32]
Video games and related items were sold in the company's GameStop retail outlets from 1999 until late 2004, when the division was spun off by distributing its 59% stake in GameStop to stakeholders of Barnes & Noble's, making it an independent company.[33]
2010s[edit]
Website president William Lynch was named CEO in 2010. He is credited with helping launch the company's electronic book store and overseeing the introduction of its electronic book reader, the Nook. Many observers saw his appointment as underscoring the importance of digital books to Barnes & Noble's future. Steve Riggio stayed on as vice chairman.[34] Lynch resigned in mid-2013,[35] and he was replaced by Chief Financial Officer Michael Huseby early the next year.[36] Following the spinoff of Barnes and Noble Education, Huseby departed to head the new firm; his place was filled in mid-2015 by Ronald Boire,[37][38] who departed one year later.[39]
After the bankruptcy and closure of its chief competitor, Borders Group, in 2011,[40] Barnes & Noble became the last remaining national bookstore chain in America.[6][7] This followed a series of mergers and bankruptcies in the American bookstore industry since the 1990s, which also saw the demise of Waldenbooks, Barnes & Noble's own subsidiary B. Dalton, and Crown Books, among others. Barnes & Noble's largest physical bookstore rival is now Books-A-Million, which does not operate in the Western US. Barnes & Noble also faces competition from general retailers, especially from Amazon.com, and from regional and independent booksellers.
At the same time, Barnes & Noble has reduced its overall presence; it closed its original flagship store in early 2014,[41] and mid-2014 saw it spinning off the Nook Media division.[42]
Publishing[edit]
Barnes & Noble publishes some of the books it sells, inexpensively reprinting non-copyrighted titles or acquiring the U.S. or English language rights from another publisher. In addition, Barnes & Noble commissions reprint anthologies and omnibus editions using in-house editors.[citation needed]
One of these titles, The Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense by Suzette Haden Elgin, has sold over 250,000 copies.[28] The reissued edition of The Columbia History of the World by John Garrity, for example has sold over 1 million copies.[28]
Since then, the company has expanded its publishing operation. This expansion was aided by the company's 2001 acquisition of SparkNotes, an educational website and publishing company.[43] Further expansions of the company's publishing business include the purchase of Sterling Publishing in 2003.[28]
From around 1992 through early 2003, Barnes & Noble released a series of literary classics for adults and children under the imprint Barnes & Noble Classics. Originally available only in hardcover, most titles came in a black or cream-colored dust jacket edition. In 2003, Barnes & Noble revamped and expanded its line of literature classics, releasing books in hardcover, mass market, and trade paperback editions.[citation needed] In addition, Barnes & Noble has a second paperback series called the Barnes & Noble Library of Essential Reading.[44]
Food service[edit]




The Barnes & Noble café in Springfield, New Jersey


The first store to feature a café serving Starbucks beverages was in Springfield, New Jersey, in 1993. Since then, most stores have been amended or constructed specifically to feature a café serving Starbucks beverages, Harney & Sons or Tazo Tea, FIJI Bottled Water, bakery goods from The Cheesecake Factory, candy from Godiva Chocolatiers, sandwiches and other specialty products. Although the cafés are owned and operated by Barnes & Noble, servers follow Starbucks' standards in beverage preparation.[citation needed] The Barnes & Noble membership card is accepted to receive a discount on any café related goods.[45] Starbucks Rewards and gift cards are not accepted at Barnes & Noble cafés.
In 2004, Barnes & Noble began offering Wi-Fi in the café area of selected stores, using SBC FreedomLink (now the AT&T Wi-Fi network). All stores currently offer Wi-Fi, an effort which was completed in 2006. Since July 27, 2009, Wi-Fi is offered for free to all customers.[46]

In 2016, Barnes & Noble announced plans during an investor conference to open four concept stores featuring restaurants twice the size of their cafés that would offer better food, wine, and beer. The restaurants, which are planned to open in fiscal year 2017, are expected to drive sales growth; should sales meet expectations, additional concept stores could open and stores with enough space to accommodate the restaurant could have the restaurants incorporated there as well. Company officials planned to open the first such stores in New York, Minnesota, California, and Virginia.
The Barnes & Noble restaurants are expected to include a waitstaff and a full menu for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.[47]
Community involvement[edit]
Barnes & Noble hires community business development managers to engage in community outreach. These managers' responsibilities include organizing in-store events, such as author appearances, children's storytimes and book groups. Community business development managers also work closely with local schools and groups to promote literacy and the arts. For example, Barnes & Noble sponsors a children's summer reading program that promotes literacy and puts over 2 million books into the hands of the children each year.[48] Barnes & Noble also hosts bookfairs, which raise funds for schools and libraries and an annual holiday book drive to collect books for disadvantaged children. Barnes & Noble stores collected and donated nearly 1.5 million books to more than 650 local charities across the country that provide services to disadvantaged children during the 2014 Holiday Book Drive.[49] To promote nationwide literacy among 1st to 6th graders and encourage more reading during the summer, Barnes & Noble has implemented a summer challenge: if children read eight books and write about their reading, Barnes & Noble will give the reader a free book.[50]
Barnes & Noble Nook[edit]
See also: Barnes & Noble Nook
Barnes & Noble Nook (styled NOOK) is a suite of e-book readers developed by the company,[51] based on the Android platform. The first device was announced in the United States on October 20, 2009 and was released November 30, 2009, for $259.[52] On June 21, 2010, Barnes & Noble reduced the Nook's price to $199, as well as launched a new Wi-Fi-only model, for $149, and released a Nook colored touch screen for $249.[53]
The Nook competes with the Amazon Kindle, Kobo eReader, and other e-reader offerings and color tablets used sometimes as readers, such as Apple's iBooks for iOS devices. Various Nook models feature a 6-inch, 7-inch, or larger touchscreen.[54] Version 1.3 of the Nook introduced Wi-Fi connectivity, a web browser, a dictionary, chess, and sudoku games, and a separate, smaller color touchscreen that serves as the primary input device. The Nook also features a Read in Store capability that allows visitors to stream and read any book for up to one hour while shopping in a Barnes & Noble bookstore. According to a June 2010 CNet article, the company planned to expand this feature to include periodicals in the near future.[55] The color version of the Nook introduced a 7-inch color touchscreen and the ability to view at a portrait or landscape orientation.[56]
On April 30, 2012, Microsoft invested $300 million for a 17.6% stake in Nook, which valued the business at about $1.7 billion.[57]
In November 2012, the technology publications Mashable and Techdirt criticized the license agreement with which Barnes & Noble sells ebooks to consumers, pointing out that the rights to re-download a purchased ebook expire when the customer's credit card expires, and a valid credit card must be added to the account to restore this functionality.[58][59]
In June 2014, Barnes & Noble had previously announced that it would spin off its Nook Digital division into a separate publicly traded company,[42][60] but as of 2016, Nook remains a part of Barnes & Noble. That same month, the company announced a partnership with Samsung Electronics to make Nook tablets, as the bookseller moved forward with plans to revamp its digital business.[61] Samsung and Barnes & Noble introduced the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook 7.0 in August 2014, followed by the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook 10.1 in October 2014. In December 2014, Barnes & Noble announced that it had ended its Nook partnership with Microsoft by buying back its stake.[62] Samsung and Barnes & Noble continue to introduce new Nook tablets.[63]
In March 2016, Barnes & Noble announced it would close the Nook App Store and Nook Video and in the UK close the Nook Store on March 15.[64] It will continue to sell e-books as well as digital magazines and newspapers in the US.
College bookstores[edit]
In August 2015, Barnes & Noble announced the completion of the separation of its Retail and College businesses. Barnes & Noble Education, Inc. is now an independent public company and the parent of Barnes & Noble College, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol, "BNED". Barnes & Noble College Booksellers, previously owned by company chairman Leonard Riggio, operated the self-proclaimed "world's largest bookstore" on Fifth Avenue and 18th Street in New York City, from 1932 to 2014. This flagship store carried a large variety of textbooks, medical and legal books, and medical supplies, in addition to the various trade titles carried at the company's main stores.[65]

Barnes & Noble, Inc., is a Fortune 500 company, the bookseller with the largest number of retail outlets in the United States, and a retailer of content, digital media, and educational products. As of April 29, 2017, the company operates 633 retail stores in all 50 U.S. states.[4]
Barnes & Noble operates mainly through its Barnes & Noble Booksellers chain of bookstores. The company's headquarters are at 122 Fifth Avenue in New York City.[5]
After a series of mergers and bankruptcies in the American bookstore industry since the 1990s, Barnes & Noble stands alone as the United States' sole remaining national bookstore chain.[6][7] Previously, Barnes and Noble operated the chain of small B. Dalton Booksellers stores in malls until they announced the liquidation of the chain. The company is known for large retail outlets, many of which contain a café serving Starbucks coffee and other consumables, from cannolis to spinach and feta pretzels. Most stores sell books, magazines, newspapers, DVDs, graphic novels, gifts, games, toys, music, and Nook e‑readers and tablets.

History[edit]




Clifford Noble in 1893


1886–1929[edit]
Barnes & Noble originated in 1886 with a bookstore called John Barnes & Company, located in the Cooper Union Building in New York City.[8][9] In the fall of 1886, Gilbert Clifford Noble, a then-recent Harvard graduate from Westfield, Massachusetts, was hired to work there as a clerk.[10] In 1894, Noble was made a partner, and the name of the shop was changed to Hinds & Noble.[11] In 1901, Hinds & Noble moved to 31–35 W. 15th Street.[12]
In 1917, Noble bought out Hinds and entered into a partnership with William Barnes, son of his old friend Charles; the name of the store was changed to Barnes & Noble.[13][14] Charles Barnes had opened a book-printing business in Wheaton, Illinois in 1873; William Barnes divested himself of his ownership interest in his father's firm just before his partnership with Noble and it would go on to become Follett Corporation. Although the flagship store once featured the motto "founded in 1873," the C. M. Barnes-Wilcox Company never had any connection to Barnes & Noble other than the fact that both were partly owned (at different times) by William Barnes.
1930–1969[edit]
In 1930, Noble sold his share of the company to William Barnes' son John Wilcox Barnes.[15] Noble died on June 6, 1936, at the age of 72.[16]

In 1932, at the height of the Great Depression, the bookstore moved to a flagship location on 18th Street and Fifth Avenue,[17] which served as so until its closure in 2014. The Noble family retained ownership of an associated publishing business, and Barnes & Noble opened a new publishing division in 1931.[15] In 1940, the store was one of the first businesses to feature Muzak; it underwent a major renovation the following year.[18] That decade the company opened stores in Brooklyn and Chicago.[19] William Barnes died in 1945, at the age of 78, and his son John Wilcox Barnes assumed full control.[19] The company underwent a significant expansion between the 1950s and the 1960s, opening an additional retail store on 23rd Street in Manhattan, as well as shops near the City University of New York, Harvard, and other Northeast college campuses.[20] John Barnes died in 1964, and the company was sold to the conglomerate Amtel two years later.[21]

1970s[edit]
The business was purchased in 1971, by Leonard Riggio for $1.2 million.[20] By then, it had been badly mismanaged over the prior two years and consisted only of "a significantly reduced wholesale operation and a single retail location—the store at 105 Fifth Avenue."[20] In 1974, Barnes & Noble became the first bookstore chain to advertise on television and a year later, the company became the first bookseller in America to discount books, by selling The New York Times best-selling titles at 40% off the publishers' list price.[22] Between the 1970s and the 1980s, Barnes & Noble opened smaller discount stores, which eventually phased out in favor of larger stores. They also began to publish their own books to be sold to mail-order customers. These titles were primarily affordable reissues of out-of-print titles and selling them through mail-order catalogs allowed Barnes & Noble to reach new customers nationwide.[22]
In November 1974, in response to a question from a member of the studio audience, the British twin brothers Norris McWhirter and Ross McWhirter, who were editors of the British-produced Guinness Book of Records, claimed on the BBC One television programme Record Breakers that the Fifth Avenue store of Barnes and Noble had overtaken that of London's Foyles bookshop to become the world's biggest bookstore.[23]
1980s–1990s[edit]
Barnes & Noble continued to expand throughout the 1980s, and it purchased the primarily shopping mall-based B. Dalton chain from Dayton Hudson in 1986, for an estimated $275 million to $300 million.[24] The last B. Dalton stores were scheduled to close in January 2010.[25] In 1989, Barnes and Noble had purchased the 22-store chain Bookstop. Solveig Robinson, author of The Book in Society: An Introduction to Print Culture, wrote that the purchase "gave [Barnes and Noble] the necessary know-how and infrastructure to create what, in 1992, became the definitive bookselling superstore."[26] The acquisition of the 797 B. Dalton bookstores turned the company into a nationwide retailer, and by the end of fiscal year 1999, the second-largest online bookseller in the United States.[25] B&N's critics claim that it has contributed to the decline of local and independent booksellers.[27]
Before Barnes & Noble created its official website, it sold books directly to customers through mail-order catalogs. It first began selling books online through an early videotex service called "Trintex," a joint venture between Sears and IBM, but the company's website was not launched until May 1997.[28] According to B&N's website, it now carries over 2 million titles.[29]
2000s[edit]
In 2002, Leonard Riggio's brother Stephen Riggio was named Barnes & Noble's CEO, a position he held until 2010.[30] The Barnes & Noble Review, an online literary site, was launched in October 2007. It featured book reviews, columns, and interview from critics and authors such as Michael Dirda, John Freeman, A.C. Grayling, Ezra Klein, Paul LaFarge, Mark Sarvas, Dava Sobel, Neal Stephenson, Stephen King, and Greil Marcus.[31] Music critic Robert Christgau has also written essays for the site.[32]
Video games and related items were sold in the company's GameStop retail outlets from 1999 until late 2004, when the division was spun off by distributing its 59% stake in GameStop to stakeholders of Barnes & Noble's, making it an independent company.[33]
2010s[edit]
Website president William Lynch was named CEO in 2010. He is credited with helping launch the company's electronic book store and overseeing the introduction of its electronic book reader, the Nook. Many observers saw his appointment as underscoring the importance of digital books to Barnes & Noble's future. Steve Riggio stayed on as vice chairman.[34] Lynch resigned in mid-2013,[35] and he was replaced by Chief Financial Officer Michael Huseby early the next year.[36] Following the spinoff of Barnes and Noble Education, Huseby departed to head the new firm; his place was filled in mid-2015 by Ronald Boire,[37][38] who departed one year later.[39]
After the bankruptcy and closure of its chief competitor, Borders Group, in 2011,[40] Barnes & Noble became the last remaining national bookstore chain in America.[6][7] This followed a series of mergers and bankruptcies in the American bookstore industry since the 1990s, which also saw the demise of Waldenbooks, Barnes & Noble's own subsidiary B. Dalton, and Crown Books, among others. Barnes & Noble's largest physical bookstore rival is now Books-A-Million, which does not operate in the Western US. Barnes & Noble also faces competition from general retailers, especially from Amazon.com, and from regional and independent booksellers.
At the same time, Barnes & Noble has reduced its overall presence; it closed its original flagship store in early 2014,[41] and mid-2014 saw it spinning off the Nook Media division.[42]
Publishing[edit]
Barnes & Noble publishes some of the books it sells, inexpensively reprinting non-copyrighted titles or acquiring the U.S. or English language rights from another publisher. In addition, Barnes & Noble commissions reprint anthologies and omnibus editions using in-house editors.[citation needed]
One of these titles, The Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense by Suzette Haden Elgin, has sold over 250,000 copies.[28] The reissued edition of The Columbia History of the World by John Garrity, for example has sold over 1 million copies.[28]
Since then, the company has expanded its publishing operation. This expansion was aided by the company's 2001 acquisition of SparkNotes, an educational website and publishing company.[43] Further expansions of the company's publishing business include the purchase of Sterling Publishing in 2003.[28]
From around 1992 through early 2003, Barnes & Noble released a series of literary classics for adults and children under the imprint Barnes & Noble Classics. Originally available only in hardcover, most titles came in a black or cream-colored dust jacket edition. In 2003, Barnes & Noble revamped and expanded its line of literature classics, releasing books in hardcover, mass market, and trade paperback editions.[citation needed] In addition, Barnes & Noble has a second paperback series called the Barnes & Noble Library of Essential Reading.[44]
Food service[edit]




The Barnes & Noble café in Springfield, New Jersey


The first store to feature a café serving Starbucks beverages was in Springfield, New Jersey, in 1993. Since then, most stores have been amended or constructed specifically to feature a café serving Starbucks beverages, Harney & Sons or Tazo Tea, FIJI Bottled Water, bakery goods from The Cheesecake Factory, candy from Godiva Chocolatiers, sandwiches and other specialty products. Although the cafés are owned and operated by Barnes & Noble, servers follow Starbucks' standards in beverage preparation.[citation needed] The Barnes & Noble membership card is accepted to receive a discount on any café related goods.[45] Starbucks Rewards and gift cards are not accepted at Barnes & Noble cafés.
In 2004, Barnes & Noble began offering Wi-Fi in the café area of selected stores, using SBC FreedomLink (now the AT&T Wi-Fi network). All stores currently offer Wi-Fi, an effort which was completed in 2006. Since July 27, 2009, Wi-Fi is offered for free to all customers.[46]

In 2016, Barnes & Noble announced plans during an investor conference to open four concept stores featuring restaurants twice the size of their cafés that would offer better food, wine, and beer. The restaurants, which are planned to open in fiscal year 2017, are expected to drive sales growth; should sales meet expectations, additional concept stores could open and stores with enough space to accommodate the restaurant could have the restaurants incorporated there as well. Company officials planned to open the first such stores in New York, Minnesota, California, and Virginia.
The Barnes & Noble restaurants are expected to include a waitstaff and a full menu for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.[47]
Community involvement[edit]
Barnes & Noble hires community business development managers to engage in community outreach. These managers' responsibilities include organizing in-store events, such as author appearances, children's storytimes and book groups. Community business development managers also work closely with local schools and groups to promote literacy and the arts. For example, Barnes & Noble sponsors a children's summer reading program that promotes literacy and puts over 2 million books into the hands of the children each year.[48] Barnes & Noble also hosts bookfairs, which raise funds for schools and libraries and an annual holiday book drive to collect books for disadvantaged children. Barnes & Noble stores collected and donated nearly 1.5 million books to more than 650 local charities across the country that provide services to disadvantaged children during the 2014 Holiday Book Drive.[49] To promote nationwide literacy among 1st to 6th graders and encourage more reading during the summer, Barnes & Noble has implemented a summer challenge: if children read eight books and write about their reading, Barnes & Noble will give the reader a free book.[50]
Barnes & Noble Nook[edit]
See also: Barnes & Noble Nook
Barnes & Noble Nook (styled NOOK) is a suite of e-book readers developed by the company,[51] based on the Android platform. The first device was announced in the United States on October 20, 2009 and was released November 30, 2009, for $259.[52] On June 21, 2010, Barnes & Noble reduced the Nook's price to $199, as well as launched a new Wi-Fi-only model, for $149, and released a Nook colored touch screen for $249.[53]
The Nook competes with the Amazon Kindle, Kobo eReader, and other e-reader offerings and color tablets used sometimes as readers, such as Apple's iBooks for iOS devices. Various Nook models feature a 6-inch, 7-inch, or larger touchscreen.[54] Version 1.3 of the Nook introduced Wi-Fi connectivity, a web browser, a dictionary, chess, and sudoku games, and a separate, smaller color touchscreen that serves as the primary input device. The Nook also features a Read in Store capability that allows visitors to stream and read any book for up to one hour while shopping in a Barnes & Noble bookstore. According to a June 2010 CNet article, the company planned to expand this feature to include periodicals in the near future.[55] The color version of the Nook introduced a 7-inch color touchscreen and the ability to view at a portrait or landscape orientation.[56]
On April 30, 2012, Microsoft invested $300 million for a 17.6% stake in Nook, which valued the business at about $1.7 billion.[57]
In November 2012, the technology publications Mashable and Techdirt criticized the license agreement with which Barnes & Noble sells ebooks to consumers, pointing out that the rights to re-download a purchased ebook expire when the customer's credit card expires, and a valid credit card must be added to the account to restore this functionality.[58][59]
In June 2014, Barnes & Noble had previously announced that it would spin off its Nook Digital division into a separate publicly traded company,[42][60] but as of 2016, Nook remains a part of Barnes & Noble. That same month, the company announced a partnership with Samsung Electronics to make Nook tablets, as the bookseller moved forward with plans to revamp its digital business.[61] Samsung and Barnes & Noble introduced the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook 7.0 in August 2014, followed by the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook 10.1 in October 2014. In December 2014, Barnes & Noble announced that it had ended its Nook partnership with Microsoft by buying back its stake.[62] Samsung and Barnes & Noble continue to introduce new Nook tablets.[63]
In March 2016, Barnes & Noble announced it would close the Nook App Store and Nook Video and in the UK close the Nook Store on March 15.[64] It will continue to sell e-books as well as digital magazines and newspapers in the US.
College bookstores[edit]
In August 2015, Barnes & Noble announced the completion of the separation of its Retail and College businesses. Barnes & Noble Education, Inc. is now an independent public company and the parent of Barnes & Noble College, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol, "BNED". Barnes & Noble College Booksellers, previously owned by company chairman Leonard Riggio, operated the self-proclaimed "world's largest bookstore" on Fifth Avenue and 18th Street in New York City, from 1932 to 2014. This flagship store carried a large variety of textbooks, medical and legal books, and medical supplies, in addition to the various trade titles carried at the company's main stores.[65]

Vendor and Product Compliance Requirements





Product quality and safety has always been a priority for Barnes & Noble, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (“Barnes & Noble” or “B&N”) and, as new and complex safety standards emerge, we count on our suppliers and manufacturers to provide products that meet or exceed all applicable safety requirements.
Many of the products produced and sold by Barnes & Noble are regulated by federal, state and local laws and other industry guidelines and standards. Regulations and standards change over time and as such, Vendors must stay apprised of products they supply. Barnes & Noble requires all suppliers to stand fully behind their products. We depend on you to maintain knowledge of and comply with all safety standards for your products.
To that extent, we have developed a Vendor and Product Compliance program to ensure that we continue to provide high quality, safe products to our customers. All costs associated with the removal of Vendor’s products from Barnes & Noble stores or distribution centers in violation of these requirements or any other product compliance remediation, will be at the cost of Vendor. Barnes & Noble reserves the right to assess doing business with any supplier who does not comply with these requirements.

 Vendor Compliance Certification (VCC)


In connection with the Barnes & Noble Compliance Program, all new Vendors who supply or manufacturer product for Barnes & Noble will be required to complete and sign our Vendor Compliance Certification form as part of the new Vendor on-boarding package. Existing Vendors are also required to have submitted a Vendor Compliance Certification form. By signing the Vendor Compliance Certification form and/or by accepting and fulfilling any order for products, you represent and warrant that you, your contractors, and subcontractors comply with all requirements in the Barnes & Noble Vendor Code of Conduct and the Vendor Compliance Certification form, and that all products you supply to or manufacture for Barnes & Noble meet and will continue to meet any applicable laws, rules and regulations.

View the Vendor Compliance Certification form
View the Barnes & Noble Vendor Code of Conduct
 




Children’s Products


The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA), along with other directives and amendments, enacted new requirements related to lead paint, lead content, phthalates and tracking labels for products designed or intended primarily for children 12 years old or younger. (For more details on the Consumer Product Safety Commission, visit www.cpsc.gov/en.)
For all Children’s Products (which are defined by the CPSIA as products intended primarily for children 12 years old or younger), Vendor shall ensure that:

All children’s products will comply with all applicable safety testing requirements including, but not limited to, American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) requirements for toy safety and CPSIA requirements for lead content, lead paint and phthalate requirements.
All children’s products will contain all requisite labeling and safety warnings, including, but not limited to, requisite CPSIA tracking information, which will be permanently affixed to the product.
 




Toxic Chemical Laws and Regulations


All products produced for and/or supplied to Barnes & Noble must comply with federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations regarding toxicity in products.  These laws are often known as “Green Chemistry Laws,” and typically pertain to children’s products. Click here for a listing of websites about these laws which you may find helpful.  This is not intended to be an exhaustive list, and all Barnes & Noble suppliers and manufacturers are expected to remain abreast of existing and newly adopted safety standards and legal obligations applicable to their products. 
Some of these laws require manufacturers and certain retailers, to disclose the presence of certain listed chemicals above pre-defined limits in their products.  Some jurisdictions outright prohibit the inclusion of listed chemicals in children’s products sold there.  For jurisdictions where a sales ban is required for the presence of certain chemicals, Vendors are required to meet those conditions and limit or eliminate the presence of those chemicals in their products as required by law.  For jurisdictions where sales of the product obligates the manufacturer or retailer to disclose or report certain information regarding such products (e.g., State of Washington), Vendors are responsible for completing the reporting required by Barnes & Noble and paying any and all associated fees.  Vendors of in-scope products may be required to make a reasonable, good-faith effort to provide declarations about the content of product supplied in the form requested by Barnes & Noble. 
In addition, there are laws prohibiting or limiting the use of chlorinated flame retardants that contain TCEP and TDCPP (TRIS) in certain states (e.g., Vermont, New York and Maryland) which affect various product scopes including toys and childcare articles.
Under the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, California Health & Safety Code §§ 25249.5 et seq. (Prop 65), listed chemicals are known to the state of California to cause cancer or birth defects or other reproductive harm.  These regulations are not limited to children’s products, and apply to all products sold in the State of California.  
Barnes & Noble expects all Vendors to be familiar with these laws, to proactively test their products (contact Compliance@bn.com for approved testing labs) and advise Barnes & Noble immediately if any product supplied contains any toxic chemicals. 




Electronics Products


For all Electronics Products, Vendor shall ensure that:

If required, Vendor has registered its products as covered electronic devices (each a CED) in all states that have enacted e-Cycling laws and will renew and maintain such registrations so long as Vendor supplies such CEDs to B&N for resale.
Vendor will provide to B&N adequate quantities of any materials or information required by law for retailers to distribute or share with consumers in connection with a sale of Vendor’s CEDs in any and all appropriate forms of media, including, but not limited to, Internet website links, notices or inserts affixed to or included with the product, and printed posters, flyers or brochures, as required.
If Vendor’s product is defined as a CED by the Public Resources Code of California Section 42463, Vendor will notify B&N in writing, so long as B&N will be carrying its product by April 1 of each year, and Vendor shall also submit a copy of such notification letter to the California State Board of Equalization. Such notification shall include the brand and type of CED and applicable fee category.
Immediate notification will be provided to B&N if Vendor’s CED registration status changes in any state.
 




Conflict Minerals


Barnes & Noble supports responsible sourcing practices, which includes compliance with the Conflict Minerals provision (Section 1502) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank). Vendors who manufacture B&N proprietary product are required to design and implement reasonable processes to ensure transparency related to the content and materials comprising all products supplied to Barnes & Noble, which may include gold, tantalum, tin, and tungsten and the ores from which they are derived. These Vendors are required to assist Barnes & Noble with its conflict minerals compliance by making a reasonable, good-faith effort to answer any questions and to provide all declarations in the form requested by Barnes & Noble. Upon request, these Vendors are required to communicate, to the best of their knowledge, the country of origin and content of the product(s) supplied to Barnes & Noble and to determine whether these products contain “conflict minerals” as defined by Dodd-Frank.
Barnes & Noble has established an emailbox to facilitate communication with interested parties. Any questions or concerns relating to Barnes & Noble’s Conflict Minerals efforts should be directed to this emailbox: conflictminerals@bn.com. In addition, please refer to FAQs on Conflict Minerals located within the Product Compliance Frequently Asked Questions.

Barnes & Noble, Inc., is a Fortune 500 company, the bookseller with the largest number of retail outlets in the United States, and a retailer of content, digital media, and educational products. As of April 29, 2017, the company operates 633 retail stores in all 50 U.S. states.[4]
Barnes & Noble operates mainly through its Barnes & Noble Booksellers chain of bookstores. The company's headquarters are at 122 Fifth Avenue in New York City.[5]
After a series of mergers and bankruptcies in the American bookstore industry since the 1990s, Barnes & Noble stands alone as the United States' sole remaining national bookstore chain.[6][7] Previously, Barnes and Noble operated the chain of small B. Dalton Booksellers stores in malls until they announced the liquidation of the chain. The company is known for large retail outlets, many of which contain a café serving Starbucks coffee and other consumables, from cannolis to spinach and feta pretzels. Most stores sell books, magazines, newspapers, DVDs, graphic novels, gifts, games, toys, music, and Nook e‑readers and tablets.

History[edit]




Clifford Noble in 1893


1886–1929[edit]
Barnes & Noble originated in 1886 with a bookstore called John Barnes & Company, located in the Cooper Union Building in New York City.[8][9] In the fall of 1886, Gilbert Clifford Noble, a then-recent Harvard graduate from Westfield, Massachusetts, was hired to work there as a clerk.[10] In 1894, Noble was made a partner, and the name of the shop was changed to Hinds & Noble.[11] In 1901, Hinds & Noble moved to 31–35 W. 15th Street.[12]
In 1917, Noble bought out Hinds and entered into a partnership with William Barnes, son of his old friend Charles; the name of the store was changed to Barnes & Noble.[13][14] Charles Barnes had opened a book-printing business in Wheaton, Illinois in 1873; William Barnes divested himself of his ownership interest in his father's firm just before his partnership with Noble and it would go on to become Follett Corporation. Although the flagship store once featured the motto "founded in 1873," the C. M. Barnes-Wilcox Company never had any connection to Barnes & Noble other than the fact that both were partly owned (at different times) by William Barnes.
1930–1969[edit]
In 1930, Noble sold his share of the company to William Barnes' son John Wilcox Barnes.[15] Noble died on June 6, 1936, at the age of 72.[16]




Barnes & Noble's former flagship store at 105 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, New York that operated from 1932 to 2014.


In 1932, at the height of the Great Depression, the bookstore moved to a flagship location on 18th Street and Fifth Avenue,[17] which served as so until its closure in 2014. The Noble family retained ownership of an associated publishing business, and Barnes & Noble opened a new publishing division in 1931.[15] In 1940, the store was one of the first businesses to feature Muzak; it underwent a major renovation the following year.[18] That decade the company opened stores in Brooklyn and Chicago.[19] William Barnes died in 1945, at the age of 78, and his son John Wilcox Barnes assumed full control.[19] The company underwent a significant expansion between the 1950s and the 1960s, opening an additional retail store on 23rd Street in Manhattan, as well as shops near the City University of New York, Harvard, and other Northeast college campuses.[20] John Barnes died in 1964, and the company was sold to the conglomerate Amtel two years later.[21]

1970s[edit]
The business was purchased in 1971, by Leonard Riggio for $1.2 million.[20] By then, it had been badly mismanaged over the prior two years and consisted only of "a significantly reduced wholesale operation and a single retail location—the store at 105 Fifth Avenue."[20] In 1974, Barnes & Noble became the first bookstore chain to advertise on television and a year later, the company became the first bookseller in America to discount books, by selling The New York Times best-selling titles at 40% off the publishers' list price.[22] Between the 1970s and the 1980s, Barnes & Noble opened smaller discount stores, which eventually phased out in favor of larger stores. They also began to publish their own books to be sold to mail-order customers. These titles were primarily affordable reissues of out-of-print titles and selling them through mail-order catalogs allowed Barnes & Noble to reach new customers nationwide.[22]
In November 1974, in response to a question from a member of the studio audience, the British twin brothers Norris McWhirter and Ross McWhirter, who were editors of the British-produced Guinness Book of Records, claimed on the BBC One television programme Record Breakers that the Fifth Avenue store of Barnes and Noble had overtaken that of London's Foyles bookshop to become the world's biggest bookstore.[23]
1980s–1990s[edit]
Barnes & Noble continued to expand throughout the 1980s, and it purchased the primarily shopping mall-based B. Dalton chain from Dayton Hudson in 1986, for an estimated $275 million to $300 million.[24] The last B. Dalton stores were scheduled to close in January 2010.[25] In 1989, Barnes and Noble had purchased the 22-store chain Bookstop. Solveig Robinson, author of The Book in Society: An Introduction to Print Culture, wrote that the purchase "gave [Barnes and Noble] the necessary know-how and infrastructure to create what, in 1992, became the definitive bookselling superstore."[26] The acquisition of the 797 B. Dalton bookstores turned the company into a nationwide retailer, and by the end of fiscal year 1999, the second-largest online bookseller in the United States.[25] B&N's critics claim that it has contributed to the decline of local and independent booksellers.[27]
Before Barnes & Noble created its official website, it sold books directly to customers through mail-order catalogs. It first began selling books online through an early videotex service called "Trintex," a joint venture between Sears and IBM, but the company's website was not launched until May 1997.[28] According to B&N's website, it now carries over 2 million titles.[29]
2000s[edit]
In 2002, Leonard Riggio's brother Stephen Riggio was named Barnes & Noble's CEO, a position he held until 2010.[30] The Barnes & Noble Review, an online literary site, was launched in October 2007. It featured book reviews, columns, and interview from critics and authors such as Michael Dirda, John Freeman, A.C. Grayling, Ezra Klein, Paul LaFarge, Mark Sarvas, Dava Sobel, Neal Stephenson, Stephen King, and Greil Marcus.[31] Music critic Robert Christgau has also written essays for the site.[32]
Video games and related items were sold in the company's GameStop retail outlets from 1999 until late 2004, when the division was spun off by distributing its 59% stake in GameStop to stakeholders of Barnes & Noble's, making it an independent company.[33]
2010s[edit]
Website president William Lynch was named CEO in 2010. He is credited with helping launch the company's electronic book store and overseeing the introduction of its electronic book reader, the Nook. Many observers saw his appointment as underscoring the importance of digital books to Barnes & Noble's future. Steve Riggio stayed on as vice chairman.[34] Lynch resigned in mid-2013,[35] and he was replaced by Chief Financial Officer Michael Huseby early the next year.[36] Following the spinoff of Barnes and Noble Education, Huseby departed to head the new firm; his place was filled in mid-2015 by Ronald Boire,[37][38] who departed one year later.[39]
After the bankruptcy and closure of its chief competitor, Borders Group, in 2011,[40] Barnes & Noble became the last remaining national bookstore chain in America.[6][7] This followed a series of mergers and bankruptcies in the American bookstore industry since the 1990s, which also saw the demise of Waldenbooks, Barnes & Noble's own subsidiary B. Dalton, and Crown Books, among others. Barnes & Noble's largest physical bookstore rival is now Books-A-Million, which does not operate in the Western US. Barnes & Noble also faces competition from general retailers, especially from Amazon.com, and from regional and independent booksellers.
At the same time, Barnes & Noble has reduced its overall presence; it closed its original flagship store in early 2014,[41] and mid-2014 saw it spinning off the Nook Media division.[42]
Publishing[edit]
Barnes & Noble publishes some of the books it sells, inexpensively reprinting non-copyrighted titles or acquiring the U.S. or English language rights from another publisher. In addition, Barnes & Noble commissions reprint anthologies and omnibus editions using in-house editors.[citation needed]
One of these titles, The Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense by Suzette Haden Elgin, has sold over 250,000 copies.[28] The reissued edition of The Columbia History of the World by John Garrity, for example has sold over 1 million copies.[28]
Since then, the company has expanded its publishing operation. This expansion was aided by the company's 2001 acquisition of SparkNotes, an educational website and publishing company.[43] Further expansions of the company's publishing business include the purchase of Sterling Publishing in 2003.[28]
From around 1992 through early 2003, Barnes & Noble released a series of literary classics for adults and children under the imprint Barnes & Noble Classics. Originally available only in hardcover, most titles came in a black or cream-colored dust jacket edition. In 2003, Barnes & Noble revamped and expanded its line of literature classics, releasing books in hardcover, mass market, and trade paperback editions.[citation needed] In addition, Barnes & Noble has a second paperback series called the Barnes & Noble Library of Essential Reading.[44]
Food service[edit]




The Barnes & Noble café in Springfield, New Jersey


The first store to feature a café serving Starbucks beverages was in Springfield, New Jersey, in 1993. Since then, most stores have been amended or constructed specifically to feature a café serving Starbucks beverages, Harney & Sons or Tazo Tea, FIJI Bottled Water, bakery goods from The Cheesecake Factory, candy from Godiva Chocolatiers, sandwiches and other specialty products. Although the cafés are owned and operated by Barnes & Noble, servers follow Starbucks' standards in beverage preparation.[citation needed] The Barnes & Noble membership card is accepted to receive a discount on any café related goods.[45] Starbucks Rewards and gift cards are not accepted at Barnes & Noble cafés.
In 2004, Barnes & Noble began offering Wi-Fi in the café area of selected stores, using SBC FreedomLink (now the AT&T Wi-Fi network). All stores currently offer Wi-Fi, an effort which was completed in 2006. Since July 27, 2009, Wi-Fi is offered for free to all customers.[46]

In 2016, Barnes & Noble announced plans during an investor conference to open four concept stores featuring restaurants twice the size of their cafés that would offer better food, wine, and beer. The restaurants, which are planned to open in fiscal year 2017, are expected to drive sales growth; should sales meet expectations, additional concept stores could open and stores with enough space to accommodate the restaurant could have the restaurants incorporated there as well. Company officials planned to open the first such stores in New York, Minnesota, California, and Virginia.
The Barnes & Noble restaurants are expected to include a waitstaff and a full menu for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.[47]
Community involvement[edit]
Barnes & Noble hires community business development managers to engage in community outreach. These managers' responsibilities include organizing in-store events, such as author appearances, children's storytimes and book groups. Community business development managers also work closely with local schools and groups to promote literacy and the arts. For example, Barnes & Noble sponsors a children's summer reading program that promotes literacy and puts over 2 million books into the hands of the children each year.[48] Barnes & Noble also hosts bookfairs, which raise funds for schools and libraries and an annual holiday book drive to collect books for disadvantaged children. Barnes & Noble stores collected and donated nearly 1.5 million books to more than 650 local charities across the country that provide services to disadvantaged children during the 2014 Holiday Book Drive.[49] To promote nationwide literacy among 1st to 6th graders and encourage more reading during the summer, Barnes & Noble has implemented a summer challenge: if children read eight books and write about their reading, Barnes & Noble will give the reader a free book.[50]
Barnes & Noble Nook[edit]
See also: Barnes & Noble Nook
Barnes & Noble Nook (styled NOOK) is a suite of e-book readers developed by the company,[51] based on the Android platform. The first device was announced in the United States on October 20, 2009 and was released November 30, 2009, for $259.[52] On June 21, 2010, Barnes & Noble reduced the Nook's price to $199, as well as launched a new Wi-Fi-only model, for $149, and released a Nook colored touch screen for $249.[53]
The Nook competes with the Amazon Kindle, Kobo eReader, and other e-reader offerings and color tablets used sometimes as readers, such as Apple's iBooks for iOS devices. Various Nook models feature a 6-inch, 7-inch, or larger touchscreen.[54] Version 1.3 of the Nook introduced Wi-Fi connectivity, a web browser, a dictionary, chess, and sudoku games, and a separate, smaller color touchscreen that serves as the primary input device. The Nook also features a Read in Store capability that allows visitors to stream and read any book for up to one hour while shopping in a Barnes & Noble bookstore. According to a June 2010 CNet article, the company planned to expand this feature to include periodicals in the near future.[55] The color version of the Nook introduced a 7-inch color touchscreen and the ability to view at a portrait or landscape orientation.[56]
On April 30, 2012, Microsoft invested $300 million for a 17.6% stake in Nook, which valued the business at about $1.7 billion.[57]
In November 2012, the technology publications Mashable and Techdirt criticized the license agreement with which Barnes & Noble sells ebooks to consumers, pointing out that the rights to re-download a purchased ebook expire when the customer's credit card expires, and a valid credit card must be added to the account to restore this functionality.[58][59]
In June 2014, Barnes & Noble had previously announced that it would spin off its Nook Digital division into a separate publicly traded company,[42][60] but as of 2016, Nook remains a part of Barnes & Noble. That same month, the company announced a partnership with Samsung Electronics to make Nook tablets, as the bookseller moved forward with plans to revamp its digital business.[61] Samsung and Barnes & Noble introduced the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook 7.0 in August 2014, followed by the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook 10.1 in October 2014. In December 2014, Barnes & Noble announced that it had ended its Nook partnership with Microsoft by buying back its stake.[62] Samsung and Barnes & Noble continue to introduce new Nook tablets.[63]
In March 2016, Barnes & Noble announced it would close the Nook App Store and Nook Video and in the UK close the Nook Store on March 15.[64] It will continue to sell e-books as well as digital magazines and newspapers in the US.
College bookstores[edit]
In August 2015, Barnes & Noble announced the completion of the separation of its Retail and College businesses. Barnes & Noble Education, Inc. is now an independent public company and the parent of Barnes & Noble College, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol, "BNED". Barnes & Noble College Booksellers, previously owned by company chairman Leonard Riggio, operated the self-proclaimed "world's largest bookstore" on Fifth Avenue and 18th Street in New York City, from 1932 to 2014. This flagship store carried a large variety of textbooks, medical and legal books, and medical supplies, in addition to the various trade titles carried at the company's main stores.[65]

Barnes & Noble, Inc., is a Fortune 500 company, the bookseller with the largest number of retail outlets in the United States, and a retailer of content, digital media, and educational products. As of April 29, 2017, the company operates 633 retail stores in all 50 U.S. states.[4]
Barnes & Noble operates mainly through its Barnes & Noble Booksellers chain of bookstores. The company's headquarters are at 122 Fifth Avenue in New York City.[5]
After a series of mergers and bankruptcies in the American bookstore industry since the 1990s, Barnes & Noble stands alone as the United States' sole remaining national bookstore chain.[6][7] Previously, Barnes and Noble operated the chain of small B. Dalton Booksellers stores in malls until they announced the liquidation of the chain. The company is known for large retail outlets, many of which contain a café serving Starbucks coffee and other consumables, from cannolis to spinach and feta pretzels. Most stores sell books, magazines, newspapers, DVDs, graphic novels, gifts, games, toys, music, and Nook e‑readers and tablets.

History[edit]




Clifford Noble in 1893


1886–1929[edit]
Barnes & Noble originated in 1886 with a bookstore called John Barnes & Company, located in the Cooper Union Building in New York City.[8][9] In the fall of 1886, Gilbert Clifford Noble, a then-recent Harvard graduate from Westfield, Massachusetts, was hired to work there as a clerk.[10] In 1894, Noble was made a partner, and the name of the shop was changed to Hinds & Noble.[11] In 1901, Hinds & Noble moved to 31–35 W. 15th Street.[12]
In 1917, Noble bought out Hinds and entered into a partnership with William Barnes, son of his old friend Charles; the name of the store was changed to Barnes & Noble.[13][14] Charles Barnes had opened a book-printing business in Wheaton, Illinois in 1873; William Barnes divested himself of his ownership interest in his father's firm just before his partnership with Noble and it would go on to become Follett Corporation. Although the flagship store once featured the motto "founded in 1873," the C. M. Barnes-Wilcox Company never had any connection to Barnes & Noble other than the fact that both were partly owned (at different times) by William Barnes.
1930–1969[edit]
In 1930, Noble sold his share of the company to William Barnes' son John Wilcox Barnes.[15] Noble died on June 6, 1936, at the age of 72.[16]




Barnes & Noble's former flagship store at 105 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, New York that operated from 1932 to 2014.


In 1932, at the height of the Great Depression, the bookstore moved to a flagship location on 18th Street and Fifth Avenue,[17] which served as so until its closure in 2014. The Noble family retained ownership of an associated publishing business, and Barnes & Noble opened a new publishing division in 1931.[15] In 1940, the store was one of the first businesses to feature Muzak; it underwent a major renovation the following year.[18] That decade the company opened stores in Brooklyn and Chicago.[19] William Barnes died in 1945, at the age of 78, and his son John Wilcox Barnes assumed full control.[19] The company underwent a significant expansion between the 1950s and the 1960s, opening an additional retail store on 23rd Street in Manhattan, as well as shops near the City University of New York, Harvard, and other Northeast college campuses.[20] John Barnes died in 1964, and the company was sold to the conglomerate Amtel two years later.[21]

1970s[edit]
The business was purchased in 1971, by Leonard Riggio for $1.2 million.[20] By then, it had been badly mismanaged over the prior two years and consisted only of "a significantly reduced wholesale operation and a single retail location—the store at 105 Fifth Avenue."[20] In 1974, Barnes & Noble became the first bookstore chain to advertise on television and a year later, the company became the first bookseller in America to discount books, by selling The New York Times best-selling titles at 40% off the publishers' list price.[22] Between the 1970s and the 1980s, Barnes & Noble opened smaller discount stores, which eventually phased out in favor of larger stores. They also began to publish their own books to be sold to mail-order customers. These titles were primarily affordable reissues of out-of-print titles and selling them through mail-order catalogs allowed Barnes & Noble to reach new customers nationwide.[22]
In November 1974, in response to a question from a member of the studio audience, the British twin brothers Norris McWhirter and Ross McWhirter, who were editors of the British-produced Guinness Book of Records, claimed on the BBC One television programme Record Breakers that the Fifth Avenue store of Barnes and Noble had overtaken that of London's Foyles bookshop to become the world's biggest bookstore.[23]
1980s–1990s[edit]
Barnes & Noble continued to expand throughout the 1980s, and it purchased the primarily shopping mall-based B. Dalton chain from Dayton Hudson in 1986, for an estimated $275 million to $300 million.[24] The last B. Dalton stores were scheduled to close in January 2010.[25] In 1989, Barnes and Noble had purchased the 22-store chain Bookstop. Solveig Robinson, author of The Book in Society: An Introduction to Print Culture, wrote that the purchase "gave [Barnes and Noble] the necessary know-how and infrastructure to create what, in 1992, became the definitive bookselling superstore."[26] The acquisition of the 797 B. Dalton bookstores turned the company into a nationwide retailer, and by the end of fiscal year 1999, the second-largest online bookseller in the United States.[25] B&N's critics claim that it has contributed to the decline of local and independent booksellers.[27]
Before Barnes & Noble created its official website, it sold books directly to customers through mail-order catalogs. It first began selling books online through an early videotex service called "Trintex," a joint venture between Sears and IBM, but the company's website was not launched until May 1997.[28] According to B&N's website, it now carries over 2 million titles.[29]
2000s[edit]
In 2002, Leonard Riggio's brother Stephen Riggio was named Barnes & Noble's CEO, a position he held until 2010.[30] The Barnes & Noble Review, an online literary site, was launched in October 2007. It featured book reviews, columns, and interview from critics and authors such as Michael Dirda, John Freeman, A.C. Grayling, Ezra Klein, Paul LaFarge, Mark Sarvas, Dava Sobel, Neal Stephenson, Stephen King, and Greil Marcus.[31] Music critic Robert Christgau has also written essays for the site.[32]
Video games and related items were sold in the company's GameStop retail outlets from 1999 until late 2004, when the division was spun off by distributing its 59% stake in GameStop to stakeholders of Barnes & Noble's, making it an independent company.[33]
2010s[edit]
Website president William Lynch was named CEO in 2010. He is credited with helping launch the company's electronic book store and overseeing the introduction of its electronic book reader, the Nook. Many observers saw his appointment as underscoring the importance of digital books to Barnes & Noble's future. Steve Riggio stayed on as vice chairman.[34] Lynch resigned in mid-2013,[35] and he was replaced by Chief Financial Officer Michael Huseby early the next year.[36] Following the spinoff of Barnes and Noble Education, Huseby departed to head the new firm; his place was filled in mid-2015 by Ronald Boire,[37][38] who departed one year later.[39]
After the bankruptcy and closure of its chief competitor, Borders Group, in 2011,[40] Barnes & Noble became the last remaining national bookstore chain in America.[6][7] This followed a series of mergers and bankruptcies in the American bookstore industry since the 1990s, which also saw the demise of Waldenbooks, Barnes & Noble's own subsidiary B. Dalton, and Crown Books, among others. Barnes & Noble's largest physical bookstore rival is now Books-A-Million, which does not operate in the Western US. Barnes & Noble also faces competition from general retailers, especially from Amazon.com, and from regional and independent booksellers.
At the same time, Barnes & Noble has reduced its overall presence; it closed its original flagship store in early 2014,[41] and mid-2014 saw it spinning off the Nook Media division.[42]
Publishing[edit]
Barnes & Noble publishes some of the books it sells, inexpensively reprinting non-copyrighted titles or acquiring the U.S. or English language rights from another publisher. In addition, Barnes & Noble commissions reprint anthologies and omnibus editions using in-house editors.[citation needed]
One of these titles, The Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense by Suzette Haden Elgin, has sold over 250,000 copies.[28] The reissued edition of The Columbia History of the World by John Garrity, for example has sold over 1 million copies.[28]
Since then, the company has expanded its publishing operation. This expansion was aided by the company's 2001 acquisition of SparkNotes, an educational website and publishing company.[43] Further expansions of the company's publishing business include the purchase of Sterling Publishing in 2003.[28]
From around 1992 through early 2003, Barnes & Noble released a series of literary classics for adults and children under the imprint Barnes & Noble Classics. Originally available only in hardcover, most titles came in a black or cream-colored dust jacket edition. In 2003, Barnes & Noble revamped and expanded its line of literature classics, releasing books in hardcover, mass market, and trade paperback editions.[citation needed] In addition, Barnes & Noble has a second paperback series called the Barnes & Noble Library of Essential Reading.[44]
Food service[edit]




The Barnes & Noble café in Springfield, New Jersey


The first store to feature a café serving Starbucks beverages was in Springfield, New Jersey, in 1993. Since then, most stores have been amended or constructed specifically to feature a café serving Starbucks beverages, Harney & Sons or Tazo Tea, FIJI Bottled Water, bakery goods from The Cheesecake Factory, candy from Godiva Chocolatiers, sandwiches and other specialty products. Although the cafés are owned and operated by Barnes & Noble, servers follow Starbucks' standards in beverage preparation.[citation needed] The Barnes & Noble membership card is accepted to receive a discount on any café related goods.[45] Starbucks Rewards and gift cards are not accepted at Barnes & Noble cafés.
In 2004, Barnes & Noble began offering Wi-Fi in the café area of selected stores, using SBC FreedomLink (now the AT&T Wi-Fi network). All stores currently offer Wi-Fi, an effort which was completed in 2006. Since July 27, 2009, Wi-Fi is offered for free to all customers.[46]

In 2016, Barnes & Noble announced plans during an investor conference to open four concept stores featuring restaurants twice the size of their cafés that would offer better food, wine, and beer. The restaurants, which are planned to open in fiscal year 2017, are expected to drive sales growth; should sales meet expectations, additional concept stores could open and stores with enough space to accommodate the restaurant could have the restaurants incorporated there as well. Company officials planned to open the first such stores in New York, Minnesota, California, and Virginia.
The Barnes & Noble restaurants are expected to include a waitstaff and a full menu for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.[47]
Community involvement[edit]
Barnes & Noble hires community business development managers to engage in community outreach. These managers' responsibilities include organizing in-store events, such as author appearances, children's storytimes and book groups. Community business development managers also work closely with local schools and groups to promote literacy and the arts. For example, Barnes & Noble sponsors a children's summer reading program that promotes literacy and puts over 2 million books into the hands of the children each year.[48] Barnes & Noble also hosts bookfairs, which raise funds for schools and libraries and an annual holiday book drive to collect books for disadvantaged children. Barnes & Noble stores collected and donated nearly 1.5 million books to more than 650 local charities across the country that provide services to disadvantaged children during the 2014 Holiday Book Drive.[49] To promote nationwide literacy among 1st to 6th graders and encourage more reading during the summer, Barnes & Noble has implemented a summer challenge: if children read eight books and write about their reading, Barnes & Noble will give the reader a free book.[50]
Barnes & Noble Nook[edit]
See also: Barnes & Noble Nook
Barnes & Noble Nook (styled NOOK) is a suite of e-book readers developed by the company,[51] based on the Android platform. The first device was announced in the United States on October 20, 2009 and was released November 30, 2009, for $259.[52] On June 21, 2010, Barnes & Noble reduced the Nook's price to $199, as well as launched a new Wi-Fi-only model, for $149, and released a Nook colored touch screen for $249.[53]
The Nook competes with the Amazon Kindle, Kobo eReader, and other e-reader offerings and color tablets used sometimes as readers, such as Apple's iBooks for iOS devices. Various Nook models feature a 6-inch, 7-inch, or larger touchscreen.[54] Version 1.3 of the Nook introduced Wi-Fi connectivity, a web browser, a dictionary, chess, and sudoku games, and a separate, smaller color touchscreen that serves as the primary input device. The Nook also features a Read in Store capability that allows visitors to stream and read any book for up to one hour while shopping in a Barnes & Noble bookstore. According to a June 2010 CNet article, the company planned to expand this feature to include periodicals in the near future.[55] The color version of the Nook introduced a 7-inch color touchscreen and the ability to view at a portrait or landscape orientation.[56]
On April 30, 2012, Microsoft invested $300 million for a 17.6% stake in Nook, which valued the business at about $1.7 billion.[57]
In November 2012, the technology publications Mashable and Techdirt criticized the license agreement with which Barnes & Noble sells ebooks to consumers, pointing out that the rights to re-download a purchased ebook expire when the customer's credit card expires, and a valid credit card must be added to the account to restore this functionality.[58][59]
In June 2014, Barnes & Noble had previously announced that it would spin off its Nook Digital division into a separate publicly traded company,[42][60] but as of 2016, Nook remains a part of Barnes & Noble. That same month, the company announced a partnership with Samsung Electronics to make Nook tablets, as the bookseller moved forward with plans to revamp its digital business.[61] Samsung and Barnes & Noble introduced the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook 7.0 in August 2014, followed by the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook 10.1 in October 2014. In December 2014, Barnes & Noble announced that it had ended its Nook partnership with Microsoft by buying back its stake.[62] Samsung and Barnes & Noble continue to introduce new Nook tablets.[63]
In March 2016, Barnes & Noble announced it would close the Nook App Store and Nook Video and in the UK close the Nook Store on March 15.[64] It will continue to sell e-books as well as digital magazines and newspapers in the US.
College bookstores[edit]
In August 2015, Barnes & Noble announced the completion of the separation of its Retail and College businesses. Barnes & Noble Education, Inc. is now an independent public company and the parent of Barnes & Noble College, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol, "BNED". Barnes & Noble College Booksellers, previously owned by company chairman Leonard Riggio, operated the self-proclaimed "world's largest bookstore" on Fifth Avenue and 18th Street in New York City, from 1932 to 2014. This flagship store carried a large variety of textbooks, medical and legal books, and medical supplies, in addition to the various trade titles carried at the company's main stores.[65]

Barnes & Noble, Inc., is a Fortune 500 company, the bookseller with the largest number of retail outlets in the United States, and a retailer of content, digital media, and educational products. As of April 29, 2017, the company operates 633 retail stores in all 50 U.S. states.[4]
Barnes & Noble operates mainly through its Barnes & Noble Booksellers chain of bookstores. The company's headquarters are at 122 Fifth Avenue in New York City.[5]
After a series of mergers and bankruptcies in the American bookstore industry since the 1990s, Barnes & Noble stands alone as the United States' sole remaining national bookstore chain.[6][7] Previously, Barnes and Noble operated the chain of small B. Dalton Booksellers stores in malls until they announced the liquidation of the chain. The company is known for large retail outlets, many of which contain a café serving Starbucks coffee and other consumables, from cannolis to spinach and feta pretzels. Most stores sell books, magazines, newspapers, DVDs, graphic novels, gifts, games, toys, music, and Nook e‑readers and tablets.

History[edit]




Clifford Noble in 1893


1886–1929[edit]
Barnes & Noble originated in 1886 with a bookstore called John Barnes & Company, located in the Cooper Union Building in New York City.[8][9] In the fall of 1886, Gilbert Clifford Noble, a then-recent Harvard graduate from Westfield, Massachusetts, was hired to work there as a clerk.[10] In 1894, Noble was made a partner, and the name of the shop was changed to Hinds & Noble.[11] In 1901, Hinds & Noble moved to 31–35 W. 15th Street.[12]
In 1917, Noble bought out Hinds and entered into a partnership with William Barnes, son of his old friend Charles; the name of the store was changed to Barnes & Noble.[13][14] Charles Barnes had opened a book-printing business in Wheaton, Illinois in 1873; William Barnes divested himself of his ownership interest in his father's firm just before his partnership with Noble and it would go on to become Follett Corporation. Although the flagship store once featured the motto "founded in 1873," the C. M. Barnes-Wilcox Company never had any connection to Barnes & Noble other than the fact that both were partly owned (at different times) by William Barnes.
1930–1969[edit]
In 1930, Noble sold his share of the company to William Barnes' son John Wilcox Barnes.[15] Noble died on June 6, 1936, at the age of 72.[16]

In 1932, at the height of the Great Depression, the bookstore moved to a flagship location on 18th Street and Fifth Avenue,[17] which served as so until its closure in 2014. The Noble family retained ownership of an associated publishing business, and Barnes & Noble opened a new publishing division in 1931.[15] In 1940, the store was one of the first businesses to feature Muzak; it underwent a major renovation the following year.[18] That decade the company opened stores in Brooklyn and Chicago.[19] William Barnes died in 1945, at the age of 78, and his son John Wilcox Barnes assumed full control.[19] The company underwent a significant expansion between the 1950s and the 1960s, opening an additional retail store on 23rd Street in Manhattan, as well as shops near the City University of New York, Harvard, and other Northeast college campuses.[20] John Barnes died in 1964, and the company was sold to the conglomerate Amtel two years later.[21]

1970s[edit]
The business was purchased in 1971, by Leonard Riggio for $1.2 million.[20] By then, it had been badly mismanaged over the prior two years and consisted only of "a significantly reduced wholesale operation and a single retail location—the store at 105 Fifth Avenue."[20] In 1974, Barnes & Noble became the first bookstore chain to advertise on television and a year later, the company became the first bookseller in America to discount books, by selling The New York Times best-selling titles at 40% off the publishers' list price.[22] Between the 1970s and the 1980s, Barnes & Noble opened smaller discount stores, which eventually phased out in favor of larger stores. They also began to publish their own books to be sold to mail-order customers. These titles were primarily affordable reissues of out-of-print titles and selling them through mail-order catalogs allowed Barnes & Noble to reach new customers nationwide.[22]
In November 1974, in response to a question from a member of the studio audience, the British twin brothers Norris McWhirter and Ross McWhirter, who were editors of the British-produced Guinness Book of Records, claimed on the BBC One television programme Record Breakers that the Fifth Avenue store of Barnes and Noble had overtaken that of London's Foyles bookshop to become the world's biggest bookstore.[23]
1980s–1990s[edit]
Barnes & Noble continued to expand throughout the 1980s, and it purchased the primarily shopping mall-based B. Dalton chain from Dayton Hudson in 1986, for an estimated $275 million to $300 million.[24] The last B. Dalton stores were scheduled to close in January 2010.[25] In 1989, Barnes and Noble had purchased the 22-store chain Bookstop. Solveig Robinson, author of The Book in Society: An Introduction to Print Culture, wrote that the purchase "gave [Barnes and Noble] the necessary know-how and infrastructure to create what, in 1992, became the definitive bookselling superstore."[26] The acquisition of the 797 B. Dalton bookstores turned the company into a nationwide retailer, and by the end of fiscal year 1999, the second-largest online bookseller in the United States.[25] B&N's critics claim that it has contributed to the decline of local and independent booksellers.[27]
Before Barnes & Noble created its official website, it sold books directly to customers through mail-order catalogs. It first began selling books online through an early videotex service called "Trintex," a joint venture between Sears and IBM, but the company's website was not launched until May 1997.[28] According to B&N's website, it now carries over 2 million titles.[29]
2000s[edit]
In 2002, Leonard Riggio's brother Stephen Riggio was named Barnes & Noble's CEO, a position he held until 2010.[30] The Barnes & Noble Review, an online literary site, was launched in October 2007. It featured book reviews, columns, and interview from critics and authors such as Michael Dirda, John Freeman, A.C. Grayling, Ezra Klein, Paul LaFarge, Mark Sarvas, Dava Sobel, Neal Stephenson, Stephen King, and Greil Marcus.[31] Music critic Robert Christgau has also written essays for the site.[32]
Video games and related items were sold in the company's GameStop retail outlets from 1999 until late 2004, when the division was spun off by distributing its 59% stake in GameStop to stakeholders of Barnes & Noble's, making it an independent company.[33]
2010s[edit]
Website president William Lynch was named CEO in 2010. He is credited with helping launch the company's electronic book store and overseeing the introduction of its electronic book reader, the Nook. Many observers saw his appointment as underscoring the importance of digital books to Barnes & Noble's future. Steve Riggio stayed on as vice chairman.[34] Lynch resigned in mid-2013,[35] and he was replaced by Chief Financial Officer Michael Huseby early the next year.[36] Following the spinoff of Barnes and Noble Education, Huseby departed to head the new firm; his place was filled in mid-2015 by Ronald Boire,[37][38] who departed one year later.[39]
After the bankruptcy and closure of its chief competitor, Borders Group, in 2011,[40] Barnes & Noble became the last remaining national bookstore chain in America.[6][7] This followed a series of mergers and bankruptcies in the American bookstore industry since the 1990s, which also saw the demise of Waldenbooks, Barnes & Noble's own subsidiary B. Dalton, and Crown Books, among others. Barnes & Noble's largest physical bookstore rival is now Books-A-Million, which does not operate in the Western US. Barnes & Noble also faces competition from general retailers, especially from Amazon.com, and from regional and independent booksellers.
At the same time, Barnes & Noble has reduced its overall presence; it closed its original flagship store in early 2014,[41] and mid-2014 saw it spinning off the Nook Media division.[42]
Publishing[edit]
Barnes & Noble publishes some of the books it sells, inexpensively reprinting non-copyrighted titles or acquiring the U.S. or English language rights from another publisher. In addition, Barnes & Noble commissions reprint anthologies and omnibus editions using in-house editors.[citation needed]
One of these titles, The Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense by Suzette Haden Elgin, has sold over 250,000 copies.[28] The reissued edition of The Columbia History of the World by John Garrity, for example has sold over 1 million copies.[28]
Since then, the company has expanded its publishing operation. This expansion was aided by the company's 2001 acquisition of SparkNotes, an educational website and publishing company.[43] Further expansions of the company's publishing business include the purchase of Sterling Publishing in 2003.[28]
From around 1992 through early 2003, Barnes & Noble released a series of literary classics for adults and children under the imprint Barnes & Noble Classics. Originally available only in hardcover, most titles came in a black or cream-colored dust jacket edition. In 2003, Barnes & Noble revamped and expanded its line of literature classics, releasing books in hardcover, mass market, and trade paperback editions.[citation needed] In addition, Barnes & Noble has a second paperback series called the Barnes & Noble Library of Essential Reading.[44]
Food service[edit]




The Barnes & Noble café in Springfield, New Jersey


The first store to feature a café serving Starbucks beverages was in Springfield, New Jersey, in 1993. Since then, most stores have been amended or constructed specifically to feature a café serving Starbucks beverages, Harney & Sons or Tazo Tea, FIJI Bottled Water, bakery goods from The Cheesecake Factory, candy from Godiva Chocolatiers, sandwiches and other specialty products. Although the cafés are owned and operated by Barnes & Noble, servers follow Starbucks' standards in beverage preparation.[citation needed] The Barnes & Noble membership card is accepted to receive a discount on any café related goods.[45] Starbucks Rewards and gift cards are not accepted at Barnes & Noble cafés.
In 2004, Barnes & Noble began offering Wi-Fi in the café area of selected stores, using SBC FreedomLink (now the AT&T Wi-Fi network). All stores currently offer Wi-Fi, an effort which was completed in 2006. Since July 27, 2009, Wi-Fi is offered for free to all customers.[46]

In 2016, Barnes & Noble announced plans during an investor conference to open four concept stores featuring restaurants twice the size of their cafés that would offer better food, wine, and beer. The restaurants, which are planned to open in fiscal year 2017, are expected to drive sales growth; should sales meet expectations, additional concept stores could open and stores with enough space to accommodate the restaurant could have the restaurants incorporated there as well. Company officials planned to open the first such stores in New York, Minnesota, California, and Virginia.
The Barnes & Noble restaurants are expected to include a waitstaff and a full menu for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.[47]
Community involvement[edit]
Barnes & Noble hires community business development managers to engage in community outreach. These managers' responsibilities include organizing in-store events, such as author appearances, children's storytimes and book groups. Community business development managers also work closely with local schools and groups to promote literacy and the arts. For example, Barnes & Noble sponsors a children's summer reading program that promotes literacy and puts over 2 million books into the hands of the children each year.[48] Barnes & Noble also hosts bookfairs, which raise funds for schools and libraries and an annual holiday book drive to collect books for disadvantaged children. Barnes & Noble stores collected and donated nearly 1.5 million books to more than 650 local charities across the country that provide services to disadvantaged children during the 2014 Holiday Book Drive.[49] To promote nationwide literacy among 1st to 6th graders and encourage more reading during the summer, Barnes & Noble has implemented a summer challenge: if children read eight books and write about their reading, Barnes & Noble will give the reader a free book.[50]
Barnes & Noble Nook[edit]
See also: Barnes & Noble Nook
Barnes & Noble Nook (styled NOOK) is a suite of e-book readers developed by the company,[51] based on the Android platform. The first device was announced in the United States on October 20, 2009 and was released November 30, 2009, for $259.[52] On June 21, 2010, Barnes & Noble reduced the Nook's price to $199, as well as launched a new Wi-Fi-only model, for $149, and released a Nook colored touch screen for $249.[53]
The Nook competes with the Amazon Kindle, Kobo eReader, and other e-reader offerings and color tablets used sometimes as readers, such as Apple's iBooks for iOS devices. Various Nook models feature a 6-inch, 7-inch, or larger touchscreen.[54] Version 1.3 of the Nook introduced Wi-Fi connectivity, a web browser, a dictionary, chess, and sudoku games, and a separate, smaller color touchscreen that serves as the primary input device. The Nook also features a Read in Store capability that allows visitors to stream and read any book for up to one hour while shopping in a Barnes & Noble bookstore. According to a June 2010 CNet article, the company planned to expand this feature to include periodicals in the near future.[55] The color version of the Nook introduced a 7-inch color touchscreen and the ability to view at a portrait or landscape orientation.[56]
On April 30, 2012, Microsoft invested $300 million for a 17.6% stake in Nook, which valued the business at about $1.7 billion.[57]
In November 2012, the technology publications Mashable and Techdirt criticized the license agreement with which Barnes & Noble sells ebooks to consumers, pointing out that the rights to re-download a purchased ebook expire when the customer's credit card expires, and a valid credit card must be added to the account to restore this functionality.[58][59]
In June 2014, Barnes & Noble had previously announced that it would spin off its Nook Digital division into a separate publicly traded company,[42][60] but as of 2016, Nook remains a part of Barnes & Noble. That same month, the company announced a partnership with Samsung Electronics to make Nook tablets, as the bookseller moved forward with plans to revamp its digital business.[61] Samsung and Barnes & Noble introduced the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook 7.0 in August 2014, followed by the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook 10.1 in October 2014. In December 2014, Barnes & Noble announced that it had ended its Nook partnership with Microsoft by buying back its stake.[62] Samsung and Barnes & Noble continue to introduce new Nook tablets.[63]
In March 2016, Barnes & Noble announced it would close the Nook App Store and Nook Video and in the UK close the Nook Store on March 15.[64] It will continue to sell e-books as well as digital magazines and newspapers in the US.
College bookstores[edit]
In August 2015, Barnes & Noble announced the completion of the separation of its Retail and College businesses. Barnes & Noble Education, Inc. is now an independent public company and the parent of Barnes & Noble College, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol, "BNED". Barnes & Noble College Booksellers, previously owned by company chairman Leonard Riggio, operated the self-proclaimed "world's largest bookstore" on Fifth Avenue and 18th Street in New York City, from 1932 to 2014. This flagship store carried a large variety of textbooks, medical and legal books, and medical supplies, in addition to the various trade titles carried at the company's main stores.[65]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
