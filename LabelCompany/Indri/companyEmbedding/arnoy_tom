Tom Arnoy
Thank you, operator. And thank you all for joining us today. I’m Tom Arnoy, co-founder and CEO of Zedge. Welcome to Zedge’s third quarter 2017 earnings conference call, recapping three months ended April 30 2017. Joining me today is Jonathan Reich, our Chief Financial and Chief Operating Officer who will provide insight into the numbers that we reported earlier today.
June 1st marked our first anniversary as an independent public company. During our initial conference call, I committed to you, our investors that I would be forthright about the business and express our expectations and challenges. This afternoon, I’d like to share some trends facing our business and discuss what we are doing about them. From a macro perspective on a year over year basis, both our revenues and monthly active user base or MAU have remained fairly flat.
Peeling back the onion, we’ve experienced solid MAU growth in emerging markets while contracting in well developed economies. At the same time, our average revenue per monthly active user from apps or ARPMAU has improved across both, well-developed economies and emerging markets. This growth is impressive, considering that we’ve been able to expand the revenue per user, even when facing a decline in users in more valuable geographies. Furthermore, considering our competitive position in the personalization space, we believe that we are well-positioned for continued growth. I should also add that Android users account for the bulk of these results as we continue to recover on iOS after Apple removed us from the iTunes App Store in early 2016.
We have taken stock of these trends and have narrowed our focus to concentrate on projects that will put MAU back on a growth trajectory in the most valuable markets, so that we can monetize more effectively. If we can deliver on this strategy, we expect to yield impressive revenue growth due to the expanding ARPMAU trends we have experienced in these markets. In addition, we have streamlined operations in order to accelerate these developments and release to market priority projects designed to achieve our goals. Our team is concentrating on improving core functionality and user experience which will positively impact user growth, engagement and retention.

I’d like to highlight some of these investments. To start, we are reworking Search which currently generates close to 100 million queries monthly. The makeover provides more relevant results with an improved user interface that renders the constant in an engaging way. Recently, we launched a whole new way for users to discover content by offering inspirational, text mix [ph] together by color, categories and trending searches. We have also taken advantage of artificial intelligence to offer real time recommendations that are both timely and contextually relevant. These recommendations are based on meaningful signals including personal interests, preferences, events and occasions. We have already started to see positive impact from some of these investments and hope these will increase over the coming months.
Many of these projects sound elementary, which is precisely the point. We need to focus on the core value proposition and functionality to make sure that our products align with the expectations of our users. When we do, users will return more often and engage more deeply. It’s a virtuous cycle and we are committed to doing a better job of taking advantage of it.
As discussed last quarter, our strategic focus on content is critical to enhancing user acquisition, engagement and retention, leading to an increase in revenues. To this end, I am pleased to announce that we rolled out an open beta of our entirely new content publishing platform earlier today. It goes without saying that content creators are the fuel that drives our leadership position. They are the strongest and most effective evangelists of our platform and contents. In all candor, we need to do better job of embracing this community to make them feel welcome and appreciate it. A core means to achieve this is to overhaul our content upload tool and content management system which was only available from the desktop.
With the introduction of our new publishing platform, creators will now be able to easily upload their art directly from their mobile devices and will be able to upload from their desktops far more easily. This will result in a more welcoming and friendly experience, open a door for new contributors, improve loyalty among the creator community and aware our consumers of great and timely contents. It will also have a positive effect on user growth because contributors market their creations to their friends and followers.
The flip side of where to focus is the de-prioritizing of projects that have value but only with expanding MAU. We have temporarily reallocated some of the resources dedicated to developing collections, which we previously referred to our stories. Yes, we continue investing in growing our portfolio of Hollywood releases and we are successful in expanding our marketing relationships to both the U.S. and Europe this past quarter. We are still excited by the opportunity for collections and remain confident that it will generate revenue in calendar year 2017.
Let me move on to iOS. It’s been around a year since we reentered the iTune store with a wallpaper only app. In late 2016, we rolled out a free ringtones app. And in late April of this year, we launched our Premium Ringtones and Marimba Remixes, featuring chart toping remixes from artists. The app enables users to purchase and set these ringtones directly from within the app. Although this steps haven’t returned our user base and revenues to pre-2016 levels, we remain committed to the Apple existence. [Ph] Early indications related to the Premium Ringtone app leave us with two priorities, first, scale the user base organically; second, grow the content catalog. We are doing both of these and expect to share more details with you the next quarter.

Shifting to Zedge Wallpapers. We launched several powerful app updates that have had an exceptional impact on our rating. Our current version has a 5-star rating compared to 3 stars previously. This should benefit us in organic user acquisition, as users will be more likely to install our app when seeing the positive reviews that should increase rankings in the app store, giving us more visibility with potential customers. With continued focus and improvements, we believe that we can continue to unlock significant value with our iOS offerings.
In wrapping up, I want to stress my conviction that we can resume a growth trajectory in MAU and revenue by continuing to focus on excellence in product, content and user experience.
Now, I am going to turn the call over to Jonathan Reich for a discussion of the quarter’s financial results. Thank you.
Jonathan Reich
Thank you, Tom. My remarks today will focus on our key operational and financial results for the third quarter of our fiscal year 2017. For a comprehensive and detailed discussion of our results, please read our earnings release issued earlier today and our Form 10-Q, which we expect to file with the SEC by June 14, 2017. Following my comments, we will open the call to any questions you may have.
Throughout my remarks the third quarter refers to February through April 2017, and the second quarter refers to November 2016 through January 2017.
Monthly active users or MAU, that is the number of unique users that opened our app during the last 30 days of the quarter increased by 0.1% to 31.7 million during April 2017 from 31.6 million in the corresponding period a year-ago.
On a sequential basis, MAU was impacted by seasonality and as expected declined 5.1%. The year-over-year MAU increase reflects strong growth in emerging markets, partially offset by an 11% decline in users from well-developed countries. As Tom mentioned, we do not downplay the import of this trend and are highly focused on streamlining operations and executing our projects that we expect will drive user growth in the high-value geographies in order to increase our revenues.
Total revenue in the third quarter declined $1.7% compared to the year-ago quarter, and 1.6% from the prior year quarter to $2.5 million. The year-over-year revenue decline was due to a combination of factors including but not limited to the removal of our app from the iTunes stores in early 2016, reduced investments in the game channel where we monetized on a cost per install basis, decline in revenues from our desktop and mobile websites which became less relevant with the adoption of our smartphone apps, and a drop in revenue from managing and optimizing a third-party’s advertising inventory. However, I want to point out that revenue generated from our Android app increased by close to 6% year-over-year, and was basically flat sequentially.
We are proud of this, especially considering seasonal advertising trends typically resulting in lighter budgets in the January through March period and the impact that the decrease in MAU from well-developed markets had on the apps revenue contribution. Revenue derived from our Android app constituted over 90% of Zedge’s aggregate revenue in the third quarter.
Overall, average revenue per monthly active user generated from our apps or ARPMAU increased by close to 1% year-over-year and 5.1% sequentially to $0.0294%. The year-over-year and sequential increases in ARPMAU were primarily achieved through the introduction of a new higher value Android ad unit in March 2017 and the addition of direct advertising partners. Our direct cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue increased to 16% from 13% in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and was unchanged compared to the prior sequential quarter. The year-over-year increase reflects investment to reduce content delivery latency, improved content filtering, and expand our addressable user base for push notifications and in-app messages. We believe that these investments are necessary to retain users and will lead to increased revenue in the future.

SG&A in the third quarter was $2.2 million, a 16% increase compared to the year ago quarter and a 7% decrease compared to the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase primarily relates to increasing headcount to 64 from 55 and the costs associated with operating as a public company. Although, we increased headcount by nine people in past year, we don’t anticipate adding as many employees in the near to mid-term. It’s also important to note that the new hires are both driving the accelerated development of the projects that Tom highlighted in his comments and closing technology deficits in core areas with new enhancements and features like our mobile publishing platform that was rolled out in open beta earlier day.
Our loss from operations in the third quarter narrowed to $193,000, compared to a loss of $339,000 in the second quarter. In the year ago quarter, we achieved income from operations $243,000. Our loss per share narrowed to $0.02 from $0.03 in the second quarter. In the year ago quarter, we reported earnings per diluted share of $0.04.
Zedge’s balance sheet continues to be strong and liquid. At April 30th, we reported $5.1 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to $4 million a year earlier. Our working capital or current assets less current liabilities was $5.3 million, compared to $3.9 million at April 30, 2016. Zedge has no debt.
To wrap up, we are pleased by the year-over-year increase in ARPMAU and are highly focused on efforts that will improve engagement and retention. As Tom discussed, we’ve implemented a comprehensive program intended to accelerate MAU and revenue growth by enhancing the quality, discoverability and relevancy of the contents we make available to our users, particularly those users in well-developed regions that command higher ad rates.
That concludes my remarks. Now, Tom and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator, back to you for Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you, sir. We will begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question of today is going to be John Rolfe with Argand Capital. Please go ahead you’re your question.
John Rolfe
You provided some color on the year to year increase in SG&A as a function of the increased headcount. Can you just talk a little bit about the sequential decline in SG&, was that related to some of this refocusing of resources or what sort of was behind the decline quarter to quarter?
Jonathan Reich
Sure, John. Thanks for asking the question. This is Jonathan. And that relates to initiatives such as content creation, where we began hearing back. But overall that is related to making sure that we’re hyper focused on the things that will move the lever in terms of growing monthly active users.
John Rolfe
Okay, great. And I did notice, I mean you guys have sort of spoken a couple of times on the call about the need or the desire or the initiatives to get that monthly average users growing again. So, on the one hand, you’ve kind of acknowledged that; on the other hand, you said I believe that the sequential decline was expected given seasonal factors. And it does look like you had a similar decline in the year ago quarter, on a sequential basis. How should we be thinking about the trajectory of that MAU seasonally from quarter to quarter and were you guys disappointed with the decline or was it expected?
Jonathan Reich
So, just to provide a little bit more color, overall, we did see that sequential decline. But, when you begin to take a look under the hood, as we’d indicated, the well-developed market that command higher ad rates, were the ones where we saw decline; and on the flip side, emerging markets, we actually saw the user base continue to grow. And I guess when we think about this on an ongoing basis, we do feel that the first quarter of the calendar year will typically be one where we see a fallback on user growth; the fourth quarter of the calendar year will actually be one where we see that user growth improve. And that is the seasonal effect having nothing to do with -- or having little to do per se with the activities in which we’re investing to overall drive growth in the well-developed economies. 

John Rolfe
I mean what is it? I understand the seasonality in terms of the average revenue and the fact that there is more robust ad budgets over the holiday quarter at the end of the calendar year. But what is the seasonal impact that’s driving better growth in the calendar fourth quarter and then the drop off of in the calendar first quarter?
Jonathan Reich
Sure. So, there are several factors but one very obvious factor, in holiday present giving, people get a new phone, they’ll download an app, they’ll try it out, they’ll say hey great and then with time, they will say, you know what this isn’t really what I was looking for and that begins to tail off in the calendar first quarter.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And it looks like our next questioner today is going to be Andrew Walker with Rangeley Capital, please go ahead with your question.
Andrew Walker
Hey, guys. Sorry, if I missed it; I got disconnected for a second. But, you launched a premium iPhone app at the end of the quarter. Can you give us a little color on how that kind of launch works in the quarter and what you’re seeing there, heading into this month?
Tom Arnoy
Hi Andrew, this is Tom. Are you referring to the last release, the premium ringtone apps, the remixes app?
Andrew Walker
Yes. That’s exactly what I’m talking about.
Tom Arnoy
Okay. So, we have launched app. So, if you go and look at the approximately, it’s an app we are really proud of. It looks really good. It’s in our opinion, state of the art. We can still add more content to it, like it has somewhat limited content still but we’re working on that. However, the content is of great quality. A lot of remixed songs of famous artists and like really well known songs there. For us now, it’s all about scaling number of users and of course increasing the monetization per user or the -- but this is a process that takes time. We’re not going to spend material amounts of money on user acquisition where we really invest in getting organic growth in this app. And that is going to take some time but we had like a really good start. And does that answer your question?
Andrew Walker
Kind of. I guess, two questions on it. So, on the content, right now it’s all Marimba Remixes; why don’t you kind of get normal songs and normal sounds on there? And the second question with you know, how much revenue is kind of generating at this point?
Tom Arnoy
So, the last question first. We don’t want to provide that number yet; it’s still early. Regarding the first question, yes, people want all sorts of different content and we are exploring that too. We chose now to go down a themed path with Marimba Remixes. There’s a lot of demand for that content now. This has to do with how we position the app, how you communicate the value proposition, how you also catch like keywords et cetera, like in the App Store. We have many reasons why we chose this path. But of course we will, there are many possible paths from here, and it’s a learning, it’s a journey for us. And currently, if we succeed with this, then we can go down many other -- we can launch many different themes.
Jonathan Reich
Andrew, just to set expectations, this is not -- this is still very early phase and revenue contribution is de minimis at this point. As Tom has said, in quarter four revenues increase; we’ve got to bring in users, then convert by making a purchase and selling it so forth.
Andrew Walker
Okay. I would just say, having [indiscernible] I mean the obvious thing to get this more popular is adding more content. But if you think the Marimba Remixes are popular, I guess that’s one thing. Just kind of moving on, I think you guys get a lot of consumer data, I think you mentioned -- was it over 100 million searches per month? Have you explored any ways to modify that outside of advertising for the users to kind of selling that data?

Jonathan Reich
Yes, we have explored ways in which we can monetize that. And as you can well appreciate, we need to be very, very careful there in order to make sure that we do not do something that will hurt our user base. We have seen a lot of activity in the data space overall. But there are whole host of purchases out there, some of them are very outstanding and some of them are little bit more sketchy. And we are beginning to generate a small amount of revenue from data but on a non-PII basis, making sure that we are limiting it until we have a comfort level that we can really scale that without ultimately hurting our core business. We don’t want to have a situation where we have a quick win with some data and users then begin to push back saying hey, what are doing with my data. And again just to reiterate, anything that we do in the data space is on a very anonymized basis so that we do not embrace that relationship that we have with users in terms of securing and maintaining their privacy.
Andrew Walker
And then, just the last thing I would say, I think three quarter ago, the focus was on the set my ringtone app, two quarters ago the focus was on the stories app; now, we are starting to hear stories on the [indiscernible] and they are going back to kind of elementary type things and all that sounds nice, but this is a 10 year old company and as an investor it’s pretty concerning to hear these constant shifts. I would just say -- I don’t know what I am saying, but it’s just very concerning to see revenue flat line and the constant shifts in narrative. It will be nice to see the company just focus on the core app monetization and I guess elementary focus you guys mentioned?
Tom Arnoy
I understand your comments, but we are a tech company. And we -- like things change all the time. We have to focus on the information and data we have at any given time. And remember, I believe we addressed this the last time as well. But set my ring tone was one feature, we highlighted. That we chose, not to pursue because it is -- it takes a lot of investment to get where we believe we need to be with that feature in order to succeed. So, we haven’t dropped it, we haven’t said we are not doing that, but it’s there like maybe we will do it. 
When it comes to collections or stories collections, we are still investing in that. And previously, we didn’t invest like a big percent of the resources in that product. We just wanted to address we are focusing back on like on a lot of the core stuffs and we are now stopping some development on collections and pursue -- start to get more deals in at this point. But we are not stopping doing it we’re just reducing the investment there, the activity a little bit. But I think it’s truly -- it’s natural for a company like Zedge from quarter-to-quarter move around resources because every day we get new data, new information that can have the influence on our decisions. And I would be surprised if these tests doesn’t happen in other tech companies.
Andrew Walker
I don’t disagree with you, I’m not saying don’t do it which makes the most sense. But I’m just saying for a company every quarter to kind of shifting growth priorities and see this stalled out revenue growth at this level, stalled out MAUs at this level, it’s pretty concerning as an investor but it might be a conversation better taken offline. So, I will take it there. So thanks for taking the question.
Jonathan Reich
Andrew, it’s Jonathan. I think if I were to do reframe this, I think that where we have not done as good of a job as we can do is actually in highlighting that our core app has and continues to be the investment which -- the asset I should say where we invest the most time in resources. In the previous conference calls, and maybe we are guilty of not articulating that well and maybe we’re also guilty of trying to share a vision of where we think this can go. But, I think that I would reframe your description to want to -- you don’t rightfully want to see that every quarter, hey, we have a new top priority and I agree with that. I think that in our previous conference calls, we have talked about features where we have tested and explored, but it’s not like we’ve taken 80% of the workforce and allocated them on something or invested their resources on something which has not won the favor that our users would like, rather we have a limited amount of resources that are dedicated to trying new things out, so that we can continue to evolve. And what we really have decided this quarter is as opposed to continuing to evolve collections with technical and development resources, we rather apply those technical and development resources for the most part to some of the core areas, which we would like to accelerate a little bit more quickly. But on the sales and marketing side, we are full steam ahead in terms of bringing in more partners, making sure that we are expanding our footprint. In previous quarters, we were only available pretty much in Canada with the studios; this past quarter, we have actually launched collections both in the U.S. and in Europe. And that continues to be their goal and objective ultimately to translate into a revenue producing contributor to our business.

But, I think that in summary, we have not done as good of a job in terms of articulating the focus that we have on the core app and we need to do a better job of that going forward.
Operator
And our next questioner today is going to be Brian Warner with Performance Capital. Please go ahead with your question.
Brian Warner
Hi, guys. Couple of questions. On your efforts to improve and grow your ARPMAU, you sort of mentioned a couple of things. And I’m wondering, if you could just sort to talk in late terms about, which of those things can sort of move the lever the most? And if we’re trying to observe and watch and grade you, when should we begin to see the fruits of those things? And maybe you can marry it to what it might look like a few years out in terms of your vision. I know it’s a little vague, but I’ll leave it there.
Tom Arnoy
Hi. This is Tom. First of all, I think we are already seeing the fruits of this, as we mentioned just now. We have added new ads formats and have different -- and we are constantly testing new things there. Again, the most important for us is focusing on making sure that we continue growth in user base, because that is the strongest driver on revenue. So, we’re balancing how much business is we’re investing and try new advertising formats. However, we are constantly trying new things and we are now exploring some really interesting things. I think, we expect to see results every quarter and then that’s really what the whole family has to work for. But generally, it is formats short-term; more long-term, we have addressed that we are working on collections. Hopefully that will bring like a new revenue stream and for sure also iOS. It’s still early, but we really hope that iOS will be a strong contributor to our revenue and to our average revenue per user moving forward.

Good day everyone and welcome to Zedge’s first quarter fiscal year 2017 earnings conference call. During management’s prepared remarks, all participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]
In today’s presentation, Tom Arnoy, Zedge’s Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, and Jonathan Reich, Zedge’s Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, will discuss Zedge’s financial and operational results for the three month period ended October 31st, 2016. 
Any forward-looking statements made during this conference call, either in the prepared remarks or in the Q&A session, whether general or specific in nature, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those which the company anticipates. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, specific risks and uncertainties disclosed in the reports that Zedge files periodically with the SEC. Zedge assumes no obligation either to update any forward-looking statements that they have made, or may make, or to update the factors that can cause these actual results to differ materially from those that they forecast.
Please note that Zedge earnings release is available on the Investor Relations page of Zedge’s website and the earnings release has also been filed on Form 8-K with the SEC.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Arnoy. Please go ahead, sir.
Tom Arnoy
Thank you operator. And thank you all for joining us today. I am Tom Arnoy, Co-Founder and CEO of Zedge. Welcome to Zedge’s first quarter of fiscal 2017 earnings conference call, recapping the three months ended October 31, 2016. Joining me today is Jonathan Reich, our Chief Financial and Chief Operating Officer.
We’re pleased to share the highlights of the quarter. As you know from our previous calls, Zedge is focused on growing our user base, increasing engagement and ultimately expanding our revenues through that user growth and new methods to monetize our base. We know there is great untapped potential in our platform that we can unlock by investing in these priorities. After a decline last quarter, we made good progress in Q1, most notably with the uptick in monthly active users, or MAU, and we are seeing improving trends in engagement. I want to quickly note that we are no longer reporting active installs, as Google has ceased reporting total device active installs. 
For Zedge, MAU is a significant performance indicator, because it speaks to both reach and retention. We’re pleased about the recent improvement in MAU, and are optimistic that we can build on that success. During the last 30 days of the first quarter, MAU grew by 2.6% to 31.6 million when compared to the last 30 days of Q1 of fiscal 2016. We also saw modest growth in MAU compared to Q4 of the prior fiscal year. 
MAU resumed growing this past quarter, which is important considering that Q4 2016 was the first quarter in our history which witnessed a decline in MAU. This growth is a direct result of our investments in improving the user experience, which should provide a sustained user growth and ultimately translate into revenue expansion.
That said, in Q1, average revenue per monthly active user declined by 10.7%. We are working hard to reverse this downturn by continuing to grow our user base with users that generate greater revenues, and unlocking the potential with improved engagement and introducing new monetization layers. As stated earlier, user growth, engagement and retention are harbingers of revenue growth. In Q1, we took assertive steps to advance Zedge’s reach and revenue potential.

To that end, I want to outline three areas of focus that we have adopted, scaling our team, optimizing the user experience and expanding our product portfolio. I would like to elaborate on the progress we’ve made in each of these areas.
First, the team. We have made significant investments in expanding our team, both in Norway and in the US. In fact, compared to the year-ago quarter, our team has grown by eight people. Key hires in Q1 were related directly to driving Zedge’s revenue potential, namely hiring in products, engineering, marketing and commercial partnerships. Our engineering and development team growth contributed directly to an unprecedented level of updates and new product growth. 
We also expanded our commercial team by bringing on seasoned professionals focusing on the sports and entertainment verticals. They are already hard at work establishing partnerships with major content providers, as Zedge takes action on its stated commitment to open up the homescreen to brands that want to engage with their fans and customers with compelling personalization content.
Second is our focus on optimizing the user experience and improving engagement. Our quarterly results show that our efforts are resonating in these areas, as we selectively deployed feature enhancements to accelerate user growth and increase customer engagement. An improved user experience is especially critical as we approach the holiday period, not to mention for overall retention.
Examples of feature enhancements made in the first quarter includes, using AI technology to scale images from low resolution to high resolution, thus making more content available, just in time for those turning to Zedge in order to personalize their new high-end phones this holiday season. This effort resulted in a significant increase of wallpapers available to 54% of US users and 40% of global users. For users affected, this has led to 20% more interaction with the content and 4% more wallpapers being set.
Through deep learning and enhanced technology, we have improved the user experience by ensuring that our content is easy to discover and fun to navigate. This update has unearthed 10% more unique content. We will continue to leverage this powerful functionality to improve content recommendations and search results.
We have enabled the possibility to set lock screen wallpapers directly from within the app for more than 40% of our user base, which, for this group, has increased the number of users setting wallpapers by 6%. In the coming months, we expect to enable this functionality to more and more users.
We have significantly reduced the latency for users playing ringtones and notifications, to ensure a much more responsive experience. After these improvements, on average, our users are listening to 15% more ringtones and notifications than before.
Finally, we remain committed to expanding our product portfolio with the goal of increasing our reach. We have rolled out an unprecedented number of products over the past several months. We most recently launched Ringtones for iOS as well as expanded the beta of our new app, SNAKK, globally. Even as we expect to continue to optimize these products, we view these launches as significant accomplishments which will help us in growing our user base.
Beyond this, our data reveals that overall retention has improved with the Android widgets beta. We’re also focused on finalizing Set My Ringtone in calendar 2017, which we believe will have broad appeal and help expand our user base.
In another exciting development, we made steady progress with the introduction of Zedge Stories both in terms of the core product offering and brand partners. To this end, we started promoting content from MMA's World Series of Fighting, our first foray into sports and expect to offer embedded merchandising capabilities in Stories in time for the holidays. The content is related to World Series of Fighting's New Year's Eve mega-event at New York's Madison Square Garden to be broadcast live on the NBC Television Network.

We remain committed to growing our user base and designing and deploying products that cement our leadership position in smartphone personalization. We believe that over time this will create a sustainable path to revenue growth.
Now, I am going to turn the call over to Jonathan Reich for a discussion of the quarter’s financial results. Thank you.
Jonathan Reich
Thank you, Tom. My comments today will focus on our key operational and financial results for Q1 of fiscal 2017, the three months ended October 31st, 2016. For a comprehensive and detailed discussion of our results, please read our earnings release issued earlier today and our Form 10-Q, which we expect to file with the SEC by December 15th. Following my comments, we will open the call and address any questions you may have.
In my remarks and unless I specify otherwise, comparisons are to the year ago quarter, mainly the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. Monthly active users, or MAU, climbed to 31.6 million during the last 30 days of the first quarter from 30.8 million in the comparable period one year ago, and 31.1 million in the sequential quarter. As Tom mentioned, this growth primarily relates to improving the user experience, increasing engagement and re-launching the iOS ringtone app.
Revenue in the first quarter was $2.4 million, a decrease of 6.9% compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, while average revenue per monthly active user, or ARPMAU, decreased 10.7% year over year to 2.33 cents.
The year-over-year declines in revenue and ARPMAU reflect the impact of Apple’s decision to remove the Zedge app from iTunes in early 2016 and our decision, in April 2016, to de-emphasize the Game Channel which resulted in a decline in game installs.
MAU is a leading directional indicator of revenue, and we expect that the investments we are making in our offerings will help expand our reach and drive continued growth in MAU. Taken together with the improvements in user engagement, we believe that these efforts will translate into both expanding revenues and new monetization opportunities that will start to unfold later this year.
Direct cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue increased slightly to 15.4% from 15% in Q4 2016 and from 11.5% in Q1 2016 as we experienced higher marketing automation expense related to reaching a larger number of our customers and increases in both hosting and content filtering costs. We will seek to manage these costs and ensure that we have the right partners and infrastructure to support our user growth.
SG&A grew by 4.2% or $71,000 to $1.8 million compared to the year ago quarter. The increase primarily reflects growing our headcount to 59 from 51 in the year ago quarter and the added costs of operating as a public company following our spin-off from IDT in June. The impact of these factors was partially offset in the first quarter by several non-routine items including a tax credit in Norway and lower bonus payouts. Looking ahead, we expect that SG&A will continue to increase in 2017 as we further expand the team and increase our investment in new technology and content development. 
The revenue decline in combination with the increase in SG&A expense lowered income from operations to $113,000 from $419,000 in the year ago quarter. Net income per diluted share decreased to $0.02 compared to $0.04 in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 despite a $51,000 foreign exchange gain compared to a foreign exchange loss of $54,000 a year earlier.
Turning to our balance sheet, Zedge remains well capitalized. As of October 31st, we reported $6 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to $2.4 million a year earlier. Trade accounts receivable were $1.9 million, and our historical receivables collection rate is 100%. Zedge continues to carry no debt, although we have access to a $2.5 million credit facility with Bridge Bank.

To wrap up my remarks, our efforts to improve MAU, expand reach and improve engagement are starting to pay dividends as evidenced by the reversal in the direction of MAU from last quarter. We believe that these initiatives will result in expanding revenue in 2017 both organically and through the introduction of new monetization schemes. We will continue to invest judiciously in growth opportunities pursuant to the strategy Tom outlined in his remarks and do so while maintaining a healthy balance sheet with ample liquidity.
This concludes my remarks. Now, Tom and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator, back to you for Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first questioner today is John Rolfe [ph] with Oregon Capital. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
Hey, Guys. So just a little help I guess with the numbers. Can you give us any sort of guidance with respect to, on either a percentage of revenue basis or on an absolute basis how we should be thinking about SG&A for the entire year? And I guess I sort of asked the question in the context of your comment that there were some puts and takes this quarter. So I'm just trying to understand what a certain normalized level for SG&A might be for the year, now that you have certain ongoing run rate with all the public company expenses?
Jonathan Reich
Yes. So this is Jonathan and thanks for asking the question. What we've said in the past really is two things. First of all, the cost of being a public company, we estimated it to be somewhere between $750,000 to $900,000 compared to when we were majority owned by IDT. And the growth in SG&A that we see aside from that really relates to adding more personnel, which as we mentioned, we grew around 8 people from a year ago this quarter. We’re not really at the point where we are providing projections. 
But suffice it to say that if we're 59 people now, we believe that we will be north of 70 people by the end of the fiscal year, if not more than that. And I should add as well that we have had a pretty consistent policy within the company that we are not going to just load up the ship with contents on the people unless we know that or unless we feel very comfortable that the revenue will be there to ultimately support that investment.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And let me just ask, I guess, one additional question. I mean looking longer term, can you guys talk at all about sort of what you think a target operating model for the business might be. I mean when you look at a business like yours, what -- once you sort of transition through the growth investments, what sort of operating margins do you think should be achievable for a business like yours?
Jonathan Reich
Yes. So it’s also a little bit early for us to answer that question because as we've described, we have several initiatives in terms of the monetization stack that we need to really scale out in a marketplace. As I think John you know that our revenue today is primarily driven by programmatic advertising and the new monetization schemes that we have been working on we believe will sell at a premium to those, but it's still a little bit too early for us to really be able to sort of say, hey, it will be a 20%, 30%, 40%, whatever that number is. So we ask that you indulge with us while we are sort of getting those products out there and assessing what demand will be like and where those products price out. 
That being said, when thinking about the add-ons that we've had on the commercial side, focusing on the sports and the entertainment verticals, these are verticals which are investing tons and tons of money in terms of their marketing initiatives and thinking about the fact that Zedge really can bring ownership of the homescreen, whether it be through wallpapers, lock screen wallpapers, widgets, icons and all of the associated audio to these different verticals, we are very excited about what the opportunity is and look forward to executing on that in the upcoming quarters.

Operator
Our next questioner today is Andrew Walker with Rangeley Capital. Please go ahead, sir.
Andrew Walker
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Yes. So I just wanted to start with, so for the overall revenue declines, obviously ARPU was way down and you guys kind of mentioned games as a driver, but I was wondering if you could draw a little bit further down and kind of switch -- and kind of break it down like how much was games a driver versus I think the other piece has to be either a lot lower prices on advertising or a lot less engagement from users. So can you kind of break those three different pieces down?
Jonathan Reich
Hey, Andrew. How are you? Yeah. It’s Jonathan. So a couple of things. What we've said was really that there were two pieces here, a, not being around an iOS obviously had hurt us and that prevented us from pushing upgrades to the existing customers, so that was basically something that contributed to the downturn. And when comparing the two platforms, iOS does monetize at a higher rate than [indiscernible], number one. Number two is the game channel specifically, we experienced a downturn there because we've not been investing there and that was a, we’ve not broken out the numbers in the past, but it's fair to assume that that was definitely something that was helping us in terms of lifting the average revenue per monthly active user. We, overall, have seen that on Android that we're holding our own in terms of where that has been pricing out. So these ancillary and important, but ancillary removals from iOS and from the game channel, we think are the overall piece that has hurt us there. 
In terms of engagement, Tom, do you want to address that a little bit?
Tom Arnoy
Yeah, sure. So Mike, we have not seen like a decline on engagement on the retention in general. There are no clear patents on the crease. They’re like, in fact like our focus on engagement and retention, we think over time will have a significant impact on the average revenue per user. And we speak more to both factors as like session time and frequency of use as like how many times a user actually uses Zedge in a month, et cetera that has very big impact on the average revenue per user and that is one of our main focus areas right now and expands everything from focusing on content discovery and like search recommendations and UI and algorithms, a whole lot of things.
Andrew Walker
Okay. That was super helpful. And then I guess, you’ve mentioned the iPhone a couple of times and we didn’t get to talk about it last quarter, but if we just looked at monthly active users on Android versus iPhone, would it be substantially higher than the 2% that you're reporting right now on Android, because I'm guessing iPhones drives it down?
Jonathan Reich
Are you talking about growth on Android versus growth on iOS?
Andrew Walker
Yeah. Monthly active users on Android, instead of like you guys report overall, but if I was looking just at Android, would it be much higher. So iPhone is dragging the overall number down.
Jonathan Reich
Yes. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but let me get back to you on that.
Andrew Walker
Okay. I can follow up with you guys on that. And then just kind of turning to Zedge stories, so I’m just on my iPhone looking at Zedge stories and the top two right now are kind of Bad Santa and the Washington Wizards, are you guys getting paid for these or are these still kind of aimed I guess freebie mode?
Jonathan Reich
Yes. So we're not, as of yet, charging for stories and let me sort of share with you what we envision in terms of progression. We need to iterate until we get the product right. And we also need to have a couple of successes and wins that we can use to market, but we believe that in calendar year 2017, we will begin to monetize those stories directly with content owners there, looking to gain access to our customer base.

Andrew Walker
Perfect. Okay. Well, that was super helpful and I will follow up kind of offline with you guys on everything else.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next questioner is Dylan Adelman from Global Platinum Securities. Please go ahead.
Dylan Adelman
Hi. So I have a question about the alignment of management and shareholder interests. So because Zedge is a smaller fast growing company that's based around the mobile application, it does seem very much like a start-up company and start-ups usually compensate upper management and regular employees as well using options. And this is to align those interests of management with shareholders as well as prevent cash burn. But looking to the proxy, you noticed that both of you, Mr. Reich and Mr. Arnoy, you both received about 99,000, 990,000 in total compensation and none of that was in stock owned options. 
This is about one-seventh of the total SG&A of the firm and more than the firm's net income for the year. So in recognizing that options are really critical for smaller fast run companies like Zedge, they're critical for aligning that management shareholder interest. Can you talk a little bit more about how you think about this compensation structure and choosing to pay a large salary and bonus in cash rather than focusing mostly on options?
Jonathan Reich
So, first of all, Dylan, I think that there was mention of a new options package being offered to management and the compensation you're looking at is for the previous year. The ownership of the company, it felt that in light of our having grown the company to the point where it was self-sustaining, and would unlock value for shareholders, that it was the right thing to throw some additional cash our way, but certainly we have, we had at the point of the spinout, our equity piece had been fully vested and there is an additional equity grant that is part of compensation now. In terms of our cash compensation, we have a bonus on top of or the potential for a bonus I should say on top of our base compensation. And if we don't meet our numbers in fiscal year 2017, we will not be able to take benefit of that cash bonus accordingly.
Dylan Adelman
Okay. So just like one follow-up question on that, are you looking at shifting your compensation more towards stock or options in the future and the reason why I just press on this so much is because to me Zedge does seem like a great company, but there's always those concerns with smaller companies if management is not, really, if they don't have skin in the game, as I can phrase it that way and for me, that's just one persistent concern that I don't see that same skin in the game that you might hope for in a smaller company. So do you see that compensation shifting at all?
Jonathan Reich
Yeah. That's really not a question that, and I don't want to sound that I'm not sensitive to your question, but ultimately our compensation is determined by the board and by the comp committee. And I would venture to say that we both have skin in the game and that our employees overall have skin in the game in terms of overall option grants and hard equity that is owned by that group. So I'll be glad to follow-up with you if you like, but I don't have that much more to say on this at this point in time.
