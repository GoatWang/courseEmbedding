For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch Affirms Four and Upgrades One Class of CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2014-1 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms Four and Upgrades One Class of CarMax Auto Owner Trust 
      2014-1
    





October 26, 2016 10:50 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As part of its ongoing surveillance, Fitch Ratings has affirmed four 
      classes and upgraded one class of outstanding notes of CarMax Auto Owner 
      Trust 2014-1. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this 
      press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The rating affirmations are based on available credit enhancement and 
      loss performance. The collateral pool continues to perform within 
      Fitch's expectations. Based on the current structure and credit 
      enhancement, the securities are able to withstand stress scenarios 
      consistent with the assigned ratings and make full payments to 
      investors, in accordance with the terms of the documents. The positive 
      outlook for the class D notes reflects Fitch's expectation of potential 
      positive rating actions in the next 12 - 18 months.
    

      The ratings reflect the quality of CarMax Business Services, LLC's 
      retail auto loan originations, the strength of its servicing 
      capabilities, and the sound financial and legal structure of the 
      transactions.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case 
      loss proxy, and impact available loss coverage and multiples levels for 
      the transaction. Lower loss coverage could impact ratings and Rating 
      Outlooks, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.
    

      In Fitch's initial review of the transaction, the notes were found to 
      have limited sensitivity to a 1.5x and 2.5x increase of Fitch's base 
      case loss expectation. To date, the transaction has exhibited strong 
      performance with losses well within Fitch's initial expectations with 
      rising loss coverage and multiple levels. Therefore, a material 
      deterioration in performance would have to occur within the asset pool 
      to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratings.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in 
      relation to this rating action.
    

      Fitch has taken the following actions:
    

      CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2014-1
    

      --Class A-3 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class C upgraded to 'AAAsf' from 'AAsf'; Outlook revised to Stable 
      from Positive;
    

      --Class D affirmed at 'BBBsf'; Outlook Positive.

      subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone:

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not 
      intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning 
      of the Corporations Act 2001.

Third-Party Auto Sites Continue to Lag Behind Manufacturer Sites in Overall Look and Feel


 






TrueCar Ranks Highest among Third-Party Automotive Websites, Followed by CARFAX and Cars.comNew York: 24 March 2016 — Third-party automotive websites are improving satisfaction by capturing the attention of car shoppers through increased use of the visual Web and its streamlined approach to site navigation, according to the J.D. Power 2016 Third-Party Automotive Website Evaluation Study,SM released today.The study, now in its fourth year, measures the usefulness of automotive third-party websites during the new- and used-vehicle shopping process by examining four key measures (in order of importance): information/content; appearance; navigation; and speed. Satisfaction is measured on a 1,000-point scale.While the impact of appearance on third-party auto website satisfaction has increased at a steady pace to 24% in 2016 from 21% in 2013, there exists a significant 83-point gap in satisfaction between third-party sites and manufacturer (OEM[1]) sites (742 vs. 825, respectively).  Appearance is the highest-scoring measure for auto manufacturer sites and second lowest for third-party sites.“The common bond among top-performing third-party auto sites is a heavy reliance on the ‘visual Web,’ with its very streamlined, easy-to-use site navigation features,” said Arianne Walker, senior director of marketing analytics at J.D. Power. “Expectations continue to increase not only because auto manufacturers have such visually stimulating sites but because websites in many categories have focused on enhancing visual aesthetics and easy navigation. If third-party sites want to maintain and increase their usage among shoppers, they need to consider the impact appearance has on satisfaction and continually work to improve the look and feel of the website to keep up with the ever changing expectations of shoppers.”Following are the key findings of the 2016 study:Visual Web Influences Site Preference: The study finds that the highest-scoring third-party auto websites employ heavy use of visual Web design elements such as edge-to-edge imagery, cleaner spacing and aesthetically pleasing call-to-action colors.Expert Reviews Must Cover the Basics: Content is king when it comes to satisfying shoppers on third-party sites, which includes ratings and reviews. Shoppers indicate the most important content to cover in an expert review is safety (38%), performance (24%) and functionality (11%).Satisfaction Drives Loyalty and Advocacy: The study finds that 83% of highly satisfied shoppers (overall satisfaction scores of 901 or higher) using third-party websites say they “definitely will” return to the website in the future, and 81% say they “definitely will” recommend the site, while only 3% of displeased shoppers (scores of 500 or less) say they “definitely will” return and only 2% say they “definitely will” recommend.Study RankingsIn 2016, overall satisfaction with automotive third-party websites averages 751. TrueCar ranks highest (795), followed by CARFAX (793) and Cars.com (775).The 2016 Third-Party Automotive Website Evaluation Study is based on evaluations from more than 5,000 new- and used-vehicle shoppers who indicate they will be in the market for a vehicle within the next 24 months. The study was fielded in January 2016.Websites evaluated in the study were selected based on meeting the following criteria: must be an automotive third-party site; have the ability for consumers to shop for both new and used vehicles; and be among the most frequently visited sites based on behavioral data.Media Relations ContactsJohn Tews; Troy, Mich.; (248) 680-6218; media.relations@jdpa.comFor more information about the 2016 Third-Party Automotive Website Evaluation Study, visit http://www.jdpower.com/resource/us-third-party-automotive-website-evaluation-studySee the online Press Release at http://www.jdpower.com/press-releases/2016-third-party-automotive-website-evaluation-studyAbout J.D.

We Buy Cars and Trucks, Any Condition!

 We Buy Cars, Trucks, Vans, SUVs, Classics, Commercial vehicles and more. Seriously, if it’s got wheels and an engine we want it!  We’ve been in business for over 35 years, and due to the fantastic customer response we’ve gotten all those years, we expect to be around for many years to come.
				 You can sell your “like new” or “beat to heck” used car to us. We, of course, LOVE to get our hands on clean cars and really bend over backwards to buy your late model, low mileage car. However, we are realistic and know that most people buy their cars and drive them, until that sad day when the car is no longer useful to them. Because of that, we buy cars in nearly every possible condition. Check out our photos of recently purchased vehicles to see the ginormous variety of vehicles that we are able to purchase.
				 We have the capability to purchase a fleet of late model commercial trucks, as well as the ability to purchase the junk car your ex left in the driveway 12 years ago and of course anything in between these extremes, and we can do it today!
				 We will come to your home or office and buy your car, truck, van, SUV or commercial vehicle. We are fully licensed, bonded, insured and have received great reviews on Yelp and the
				BBB. We handle all of the paperwork for you and will tow your car for free.
			
Sell Your Car Fast

				We come to you FAST. For instance, in just ONE of our Service Zones, we have 14 expert car buyers on our payroll in the field, all either on their way to or at a vehicle that we are purchasing. They are on a map in our call center and can be deployed to you literally at the touch of a button. 
			





				Call, Chat or Submit your vehicle online to initiate a conversation with a live experienced buyer.
				
WE CAN PURCHASE YOUR CAR IN ANY STATE!! WHETHER ITS ONE OF OUR MOBILE REPS OR OUR MOBILE TOW SERVICE, WE CAN BUY YOUR CAR!

Common Questions


Why Sell To Us?


Cash For Cars 
Get Top Dollar 
 Get all your questions answered by calling or chatting with a knowledgeable professional Cash for Cars representative. Even if your car  failed smog,  we will buy it. If your  car is wrecked, we will buy it. 
Smog Certificate
 
				California State law says that " The seller is required to provide the 
				buyer with a valid smog inspection certification at the time of the sale or transfer." If your car hasn't been smogged in the last 90 days, then you must go through the hassle of getting the smog certificate to make the sale of your car legal in California. If you don't, then you would be liable for the cost of repairs that the buyer had to pay for to get the car you sold him smogged. When you sell your car to WeBuyCars.com, we handle all DMV paperwork and smog cert, so you don’t have to.
				 We will even buy your car if the title has been lost and if the registration is out of date.

					Jim and Kathy had a great run of luck with their 2004 Toyota Highlander. It was dependable and they had used it for almost everything but now they needed to sell it right away. Jim had taken a job on the East Coast as a sales manager for a large software firm. He was planning to buy a 2013 Lexus LS 450 once they got settled in. They used the Highlander until the day before they needed to move because they figured they could sell it on Craigslist pretty quickly. They placed an ad and two hours later they removed the ad in fear for their lives (just kidding). But they did take the ad down right away because the phone was ringing off the hook. And they hadn't talked to one person who they were comfortable with having come to their house. Jim remembered having seen a television ad for a company called WE BUY CARS. He remembered that they purchased cars really fast and the process seemed really straightforward. He found WeBuyCars.com on the Internet and gave them a call. A friendly, courteous, very knowledgeable buyer was literally on their doorstep two hours later. The buyer inspected the vehicle quickly and 15 minutes later they had a guaranteed company check in hand and were on their way to their new life on the East Coast.

 Misho A.  on   4/9/2016 

 

 Excellent, nice, perfect person for the job. I feel very grateful and happy about the transaction. Mostly about the representative. Thank you thank you thank you very much.
							





 Lynn  on   4/1/2016 

 

 We recently sold a Toyota Camry long distance. The task seemed daunting but was made surprisingly easy, fast and pleasant by WeBuyCars. Guesley in Florida was super patient but also efficient. He was ready to answer any questions about the car and the process. Bruce in New York was a true professional, also personable. René was friendly and very helpful on the the phone. We would strongly recommend this company to anyone who wants to sell a car!
							





 Thomas  on   3/28/2016 

 

 Never having sold a car in this fashion, I was extremely satisfied with Guesley's professionalism, experience and honesty. I was confident that I received the best price for my car. Thank you very much!
							





 Adam  on   4/14/2016 

 

 Professional is what I describe my rep as. They matched our offer and then some. Thanks Heber.
							





 Jason G.  on   4/1/2016 

 

 Very flexible with time, great service friendly, patient. Would recommend the service to anyone.
							





 Megan  on   3/31/2016 

 

 We couldn't be more pleased with our WeBuyCars experience and was even more impressed with your buyer, Bob. We initially had no idea what to expect, what to do, or if we even wanted to sell our car, since this decision was completely on a whim. Bob promptly showed up, chatted with us about our day, gave us the rundown on how WeBuyCars works and was not only extremely helpful with negotiations, but patient with our indecisions. Although we were his last stop for the evening, Bob was genuinely kind, outgoing and made us feel comfortable in whatever decision we made, during however long it took us to decide. WeBuyCars, Bob has upper management written all over him! Give that man a raise! Thanks for all the help Bob!

CarMax store in Raleigh, North Carolina


CarMax is the United States' largest used-car retailer and a Fortune 500 company. The first CarMax location opened in September 1993. As of March 2017, the company had 173 locations.[2] Prior to the first store being built, DeVito/Verdi was hired as the advertising agency and creative resource. The company executed the campaign and additional TV advertisements over the course of a number of years in support of the launch and the initial wave of stores.
Concept[edit]
The concept for CarMax was developed by Circuit City executives under then-CEO Richard L. Sharp. It was developed for nearly a year in 1991, using the code name "Project X", and was also known as "Honest Rick's Used Cars" to those intimately involved in the skunk works team.[3] The concept was actually first proposed by a consultant hired by Circuit City to evaluate possible business opportunities beyond the scope of their consumer electronics locations. While used cars have always been the main business, CarMax purchased the rights to locations from car manufacturers such as Chrysler, Mitsubishi, and Toyota. CarMax also purchased an auto row in Kenosha, Wisconsin that had additional manufacturer franchises, such as Ford, BMW, and Volvo. The first CarMax location opened in September 1993, 1.7 miles (2.7 km) from Circuit City's corporate offices in Richmond, Virginia. As of November 30, 2016, CarMax operated 169 locations across 39 states.[4]
The business model began with no fees, however the model was subsequently abandoned for the current business model after it was determined that customers were not concerned about paying transaction fees for the purchase of a vehicle.
A typical CarMax store is approximately 59,000 square feet (5,500 m2),[5] carries an inventory of 300–400 vehicles, and turns its inventory over eight to ten times a year. On average, a CarMax location employs 40 sales associates. Each car goes through a thorough 125-point inspection process, beyond any state-required inspections, and includes a 30-day warranty and a five-day money back guarantee.[6]
Circuit City issued the first CarMax stock in February 1997, when CarMax had seven locations. Initially, the stock was a tracking stock still under the umbrella of the Circuit City. CarMax officially split from Circuit City as of October 1, 2002, when it was spun off as a stock dividend for Circuit City shareholders, with shares also issued to those holding CarMax tracking stock.
During the 12-month period ending February 28, 2015, the company sold 582,282 used cars.[1] According to the CarMax fiscal year 2009 report released on April 2, 2009, the company opened 11 used car superstores, including superstores in 5 new markets.[7]
CarMax was on Fortune's "100 Best Companies to Work For" list from 2005 to 2016, placing 85th in 2016.[2]

CarMax is the United States' largest used-car retailer and a Fortune 500 company. The first CarMax location opened in September 1993. As of March 2017, the company had 173 locations.[2] Prior to the first store being built, DeVito/Verdi was hired as the advertising agency and creative resource. The company executed the campaign and additional TV advertisements over the course of a number of years in support of the launch and the initial wave of stores.
Concept[edit]
The concept for CarMax was developed by Circuit City executives under then-CEO Richard L. Sharp. It was developed for nearly a year in 1991, using the code name "Project X", and was also known as "Honest Rick's Used Cars" to those intimately involved in the skunk works team.[3] The concept was actually first proposed by a consultant hired by Circuit City to evaluate possible business opportunities beyond the scope of their consumer electronics locations. While used cars have always been the main business, CarMax purchased the rights to locations from car manufacturers such as Chrysler, Mitsubishi, and Toyota. CarMax also purchased an auto row in Kenosha, Wisconsin that had additional manufacturer franchises, such as Ford, BMW, and Volvo. The first CarMax location opened in September 1993, 1.7 miles (2.7 km) from Circuit City's corporate offices in Richmond, Virginia. As of November 30, 2016, CarMax operated 169 locations across 39 states.[4]
The business model began with no fees, however the model was subsequently abandoned for the current business model after it was determined that customers were not concerned about paying transaction fees for the purchase of a vehicle.
A typical CarMax store is approximately 59,000 square feet (5,500 m2),[5] carries an inventory of 300–400 vehicles, and turns its inventory over eight to ten times a year. On average, a CarMax location employs 40 sales associates. Each car goes through a thorough 125-point inspection process, beyond any state-required inspections, and includes a 30-day warranty and a five-day money back guarantee.[6]
Circuit City issued the first CarMax stock in February 1997, when CarMax had seven locations. Initially, the stock was a tracking stock still under the umbrella of the Circuit City. CarMax officially split from Circuit City as of October 1, 2002, when it was spun off as a stock dividend for Circuit City shareholders, with shares also issued to those holding CarMax tracking stock.
During the 12-month period ending February 28, 2015, the company sold 582,282 used cars.[1] According to the CarMax fiscal year 2009 report released on April 2, 2009, the company opened 11 used car superstores, including superstores in 5 new markets.[7]
CarMax was on Fortune's "100 Best Companies to Work For" list from 2005 to 2016, placing 85th in 2016.[2]

CarMax store in Raleigh, North Carolina


CarMax is the United States' largest used-car retailer and a Fortune 500 company. The first CarMax location opened in September 1993. As of March 2017, the company had 173 locations.[2] Prior to the first store being built, DeVito/Verdi was hired as the advertising agency and creative resource. The company executed the campaign and additional TV advertisements over the course of a number of years in support of the launch and the initial wave of stores.
Concept[edit]
The concept for CarMax was developed by Circuit City executives under then-CEO Richard L. Sharp. It was developed for nearly a year in 1991, using the code name "Project X", and was also known as "Honest Rick's Used Cars" to those intimately involved in the skunk works team.[3] The concept was actually first proposed by a consultant hired by Circuit City to evaluate possible business opportunities beyond the scope of their consumer electronics locations. While used cars have always been the main business, CarMax purchased the rights to locations from car manufacturers such as Chrysler, Mitsubishi, and Toyota. CarMax also purchased an auto row in Kenosha, Wisconsin that had additional manufacturer franchises, such as Ford, BMW, and Volvo. The first CarMax location opened in September 1993, 1.7 miles (2.7 km) from Circuit City's corporate offices in Richmond, Virginia. As of November 30, 2016, CarMax operated 169 locations across 39 states.[4]
The business model began with no fees, however the model was subsequently abandoned for the current business model after it was determined that customers were not concerned about paying transaction fees for the purchase of a vehicle.
A typical CarMax store is approximately 59,000 square feet (5,500 m2),[5] carries an inventory of 300–400 vehicles, and turns its inventory over eight to ten times a year. On average, a CarMax location employs 40 sales associates. Each car goes through a thorough 125-point inspection process, beyond any state-required inspections, and includes a 30-day warranty and a five-day money back guarantee.[6]
Circuit City issued the first CarMax stock in February 1997, when CarMax had seven locations. Initially, the stock was a tracking stock still under the umbrella of the Circuit City. CarMax officially split from Circuit City as of October 1, 2002, when it was spun off as a stock dividend for Circuit City shareholders, with shares also issued to those holding CarMax tracking stock.
During the 12-month period ending February 28, 2015, the company sold 582,282 used cars.[1] According to the CarMax fiscal year 2009 report released on April 2, 2009, the company opened 11 used car superstores, including superstores in 5 new markets.[7]
CarMax was on Fortune's "100 Best Companies to Work For" list from 2005 to 2016, placing 85th in 2016.[2]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
