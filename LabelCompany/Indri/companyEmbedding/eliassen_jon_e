The Red Lion Board will immediately initiate a search process and retain a leading executive search firm to assist in identifying the next President and CEO.  The search process will include a full review of internal and external candidates.  Mr. Eliassen will remain a member of the Board through September 30, 2013 in order to facilitate a seamless transition of leadership responsibilities.
"It has been an honor to serve as Red Lion's President and CEO for the last four years, and to have worked with the some of the finest employees and management team in the hotel and hospitality industry," said Mr. Eliassen.  "I have been discussing my retirement with the Board for several months and believe that now is the right time to select a new leader for the next phase of Red Lion's development and growth.  I am committed to ensuring that this transition is seamless for all of Red Lion's stakeholders.  I am leaving the company in excellent hands and I am confident that our strong team will continue to succeed and build on the important progress we have made." 
"On behalf of the Board and everyone at Red Lion, I thank Jon for his leadership, commitment and contributions to this company," said Mel Keating, Chairman of the Board.  "Jon helped put this company on a path to improved results by concentrating our portfolio to strictly hospitality holdings, strengthening the balance sheet, restructuring our operations for improved efficiency across the organization, and paying down debt.  Jon has been a valuable member of our Board and leadership team and we wish him all the best in his retirement."
"We are committed to conducting a thorough and comprehensive search to identify an industry veteran with the skills and experience to continue to grow the company through franchising while improving our hotel operations and profitability," continued Mr. Keating.  "Our Board is confident that Jim Evans is well-qualified to lead Red Lion forward on an interim basis.  With nearly 40 years of hospitality, hotel and brand management expertise, Jim has an unmatched record of driving performance, achieving results, and creating value. Jim has served as a director since last year and he knows our company well."  
Mr. Evans stated, "I will be honored to succeed Jon and lead Red Lion at this time of transition and great opportunity.  I am excited to work closely with the Board, senior leadership team and Red Lion's dedicated and hard-working employees across our destinations.  Red Lion is a special company with a strong brand name and a diverse portfolio of owned-and-operated hotels and franchises throughout western North America.  While the CEO search process is ongoing, I am committed to driving improved operating results, accelerating growth, and further strengthening our sales, marketing, and support services to achieve our goal of 30 franchised hotels by the end of 2013.  The Board and I share in Jon's enthusiasm about Red Lion's opportunities, and I am confident that we will achieve our objectives."

While the CEO search process is ongoing, I am committed to driving improved operating results, accelerating growth, and further strengthening our sales, marketing, and support services to achieve our goal of 30 franchised hotels by the end of 2013.
