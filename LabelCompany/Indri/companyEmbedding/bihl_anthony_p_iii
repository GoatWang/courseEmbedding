Anthony P. Bihl III Named New Bioventus Chief Executive Officer






November 21, 2013 08:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



DURHAM, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bioventus, a leader in active orthopaedic healing, today announced that 
      Anthony P. Bihl III will join the company on Dec. 2, 2013 as its new 
      Chief Executive Officer. Bihl, an experienced healthcare industry 
      executive known for building high-performing teams, driving operational 
      improvements and achieving exceptional financial results, will also 
      serve on the company’s Board of Managers.
    


      “Tony’s strategic aptitude, coupled with his proven track record of 
      producing extraordinary results, made him the perfect choice to lead 
      Bioventus,” said Marty Sutter, Founding Partner and Managing Director of 
      Essex Woodlands, a specialist healthcare growth equity firm and the lead 
      investor in Bioventus. “We’re pleased to have him join the company and 
      are confident he will help propel Bioventus to even greater success.”
    

      “I’m excited for the opportunity to lead Bioventus, a company on the 
      verge of establishing itself as a global biologics leader,” Bihl said. 
      “Although the current healthcare environment is challenging for many 
      companies, Bioventus is in the unique position of leveraging what it has 
      today – proven, market-leading offerings – while aggressively planning 
      for the future, through its development projects and product acquisition 
      strategy. I look forward to working with the Bioventus leadership team 
      to capitalize on these opportunities.”
    

      Bihl, 57, previously served as CEO and President of American Medical 
      Systems (AMS), a publicly-traded diversified supplier of medical devices 
      and pelvic procedures. During his four years with the company, he led 
      its restructuring following a series of acquisitions, strengthened its 
      management team, established a performance-based culture with clear 
      accountability, and achieved revenue growth and grew operating profit. 
      In 2011, Bihl led the company to its successful sale to Endo 
      Pharmaceuticals.
    

      Prior to AMS, Bihl was CEO of Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics, a 
      $2.5 billion division of Siemens AG focused on the in vitro diagnostics 
      (IVD) market. There, he led the formation of the division by 
      successfully integrating two business units involving more than 8,000 
      employees and operations in 100 countries – all while achieving sales 
      growth faster than market growth and exceeding profit targets.
    

      Bihl also served as President of the $1.8 billion diagnostics division 
      of Bayer Healthcare LLC, and as Executive Vice President for Bayer 
      Healthcare LLC. He consistently grew sales for the division and managed 
      the strategic discussions and due diligence that resulted in the 
      division’s acquisition by Siemens for $5.4 billion.
    

      Before joining Bayer, Bihl held management positions at Sterling 
      Diagnostic Imaging and E.I. DuPont.
    

      Bihl currently holds Board seats and provides strategic leadership for 
      Greatbatch Inc., a medical device and components developer and 
      manufacturer; and Spectral Diagnostics Inc., a diagnostics company with 
      the only FDA cleared test for risk of developing severe sepsis.
    

      He holds a Bachelor of Science with distinction degree from Pennsylvania 
      State University.

 About American Medical Systems 
       American Medical Systems, headquartered in Minnetonka, Minnesota, is a        diversified supplier of medical devices and procedures to cure erectile        dysfunction, benign prostatic hyperplasia, incontinence, menorrhagia,        prolapse and other pelvic disorders in men and women. These disorders        can significantly diminish one’s quality of life and profoundly affect        social relationships. In recent years, the number of people seeking        treatment has increased markedly as a result of longer lives, higher        quality-of-life expectations and greater awareness of new treatment        alternatives. American Medical Systems’ products reduce or eliminate the        incapacitating effects of these diseases, often through minimally        invasive therapies. The Company’s products were used to treat        approximately 310,000 patients in 2007.     
       More information about the Company and its products can be found at its        website www.AmericanMedicalSystems.com        and in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2007 and its other        SEC filings.
