Shuttle Valves







click to enlarge
 




The cartridge shuttle valve permits flow from either of two inlet ports to
              a common outlet. Similar to the Kep-O-seal inline version, a free floating
              
              metal ball shuttles according to the relative pressure at the two inlets. The
              higher pressure inlet flows through the valve and moves the ball to close the
              opposite inlet. Kepner's Flexible
                Seal Seat™ ensures bubble-tight
              shutoff of liquid or gas, and long service life. Shuttle valves can also flow
              in the reverse direction, and relieve system pressure when input is removed.
              Standard and specialty valves handle a wide variety of applications, and are
              ideal for use in manifolds, subplates, or cylinder heads.
Features and Benefits:

Flexible
                    Seal Seat™ for zero leak (bubble-tight) seal at closed
                    port
No threaded connections (avoid potential leakage)
Non-biased free floating shuttle ball with short travel path
Minimal pressure differential switching
O-Ring positively secured
Compact, easy installation – Accessory Kepner Holding Device Kits
                  available

Flexible seal seat check valve|Pilot operated check valve|Miniature check valve - High pressure check and relief/check valves





























































 



High Pressure Check and Relief/Check Valves









click to enlarge
 




These inline valves allow free flow in only one direction, prevent backflow,
              and meet the industry's need for higher operating pressures. They also are used for relief and by-pass functions; however, they should not be used as safety relief valves. Kepner's Flexible
                Seal Seat™ combines metal-to-metal contact with a resilient seal
              seat ensuring bubble-tight shutoff of liquid or gas. This is an ideal choice
              for applications that require positive leak-tight sealing and long service
              life at pressures to 6000 PSI. Standard and specialty valves handle a
              wide variety of applications.
Features and Benefits:

Flexible
                    Seal Seat™ for zero leak (bubble-tight) sealing to
                    6000 PSI
O-Ring seal positively secured
Non-pressurized threads
Poppet stop inside valve body prevents spring from bottoming out
Generous flow passages allow full flow with minimal pressure drop
