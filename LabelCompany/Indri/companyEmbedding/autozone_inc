													Replacement Parts

















Don’t let today’s small noise become tomorrow’s big headache. Fix that noisy brake, loud engine or cranky starter, and you could save yourself a bunch of money down the road. Whether you’re dealing with a big problem or a small one, AutoZone’s specific auto parts selection has what you need to get back on the road.

If you’re looking for simple fixes like wipers or light bulbs, we’ve got it. Tune-up items like belts and spark plugs? We’ve got that too. Even if you’re looking at a more serious issue, like a bad battery or malfunctioning starter, we have the best replacement auto parts to get you back on the road.Engine problems can leave you stranded but can sometimes be anticipated. If your car won’t start with a roar but instead clicks when you turn the key, you may need to look at replacing the starter. If you see your headlights pulsing at night, that could be a warning sign for alternator repair. AutoZone keeps a full stock of external engine parts to streamline your do-it-yourself job and avoid a bigger problem later. Keeping up with routine maintenance protects your most important car parts and helps avoid costly or difficult repairs. Hearing a rattling or knocking from under the hood? Probably time to replace the spark plugs. Squeaking, especially in the rain, can let you know a belt needs some attention, and we all know the telltale scrape of worn-out windshield wipers. A quick trip to AutoZone can check these items off your list and keep your car running smoothly.You want to know your car’s lighting is shining brightly every time you drive. AutoZone has the bulbs you need to replace a problematic headlight, signal or brake light and keep you driving safely. If your car won’t rev or a particular electrical system, like the radio, just won’t work right, you may have a problem with the fuses. AutoZone has an unmatched selection of bulbs and fuses to get you the right car part for the job.To find the right auto parts online, enter the year, make and model of your vehicle in the box at the top of this page. You can also freely browse our online auto parts store for car, truck or SUV parts by simply selecting an aftermarket parts category. Our system will help you find the right car or truck parts to get the job done right.

You expect your engine to startup with ease every time you slide into your vehicle. Unfortunately, if your battery, starter or alternator isn’t up to par, chances are your vehicle is going to struggle to fire up quickly. Luckily, AutoZone has every component you need when it comes to your charging system.



Most Popular Parts

Ignition Switch







Battery Cable







Battery Terminal

Solenoid Switch







Voltage Regulator







Relay - Starter







Battery Cable Cover







Battery Tray







There’s a great amount of action that takes place when you turn your key over upon getting into your ride. Your battery must power the starter through a relay, which then uses a gear to manually engage the flywheel to make it turn. Simultaneously, your ignition system receives power and begins to fire the spark plugs – starting the cycle of combustion. Additionally, the battery generates the electricity to power your ignition while your alternator recharges the battery when necessary. Due to this complex process, you should ensure every component is working in top condition to guarantee your vehicle fires up quickly every time you hop into the driver’s seat. AutoZone has every replacement part you may need if you notice a charging system component going awry. 
It’s plain and simple - not every car, truck and SUV is made the same. As a result, we’ve done the leg work to figure out what your year, make and model specifically needs to run its best. Whether you require a Ford F150 starter, battery for Honda Accord or any other product, you can find it at AutoZone. Plus, take advantage of Same Day Store Pickup to start your repair today and be back on the road by tomorrow.

Your vehicle's life support starts with a durable battery. But, if there are problems with your circuits and fuses, your ride still might not be moving after you turn your key. If the current in your wiring becomes dangerously high, a significant electrical issue can arise within your battery, starting a dangerous fire or even causing your wire to dissolve. If your wiring becomes detached or broken, it can cause an unintentional short circuit and a sudden surge of high current that can blow a fuse. Keep your circuits and fuses nice and tidy with AutoZone's upgraded electrical system components.Check out the unbeatable selection of electrical and lighting systems at your local AutoZone or browse our broad assortment online. We provide electrical and lighting systems for your specific make and model, so whether you need lighting for Nissan Altima cars or a Toyota Camry lighting system installed, you're guaranteed to find everything you need when you depend on AutoZone. Enjoy our Same Day Store Pickup when you shop online.

The AutoZone Story
AutoZone's history started with the vision of one man: J.R. "Pitt" Hyde III. After receiving his bachelor's degree in economics from the University of North Carolina, he joined Malone & Hyde, Inc., a wholesale food company founded by his grandfather. Pitt initiated and developed Malone & Hyde's specialty retailing division, beginning with drug stores and expanding to include sporting goods stores and supermarkets. 
Pitt saw a need for a retail automotive parts store to help people with the upkeep of their vehicles so he created Auto Shack. He believed that the characteristics found in supermarkets -  clean, well-organized store, accessible products and great customer service - could be applied to the automotive parts business. In 1979, his vision became a reality.
On July 4, 1979, Auto Shack opened its first store in Forrest City, Arkansas. Doc Crain was the first Auto Shack store manager and sales that day totaled about $300. In 1986, Auto Shack was spun off as a freestanding company of which Pitt served as Chairman and CEO. 
Today, Auto Shack is AutoZone - a Fortune 500 company and the leading auto parts retailer in the United States with more than $8.1 billion in annual sales. 
AutoZone continues to fuel growth by exploring new businesses and entering new markets. In 1996, AutoZone launched a commercial program offering credit and delivery to professional technicians. Later, with the purchase of ALLDATA, AutoZone acquired the nation's leading provider of electronic automotive diagnostic and repair software. In 1998, AutoZone expanded its presence outside the U.S. borders to Mexico, opening our first AutoZone de Mexico store in December 1998. 
AutoZone has come a long way. Today, AutoZone serves customers in 48 states, Mexico and Puerto Rico and employs more than 65,000 employees, referred to as AutoZoners. One of the constant, core foundations to our success has been our strong culture of customer satisfaction. Our Pledge is:

"AutoZoners always put customers first! 
      We know our parts and products. 
      Our stores look great! 
      We've got the best merchandise at the right price." 
AutoZoners do more than simply recite the pledge; they live it every day. 
Our goal is to provide our customers with Trustworthy Advice and real solutions ensuring the customer has What It Takes To Do The Job Right, or better known to AutoZoners as WITTDTJR®. 
We are a diverse, rapidly growing company, and there is one key ingredient that keeps AutoZone on the leading edge of the auto parts industry, it's simply providing WOW! Customer Service. No matter where the business takes us in the future, customer satisfaction will remain our number one priority.

History[edit]
1970s[edit]
Originally a division of Memphis-based wholesale grocer Malone & Hyde, the company was known as Auto Shack. After the sale of the grocery operation to the Fleming Companies of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, the name of the company was changed to AutoZone to reflect the new focus and to settle a lawsuit brought by Tandy Corporation for infringing on Tandy's "Radio Shack" trademark.[5]
On July 4, 1979, the first store opened in Forrest City, Arkansas[6] under the name of Auto Shack.[7] Doc Crain was the store's first manager. Sales that first day totaled $300.00.
1980s[edit]
In 1981, Express Parts or VDP is implemented to get the customers hard to find parts by special ordering them through wholesalers. Total stores was 73 in 7 states.
In 1984, the company became the first auto parts retailer to create a quality control program for its parts. Total stores was 194 in 13 states.
In 1985, Doc Crain coined the term WITTDTJR, which stands for "What it takes to do the job right." Total store count is 263 in 14 states.
By 1986, expansion had made the company grow into a large store chain across the South and the Midwest. That year, Darren Reltherford, manager of Auto Shack's Memphis, Tennessee store, received the first Extra Miler award, which has since been given to AutoZoners who show their dedication to customer satisfaction by "going the extra mile" for customer service. The Duralast line of alternators and starters is released. The Loan-A-Tool program begins allowing customers the ability to borrow specific tools for jobs. The 4th Distribution Center in Greenville, South Carolina opens. Total of stores is 339 in 15 states.

In 1988, Auto Shack officially changed its name to AutoZone.[7] The first AutoZone store was in Enid, Oklahoma. That year also, the company introduced WITT-JR, an electronic catalog used to look up parts and keep warranty information. Total of stores is now 459 in 16 states.
In 1989, the company began using a computerized store management system (SMS). The Duralast battery line is released consisting of Sub-Zero, Desert and long life. Total of stores is 513 in 17 states.
1990s[edit]
In 1991, its stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange using the ticker symbol "AZO." [7] It opened up at $27.50 a share. It was then valued at $1 billion. The 5th DC opens in Lafayette, Louisiana. The company also became the first auto parts retailer to register customer warranties in a computer database.
In 1994, AutoZone began using satellites to facilitate communication between stores and the corporate office. Sales hit $1.5 billion.
In 1995, AutoZone opened its 1,000th store in Louisville, Kentucky. Also, the Duralast trademark made its debut with the Duralast and Duralast Gold batteries. Total of stores is now 1,143 in 26 states.[8]
1996 was the year when the Internet era arrived at the company, when AutoZone opened its company Web site. The new commercial program debuted in Germantown, Tennessee. ALLDATA, a software company based in Elk Grove, California that provides automotive diagnostic and repair information, was acquired.[9]
Pitt Hyde retired as chairman and CEO in 1997.[7] John Adams became the new chairman and CEO.
In 1998,[10][11] AutoZone acquired 112 Auto Palace stores in six states in the northeastern United States,[12][13] 43 TruckPro L.P. stores in 14 states, and 560 Chief Auto Parts Inc. stores in 5 states.[14][15] At the commencement of fiscal 1999, AutoZone made another acquisition by purchasing 100 Express stores from The Pep Boys—Manny, Moe & Jack.[16] The company began a process of internationalization with their first store abroad, which opened in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico.[17] AutoZone closed the 1990s by debuting at the Fortune 500 list in 1999.
2000s[edit]
Steve Odland became AutoZone's third CEO in 2001.[18] AutoZone's Vision and Values are released. Vision: "Relentlessly creating the most exciting Zone for vehicle solutions!"[19] AutoZone's value statements: Integrity, Respect, Teamwork, Communication, Innovation, Initiative, Accountability, Thriftiness, Leadership, Excellence. Also in 2001, AutoZone sold TruckPro to Paratus Capital Management.[20]

In 2002, AutoZone developed a network of "hub, feeder, and satellite" stores to have more product in the market area, while reducing inventory investment. Sales hit $5.33 billion.[21]
In 2003, the Duralast tool line was introduced. This was a year of important negotiations for AutoZone, as the company partnered with other important auto parts industry companies, such as CarMax and Midas. AutoZone de Mexico opens the first DC in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. Total stores number 3,219 in 48 states and 49 in Mexico.[22]
In 2005, William C. Rhodes III was named President and CEO. Steve Odland left to become the Chairman and CEO of Office Depot.[23]

On November 24, 2014, an AutoZone store in Dellwood, Missouri (misidentified in most media reports as being in Ferguson, Missouri) was burned during violent protests. The store was said to have been looted before being set on fire. Nobody was injured in the store. The company later removed all remains of the building and vacated the property.[citation needed]
Corporate affairs[edit]
AutoZone is incorporated in the state of Nevada.
Headquarters[edit]
AutoZone has its headquarters in its J.R. Hyde, III Store Support Center (SSC), a 270,000 square feet (25,000 m2), eight-story building in Downtown Memphis, Tennessee. In October 1995 the company moved into the building.[29] As of 2013 there are over 1,200 employees there.[30]
The project manager of the building's construction was Rob Norcross, a principal at LRK Inc. The building has the capability to withstand a 9.0 magnitude earthquake because it has a special base isolation system that had a price tag of $950,000.[29]
Private labels[edit]
Valucraft, Duralast, and Duralast Gold are AutoZone's private label brands for lead-acid automotive batteries (manufactured by Johnson Controls, East Penn, and other manufacturers). They also sell an AGM line of batteries under the Duralast Platinum name.
Brake pad labels, manufactured primarily by Bosch, include (ranging from least to most expensive):

Duralast - OEM-like performance; semi-metallic or organic.
Duralast Gold - OEM design and performance; semi-metallic or ceramic.
Duralast Max - superior to OEM design and performance; ceramic.

Valucraft and Duralast Gold C-MAX pads are being phased out, as of early 2015.
The Valucraft, Duralast, and Duralast Gold names are used on various other parts and accessories as well.
Retail stores[edit]
Not franchises,[31] AutoZone's 5,800+ retail outlets[6] throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, Mexico and Brazil stock a variety of aftermarket parts.

History[edit]
1970s[edit]
Originally a division of Memphis-based wholesale grocer Malone & Hyde, the company was known as Auto Shack. After the sale of the grocery operation to the Fleming Companies of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, the name of the company was changed to AutoZone to reflect the new focus and to settle a lawsuit brought by Tandy Corporation for infringing on Tandy's "Radio Shack" trademark.[5]
On July 4, 1979, the first store opened in Forrest City, Arkansas[6] under the name of Auto Shack.[7] Doc Crain was the store's first manager. Sales that first day totaled $300.00.
1980s[edit]
In 1981, Express Parts or VDP is implemented to get the customers hard to find parts by special ordering them through wholesalers. Total stores was 73 in 7 states.
In 1984, the company became the first auto parts retailer to create a quality control program for its parts. Total stores was 194 in 13 states.
In 1985, Doc Crain coined the term WITTDTJR, which stands for "What it takes to do the job right." Total store count is 263 in 14 states.
By 1986, expansion had made the company grow into a large store chain across the South and the Midwest. That year, Darren Reltherford, manager of Auto Shack's Memphis, Tennessee store, received the first Extra Miler award, which has since been given to AutoZoners who show their dedication to customer satisfaction by "going the extra mile" for customer service. The Duralast line of alternators and starters is released. The Loan-A-Tool program begins allowing customers the ability to borrow specific tools for jobs. The 4th Distribution Center in Greenville, South Carolina opens. Total of stores is 339 in 15 states.

In 1994, AutoZone began using satellites to facilitate communication between stores and the corporate office. Sales hit $1.5 billion.
In 1995, AutoZone opened its 1,000th store in Louisville, Kentucky. Also, the Duralast trademark made its debut with the Duralast and Duralast Gold batteries. Total of stores is now 1,143 in 26 states.[8]
1996 was the year when the Internet era arrived at the company, when AutoZone opened its company Web site. The new commercial program debuted in Germantown, Tennessee. ALLDATA, a software company based in Elk Grove, California that provides automotive diagnostic and repair information, was acquired.[9]
Pitt Hyde retired as chairman and CEO in 1997.[7] John Adams became the new chairman and CEO.
In 1998,[10][11] AutoZone acquired 112 Auto Palace stores in six states in the northeastern United States,[12][13] 43 TruckPro L.P. stores in 14 states, and 560 Chief Auto Parts Inc. stores in 5 states.[14][15] At the commencement of fiscal 1999, AutoZone made another acquisition by purchasing 100 Express stores from The Pep Boys—Manny, Moe & Jack.[16] The company began a process of internationalization with their first store abroad, which opened in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico.[17] AutoZone closed the 1990s by debuting at the Fortune 500 list in 1999.
2000s[edit]
Steve Odland became AutoZone's third CEO in 2001.[18] AutoZone's Vision and Values are released. Vision: "Relentlessly creating the most exciting Zone for vehicle solutions!"[19] AutoZone's value statements: Integrity, Respect, Teamwork, Communication, Innovation, Initiative, Accountability, Thriftiness, Leadership, Excellence. Also in 2001, AutoZone sold TruckPro to Paratus Capital Management.[20]

The project manager of the building's construction was Rob Norcross, a principal at LRK Inc. The building has the capability to withstand a 9.0 magnitude earthquake because it has a special base isolation system that had a price tag of $950,000.[29]

Corporate affairs[edit]
AutoZone is incorporated in the state of Nevada.
Headquarters[edit]
AutoZone has its headquarters in its J.R. Hyde, III Store Support Center (SSC), a 270,000 square feet (25,000 m2), eight-story building in Downtown Memphis, Tennessee. In October 1995 the company moved into the building.[29] As of 2013 there are over 1,200 employees there.[30]
The project manager of the building's construction was Rob Norcross, a principal at LRK Inc. The building has the capability to withstand a 9.0 magnitude earthquake because it has a special base isolation system that had a price tag of $950,000.[29]
Private labels[edit]
Valucraft, Duralast, and Duralast Gold are AutoZone's private label brands for lead-acid automotive batteries (manufactured by Johnson Controls, East Penn, and other manufacturers). They also sell an AGM line of batteries under the Duralast Platinum name.
Brake pad labels, manufactured primarily by Bosch, include (ranging from least to most expensive):

Duralast - OEM-like performance; semi-metallic or organic.
Duralast Gold - OEM design and performance; semi-metallic or ceramic.
Duralast Max - superior to OEM design and performance; ceramic.

Valucraft and Duralast Gold C-MAX pads are being phased out, as of early 2015.
The Valucraft, Duralast, and Duralast Gold names are used on various other parts and accessories as well.
Retail stores[edit]
Not franchises,[31] AutoZone's 5,800+ retail outlets[6] throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, Mexico and Brazil stock a variety of aftermarket parts.
Sponsorships[edit]

History[edit]
1970s[edit]
Originally a division of Memphis-based wholesale grocer Malone & Hyde, the company was known as Auto Shack. After the sale of the grocery operation to the Fleming Companies of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, the name of the company was changed to AutoZone to reflect the new focus and to settle a lawsuit brought by Tandy Corporation for infringing on Tandy's "Radio Shack" trademark.[5]
On July 4, 1979, the first store opened in Forrest City, Arkansas[6] under the name of Auto Shack.[7] Doc Crain was the store's first manager. Sales that first day totaled $300.00.
1980s[edit]
In 1981, Express Parts or VDP is implemented to get the customers hard to find parts by special ordering them through wholesalers. Total stores was 73 in 7 states.
In 1984, the company became the first auto parts retailer to create a quality control program for its parts. Total stores was 194 in 13 states.
In 1985, Doc Crain coined the term WITTDTJR, which stands for "What it takes to do the job right." Total store count is 263 in 14 states.
By 1986, expansion had made the company grow into a large store chain across the South and the Midwest. That year, Darren Reltherford, manager of Auto Shack's Memphis, Tennessee store, received the first Extra Miler award, which has since been given to AutoZoners who show their dedication to customer satisfaction by "going the extra mile" for customer service. The Duralast line of alternators and starters is released. The Loan-A-Tool program begins allowing customers the ability to borrow specific tools for jobs. The 4th Distribution Center in Greenville, South Carolina opens. Total of stores is 339 in 15 states.

In 1988, Auto Shack officially changed its name to AutoZone.[7] The first AutoZone store was in Enid, Oklahoma. That year also, the company introduced WITT-JR, an electronic catalog used to look up parts and keep warranty information. Total of stores is now 459 in 16 states.
In 1989, the company began using a computerized store management system (SMS). The Duralast battery line is released consisting of Sub-Zero, Desert and long life. Total of stores is 513 in 17 states.
1990s[edit]
In 1991, its stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange using the ticker symbol "AZO." [7] It opened up at $27.50 a share. It was then valued at $1 billion. The 5th DC opens in Lafayette, Louisiana. The company also became the first auto parts retailer to register customer warranties in a computer database.
In 1994, AutoZone began using satellites to facilitate communication between stores and the corporate office. Sales hit $1.5 billion.
In 1995, AutoZone opened its 1,000th store in Louisville, Kentucky. Also, the Duralast trademark made its debut with the Duralast and Duralast Gold batteries. Total of stores is now 1,143 in 26 states.[8]
1996 was the year when the Internet era arrived at the company, when AutoZone opened its company Web site. The new commercial program debuted in Germantown, Tennessee. ALLDATA, a software company based in Elk Grove, California that provides automotive diagnostic and repair information, was acquired.[9]
Pitt Hyde retired as chairman and CEO in 1997.[7] John Adams became the new chairman and CEO.
In 1998,[10][11] AutoZone acquired 112 Auto Palace stores in six states in the northeastern United States,[12][13] 43 TruckPro L.P. stores in 14 states, and 560 Chief Auto Parts Inc. stores in 5 states.[14][15] At the commencement of fiscal 1999, AutoZone made another acquisition by purchasing 100 Express stores from The Pep Boys—Manny, Moe & Jack.[16] The company began a process of internationalization with their first store abroad, which opened in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico.[17] AutoZone closed the 1990s by debuting at the Fortune 500 list in 1999.
2000s[edit]
Steve Odland became AutoZone's third CEO in 2001.[18] AutoZone's Vision and Values are released. Vision: "Relentlessly creating the most exciting Zone for vehicle solutions!"[19] AutoZone's value statements: Integrity, Respect, Teamwork, Communication, Innovation, Initiative, Accountability, Thriftiness, Leadership, Excellence. Also in 2001, AutoZone sold TruckPro to Paratus Capital Management.[20]

In 2002, AutoZone developed a network of "hub, feeder, and satellite" stores to have more product in the market area, while reducing inventory investment. Sales hit $5.33 billion.[21]
In 2003, the Duralast tool line was introduced. This was a year of important negotiations for AutoZone, as the company partnered with other important auto parts industry companies, such as CarMax and Midas. AutoZone de Mexico opens the first DC in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. Total stores number 3,219 in 48 states and 49 in Mexico.[22]
In 2005, William C. Rhodes III was named President and CEO. Steve Odland left to become the Chairman and CEO of Office Depot.[23]

History[edit]
1970s[edit]
Originally a division of Memphis-based wholesale grocer Malone & Hyde, the company was known as Auto Shack. After the sale of the grocery operation to the Fleming Companies of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, the name of the company was changed to AutoZone to reflect the new focus and to settle a lawsuit brought by Tandy Corporation for infringing on Tandy's "Radio Shack" trademark.[5]
On July 4, 1979, the first store opened in Forrest City, Arkansas[6] under the name of Auto Shack.[7] Doc Crain was the store's first manager. Sales that first day totaled $300.00.
1980s[edit]
In 1981, Express Parts or VDP is implemented to get the customers hard to find parts by special ordering them through wholesalers. Total stores was 73 in 7 states.
In 1984, the company became the first auto parts retailer to create a quality control program for its parts. Total stores was 194 in 13 states.
In 1985, Doc Crain coined the term WITTDTJR, which stands for "What it takes to do the job right." Total store count is 263 in 14 states.
By 1986, expansion had made the company grow into a large store chain across the South and the Midwest. That year, Darren Reltherford, manager of Auto Shack's Memphis, Tennessee store, received the first Extra Miler award, which has since been given to AutoZoners who show their dedication to customer satisfaction by "going the extra mile" for customer service. The Duralast line of alternators and starters is released. The Loan-A-Tool program begins allowing customers the ability to borrow specific tools for jobs. The 4th Distribution Center in Greenville, South Carolina opens. Total of stores is 339 in 15 states.

In 1994, AutoZone began using satellites to facilitate communication between stores and the corporate office. Sales hit $1.5 billion.
In 1995, AutoZone opened its 1,000th store in Louisville, Kentucky. Also, the Duralast trademark made its debut with the Duralast and Duralast Gold batteries. Total of stores is now 1,143 in 26 states.[8]

ALLDATA, a software company based in Elk Grove, California that provides automotive diagnostic and repair information, was acquired.[9]
Pitt Hyde retired as chairman and CEO in 1997.[7] John Adams became the new chairman and CEO.
In 1998,[10][11] AutoZone acquired 112 Auto Palace stores in six states in the northeastern United States,[12][13] 43 TruckPro L.P. stores in 14 states, and 560 Chief Auto Parts Inc. stores in 5 states.[14][15] At the commencement of fiscal 1999, AutoZone made another acquisition by purchasing 100 Express stores from The Pep Boys—Manny, Moe & Jack.[16] The company began a process of internationalization with their first store abroad, which opened in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico.[17] AutoZone closed the 1990s by debuting at the Fortune 500 list in 1999.
2000s[edit]
Steve Odland became AutoZone's third CEO in 2001.[18] AutoZone's Vision and Values are released. Vision: "Relentlessly creating the most exciting Zone for vehicle solutions!"[19] AutoZone's value statements: Integrity, Respect, Teamwork, Communication, Innovation, Initiative, Accountability, Thriftiness, Leadership, Excellence. Also in 2001, AutoZone sold TruckPro to Paratus Capital Management.[20]

The project manager of the building's construction was Rob Norcross, a principal at LRK Inc. The building has the capability to withstand a 9.0 magnitude earthquake because it has a special base isolation system that had a price tag of $950,000.[29]

Corporate affairs[edit]
AutoZone is incorporated in the state of Nevada.
Headquarters[edit]
AutoZone has its headquarters in its J.R. Hyde, III Store Support Center (SSC), a 270,000 square feet (25,000 m2), eight-story building in Downtown Memphis, Tennessee. In October 1995 the company moved into the building.[29] As of 2013 there are over 1,200 employees there.[30]
The project manager of the building's construction was Rob Norcross, a principal at LRK Inc. The building has the capability to withstand a 9.0 magnitude earthquake because it has a special base isolation system that had a price tag of $950,000.[29]
Private labels[edit]
Valucraft, Duralast, and Duralast Gold are AutoZone's private label brands for lead-acid automotive batteries (manufactured by Johnson Controls, East Penn, and other manufacturers). They also sell an AGM line of batteries under the Duralast Platinum name.
Brake pad labels, manufactured primarily by Bosch, include (ranging from least to most expensive):

Duralast - OEM-like performance; semi-metallic or organic.
Duralast Gold - OEM design and performance; semi-metallic or ceramic.
Duralast Max - superior to OEM design and performance; ceramic.

Valucraft and Duralast Gold C-MAX pads are being phased out, as of early 2015.
The Valucraft, Duralast, and Duralast Gold names are used on various other parts and accessories as well.
Retail stores[edit]
Not franchises,[31] AutoZone's 5,800+ retail outlets[6] throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, Mexico and Brazil stock a variety of aftermarket parts.
Sponsorships[edit]

AutoZone holds the naming rights to the downtown Memphis baseball stadium that is the home of the Memphis Redbirds of the Pacific Coast League. The company also sponsors the AutoZone Liberty Bowl.[when?][citation needed]
In 2004, AutoZone celebrated its 25th anniversary and announced a corporate sponsorship agreement with auto racing association NASCAR. In addition, founder J.R. "Pitt" Hyde III was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame. Pitt Hyde set a precedent as the first aftermarket retailer in the Automotive Hall of Fame.[citation needed]
In 2007, AutoZone sponsored Kevin Harvick and Timothy Peters in the NASCAR Busch Series.[citation needed]

													Replacement Parts

















Don’t let today’s small noise become tomorrow’s big headache. Fix that noisy brake, loud engine or cranky starter, and you could save yourself a bunch of money down the road. Whether you’re dealing with a big problem or a small one, AutoZone’s specific auto parts selection has what you need to get back on the road.

If you’re looking for simple fixes like wipers or light bulbs, we’ve got it. Tune-up items like belts and spark plugs? We’ve got that too. Even if you’re looking at a more serious issue, like a bad battery or malfunctioning starter, we have the best replacement auto parts to get you back on the road.Engine problems can leave you stranded but can sometimes be anticipated. If your car won’t start with a roar but instead clicks when you turn the key, you may need to look at replacing the starter. If you see your headlights pulsing at night, that could be a warning sign for alternator repair. AutoZone keeps a full stock of external engine parts to streamline your do-it-yourself job and avoid a bigger problem later. Keeping up with routine maintenance protects your most important car parts and helps avoid costly or difficult repairs. Hearing a rattling or knocking from under the hood? Probably time to replace the spark plugs. Squeaking, especially in the rain, can let you know a belt needs some attention, and we all know the telltale scrape of worn-out windshield wipers. A quick trip to AutoZone can check these items off your list and keep your car running smoothly.You want to know your car’s lighting is shining brightly every time you drive. AutoZone has the bulbs you need to replace a problematic headlight, signal or brake light and keep you driving safely. If your car won’t rev or a particular electrical system, like the radio, just won’t work right, you may have a problem with the fuses. AutoZone has an unmatched selection of bulbs and fuses to get you the right car part for the job.To find the right auto parts online, enter the year, make and model of your vehicle in the box at the top of this page. You can also freely browse our online auto parts store for car, truck or SUV parts by simply selecting an aftermarket parts category. Our system will help you find the right car or truck parts to get the job done right.
