Title: Audit
               Company: Bryn Mawr Film Institute
Job Details
               Bryn Mawr Film Institute (BMFI) is a non-profit community theater founded in 2002 by the region's academic, business, and civic leaders. The Mission of BMFI is to strengthen our community by providing the opportunity for diverse segments to meet, learn, share ideas, and develop talents and understanding through the catalyst of film.  The idea of the Institute took shape over several years and was made concrete in December 2004 when BMFI succeeded in purchasing the derelict Bryn Mawr Theater building at 822-26 West Lancaster Avenue in the heart of Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.  Working under a very tight schedule, the projection and sound equipment were upgraded, heating and electrical systems were made code-compliant, and the lobby was refurbished. The theater re-opened to the public on March 12, 2005 with Sir Ben Kingsley cutting the "ribbon" of 35mm film.  Sir Ben spoke eloquently of cinema as a "tribal mechanism by which we communicate profound aspects of humanity," and described Juliet Goodfriend, President of the Bryn Mawr Film Institute, as "a defender of the primitive right to tell stories." Kingsley said that storytelling began around the flickering light of fire, and that now great stories of every era, genre, and culture would be flickering across the screens of the Bryn Mawr Film Institute.  And right he was. The BMFI shows the best in independent, documentary, art, and repertory films. These fine films form the nucleus around which the community development and educational programs of the Institute revolve.
