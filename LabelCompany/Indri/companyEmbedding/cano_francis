			Dr. Cano was appointed to our Board in November 2009. Dr. Cano has been President and Founder of Cano Biotech Corp., a consulting firm focusing on the vaccine business, since 1996 and also serves on the board of Biomerica, Inc., a developer and manufacturer of diagnostic products. Previously, Dr. Cano served on the board of Arbor Vita Corporation, a biopharmaceutical company. From 1993 to 1996, Dr. Cano was President and Chief Operating Officer for Aviron, a biopharmaceutical company, which was later acquired by MedImmune in 2001. As a Co-Founder of Aviron, he completed two rounds of venture financing, a licensing agreement with SmithKline Biologicals and in-licensed Flu-Mist influenza vaccine from the National Institutes of Health. For 21 years, Dr. Cano worked with the Lederle Laboratories Division of American Cyanamid, including as its Vice President and General Manager of the Biologicals unit. The Board believes that Dr. Cano's experience as a founder of and advisor to established vaccine businesses provides significant insights for the strategy of the Company with respect to key technical and operational issues in vaccine development and qualifies him to serve as a director. He earned a Ph.D. in Microbiology from Pennsylvania State University, served as a Research Associate at Rutgers Institute of Microbiology, and holds a M.S. in Microbiology and a B.S. in Biology from St. John's University.
