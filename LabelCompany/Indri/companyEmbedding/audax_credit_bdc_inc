FICO


FICO® Scores are developed by Fair Isaac Corporation. The FICO Score provided by ConsumerInfo.com, Inc., also referred to as Experian Consumer Services ("ECS"), in Experian CreditWorksSM, Credit TrackerSM and/or your free Experian membership (as applicable) is based on FICO Score 8, unless otherwise noted. Many but not all lenders use FICO Score 8.
In addition to the FICO Score 8, ECS may offer and provide other base or industry-specific FICO Scores (such as FICO Auto Scores and FICO Bankcard Scores). The other FICO Scores made available are calculated from versions of the base and industry-specific FICO Score models. There are many different credit scoring models that can give a different assessment of your credit rating and relative risk (risk of default) for the same credit report. Your lender or insurer may use a different FICO Score than FICO Score 8 or such other base or industry-specific FICO Score, or another type of credit score altogether. Just remember that your credit rating is often the same even if the number is not.
For some consumers, however, the credit rating of FICO Score 8 (or other FICO Score) could vary from the score used by your lender. The statements that "90% of top lenders use FICO Scores" and "FICO Scores are used in 90% of credit decisions" are based on a third-party study of all versions of FICO Scores sold to lenders, including but not limited to scores based on FICO Score 8. Base FICO Scores (including the FICO Score 8) range from 300 to 850. Industry-specific FICO Scores range from 250-900. Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you'll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders. A lower FICO Score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk.
There are three different major credit reporting agencies — the Experian credit bureau, TransUnion® and Equifax® — that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit report. Your FICO Score is based on the information in your credit report at the time it is requested. Your credit report information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies. So your FICO Score can vary if the information they have on file for you is different. Since the information in your report can change over time, your FICO Score may also change.

  The Good



  Superior online tools



	Experian offers several valuable tools that make viewing and monitoring your credit information simple and easy. You can view your Experian credit report in addition to reports from the other two major credit bureaus. There is also an online dispute tool available so you can quickly fix any errors you notice in your credit report. Another useful feature is the score estimator tool, which enables you to see how certain financial decisions will affect your Experian credit score. If you believe you’ve been the victim of identity fraud, you can place a security freeze on your credit reports, preventing creditors from giving out your information without your consent.




  Access to all types of credit reports



	Through Experian, you can access all three bureau credit reports for a single, flat rate. You can also purchase your Experian credit report and score separately if you aren’t interested in your Equifax and TransUnion reports.




  Offers business-specific services



	Experian is one of the very few companies in the industry that offers business-specific credit reports and credit monitoring. The only other companies that offer these services are Equifax and TransUnion. In addition to viewing your Experian credit score, you also get access to scores and reports from the other major credit agencies. Just as with the credit monitoring for personal use, you can dispute errors in your Experian credit report quickly and easily. They also offer marketing tools to assist you in finding more qualified leads and tools to help you manage your customer portfolio.




  Exemplary learning materials



	Experian’s Credit Education knowledge base is a great place to start if you’re interested in learning more about your credit scores and reports. You’ll find articles about the different factors affecting your credit score and overall creditworthiness, as well as information about preventing identity fraud. Experian also has a blog dedicated to credit-related topics, which you can subscribe to for ongoing content. Video tutorials are another option to get you up to speed on how the credit reporting process works, with topics including how to file a dispute and establish good credit.




  The Bad



  No access to FICO score



	While Experian does well in offering Equifax, TransUnion, and even VantageScores, along with its own Experian credit score, one major omission from their offerings is FICO scores. These scores are extremely important because they are what lenders most often use to determine creditworthiness. Although the VantageScore serves a similar function, it is less widely used. Experian is not the only company that doesn’t offer a FICO score, but since this is a very important feature for some, it would be a great addition.




  Questionable marketing practices



	Experian owns several credit score websites, including FreeCreditReport.com and FreeCreditScore.com, among others. Through these websites, you can access your Experian credit report without paying. The catch, however, is doing so enrolls you in a seven-day trial membership to the site which you must cancel within the first week; otherwise, you’ll be charged $14.99 to $19.99 per month. While the Experian credit score and report are essentially free as long as you cancel the account, the advertising techniques are certainly questionable to some.

Credit Score basics






What is a Credit Score?
A Credit Score is a number lenders use to help decide how likely it is that they will be repaid on time if they give a person a loan or a credit card. Your FICO Score 8 ranges from 300 to 850 and is based on calculated factors from information in your credit report.


Why does a Credit Score matter?
Credit Scores represent the risk that lenders use in the repayment of consumer debt. Based on your risk level, a Credit Score can help determine if you qualify for a loan and mean the difference in hundreds or thousands in savings based on the interest rate offered.






What types of information can negatively impact a Credit Score?
There are many things that can potentially negatively impact a Credit Score, but include the number and severity of payments, the type and number of accounts along with their age, total debt, and public records such as bankruptcy, tax liens, and civil judgments.


What is a good Credit Score?
A FICO Score between 670 and 739 is considered to be good and is within the median score range. A FICO Score above 800 indicates an exceptional score and consumers in this range may have more favorable terms and an easier approval process with new credit.

FICO


FICO® Scores are developed by Fair Isaac Corporation. The FICO Score provided by ConsumerInfo.com, Inc., also referred to as Experian Consumer Services ("ECS"), in Experian CreditWorksSM, Credit TrackerSM and/or your free Experian membership (as applicable) is based on FICO Score 8, unless otherwise noted. Many but not all lenders use FICO Score 8.
In addition to the FICO Score 8, ECS may offer and provide other base or industry-specific FICO Scores (such as FICO Auto Scores and FICO Bankcard Scores). The other FICO Scores made available are calculated from versions of the base and industry-specific FICO Score models. There are many different credit scoring models that can give a different assessment of your credit rating and relative risk (risk of default) for the same credit report. Your lender or insurer may use a different FICO Score than FICO Score 8 or such other base or industry-specific FICO Score, or another type of credit score altogether. Just remember that your credit rating is often the same even if the number is not.
For some consumers, however, the credit rating of FICO Score 8 (or other FICO Score) could vary from the score used by your lender. The statements that "90% of top lenders use FICO Scores" and "FICO Scores are used in 90% of credit decisions" are based on a third-party study of all versions of FICO Scores sold to lenders, including but not limited to scores based on FICO Score 8. Base FICO Scores (including the FICO Score 8) range from 300 to 850. Industry-specific FICO Scores range from 250-900. Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you'll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders. A lower FICO Score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk.
There are three different major credit reporting agencies — the Experian credit bureau, TransUnion® and Equifax® — that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit report. Your FICO Score is based on the information in your credit report at the time it is requested. Your credit report information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies. So your FICO Score can vary if the information they have on file for you is different. Since the information in your report can change over time, your FICO Score may also change.
