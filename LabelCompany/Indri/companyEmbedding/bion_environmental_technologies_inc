Excess Nutrients - Bion Environmental Technologies













































































Proven Comprehensive Treatment and Resource Recovery for Livestock Waste
cleaner farms…cleaner water…cleaner air…better economics



































Excess Nutrients





Excess nutrients – nitrogen and phosphorus – lead to toxic algal blooms and dead zones in our lakes and coastal waters, poor water quality in our rivers and streams, and groundwater contamination. Severe impacts to water quality can be seen in most major U.S. watersheds, notably the Chesapeake Bay, Great Lakes and the Mississippi River Basin/Gulf of Mexico.
  




Nutrients come from a variety of sources: point sources, that are closely regulated, such as municipal sewage treatment, power plants and industrial facilities; and non-point sources that are subject to much less (if any) regulation, such as storm water runoff and agriculture. Learn more about nutrients on the EPA’s website.
Nine million dairy cows, 80 million beef cattle, 62 million swine and billions of poultry in the U.S. produce more than 100 times more organic waste than humans; but where human waste makes its way to a septic tank or sewage treatment plant, livestock waste is usually spread untreated on the ground for its fertilizer value.





These nutrients often overwhelm the crops’ and surrounding environment’s ability to absorb them and runoff to contaminate local ground- and fresh- water resources, as well as downstream lakes and coastal estuaries. Runoff from livestock waste has been identified as one of the largest sources of excess nutrients in most major watersheds. We have recently realized that the greatest source of nutrients from livestock is from ammonia that volatizes from the waste. This ammonia is highly volatile and redeposits everywhere – forests and fields, rivers and lakes, parking lots and rooftops – where it is picked up in runoff.
According to the US EPA’s National Rivers and Streams Assessment 2008-2009, over 55 percent of our nations rivers and streams are in poor biological health, the most widespread problem being nitrogen and phosphorus. Weed-choked waterways, fish kills, loss of aquatic insects that are a critical part of the food chain, and loss of overall biodiversity are all symptoms of excess nutrients. US EPA considers excess nutrients “one of America’s most widespread, costly and challenging environmental problems”. A 2015 Veolia and International Food and Policy Research report draws a similar conclusion on a global basis.




The Chesapeake Bay is one of the most nutrient-polluted estuaries in the United States, mostly due to nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment runoff from agriculture. The Bay has suffered steep declines of oyster, crab and fish populations, reduced visibility and underwater grasses, and annual dead zones.





The Chesapeake Bay suffering a severe algal bloom near Hampton Roads, Virginia, in August, 2009. (Virginia Pilot)




The Chesapeake is also one of the most closely monitored and studied watersheds in the country. In 2009, after many years of failed voluntary programs, the US EPA implemented watershed-wide regulation (TMDL – total maximum daily load) under Executive Order, requiring substantial reductions of nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment from the six Bay states and Washington, D.C.
Environmental and economic studies of the Chesapeake Bay demonstrate that a successful and affordable nutrient control strategy must address agriculture and livestock waste, as it must in most nutrient-impaired watersheds in the U.S. The strategies and policies now being developed to restore water quality in the Chesapeake Bay will create a model that can be adopted by the more than 30 states facing tremendous costs to reduce excess nutrients.








Great Lakes









In August 2014, the city of Toledo, Ohio, was unable to deliver drinking water for five days when a toxic algal bloom (microcystin), fueled by nutrient-laden runoff, developed around the intakes of their drinking water plant on Lake Erie. (NASA)






Gulf of Mexico









Every year, from the mouth of the Mississippi River, a dead zone forms in the Gulf of Mexico, caused by the decomposition of algal blooms created by the spring runoff. Averaging 6,000 square miles, marine life that depends on oxygen must flee or die. (NASA)

Benefits - Bion Environmental Technologies








































































Proven Comprehensive Treatment and Resource Recovery for Livestock Waste

Benefits





Direct treatment of livestock waste, while it is still concentrated and before it has a chance to contaminate downstream ecosystems, can save U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars in annual costs to clean up the Chesapeake Bay, Great Lakes and Mississippi River Basin, and in the many smaller watersheds where excess nutrients are an issue. Moreover, the low-cost improvements available at our largest livestock production facilities represent high-impact solutions that can help speed the recovery of these watersheds.
Our traditional clean water strategy that focuses spending on downstream ‘point sources’ is no longer up to the task of maintaining water quality: up or downstream. A new strategy that addresses all of the pollution sources in the watershed will greatly improve water quality and ecosystem health throughout the watershed, accelerate cleanup, and reduce costs.
A 2014 study by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, The Economic Benefits of Cleaning Up the Chesapeake Bay, estimated the value of the land and waters of the Bay region, prior to implementation of the 2010 TMDL, at $107.2 billion annually. Further, the study estimated that a cleaned up Bay would be valued at $129.7 billion annually. Comparable or larger numbers could be expected for the Great Lakes and Mississippi River Basin, although those studies have not been done.




 
The Bay’s declining grass beds are a bellwether of its health and provide critical habitat for the iconic blue crab and several species of fish. Improved water quality will allow the beds to return to historic levels. 





Treating livestock waste at its source promotes environmental health throughout the watershed and generates a wide range of benefits to local ecosystems and communities that cannot be achieved through more difficult and dilute downstream treatment. 

Reducing nutrient runoff to surface and ground water can avoid future costs to treat drinking water. High nitrate levels in drinking water can lead to “blue baby” syndrome that in infants reduces the blood’s capacity to carry oxygen. Pregnant women are also at risk from elevated nitrates and some health studies suggest that higher levels can lead to formation of cancer-causing substances in adults. Elevated nitrate levels in aquifers and water wells have become a growing problem in several states with livestock production.
Frequent waste collection followed by advanced treatment dramatically reduces ammonia, greenhouse gases and other air emissions. Livestock production is the largest source of ammonia in the U.S. and the world. Ammonia contributes to the formation of PM2.5, fine inhalable particulate air pollution that poses significant health risks for heart and lung disease, especially in the young and elderly. Ammonia also adds to both groundwater contamination, as well as surface runoff, through atmospheric deposition of nitrogen that is then picked up in stormwater runoff.
Direct treatment can largely eliminate pathogens in the waste stream. Outbreaks of food-borne illness, often fatal, are regularly traced back to contamination from livestock waste used to fertilize crops. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria due to overuse in livestock production is a widely and hotly-debated issue. Several recent studies have demonstrated an increased incidence of MRSA and other antibiotic-resistant bacteria in humans that live near fields that have been treated with both raw swine and dairy manure. Increased hormone levels that interfere with fish reproduction have been found in several Pennsylvania rivers; higher hormone levels and their impacts have been linked to runoff from livestock waste.
Treating livestock waste at its source isn’t just common sense – it makes economic sense:

Substantially reduced clean water compliance costs to the tax payer
Avoidance of future costs to pre-treat drinking water due to nitrate contamination
Improved water quality and ecosystem health throughout the watershed
Increased economic activity and improved quality of life in “upstream” rural communities














The Chesapeake Bay provides habitat that supports a wide variety birds, fish, mammals, amphibians and reptiles. Improved water quality promotes biodiversity that is key to ecosystem health.











Striped bass are a mainstay of the Bay’s commercial and recreational fishing industries. Their populations have suffered steep declines as a result of reduced water quality and habitat loss.











Oysters, another iconic Bay species, have also suffered steep population declines. Oysters are an important part of the Bay’s commercial fishery and play a critical role in the Bay ecosystem.











Water quality has a significant impact on waterfront property values and tourism.











From recreational opportunities and a better quality of life to increased business and employment activity, improved ecosystem health provides a wide and diverse range of benefits.

Technology





For more information on Bion’s technology platform click here.
Beginning in September 2014, Bion began filing patents on its 3rd generation (3G) technology, designed to recover substantially more value from the waste stream, while maintaining or enhancing the platform’s treatment capabilities. In September 2015, a second patent was filed. To learn more about the 3G platform, please review the following press releases:

Bion’s Next-Gen Technology To Unlock Greater Value From Livestock Waste Stream
Bion Files Patent on Process to Recover Nitrogen Fertilizer from Waste
Bion Files Patent on Next-Generation Technology Platform

Bion’s 2nd generation (2G) Comprehensive Environmental Management System removes up to 95% of the nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) from the livestock waste effluent and substantially reduces air emissions, including ammonia (as great as 90% or more), greenhouse gases, hydrogen sulfide, VOC’s and others. The system extracts renewable energy from the waste stream in the form of cellulosic biomass. The technology is patented, proven at commercial scale, and is quickly gaining acceptance from regulatory and other stakeholders.
Bion’s core 2G technology is a biological process that facilitates the growth of large populations of naturally-occurring bacteria that are responsible for the conversion of the nitrogen and phosphorus in the waste stream. Some of the nitrogen is released to the atmosphere in the form of harmless and inert nitrogen gas (N2). Most of the remaining nitrogen, as well as phosphorus, is converted by the bacteria into solid or particulate forms that are removable by centrifuge and other processes. Bion’s technology achieves 75 to 80% reductions of nutrients in the effluent; further treatment can increase the reductions to up to 95%. The system provides an expected pathogen reduction of three to nine orders of magnitude (three to nine log kill) depending upon the level of nutrient treatment employed at a particular site.

Bion Environmental Technologies, Inc.
 






Bion Environmental Technologies has provided environmental treatment solutions to the agriculture and livestock industry. Bion`s patented next-generation technology provides a unique comprehensive treatment of livestock waste that achieves substantial reductions in nitrogen and phosphorus, ammonia, greenhouse and other gases, as well as pathogens, hormones, herbicides and pesticides. Bion`s process simultaneously recovers cellulosic biomass from the waste stream to produce renewable energy.<br><br>

Bion`s technology enables development of large scale livestock facilities in strategic locations that provide greater efficiencies and dramatically reduced transportation costs but were previously impracticable due to their environmental impact. These environmentally-responsible large scale facilities can be integrated with existing or new food processing and renewable energy production operations to substantially reduce risk and improve the economics of all partners.

                        About Us
                    


Bion's patented and proven technology platform largely eliminates the air and water pollution associated with livestock waste and simultaneously recovers significantly more renewable energy from the waste biomass than other technologies that seek to exploit this energy source. It is the ONLY technology that provides a comprehensive solution to the environmental impacts of livestock waste; it is now gaining acceptance by the US EPA and state regulatory agencies as an effective solution to one of the greatest and most immediate environmental problems in the US and world today.Bion Services Group provides waste remediation and renewable energy production to existing livestock operations. Bion is currently focused on the Chesapeake Bay, where states that contribute excess nutrients to the Bay are being forced to reduce them under the Chesapeake Bay Program. Faced with a $1.4 billion price tag to upgrade its municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWTPs), Pennsylvania developed a nutrient trading program to help them comply with their obligations under the Program. PA MWTPs can purchase credits from livestock operators (or others that voluntarily reduce their nutrients) that can be used to offset the discharges of the MWTP. Bion has worked closely with the PA Department of Environmental Protection, Penn State University, PA Department of Agriculture, US EPA and other stakeholders to develop protocols and procedures to generate nutrient credits that meet the long-term planning requirements of PA's MWTPs and give them the ability to achieve compliance at a fraction of the cost to upgrade. Forty-five states have now implemented or are adopting nutrient trading programs.Bion Integrated Agriculture Group will leverage Bion's ability to substantially reduce both the environmental and physical footprint of livestock operations to develop new environmentally-sustainable large-scale facilities with substantial economic advantages over their traditional counterparts. Integrated Projects can be developed in previously impracticable locations and will combine livestock/dairy production with dedicated food processing and/or biofuels production to dramatically reduce transportation and fuel costs. They will exploit the natural synergies of their activities to produce resource, operational and logistical efficiencies that reduce risk and improve profitability for all. Renewable energy produced from the livestock waste stream will be used on-site to provide the thermal energy requirements for the partners. Bion Projects will produce meat and milk products in a responsible manner, with a reduced carbon footprint and improved food safety, creating significant branding opportunities.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  Statements made in this Form 10-Q that are not historical or current facts, which represent the Company's expectations or beliefs including, but not limited to, statements concerning the Company's operations, performance, financial condition, business strategies, and other information, involve substantial risks and uncertainties. The Company's actual results of operations, most of which are beyond the Company's control, could differ materially. These statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe," anticipate," "estimate," or "continue" or the negative thereof. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected.  These factors include adverse economic conditions, entry of new and stronger competitors, inadequate capital, unexpected costs, failure (or delay) to gain product or regulatory approvals in the United States (or particular states) or foreign countries and failure to capitalize upon access to new markets. Additional risks and uncertainties that may affect forward looking statements about Bion's business and prospects include the possibility that markets for nutrient reduction credits (discussed below) and/or other ways to monetize nutrient reductions will be slow to develop (or not develop at all), the existing default by PA1 on its loan secured by the Kreider 1 system, the possibility that a competitor will develop a more comprehensive or less expensive environmental solution, Bion's limited management team, delays in market awareness of Bion and our Systems, uncertainties and costs related to research and development efforts to update and improve Bion's technologies and applications thereof, and/or delays in Bion's development of Projects and failure of marketing strategies, each of which could have both immediate and long term material adverse effects by placing us behind our competitors and requiring expenditures of our limited resources. Bion disclaims any obligation subsequently to revise any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.  Currently, Bion is focused on using applications of its patented and proprietary waste management technologies and technology platform to pursue three main business opportunities: 1) installation of Bion systems (some of which may generate verified nutrient credits and revenues from the production of renewable energy and byproducts) to retrofit and environmentally remediate existing CAFOs ("Retrofits") in selected markets where: a) government policy supports such efforts (such as the Chesapeake Bay watershed, some Great Lakes Basin states, and/or other states and watersheds facing EPA 'total maximum daily load' ("TMDL") issues, and/or b) where CAFO's need our technology to obtain permits to expand or develop without negative environmental consequences; 2) development of new state-of-the-art large scale waste treatment facilities in strategic locations ("Projects") (some of these may be Integrated Projects as described below) with multiple revenue streams, and 3) licensing and/or joint venturing of Bion's technology and applications (primarily) outside North America. The opportunities described at 1) and 2) above each require substantial political and regulatory (federal, state and local) efforts on the part of the Company and a substantial part of Bion's efforts are focused on such political and regulatory matters. Bion is currently pursuing the international opportunities primarily through the use of consultants with existing relationships in target. During 2008 the Company commenced actively pursuing the opportunity presented by environmental retrofit and remediation of the waste streams of existing CAFOs which effort has met with very limited success to date. The first commercial activity in this area is represented by our agreement with Kreider Farms ("KF"), pursuant to which the Kreider 1 system to treat KF's dairy waste streams to reduce nutrient releases to the environment while generating marketable nutrient credits and renewable energy was designed, constructed and entered full-scale operation during 2011. On January 26, 2009 the Board of the Pennsylvania Infrastructure Investment Authority ("Pennvest") approved a $7.75 million loan to Bion PA 1, LLC ("PA1"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, for the initial Kreider Farms project ("Kreider 1 System"). After substantial unanticipated delays, on August 12, 2010 PA1 received a permit for construction of the Kreider 1 system. Construction activities commenced during November 2010. The closing/settlement of the Pennvest Loan took place on November 3, 2010. PA1 finished the construction of the Kreider 1 System and entered a period of system 'operational shakedown' during May 2011. The Kreider 1 System reached full, stabilized operation by the end of the 2012 fiscal year. During 2011 the PADEP re-certified the nutrient credits for this project. The PADEP issued final permits for the Kreider 1 System (including the credit verification plan) on August 1, 2012 on which date the Company deemed that the Kreider System was 'placed in service'. As a result, PA1 commenced generating nutrient reduction credits for potential sale while continuing to utilize the Kreider 1 system to test improvements and add-ons. However, to date liquidity in the Pennsylvania nutrient credit market has been slow to develop significant breadth and depth, which limited liquidity/depth has negatively impacted Bion's business plans and has resulted in challenges to monetizing the nutrient reductions created by PA1's existing Kreider 1 project and Bion's other proposed projects. These difficulties have prevented PA1 from generating any material revenues from the Kreider 1 project to date and raise significant questions as to when, if ever, PA1 will be able to generate such revenues from the Kreider 1 system. PA1 has had sporadic discussions/negotiations with Pennvest related to forbearance and/or re-structuring its obligations pursuant to the Pennvest Loan for more than three years. In the context of such discussions/negotiations, PA1 elected not to make interest payments to Pennvest on the Pennvest Loan since January 2013. Additionally, the Company has not made any principal payments, which were to begin in fiscal 2013, and, therefore, the Company has classified the Pennvest Loan as a current liability as of December 31, 2016. Due to the failure of the PA nutrient reduction credit market to develop, the Company determined that the carrying amount of the property and equipment related to the Kreider 1 project exceeded its estimated future undiscounted cash flows based on certain assumptions regarding timing, level and probability of revenues from sales of nutrient reduction credits and, therefore, PA1 and the Company recorded impairments related to the value of the Kreider 1 assets of $1,750,000 and $2,000,000 at June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014, respectively. During the 2016 fiscal year, effective June 30, 2016, PA1 and the Company recorded an impairment of $1,684,562 to the value of the Kreider 1 assets which reduced the value on the Company's books to $0. This impairment reflects management's judgment that the salvage value of the Kreider 1 assets roughly equals PA1's contractual obligations related to the Kreider 1 system, including expenses related to decommissioning of the Kreider 1 system, costs associated with needed capital upgrade expenses, and re-certification/ permitting amendments. See "Impairment loss on property and equipment" below.  On September 25, 2014, Pennvest exercised its right to declare the Pennvest Loan in default and accelerated the Pennvest Loan and demanded that PA1 pay $8,137,117 (principal, interest plus late charges) on or before October 24, 2014. PA1 did not make the payment and does not have the resources to make the payments demanded by Pennvest. PA1 has commenced discussions and negotiations with Pennvest concerning this matter but Pennvest has rejected PA1's proposal made during the fall of 2014. As of the date of this report, no formal proposals are currently under consideration and only sporadic communication has taken place regarding the matters involved over the last 30 months. It is not possible at this date to predict the outcome of this matter, but the Company believes that a loan modification agreement may be reached in the future if/when a more robust market for nutrient reductions develops in PA, of which there is no assurance. PA1 and Bion will continue to evaluate various options with regard to Kreider 1 over the next 30-180 days.  The economics (potential revenues, profitability and continued operation) of the Kreider 1 System are based almost entirely on the long term sale of nutrient (nitrogen and/or phosphorus) reduction credits to meet the requirements of the Chesapeake Bay environmental clean-up. See below for further discussion. During August 2012, the Company provided Pennvest (and the PADEP) with data demonstrating that the Kreider 1 system met the 'technology guaranty' standards which were incorporated in the Pennvest financing documents and, as a result, the Pennvest Loan has been (and is now) solely an obligation of PA1 since that date.  Note that while Bion believes that the Kreider 1 System, the Kreider 2 Project and/or subsequent Bion Projects will eventually generate revenue from the sale of: a) nutrient reductions (credits or in other form), b) renewable energy (and related credits), c) sales of fertilizer products, and/or d) potentially, in time, credits for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. We believe that the potential market is very large, but it is not possible to predict the exact timing and/or magnitude of these potential markets at this time.  A significant portion of Bion's current activities concern efforts with private and public stakeholders (at local and state level) in PA, (and other Chesapeake Bay, Midwest and Great Lakes states) and at the federal level (EPA and other executive departments and Congress) to establish appropriate public policies which will create regulations and funding mechanisms that foster installation of the low cost, technology-based environmental solutions that Bion (and others) can provide through clean-up of agricultural waste streams. In January 2013, the Pennsylvania Legislative Budget and Finance Committee issued a report stating that targeting upstream livestock would save Pennsylvania's taxpayers up to 80% of previously estimated costs (potential savings for PA in excess of a billion dollars per year over the next 20 years) which would be available for other needs (notably aging drinking water and sewer infrastructure) while creating large local benefits of an upstream treatment strategy including reduced freshwater compliance costs, future cost avoidance of treating drinking water from contaminated local aquifers and increased economic activity for agriculture, tourism and recreation. The Coalition for an Affordable Bay Solution ("Coalition") was formed to support the creation of a competitively-bid nitrogen trading program in Pennsylvania that will enable Pennsylvania to capture the economic benefits outlined in the legislative study. The Coalition supports legislation to establish a competitively-bid RFP program for nitrogen reductions, where bids will also be 'scored' to reflect the value of the benefits to PA's interior waterways and communities. Founding members of the Coalition represent both Chesapeake Bay and national industry participants, and include Bion, JBS, SA, Kreider Farms, and Fair Oaks Farms. The head of the Coalition is Ed Schafer, Bion's Vice Chairman. The Company believes that: i) the April 2015 release of a report from the Pennsylvania Auditor General titled "Special Report on the Importance of Meeting Pennsylvania's Chesapeake Bay Nutrient Reduction Targets" which highlighted the economic consequences of EPA-imposed sanctions if the state fails to meet the 2017 TMDL targets, as well as the need to support using low-cost solutions and technologies as alternatives to higher-cost public infrastructure projects, where possible, and ii) the April 2015 introduction of Senate Bill 724 (successor to prior SB 924) 'The Watershed Improvement Act', which, if adopted, would have established a program that will allow the Pennsylvania's tax- and rate-payers to meet their EPA-mandated Chesapeake Bay pollution reductions at significantly lower cost by purchasing verified reductions (by competitive bidding) from all sources, including those that Bion can produce through livestock waste treatment, represent visible evidence of progress being made on these matters in Pennsylvania. Such legislation, if passed and signed into law, will potentially enable Bion (and others) to compete for public funding on an equal basis with subsidized agricultural 'best management practices' and public works and storm water authorities. On May 6, 2015, the PA Senate Majority Policy Committee held a hearing on SB 724. Testifying in support of this legislation was Elliot Keller of JBS in Souderton PA, Phil Durgin - Executive Director of the PA Legislative Budget and Finance Committee, Ron Kreider of Kreider Farms, Ed Schafer representing the Coalition, and Mike McCloskey representing the National Milk Distributors Association. Bion's activity related to such legislation has intensified with increased stakeholder support and increasing attacks on the Company by those opposed to the legislation and Bion believes the primary provisions of such legislation will be incorporated into legislation that may be passed (in some version) by the Pennsylvania Legislature during 2017, but cannot predict the exact final content of such legislation or guarantee such passage. Note, however, that there was vocal opposition to SB 724 from threatened stakeholders committed to the existing status quo approaches--- a significant portion of which was focused on attacking (in often inaccurate and/or vilifying ways) Bion in/through social media and internet articles, blogs, press releases, twitter posts and re-tweets, rather than engaging the substantive issues. The Company responded in a press release and postings on its website. As a result, Bion is exploring the use of social media including Facebook, twitter and other approaches to accurately communicate about the Company's business and positions. If legislation similar to SB 724 is passed and implemented (in something close to its current form), Bion expects that the policies and strategies being developed in PA will not only benefit the Company's existing and proposed PA projects, but will also subsequently provide the basis for a larger Chesapeake Bay watershed strategy and, thereafter, a national clean water strategy.  The Company believes that Pennsylvania is 'ground zero' in the long-standing clean water battle between agriculture and the further regulation of agriculture relative to nutrient impacts. The ability of Bion and other technology providers to achieve verified reductions from agricultural non-point sources can resolve the current stalemate and enable implementation of constructive solutions that benefit all stakeholders, providing a mechanism that ensures that taxpayer funds will be used to achieve the most beneficial result at the lowest cost, regardless of source. All sources, point and non-point, rural and urban, will be able to compete for tax payer-funded nitrogen reductions in a fair and transparent process; and since payment from the tax and rate payers would now be performance-based, these providers will be held financially accountable.  We believe that the overwhelming environmental, economic, quality of life and public health benefits to all stakeholders in the watershed, both within and outside of Pennsylvania, make the case for adoption of the strategies outlined in the Report less an issue of 'if', but of 'when and how'. The adoption of a competitive procurement program will have significant positive impact on technology providers that can deliver verified nitrogen reductions such as Bion, by allocating existing tax- and rate-payer clean water funding to low cost solutions based upon a voluntary and transparent procurement process. The Company believes that implementation of a competitively-bid nutrient reduction program to achieve the goals for the Chesapeake Bay watershed can also provide a working policy model and platform for other states to adopt that will enhance their efforts to comply with both current and future requirements for local and federal estuarine watersheds, including the Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico, the Great Lakes Basin and other nutrient-impaired watersheds.  Bion will also pursue the opportunities related to development of Projects, including Integrated Projects. Integrated Projects will include large CAFOs (such as large dairies, beef cattle feed lots and/or hog farms) with Bion waste treatment system modules processing the aggregate CAFO waste stream from the equivalent of 20,000 to 80,000 (or more) beef or dairy cows (or the waste stream equivalent of other species) while recovering cellulosic biomass to be utilized for renewable energy production (and possibly high nutrient fine solids to be marketed as feed and/or fertilizer), integrated with CAFO end product users/processing facilities and/or a biofuel/ethanol plant capable of producing 40 million to 100 (or more) million gallons of ethanol per year. Such Integrated Projects will involve multiple CAFO modules of 10,000 or more beef or dairy cows (or waste stream equivalent of other species) with waste treatment modules on a single site and/or on sites within an approximately 30 mile radius. Bion believes its technology platform (2G Tech, 3G Tech and/or a hybrid in different situations) will allow integration of large-scale CAFO's with end product processors and/or ethanol production together with renewable energy production from cellulosic biomass recovered from the waste streams and on-site energy utilization in a 'closed loop' manner that will reduce the capital expenditures, operating costs and carbon footprint for the entire Integrated Project and each component facility. Some Projects may be developed from scratch while others may be developed in geographic proximity to (and in coordination with) existing participating CAFOs, ethanol plants and/or end product processors. Each Project is likely to have different degrees of integration, especially in the early development phases.  The Company currently anticipates that the Kreider 2 poultry waste treatment facility in PA will be its initial Project. Bion anticipates that it will select a site for the Kreider 2 Project and/or its initial Integrated Project (and possibly additional Projects) during calendar year 2017. Bion hopes to commence development of its initial Project by optioning land and beginning the site-specific design and permitting process during calendar year 2017, but delays are possible. It is not possible at this time to firmly predict where the initial Project will be developed or the order in which Projects will be developed. All potential Projects are in very early pre-development stages and may never progress to actual development or may be developed after other Projects not yet under active consideration.  Bion also hopes to be able to move forward on additional Projects through 2017-19 to create a pipeline of Projects. Management has a 5-year development target (through calendar year 2023) of approximately 10 or more Projects. Management hopes to have identified and begun development work related to 3-5 Projects over the next 2 years. At the end of the 5-year period, Bion projects that 3-8 of these Projects will be in full operation in 3-6 states (and possibly one or more foreign countries), and the balance would be in various stages ranging from partial operation to early development stage. It is possible that one or more Projects will be developed in joint ventures specifically targeted to meet the growing animal protein demand outside of the United States (including without limitation Asia, Europe and/or the Middle East). No Projects (including Integrated Projects) has been developed to date.  The Company's audited financial statements for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred net losses of approximately $4,522,000 and $5,642,000 during the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2016 includes a "going concern" explanatory paragraph which means that the accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred net losses of approximately $1,378,000 and $1,630,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. At December 31, . . .

Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements




Note 1 - Restatement




In connection with the audit of the Company's Financial Statements for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 2000, management determined that the Company should
make certain non-cash adjustments to its accounting throughout the fiscal
year.  The cumulative effects of these adjustments were reflected in the
financial statements contained in the Company's Annual Report for the 2000
fiscal year.  The Company has made the following non-cash adjustments in its
accounting for the first, second and third quarters:


- The Company recorded a warrant discount during the first quarter on
the related party notes payable of $349,492 and amortized $34,950 to
interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 1999.
The remaining unamortized discount of $314,542 was expensed during the
second quarter upon the exchange of the original related party notes
payable for new notes payable;


- The Company recorded consulting expense of $144,133 (valued in
accordance with the Black-Scholes model) during July 1999 related to
the value of warrants issued for consulting services to an entity
affiliated with a shareholder;


- The full fair value of 2,500,000 warrants (computed in accordance with
the Black-Scholes model) issued to D2 Co. LLC ("D2") in connection
with a consulting services agreement was recorded as $2,333,687 of
deferred consulting expense in December 1999, to be charged to expense
over the three year term of the agreement;


- The Company calculated the fair value of the 2,500,000 warrants
(valued in accordance with the Black-Scholes model) purchased by D2
in December 1999 of $2,447,370 for $500,000 cash and a $500,000
non-recourse promissory note receivable.  The excess of the fair value
of the warrants over the consideration received of $1,447,370 was
charged to general and administrative expenses;


- In December, 1999, the Company recorded a $2,419,771 discount on
related party notes payable representing the difference in fair values
of equity instruments exchanged, originally issued in connection with
related party notes payable.  The fair value of the warrants exchanged
were computed in accordance with the Black-Scholes model; and


- A beneficial conversion feature of $656,027 concerning a related party
note payable which was immediately convertible on the date of issue was
charged to interest expense in December 1999 as the related party notes
payable were immediately convertible.


As a result of the above, the Company has restated the financial statements
contained in the Form 10-QSB for the three and nine months ended March 31,
2000.  For the three months ended March 31, 2000, the Company increased
general and administrative expenses from $860,733 to $1,020,832 and increased
interest expense from $226,154 to $370,096, resulting in an increase in the
net loss and comprehensive loss from $1,293,875 to $1,597,916 and an increase
in the basic and diluted loss per common share from $0.11 per share to $0.14
per share.  For the nine months ended March 31, 2000, the Company increased
general and administrative expenses from $2,526,853 to $4,308,455 and
increased interest expense from $473,533 to $1,622,994, resulting in an

Note 1 - Restatement (continued)




increase in the net loss and comprehensive loss from $3,509,364 to $6,440,427
and an increase in the basic and diluted loss per common share from $0.32 per
share to $0.59 per share.  As of March 31, 2000, related party notes payable
and accrued interest decreased from $4,884,644 to $2,666,519 due to the
unamortized warrant discount of $2,218,123 and convertible bridge notes
payable decreased from $3,793,707 to $2,731,494 due to the unamortized warrant
discount of $1,062,213.  The Company increased the accumulated deficit at
March 31, 2000 from $18,438,858 to $21,369,920 and decreased the total
stockholders' deficit from $4,656,834 to $1,376,496.



Note 2 - Summary of Accounting Policies




The summary of the significant accounting policies of Bion Environmental
Technologies, Inc. ("Bion" or "Company") is incorporated by reference to our
annual report on Form 10-KSB/A at June 30, 1999.


The accompanying unaudited financial statements and disclosures reflect all
adjustments (all of which are normal recurring adjustments) in the ordinary
course of business which in the opinion of management are necessary for a fair
presentation of the results of operations, financial positions, and cash flow.
The results of operations for the periods indicated are not necessarily
indicative of the results for a full year.



Note 3 - Continued Operations




The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern
basis which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of
liabilities in the ordinary course of business. We have not yet begun earning
significant revenue from our planned principal operations. Consequently, as of
March 31, 2000, we have incurred accumulated losses totaling $21,369,920,
resulting in an accumulated Shareholders' deficit of $1,376,496.  Cash flows
from current operations are not sufficient to meet obligations.  Management
plans include continuing efforts to obtain additional capital to fund
operations until system sales along with sales of BionSoilJ are sufficient to
fund operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able successful in
attaining profitable operations or raising sufficient capital. Since January
1, 2000 we have spent significant funds on the development of the next
generation of system design, which will include system monitoring and controls
and a clean water recycle loop; an expanded research program for BionSoilJ (as
a result there will be only  limited quantities for sale); and retained
consultants to support these (and other) efforts.  These trends and the
related expenditures will continue through the end of the calendar year.



Note 4 - Capital Structure




Because we have a relatively complex capital structure the following capital
structure details are set forth:

Note 5 - Accounting on Material Agreements




In connection with our agreements with D2 Co. LLC (AD2@), as reported in our
Forms 8-K and 8-K/A-1 dated December 11, 1999, we issued 2,500,000 warrants
valued at $2,477,370 for $1,000,000, receiving $500,000 cash and a $500,000
non-recourse promissory note.  The promissory note has been recorded as a
reduction to equity until payment is received on the related warrants.  The
beneficial value of the warrants issued over the consideration received of
$1,477,370 has been expensed in the consolidated statement of operations.


We have also issued 2,500,000 warrants as part of the payment for services to
be rendered by D2 under the related agreements.  We will record the value of
the warrants issued of $2,333,687 as deferred consulting expenses and
recognize the expense over the three-year life of the agreement.


In connection with the exchange of related party convertible notes payable and
warrants for new convertible notes payable, Common Stock and warrants, we have
recorded $2,419,771 as a discount on the new related party notes payable.  The
amounts recorded reflect the difference in fair values of the equity
instruments exchanged.  The discount is being amortized over the life of the
debt as additional interest expense. See our Forms 8-K and 8-K/A-1 dated
December 11, 1999.

Note 6 - Subsequent Events




During the month of April 2000, we closed an additional thirteen units in our
private offering for $325,000 in long-term convertible bridge debt and $13,520
in equity for the purchase of 97,500 warrants.  The total private offering
consisted of cash proceeds of $4,095,000 of long-term convertible bridge debt
and $61,425 in equity for the purchase of 1,213,500 warrants.  The value of
the warrants of $1,110,118 has been recorded as a warrant discount on the
convertible bridge notes payable, to be amortized to interest expense over the
life of the notes.  See our Form 8-K dated April 13, 2000.


During the month of May 2000, we negotiated a settlement of the $94,182.84
account payable for legal fees that were deferred until December 31, 2001 for
40,000 shares of restricted Common Stock.


In accordance with the agreement between LoTayLingKyur, Inc. (ALTLK@), Mark A.
Smith (MAS) and Bion as reported in our Form 8-K dated December 11, 1999 (Item
10.4), LTLK and MAS have earned the fees specified.  The balance of the
consulting fees ($420,000) that are listed as a prepaid will be expensed in
the next quarter.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS



Management's Discussion of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Financial Condition and Results of Operations




The financial statements contained in this 10-QSB show more than
$14,900,000 in equity being invested in Bion as of March 31, 2000.  We have a
negative net worth of $1,376,496, accumulated deficit of $21,369,920, limited
current revenues, and substantial current operating losses. (Note that the
negative net worth is less than the outstanding long-term debt to management
and major shareholders, the largest part of which is convertible into Bion's
Common Stock.  Bion may convert notes held by LoTayLingKyur, Inc., LTLK
Defined Benefit Plan, and Dublin Holding Ltd.  under specific conditions.  In
addition, management note holders (and family entities) have agreed to use
long-term notes owed by Bion to exercise outstanding options and warrants of
Bion under specific conditions. See our Forms 8-K and 8-K/A-1 dated December
11, 1999.  See also Footnote 3 to the Financial Statements above.)


Our operations are not currently profitable; therefore, readers are
further cautioned that our continued existence is uncertain if we are not
successful in obtaining outside funding in an amount sufficient for us to meet
our operating expenses at our current level.  Management plans to continue
raising additional capital to fund operations until sales of Bion systems and
BionSoil are sufficient to fund operations.


Bion NMS system and BionSoil sales require additional expenditures. Our
system sales require additional personnel and significant capital
expenditures, which will generally increase our overhead.  BionSoil product
sales and marketing may require wholesaler and retailer distribution networks
(which may require permitting in some locations) and additional expenditures
for personnel and equipment to harvest, process, package, sell, and deliver
our products.  Although management believes that there is a reasonable basis
to remain optimistic, no assumption can be made that we will be successful in
attaining  profitable operations and/or raising sufficient capital to sustain
operations. Since January 1, 2000 we have spent significant funds on the
development of the next generation of system design, which will include system
monitoring and controls and a clean water recycle loop; an expanded research
program for BionSoilJ (as a result there will be only  limited quantities for
sale); and retained consultants to support these (and other) efforts.  These
trends and the related expenditures will continue through the end of the
calendar year.



Liquidity and Capital Resources




Our Consolidated Balance Sheet shows Current Assets of $3,623,249 and
Total Assets of $4,140,874.  Our Current and Total Liabilities as of March 31,
2000 are $96,802 and $5,517,370 respectively.  Total assets increased by
$2,823,643 from June 30, 1999.  The change is primarily attributable to the
increase in cash from the private offering (See our Form 8-K dated April 13,
2000) and the sale of warrants, partially offset by the loss on the sale of
the mortgage receivable (see our 10-KSB/A dated June 30, 1999) and prepaid
consulting. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $3,243,266 from June 30,
1999. The cash increase is the result of a private offering that closed on
April 13, 2000 (See Form 8-K dated April 13, 2000).  We received $3,817,905 of
the total offering through March 31, 2000.  Our current ratio (current
assets:current liabilities) is 37.4:1 as of March 31, 2000 as compared to
0.67:1 as of June 30, 1999.


17





Total liabilities increased $1,391,351 in the nine month period ended
March 31, 2000.  Notes payable increased by $2,096,563, partially offset by a
decrease in accrued salaries and accounts payable of $319,461 and $338,750,
respectively. The increases in notes payable result from additional notes
issued to related parties or employees ($1,583,192), offset by an unamortized
discount of $2,218,123, and will convert into stock if certain conditions are
met, and to the long-term convertible bridge debt ($3,793,707), offset by an
unamortized discount of $1,062,213, associated with the private offering (See
our Form 8-K dated April 13, 2000).


Our Consolidated Statement of Changes in Shareholders' Equity reflects a
total of 1,757,623 shares of Common Stock being issued in the nine month
period ended March 31, 2000.  We issued 282,702 shares of Common Stock for
cash ($426,460) and 242,495 shares for services ($527,269).  We also issued
1,172,426 shares in an exchange of Class X Warrants for  Common Stock and
Class Z Warrants (see our Forms 8-K and 8-K/A-1 dated December 11, 1999) and
60,000 shares to two employees as loans and received short term notes for the
value of the stock sales.  In connection with the warrant/stock exchange, we
recorded $2,419,771 as a debt discount, representing the excess of the fair
value of common stock and warrants issued in exchange for the value of
warrants surrendered.  The amount was recorded as debt discount because the
warrants exchanged were originally issued in connection with related party
notes payable.  Of these 1,757,623 shares, we issued a total of 1,471,936
shares of legended and restricted Common Stock and 285,687 shares of
unrestricted stock. We  issued a note to an employee and, as part of the note,
reclassified $60,000 of subscribed stock into the note payable.  We  also
received $500,000 cash and a $500,000 non-recourse promissory note for the
issuance of 2,500,000 warrants to purchase Common Stock at $1.75 per share as
part of our agreement with D2 Co. LLC (See Forms 8-K and 8-K/A-1 dated
December 11, 1999.)  The value of the warrants computed in accordance with the
Black Scholes model of $2,477,370 was charged to common stock and $1,477,370
representing the excess of the fair value of the warrants over the
consideration received, has been charged to general and administrative
expenses.  We recorded deferred consulting expense of $2,333,687 as a
component of stockholders' deficit, representing the fair value of 2,500,000
warrants issued to D2 Co., LLC, in connection with a three-year consulting
agreement.



Results of Operations





Comparison of the Nine Months Ended March 31, 2000 with the Nine Months
Ended March 31, 1999




Revenue in the nine months ended March 31, 2000 was $94,771 compared to
$116,805 for the corresponding nine month period in 1999, a decrease of
$19,034.  Contract costs were lower in the fiscal year 2000 nine month period
by $3,281 due to decreased expenses associated with system design.  This
resulted in a gross loss for the period ended March 31, 2000 of $176,131 as
compared to a gross loss of $157,378 for the same  nine month period in 1999.
System sales were lower in the nine months ended March 31, 2000 due to hog
industry and regulatory changes.  Since January 1, 2000 we have spent
significant funds on the development of the next generation of system design,
which will include system monitoring and controls and a clean water recycle
loop; an expanded research program for BionSoilJ (as a result there will be
only  limited quantities for sale); and retained consultants to support these
(and other) efforts.  These trends and the related expenditures will continue
through the end of the calendar year.


18





General and administrative expenses were higher by $2,705,864 due to an
increase in employee compensation ($233,000), professional expenses
($419,000), non-cash expenses related to the beneficial value of warrants
issued over the consideration received ($1,477,000), consulting expenses
related to warrants issued for services ($144,000),and amortization of
deferred consulting expenses ($194,000), and investor relation expenses
($274,000).


We recorded $1,622,994 in interest expense (including $656,027 of
beneficial conversion feature related to certain related party notes payable
and $493,434 of amortization of debt discount related to certain related party
notes payable) on our notes payable and $295,298 in research and development
costs.  We  also recorded a loss of $57,250 on the sale of the mortgage
receivables in the nine month period.  As a result of the above, we  recorded
a net loss of $6,440,427 in the nine month period ended March 31, 2000,
compared to a net loss of $2,002,032 for the nine month period ended March 31,
1999.


Comparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2000 with the Three
Months Ended March 31, 1999




Revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2000 was $23,509 compared to
$12,881 for the corresponding three month period in 1999, an increase of
$10,628.  Since January 1, 2000 we have spent significant funds on the
development of the next generation of system design, which will include system
monitoring and controls and a clean water recycle loop; an expanded research
program for BionSoilJ (as a result there will be only  limited quantities for
sale); and retained consultants to support these (and other) efforts.  These
trends and the related expenditures will continue through the end of the
calendar year.


Contract costs were higher in the 2000 three month period by $46,272 due
to increased expenses associated with system operations and New York BionSoil
processing.  This resulted in a gross loss for the quarter ended March 31,
2000 of $86,198 as compared to a gross loss of $50,554 for the same three
month period in 1999.


General and administrative expenses were higher by $334,172 due to an
increase in professional expenses ($144,000), amortization of deferred
consulting expenses ($194,000), and investor relation expenses ($43,000).


We recorded $370,096 in interest expense on our notes payable and
$135,158 in research and development costs.  As a result, we  recorded a net
loss of $1,597,916 in the three month period ended March 31, 2000, compared to
a net loss of $821,526 for the three month period ended March 31, 1999.



Trends, Events and Uncertainties






Liquidity




The funding we have received pursuant to the management agreement,
reported in our Forms 8-K and 8-K/A-1 dated December 11, 1999, and the private
placement reported in our Form 8-K dated April 13, 2000, have significantly
increased our liquidity and funding for operations.  Our current assets to
current liabilities ratio is 37.4:1 as of March 31, 2000.  See our Forms 8-K
and 8-K/A-1 dated December 11, 1999 and Form 8-K dated April 13, 2000 for
detailed information on this Management Agreement and recent financing.


19






Seasonality




Our system sales and installation business is not seasonal in nature,
except to the extent that weather conditions at certain times of the year in
certain geographic areas may temporarily affect construction and installation
of our systems.  However, our projects and markets are geographically spread
so that when weather conditions limit construction activity in southern market
areas, projects in northern markets can proceed, and when northern area
weather is inappropriate, southern projects can proceed.  BionSoil and
BionSoil product sales are expected to exhibit a somewhat seasonal sales
pattern with emphasis on spring, summer and fall sales.

PART II - Other Information






ITEM 1.    Legal Proceedings



We know of no material pending legal proceedings to which Bion or any of
our subsidiaries is a party or  in which any of our systems is the subject
except as follows:


The Office of the Attorney General of the State of Illinois has filed a
formal complaint before the  Illinois Pollution Control Board against an
Illinois hog producer (who installed a Bion NMS), Murphy Farms, Inc., and Bion
Technologies, Inc. alleging violations of the Illinois Environmental
Protection Act.  We have stated our position to the Illinois Pollution Control
Board that the Bion NMS was not properly installed, maintained and operated by
the hog producer involved in this suit.  The parties involved in the complaint
are currently in discussions to solve the problems.  Management reasonably
believes that the outcome of this complaint will have no material effect on
our business and that it has no liability for any Illinois violations.






ITEM 2.   Changes in Securities and Use of Proceeds



The following securities were sold in the three month period ended March
31, 2000 without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended:



Warrants




We issued 958,100 J-1 Warrants (540,000 on February 29, 2000 and 418,100
on March 31, 2000) to purchase restricted and legended Common Stock at $2.375
per share. The warrants are exercisable from March 31, 2000 to December 31,
2004.  Bion received $47,905 in cash for use in operations for these warrants.
See Exhibit 10.1 and 10.3 to our Form 8-K dated April 13, 2000.


We issued 75,000 J-1 Warrants on March 31, 2000 to purchase restricted
and legended Common Stock at $2.375 per share to two parties.  The warrants
are exercisable from March 31, 2000 to December 31, 2004.  Bion received
consulting and management services as consideration for these warrants.


On January 1, 2000 we issued 2,500,000 D2C warrants exercisable at $2.50
per share expiring on December 31, 2000.  These warrants were valued at
$2,333,687 using  the Black-Scholes model.  See our Form 8-K dated December
11, 1999, Exhibit 10.1.



Common Stock




We issued 5,535 shares of restricted and legended Common Stock to two
private investors in privately negotiated transactions for an aggregate amount
of $8,210 on January 24 and February 2, 2000.



Convertible Notes




We added $1,307,680 of principal and interest to the convertible notes
listed in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 10-KSB/A
dated June 30, 1999.


21





Common Stock issued pursuant to the transactions set forth above was
issued in reliance upon the exemptions from registration afforded by Sections

3(b), 4(2), and/or other provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
Each of the persons to whom such securities were issued made an informed
investment decision based upon negotiation with us and was provided with
appropriate offering documents and access to material information regarding
Bion.  We believe that such persons had knowledge and experience in financial
and business matters such that they were capable of evaluating the merits and
risks of the acquisition of our Common Stock in connection with these
transactions.  All certificates representing such common shares bear an
appropriate legend restricting the transfer of such securities, except in
accordance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and stop transfer
instructions have been provided to our transfer agent in accordance therewith.


We added $3,793,707 of long-term convertible bridge debt and interest
during the three month period January 1, 2000 to March 31, 2000. The debt has
been reduced by an unamortized warrant discount of $1,062,213 resulting from
the value of the bridge warrants issued in the private placement with the
convertible bridge debt.  See our Form 8-K dated April 13, 2000.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.
