AXALTA COATING SYSTEMS LTD. (NYSE:AXTA)Historical Stock Chart
1 Month : From Jun 2017 to Jul 2017



      Due to continuing significant price increases in the cost of titanium 
      dioxide over the past six months, Axalta Coating Systems (NYSE: AXTA) 
      will impose a price surcharge for coating products that contain this 
      critical raw material.
    

      The surcharge will be applied to specific products sold in all regions 
      of the world and is independent from any pricing actions due to the 
      long-term rise in the cost of producing resins and other key components 
      of Axalta products. The titanium dioxide surcharge will take effect on 
      all orders received after August 1, 2017.

Axalta Introduces Latest Addition to Internal Pipe Coating Line
Jul 10 17
Axalta Coating Systems to introduce the latest addition to its high-temperature, corrosion resistant internal pipe coatings with the release of Nap-Gard® 7-0016, a thermosetting epoxy powder that is designed to provide excellent chemical resistance in temperatures up to 150oC (302oF). Axalta's new Nap-Gard 7-0016, is a thermosetting epoxy powder that is designed to provide excellent chemical resistance in temperatures up to 302 degrees Fahrenheit.

Axalta's Nap-Gard collection of powder coatings are used on external and internal oil, gas and water pipelines with single, dual, and multi-layer application options.

Axalta's functional coatings offer innovative solutions for today's epoxy-based coating applications and are designed to provide superior corrosion protection for products that are used in the most demanding environments.

Axalta Coating Systems is a coatings company headquartered in Philadelphia, PA that develops and manufactures coatings for light and commercial vehicles, industrial, and refinish applications. The firm does business in 130 countries, has nearly 13,000 employees, and has more than 100,000 customers.[3]
Axalta traces its origins to the German firm Herberts Gmbh, which began in 1866 coating carriages before moving to automotive painting. Through later mergers the company became DuPont Performance Coatings (DPC), part of the American DuPont chemical empire, and was rebranded as Axalta Coating Systems after being purchased by The Carlyle Group in 2013. Axalta went public on the New York Stock Exchange in November of 2014 and since then has become fully independent. Carlyle Group exited their last ownership stake in Axlta in 2015.
The company was the sponsor of four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon and the No. 24 Hendrick Motorsports car, a relationship which dated back to Gordon's first Sprint Cup Series race in 1992. Axalta currently sponsors Gordon's former HMS teammate Dale Earnhardt Jr. and the No. 88 car.

History[edit]
The firm's first products were developed in Germany in 1866 to protect carriages from the gravel of dirt roads. In 1920, the company created a quick-drying, multi-color lacquer line for automotive painting.[3] Operating as Herberts Gmbh, the company grew under Kurt Herberts,[4] introducing the popular automobile finish Standox in 1955.[5]
In 1999 Herberts merged with DuPont Automotive Finishes,[6] a transport coating systems technology company that had been started in 1922 in Wilmington, Delaware, to form DPC. In 2012, the private equity firm The Carlyle Group announced its plans to purchase and discontinue DPC.[7] The Carlyle Group completed the sale in February 2013 and founded Axalta.[8] On November 12, 2014, the firm completed its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: AXTA).[9]
On January 21, 2015, Axalta and Chinese industrial coatings firm Shanghai Kinlita Chemical formed a partnership to operate in China.[10] In April 2015, Berkshire Hathaway invested $560 million in Axalta Coating Systems.[11] In July 2016, the firm acquired United Paint and Chemical Corp.'s automotive interior coatings business.[12]
The company currently operates in North America, South America, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.[13] The activities for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa region (EMEA) are based in Germany.[14] The company is also building a new research and development center located at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard known as the Global Innovation Center.[15]
In 1953 Axalta predecessor DuPont published the first annual Color Popularity Report, the first in the industry to have extensive global data in one report. The firm developed L,a,b color equations, an important component of modern color science. It introduced the first waterborne electrical steel coating in the industry in the 1960s.[3]
Products[edit]
Among Axalta's oldest products are Standox and Spies Hecker. Cromax, a water-based product, and the industrial paints Nap-Gard, a powder coating for oil and gas pipeline companies, and Voltatex for electrical insulation, were introduced in the 1990s.[3] Other products made by Axalta include Abcite, Alesta, AquaEC, Audurra, Centari, Challenger, Harmonized Coating Technologies, Imron, and Nason.[16]
Motorsports[edit]




Jeff Gordon's Cromax-sponsored car at Texas Motor Speedway in 2013


Axalta currently sponsors the No. 88 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet SS of Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. and the No. 9 JR Motorsports Chevrolet Camaro of NASCAR Xfinity Series driver William Byron.[17] Previously, the company sponsored four-time series champion Jeff Gordon's No. 24 car, a relationship which dated back to Axalta's days as DuPont and Gordon's first Cup race in 1992. As of the 2016 Brickyard 400, Gordon has won three times in an Axalta-sponsored car, all of which were in 2014.[18] During Gordon's career, he ran variations of his Axalta scheme to promote its brands such as Cromax[19] and Standox.[20] On February 12, 2015, Gordon was hired by Axalta as a global business advisor.[1] In 2015, Axalta sponsored Regan Smith's JR Motorsports Camaro for the Axalta Faster. Tougher. Brighter. 200 at Phoenix International Raceway; the company has been a partner of the team since 2008.[21]
Axalta provides paint for the entire Hendrick team, along with three other NASCAR teams: Camping World Truck Series' Kyle Busch Motorsports, JR Motorsports, and the Cup Series' Stewart-Haas Racing. IndyCar Series team Sarah Fisher Hartman Racing also receives paint from Axalta.[22] In addition to sponsoring Gordon, Axalta sponsored the June Cup Series race at Pocono Raceway, known as the Axalta "We Paint Winners" 400[23] (now known as the Axalta presents the Pocono 400) and the March Xfinity Series race at Phoenix International Raceway, called the Axalta Faster. Tougher. Brighter. 200[24] until 2017, when DC Solar replaced it as sponsor.[25]
Axalta also sponsors snocross team Judnick Motorsport/Polaris Racing, who field riders Ross Martin and James Johnstad in the AMSOIL Championship Snocross series. The sponsorship lasts through 2017.[26]
In 2015, Axalta became the title sponsor of the C2 Team, which competes in Stock Car Brasil.[27] The team currently fields cars for Júlio Campos and Gabriel Casagrande.[28]
Through its Spies Hecker brand, Axalta provides paint for Formula One team Mercedes AMG F1. Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff stated the lightness of the paint allows the team's Silver Arrows cars to drop in weight, assisting in performance.[29]

Axalta Coating Systems is a coatings company headquartered in Philadelphia, PA that develops and manufactures coatings for light and commercial vehicles, industrial, and refinish applications. The firm does business in 130 countries, has nearly 13,000 employees, and has more than 100,000 customers.[3]
Axalta traces its origins to the German firm Herberts Gmbh, which began in 1866 coating carriages before moving to automotive painting. Through later mergers the company became DuPont Performance Coatings (DPC), part of the American DuPont chemical empire, and was rebranded as Axalta Coating Systems after being purchased by The Carlyle Group in 2013. Axalta went public on the New York Stock Exchange in November of 2014 and since then has become fully independent. Carlyle Group exited their last ownership stake in Axlta in 2015.
The company was the sponsor of four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon and the No. 24 Hendrick Motorsports car, a relationship which dated back to Gordon's first Sprint Cup Series race in 1992. Axalta currently sponsors Gordon's former HMS teammate Dale Earnhardt Jr. and the No. 88 car.

History[edit]
The firm's first products were developed in Germany in 1866 to protect carriages from the gravel of dirt roads. In 1920, the company created a quick-drying, multi-color lacquer line for automotive painting.[3] Operating as Herberts Gmbh, the company grew under Kurt Herberts,[4] introducing the popular automobile finish Standox in 1955.[5]
In 1999 Herberts merged with DuPont Automotive Finishes,[6] a transport coating systems technology company that had been started in 1922 in Wilmington, Delaware, to form DPC. In 2012, the private equity firm The Carlyle Group announced its plans to purchase and discontinue DPC.[7] The Carlyle Group completed the sale in February 2013 and founded Axalta.[8] On November 12, 2014, the firm completed its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: AXTA).[9]
On January 21, 2015, Axalta and Chinese industrial coatings firm Shanghai Kinlita Chemical formed a partnership to operate in China.[10] In April 2015, Berkshire Hathaway invested $560 million in Axalta Coating Systems.[11] In July 2016, the firm acquired United Paint and Chemical Corp.'s automotive interior coatings business.[12]
The company currently operates in North America, South America, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.[13] The activities for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa region (EMEA) are based in Germany.[14] The company is also building a new research and development center located at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard known as the Global Innovation Center.[15]
In 1953 Axalta predecessor DuPont published the first annual Color Popularity Report, the first in the industry to have extensive global data in one report. The firm developed L,a,b color equations, an important component of modern color science. It introduced the first waterborne electrical steel coating in the industry in the 1960s.[3]
Products[edit]
Among Axalta's oldest products are Standox and Spies Hecker. Cromax, a water-based product, and the industrial paints Nap-Gard, a powder coating for oil and gas pipeline companies, and Voltatex for electrical insulation, were introduced in the 1990s.[3] Other products made by Axalta include Abcite, Alesta, AquaEC, Audurra, Centari, Challenger, Harmonized Coating Technologies, Imron, and Nason.[16]

Coatings for Parts


OEM Coatings
When an automobile body that is composed of press-molded or welded steel plates and aluminum is coated and parts like engines or tires are assembled, it becomes an automobile which we are accustomed to seeing everywhere.  Of these processes, coating is effective for protecting the surface of an automobile body and making the automobile body look beautiful.  A coating film formed by coating is usually consists of three to five layers.

Coating Processes




Removing iron powders and oils adhering to materials such as steel plate enhances adhesion to electro-deposition coatings.  It also forms a chemical coating film and increases the resistance to corrosion, using chemical reactions.




Automobile bodies are dipped in a large vessel containing electro-deposition coatings for preventing rust, and coated by applying electrical current.  This makes it possible to coat the inside of the automobile body which is difficult to coat by spray-coating.




This is done by making the automobile body look beautiful and reducing the damage due to chipping.




In the top coating, the final coating process, after having undercoated for coloring, a clear coat is coated to make the surface glossy and improve weatherproofing.

Coatings for Parts
Electro-deposition coatings for parts and frames



Metal parts which are heavily used in automobiles require high corrosion resistance, thus high rust-preventive electro-deposition coatings are used.  Of these parts, frames for trucks and other associated parts that are exposed to sunshine or rain are treated with electro-deposition coatings which additionally have weather-proofing properties.  These steel plate parts are basically finished with a single film of electro-deposition coating to become a final product.


Automobile parts


Coatings for plastic parts



Many plastic parts are also used in cars.  Of these parts, bumpers are made of polypropylene for absorbing anti-personnel impact and weight-saving.  Polypropylene generally rejects coatings, so special primer coatings* are used.
*Primer coating:  A coating that is directly coated on material.


Plastic parts


Other rust-preventive coatings
This type of coating is specifically used for automobile parts whose material is thick like cast metal and difficult to cure by heating.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

Axalta Coating Systems is a coatings company headquartered in Philadelphia, PA that develops and manufactures coatings for light and commercial vehicles, industrial, and refinish applications. The firm does business in 130 countries, has nearly 13,000 employees, and has more than 100,000 customers.[3]
Axalta traces its origins to the German firm Herberts Gmbh, which began in 1866 coating carriages before moving to automotive painting. Through later mergers the company became DuPont Performance Coatings (DPC), part of the American DuPont chemical empire, and was rebranded as Axalta Coating Systems after being purchased by The Carlyle Group in 2013. Axalta went public on the New York Stock Exchange in November of 2014 and since then has become fully independent. Carlyle Group exited their last ownership stake in Axlta in 2015.
The company was the sponsor of four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon and the No. 24 Hendrick Motorsports car, a relationship which dated back to Gordon's first Sprint Cup Series race in 1992. Axalta currently sponsors Gordon's former HMS teammate Dale Earnhardt Jr. and the No. 88 car.

History[edit]
The firm's first products were developed in Germany in 1866 to protect carriages from the gravel of dirt roads. In 1920, the company created a quick-drying, multi-color lacquer line for automotive painting.[3] Operating as Herberts Gmbh, the company grew under Kurt Herberts,[4] introducing the popular automobile finish Standox in 1955.[5]
In 1999 Herberts merged with DuPont Automotive Finishes,[6] a transport coating systems technology company that had been started in 1922 in Wilmington, Delaware, to form DPC. In 2012, the private equity firm The Carlyle Group announced its plans to purchase and discontinue DPC.[7] The Carlyle Group completed the sale in February 2013 and founded Axalta.[8] On November 12, 2014, the firm completed its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: AXTA).[9]
On January 21, 2015, Axalta and Chinese industrial coatings firm Shanghai Kinlita Chemical formed a partnership to operate in China.[10] In April 2015, Berkshire Hathaway invested $560 million in Axalta Coating Systems.[11] In July 2016, the firm acquired United Paint and Chemical Corp.'s automotive interior coatings business.[12]
The company currently operates in North America, South America, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.[13] The activities for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa region (EMEA) are based in Germany.[14] The company is also building a new research and development center located at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard known as the Global Innovation Center.[15]
In 1953 Axalta predecessor DuPont published the first annual Color Popularity Report, the first in the industry to have extensive global data in one report. The firm developed L,a,b color equations, an important component of modern color science. It introduced the first waterborne electrical steel coating in the industry in the 1960s.[3]
Products[edit]
Among Axalta's oldest products are Standox and Spies Hecker. Cromax, a water-based product, and the industrial paints Nap-Gard, a powder coating for oil and gas pipeline companies, and Voltatex for electrical insulation, were introduced in the 1990s.[3] Other products made by Axalta include Abcite, Alesta, AquaEC, Audurra, Centari, Challenger, Harmonized Coating Technologies, Imron, and Nason.[16]
Motorsports[edit]




Jeff Gordon's Cromax-sponsored car at Texas Motor Speedway in 2013


Axalta currently sponsors the No. 88 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet SS of Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. and the No. 9 JR Motorsports Chevrolet Camaro of NASCAR Xfinity Series driver William Byron.[17] Previously, the company sponsored four-time series champion Jeff Gordon's No. 24 car, a relationship which dated back to Axalta's days as DuPont and Gordon's first Cup race in 1992. As of the 2016 Brickyard 400, Gordon has won three times in an Axalta-sponsored car, all of which were in 2014.[18] During Gordon's career, he ran variations of his Axalta scheme to promote its brands such as Cromax[19] and Standox.[20] On February 12, 2015, Gordon was hired by Axalta as a global business advisor.[1] In 2015, Axalta sponsored Regan Smith's JR Motorsports Camaro for the Axalta Faster. Tougher. Brighter. 200 at Phoenix International Raceway; the company has been a partner of the team since 2008.[21]
Axalta provides paint for the entire Hendrick team, along with three other NASCAR teams: Camping World Truck Series' Kyle Busch Motorsports, JR Motorsports, and the Cup Series' Stewart-Haas Racing. IndyCar Series team Sarah Fisher Hartman Racing also receives paint from Axalta.[22] In addition to sponsoring Gordon, Axalta sponsored the June Cup Series race at Pocono Raceway, known as the Axalta "We Paint Winners" 400[23] (now known as the Axalta presents the Pocono 400) and the March Xfinity Series race at Phoenix International Raceway, called the Axalta Faster. Tougher. Brighter. 200[24] until 2017, when DC Solar replaced it as sponsor.[25]
Axalta also sponsors snocross team Judnick Motorsport/Polaris Racing, who field riders Ross Martin and James Johnstad in the AMSOIL Championship Snocross series. The sponsorship lasts through 2017.[26]
In 2015, Axalta became the title sponsor of the C2 Team, which competes in Stock Car Brasil.[27] The team currently fields cars for Júlio Campos and Gabriel Casagrande.[28]
Through its Spies Hecker brand, Axalta provides paint for Formula One team Mercedes AMG F1. Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff stated the lightness of the paint allows the team's Silver Arrows cars to drop in weight, assisting in performance.[29]

Axalta Coating Systems is a coatings company headquartered in Philadelphia, PA that develops and manufactures coatings for light and commercial vehicles, industrial, and refinish applications. The firm does business in 130 countries, has nearly 13,000 employees, and has more than 100,000 customers.[3]
Axalta traces its origins to the German firm Herberts Gmbh, which began in 1866 coating carriages before moving to automotive painting. Through later mergers the company became DuPont Performance Coatings (DPC), part of the American DuPont chemical empire, and was rebranded as Axalta Coating Systems after being purchased by The Carlyle Group in 2013. Axalta went public on the New York Stock Exchange in November of 2014 and since then has become fully independent. Carlyle Group exited their last ownership stake in Axlta in 2015.
The company was the sponsor of four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon and the No. 24 Hendrick Motorsports car, a relationship which dated back to Gordon's first Sprint Cup Series race in 1992. Axalta currently sponsors Gordon's former HMS teammate Dale Earnhardt Jr. and the No. 88 car.

History[edit]
The firm's first products were developed in Germany in 1866 to protect carriages from the gravel of dirt roads. In 1920, the company created a quick-drying, multi-color lacquer line for automotive painting.[3] Operating as Herberts Gmbh, the company grew under Kurt Herberts,[4] introducing the popular automobile finish Standox in 1955.[5]
In 1999 Herberts merged with DuPont Automotive Finishes,[6] a transport coating systems technology company that had been started in 1922 in Wilmington, Delaware, to form DPC. In 2012, the private equity firm The Carlyle Group announced its plans to purchase and discontinue DPC.[7] The Carlyle Group completed the sale in February 2013 and founded Axalta.[8] On November 12, 2014, the firm completed its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: AXTA).[9]
On January 21, 2015, Axalta and Chinese industrial coatings firm Shanghai Kinlita Chemical formed a partnership to operate in China.[10] In April 2015, Berkshire Hathaway invested $560 million in Axalta Coating Systems.[11] In July 2016, the firm acquired United Paint and Chemical Corp.'s automotive interior coatings business.[12]
The company currently operates in North America, South America, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.[13] The activities for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa region (EMEA) are based in Germany.[14] The company is also building a new research and development center located at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard known as the Global Innovation Center.[15]
In 1953 Axalta predecessor DuPont published the first annual Color Popularity Report, the first in the industry to have extensive global data in one report. The firm developed L,a,b color equations, an important component of modern color science. It introduced the first waterborne electrical steel coating in the industry in the 1960s.[3]
Products[edit]
Among Axalta's oldest products are Standox and Spies Hecker. Cromax, a water-based product, and the industrial paints Nap-Gard, a powder coating for oil and gas pipeline companies, and Voltatex for electrical insulation, were introduced in the 1990s.[3] Other products made by Axalta include Abcite, Alesta, AquaEC, Audurra, Centari, Challenger, Harmonized Coating Technologies, Imron, and Nason.[16]
Motorsports[edit]




Jeff Gordon's Cromax-sponsored car at Texas Motor Speedway in 2013


Axalta currently sponsors the No. 88 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet SS of Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. and the No. 9 JR Motorsports Chevrolet Camaro of NASCAR Xfinity Series driver William Byron.[17] Previously, the company sponsored four-time series champion Jeff Gordon's No. 24 car, a relationship which dated back to Axalta's days as DuPont and Gordon's first Cup race in 1992. As of the 2016 Brickyard 400, Gordon has won three times in an Axalta-sponsored car, all of which were in 2014.[18] During Gordon's career, he ran variations of his Axalta scheme to promote its brands such as Cromax[19] and Standox.[20] On February 12, 2015, Gordon was hired by Axalta as a global business advisor.[1] In 2015, Axalta sponsored Regan Smith's JR Motorsports Camaro for the Axalta Faster. Tougher. Brighter. 200 at Phoenix International Raceway; the company has been a partner of the team since 2008.[21]
Axalta provides paint for the entire Hendrick team, along with three other NASCAR teams: Camping World Truck Series' Kyle Busch Motorsports, JR Motorsports, and the Cup Series' Stewart-Haas Racing. IndyCar Series team Sarah Fisher Hartman Racing also receives paint from Axalta.[22] In addition to sponsoring Gordon, Axalta sponsored the June Cup Series race at Pocono Raceway, known as the Axalta "We Paint Winners" 400[23] (now known as the Axalta presents the Pocono 400) and the March Xfinity Series race at Phoenix International Raceway, called the Axalta Faster. Tougher. Brighter. 200[24] until 2017, when DC Solar replaced it as sponsor.[25]
Axalta also sponsors snocross team Judnick Motorsport/Polaris Racing, who field riders Ross Martin and James Johnstad in the AMSOIL Championship Snocross series. The sponsorship lasts through 2017.[26]
In 2015, Axalta became the title sponsor of the C2 Team, which competes in Stock Car Brasil.[27] The team currently fields cars for Júlio Campos and Gabriel Casagrande.[28]
Through its Spies Hecker brand, Axalta provides paint for Formula One team Mercedes AMG F1. Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff stated the lightness of the paint allows the team's Silver Arrows cars to drop in weight, assisting in performance.[29]

Axalta Coating Systems is a coatings company headquartered in Philadelphia, PA that develops and manufactures coatings for light and commercial vehicles, industrial, and refinish applications. The firm does business in 130 countries, has nearly 13,000 employees, and has more than 100,000 customers.[3]
Axalta traces its origins to the German firm Herberts Gmbh, which began in 1866 coating carriages before moving to automotive painting. Through later mergers the company became DuPont Performance Coatings (DPC), part of the American DuPont chemical empire, and was rebranded as Axalta Coating Systems after being purchased by The Carlyle Group in 2013. Axalta went public on the New York Stock Exchange in November of 2014 and since then has become fully independent. Carlyle Group exited their last ownership stake in Axlta in 2015.
The company was the sponsor of four-time NASCAR champion Jeff Gordon and the No. 24 Hendrick Motorsports car, a relationship which dated back to Gordon's first Sprint Cup Series race in 1992. Axalta currently sponsors Gordon's former HMS teammate Dale Earnhardt Jr. and the No. 88 car.

History[edit]
The firm's first products were developed in Germany in 1866 to protect carriages from the gravel of dirt roads. In 1920, the company created a quick-drying, multi-color lacquer line for automotive painting.[3] Operating as Herberts Gmbh, the company grew under Kurt Herberts,[4] introducing the popular automobile finish Standox in 1955.[5]
In 1999 Herberts merged with DuPont Automotive Finishes,[6] a transport coating systems technology company that had been started in 1922 in Wilmington, Delaware, to form DPC. In 2012, the private equity firm The Carlyle Group announced its plans to purchase and discontinue DPC.[7] The Carlyle Group completed the sale in February 2013 and founded Axalta.[8] On November 12, 2014, the firm completed its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: AXTA).[9]
On January 21, 2015, Axalta and Chinese industrial coatings firm Shanghai Kinlita Chemical formed a partnership to operate in China.[10] In April 2015, Berkshire Hathaway invested $560 million in Axalta Coating Systems.[11] In July 2016, the firm acquired United Paint and Chemical Corp.'s automotive interior coatings business.[12]
The company currently operates in North America, South America, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.[13] The activities for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa region (EMEA) are based in Germany.[14] The company is also building a new research and development center located at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard known as the Global Innovation Center.[15]
In 1953 Axalta predecessor DuPont published the first annual Color Popularity Report, the first in the industry to have extensive global data in one report. The firm developed L,a,b color equations, an important component of modern color science. It introduced the first waterborne electrical steel coating in the industry in the 1960s.[3]
Products[edit]
Among Axalta's oldest products are Standox and Spies Hecker. Cromax, a water-based product, and the industrial paints Nap-Gard, a powder coating for oil and gas pipeline companies, and Voltatex for electrical insulation, were introduced in the 1990s.[3] Other products made by Axalta include Abcite, Alesta, AquaEC, Audurra, Centari, Challenger, Harmonized Coating Technologies, Imron, and Nason.[16]
Motorsports[edit]




Jeff Gordon's Cromax-sponsored car at Texas Motor Speedway in 2013


Axalta currently sponsors the No. 88 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet SS of Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. and the No. 9 JR Motorsports Chevrolet Camaro of NASCAR Xfinity Series driver William Byron.[17] Previously, the company sponsored four-time series champion Jeff Gordon's No. 24 car, a relationship which dated back to Axalta's days as DuPont and Gordon's first Cup race in 1992. As of the 2016 Brickyard 400, Gordon has won three times in an Axalta-sponsored car, all of which were in 2014.[18] During Gordon's career, he ran variations of his Axalta scheme to promote its brands such as Cromax[19] and Standox.[20] On February 12, 2015, Gordon was hired by Axalta as a global business advisor.[1] In 2015, Axalta sponsored Regan Smith's JR Motorsports Camaro for the Axalta Faster. Tougher. Brighter. 200 at Phoenix International Raceway; the company has been a partner of the team since 2008.[21]
Axalta provides paint for the entire Hendrick team, along with three other NASCAR teams: Camping World Truck Series' Kyle Busch Motorsports, JR Motorsports, and the Cup Series' Stewart-Haas Racing. IndyCar Series team Sarah Fisher Hartman Racing also receives paint from Axalta.[22] In addition to sponsoring Gordon, Axalta sponsored the June Cup Series race at Pocono Raceway, known as the Axalta "We Paint Winners" 400[23] (now known as the Axalta presents the Pocono 400) and the March Xfinity Series race at Phoenix International Raceway, called the Axalta Faster. Tougher. Brighter. 200[24] until 2017, when DC Solar replaced it as sponsor.[25]
Axalta also sponsors snocross team Judnick Motorsport/Polaris Racing, who field riders Ross Martin and James Johnstad in the AMSOIL Championship Snocross series. The sponsorship lasts through 2017.[26]
In 2015, Axalta became the title sponsor of the C2 Team, which competes in Stock Car Brasil.[27] The team currently fields cars for Júlio Campos and Gabriel Casagrande.[28]
Through its Spies Hecker brand, Axalta provides paint for Formula One team Mercedes AMG F1. Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff stated the lightness of the paint allows the team's Silver Arrows cars to drop in weight, assisting in performance.[29]

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
