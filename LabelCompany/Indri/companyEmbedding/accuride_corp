 Genuine Gunite Brake Drums
When consistent performance, safety and quality matter, there is one clear choice.  Recent side-by-side durability testing of three drum models show Gunite’s 3600A®X brake drum performed 15% longer than the primary North American competitor and 2X longer than offshore drums. Click here to learn more.


Standard Full-Cast Drums (3600A®/ 3600A®X)
Only from the market leader for OEM first-fit performance and quality can you get Gunite 3600A® standard full-cast brake drums. Gunite standard full-cast brake drums are 16.5” x 7” (most popular size), which is the preferred alternative to off-shore and price-point drums. Available as factory balanced to 20 in-oz for improved ride characteristics, Gunite standard full-cast brake drums feature 1.0” drilled mounting holes for tighter dimensional control.
Valued for their quality and performance, Gunite 3600A® brake drums meet the requirements of all North American truck and trailer OEMs. The very same drum is also available in the aftermarket.
For the best performance and lowest overall life cycle costs, remember that there is only one true “3600A®,” and it only comes from Gunite. Accept no substitute.
Gunite 3600A Brake Drum Specification Sheet (PDF)
New!  Gunite Silver Lightweight Brake Drum
The all-new Gunite Silver Lightweight Brake Drum (4000X) utilizes engineered design enhancements and an advanced metallurgy to affordably achieve the weight savings you need without compromising the performance you expect.
Just 99.5 lbs., the Gunite Silver Lightweight drum is the lightest standard full-cast drum in this market segment and provides a 100 lb. weight savings for a tractor/trailer combination.
At 12.5 lbs. lighter than the industry standard 3600A®X and only 5.5 lbs. heavier than our premium lightweight GOLD® 9006X, Gunite provides another weight reduction option at an affordable price.
That’s technology leadership!
Gunite Silver Lightweight Brake Drum Brochure (PDF)
Gunite Brake Drum Unrivaled American Advantage
Value Plus Brake Drums (3922X)
Gunite engineered and manufactured the Value Plus Brake Drum to meet the demanding requirements of the heavy-duty trucking aftermarket, at a lower price than OE-original brake drums.
Gunite Value Plus Brake Drums are factory balanced for improved ride characteristics, feature drilled mounting holes for tighter dimensional control, and are rated up to 24,000 lbs GAWR for more application coverage.
100% MADE IN THE USA, Gunite Value Plus Brake Drums are a preferred alternative to off-shore and price-point drums.
Available to mix and match with 3600A® and 3600A®X truckload orders.
Gunite Value Plus Brake Drum Specification Sheet (PDF)
Gunite Optimum Lightweight Drum (GOLD) (9006X)
The New GOLD Standard: Lightweight, Longer Life, Less Downtime, Reduced Operating
Patented Gunite GOLD lightweight, full-cast brake drums are the lightest full-cast brake drums in the industry. Comparable in weight to steel shell composite brake drums, Gunite GOLD brake drums save as much as 170 lb. vs. standard full-cast drums on a typical tractor/trailer application, while offering the same superior performance characteristics as Gunite’s standard full-cast drums.
Gunite GOLD brake drums have been proven to outperform steel shell composite brake drums in extreme cycle to failure dynamometer tests, lasting two times longer than the nearest competitor of steel shell composite brake drums at high speed brake applications of 70 mph. Plus, GOLD brake drums feature reduced brake noise compared to lightweight steel shell composite brake drums.
Available in configurations to fit all of the common wheel-end applications, Gunite GOLD brake drums give you superior brake performance and longer service life, which translates into less downtime and reduced operating costs.

Heavy Duty Brake Drums (3576X)
Gunite has been designing and manufacturing brake drums for the heavy-duty commercial vehicle industry since 1923. To this day, Gunite continues to be the industry standard, with heavy duty brake drums as standard equipment with more OEMs than any other brake drum manufacturer.
Tru-Pilot Brake Drums
Superior Brake Performance, Significantly Lower Life Cycle Costs
Gunite Tru-Pilot Brake Drums feature a unique bi-level piloting system designed to help maintenance personnel properly install and seat the brake drum quickly and accurately during routine wheel-end maintenance procedures.
The exclusive, patented dual step pilot system uses the hub’s wheel pilot to help accurately align the drum onto the hub’s brake drum pilot. This feature can help eliminate damage to the hub pilots, which occurs when the drum is improperly seated during the installation process. Without proper seating, the hub pilot can be damaged on traditional ferrous hubs, resulting in the brake drum not properly seating against the mounting surface of the hub. The problem is even more prevalent with aluminum hubs, where one simple mis-piloting of the drum can actually destroy the hub mounting pilot, requiring the hub to be replaced.

Steel Disc Wheels
Accuride Wheel End Solutions has set the industry standard for steel wheel construction and quality for decades. In fact, ours is the #1 steel wheel in North America. The reason is simple. Our years of experience and our computer-aided designs provide the highest strength, the lightest weight and the best ride of any steel wheel on the market; and each wheel is meticulously assembled under Accuride’s strict guidelines for optimum quality, performance and service life.
With the industry’s widest product range, Accuride is the choice of leading truck and trailer OEMs, and are an essential wheel end component.
To learn more about Accuride steel wheel product offerings, continue reading below or view the 2016 Accuride Wheels Product Catalog (PDF).
Tubeless Steel Wheels
Accuride produces more medium/heavy truck steel wheels and demountable rims than any other manufacturer in North America. Our advanced designed disc wheels are standard products at all major truck and most major trailer OEMs. Tubeless disc wheels offer optimal strength and are lightweight, applicable for any load rating in the industry. Multiple powder coatings choices allow you to customize the coating for a specific color and particular road or weather condition. Tubeless disc wheels are also available in Heavy Duty versions for special applications.
Tube-Type Steel Wheels
Accuride supplies select high quality multi-piece tube-type disc wheel and demountable rim products for the medium/heavy commercial truck industry. The tube-type disc wheels are available in both hub-piloted and stud-piloted mounting styles to meet or exceed customer requirements.
Extra Service Wheels (ESW)
Accuride steel Extra Service Wheels (ESW), which offer a variety of extra services and features to the commercial vehicle industry, include heavy-/medium-duty truck, trailer and bus tubeless and tub-type wheels.
Accu-Lite® Steel Wheels
Ideal for Additional Payload | Fuel Savings
As new emission standards are resulting in weight being added to vehicles, Accuride has developed Accu-Lite® Steel Wheels, featuring high-strength, low-alloy (HSLA) steel, to counterbalance the added weight. With Accu-Lite Steel Wheels, you can enjoy all of the advantages of increased payload and fuel savings without reducing load rating.
As a leader in wheel technology, Accuride Wheel End Solutions has raised the standard of steel wheels by lowering the weight of our two and five hand hole extra service wheels (ESW) by eight pounds! Two hand hole Accu-Lite Steel Wheels weigh only 67 lb., and five hand hole Accu-Lite Steel Wheels weigh only 65 lb. That translates to a potential savings of 54 pounds for tractor/trailer combinations, and they look exactly the same as Accuride’s industry standard two and five hand hole design.
With Accuride’s 10 hand hold design, which weighs only 66 lb., you get a wheel boasting the same load rating as a standard steel wheel with the weight nearing that of an aluminum wheel…all at a fraction of the cost.
Accu-Lite Steel Wheels Specification Sheet (PDF)
Duplex® Wide-Base Steel Wheels

Accuride manufacturers a complete line of steel Duplex® wide-based disc wheels for the commercial truck industry. Duplex disc wheels are available in hub-piloted, stud-piloted, and heavy duty stud-piloted mounting styles as well as demountable rim assemblies. Accuride provides a full range of Duplex wheels to fit almost any “wide-based tire” application.
DupleX-One Wheels
Accuride’s DupleX-One wheels – available in steel and aluminum – offer a unique method to reduce fuel expense or increase payload capacity by replacing traditional dual wheel sets with one 22.5” x 14.00” wheel on tandem-axle tractors and trailers.

Aluminum Wheels
Whether you specify Accuride aluminum wheels for weight savings, heat dissipation, resale value, or driver retention, it’s imperative that you receive the best value for your dollar!
To learn more about Accuride aluminum wheel product offerings, continue reading below or view the 2016 Accuride Wheels Product Catalog PDF).

Accu-Lite® Aluminum Wheels
The Lightest and Brightest in the Industry
With the introduction of Accu-Lite® Aluminum Wheels – with their lighter weight and superior finish – Accuride once again set a new standard for lightweight aluminum wheels! We not only shaved weight off our previously lightweight wheels, but we also streamlined our available part numbers to make specifying even easier.
All Accu-Lite Aluminum Wheels are available with Standard Polish (SP), Extra Polish (XP) and Extra Polish with Accu-Shield (XPC).
NEW! Four popular Accu-Lite Aluminum Wheels are now available with the premium Accu-Armor Aluminum Wheel Surface Treatment!

DupleX-One Wheels
Accuride’s DupleX-One wheels – available in steel and aluminum – offer a unique method to reduce fuel expense or increase payload capacity by replacing traditional dual wheel sets with one 22.5” x 14.00” wheel on tandem-axle tractors and trailers.
Accuride Steel and Aluminum Duplex Wheels Specification Sheet (PDF)
Accu-Shield® Aluminum Wheels
Low Maintenance   |  Easy Cleaning Finish
Accu-Shield® aluminum wheels were designed and engineered to have – and keep –their bright, shiny appearance even under the rigorous conditions of the trucking industry. Accu-Shield aluminum wheels clean quickly and easily with only mild soap and water or standard non-abrasive household cleaners, saving time and money on polishing and maintenance.
Until now, the procedure for keeping conventional truck and trailer wheels free of dirt and corrosion involved hours of scouring and scrubbing to remove grime. Under these conditions, polished aluminum wheels can begin to corrode causing the wheels to appear dingy and gray. Accuride set out to develop the lowest maintenance aluminum wheel in the industry without sacrificing the appealing shiny appearance. The result is Accu-Shield aluminum wheels, providing superior shine that is simple to care for and durable enough to perform beyond expectations.
The Accu-Shield treatment can be specified to enhance the XP, SP, AOP, AIP, and ABP polishes. Cannot be combined with the Accu-Armor surface treatment.
To protect the finish of Accu-Shield wheels, Accuride highly recommends the use of Wheel-Guard separator plates.

NEW! Accu-Flange™ Aluminum Wheels 
Reduces Rim Flange Wear  |  Extends Wheel Life
Protecting your aluminum wheel investment just got easier with Accu-Flange™ aluminum wheels from Accuride. 
Its special protective coating at the wheel’s peak wear surfaces minimizes abrasion between the tire wall and wheel rim, significantly extending the service life of your wheels. That’s money-saving news for fleets that carry heavy loads and loads prone to shifting such as logs, metals, gravel, liquids or even passengers. The advantages also apply to fleets making frequent stops and starts, such as those in transit or refuse applications.
Accu-Flange™ keeps your wheels and tires in service longer, lowering your total cost of operation. That’s the durability, performance and value you can count on from Accuride.
Ordering Accu-Flange is easy. Just order the Accuride aluminum wheel you need and add an F to the end of the part number.  Accu-Flange is available on the following Accuride wheels:

Accu-Armor™ Aluminum Wheel Surface Treatment
Scratch and Corrosion Resistant  |  Very Low Maintenance   | Ideal for Vocational Use
Accuride’s distinctive Accu-Armor™ premium aluminum wheel surface treatment is ideal for applications that require low maintenance and corrosion-resistant performance. Accu-Armor wheels are highly resistant to the kinds of scuffs and scratches that occur during normal wear and should never corrode. This makes them ideal for use in vocational settings where weight sensitivity and low maintenance are key. In addition, the distinctive look has real appeal for those who want a rig that stands out from the crowd.
An alternative to standard SP, AOP, AIP, and ABP polishes, the Accu-Armor Aluminum Wheel Surface Treatment is available on the following Accuride wheels:

        Accuride Corp. Increased Aluminum Wheel Production in 2011
    



        Accuride Corp. announces it increased aluminum wheel production capacity in 2011 to meet its customers increased demand for aluminum products.
    




        Accuride Corp.
    



        January 3, 2012
    




Accuride Corporation – a supplier of components to the commercial vehicle industry – announces that it significantly enhanced its aluminum wheel production capacity during 2011 through a combination of strategic acquisitions, key process technology investments and transfers of aluminum wheel machining lines within its operations. These steps were part of a $35 million strategic initiative to boost Accuride’s ability to serve the commercial vehicle industry’s increasing demand for high-quality aluminum wheels.
“Many factors, including fuel economy requirements, residual value and aesthetics, are driving the growth in aluminum wheel demand in the North American commercial vehicle industry,” says Rick Dauch, President and Chief Executive Officer, Accuride. “Accuride is investing to ensure that we have the right production capacity in place when and where our customers need it, whether for steel or aluminum wheels. We’re also raising our standards for product dependability and finish to meet customers’ ever-increasing expectations.”
In June 2011, Accuride acquired substantially all of the assets of Forgitron Technologies LLC, including an 80,000-square-foot aluminum wheel manufacturing facility located in Camden, SC. Accuride stopped production at Camden during the following month to convert its production capacity to the Accuride brand standards. Plant manufacturing systems and controls, as well as customer order management and sales programs were also integrated into Accuride systems.  Now producing Accuride-branded aluminum wheels for the commercial vehicle market, the Camden plant increased Accuride’s aluminum wheel manufacturing capacity in North America by 21%.
In November 2011, Accuride launched its new Mega-Line – one of the highest-technology aluminum wheel production lines in North America – at its plant in Erie, PA. The new Mega-Line employs a fully automated manufacturing process that uses a centralized, closed-loop system for chip and coolant management. The line’s eight robots take a forged, spun and heat-treated raw wheel through the turning, pre-stress, milling, coining and Rösler surface finishing processes to produce durable, high-gloss aluminum wheels that are ready for shipment with zero manual intervention. The Mega-Line established a new industry benchmark in process technology and boosted Accuride’s total aluminum wheel manufacturing capacity by another 42%. 
In response to growing demand in Mexico, Accuride also transferred an existing manual-process aluminum wheel machining line to Accuride de Mexico’s 226,000-square-foot Monterrey, Mexico plant during the summer. The new aluminum wheel line was operating at full capacity in November 2011, establishing Accuride de Mexico as the country’s only single-source supplier of both steel and aluminum wheels for the local medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicle market. The capacity expansion also positioned Accuride closer to its customers’ expanding footprint in the region.
As part of its aluminum wheel machining investments, Accuride also installed additional polishing equipment in its Erie and Monterrey facilities. This new equipment established a higher standard of enhanced finish for Accuride’s aluminum wheel product portfolio and increased efficiency and productivity.
According to Scott Hazlett, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Accuride Wheels, Accuride’s investments were driven by three strategic objectives:

Maximizing the use of existing      aluminum wheel production and machining capacity to satisfy customer needs      across the company’s market segments and regions; 
Establishing new capacity in      regions where customer assembly plants are concentrated; and 
Investing in advanced      production processes to achieve higher standards of product quality and      finishing for the company’s aluminum wheel portfolio.

“By strategically managing our existing capacity and investing in key acquisitions and capacity initiatives, Accuride is fortifying its status as a leading aluminum wheel supplier to the North American commercial vehicle industry,” says Hazlett. “Further, with our proven steel wheel expertise and extensive product portfolio, we’re able to seamlessly serve as a single-source supplier for our customers’ aluminum and steel wheel needs.”
“We plan to make further significant capital investments in manufacturing equipment, products and process technologies across all of our core businesses during 2012 and 2013 in order to strengthen the value and dependability we offer our customers,” Dauch adds.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
