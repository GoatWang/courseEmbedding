Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

What are analysts saying about Oracle Corporation stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Oracle Corporation stock: 
1. KeyCorp analysts commented, "We focused on Oracle’s cloud transition, and how moving to the cloud can generate 3x the revenue per customer, as well as Oracle’s opportunity in the SaaS market. Oracle’s opportunity in cloud and SaaS, and valuation, have been the main area of investor push-back since our upgrade. As Oracle continues to execute on its cloud transition, we believe multiple expansion can continue. Key Investment Points Oracle on average could see 3x the revenue from a customer who moves its workload from on-premise to the cloud. Transitions at Autodesk and Adobe, showed lifetime customer value driven from the cloud is much higher than from on-premise. As Oracle moves its customers to the cloud, it should gain a similar benefit. For the customer, migrating to the cloud can lead to significant overall cost savings, based on labor and hardware costs needed to manage on-premise solutions." (7/18/2017)
2. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Oracle has outperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. The company's offerings in SaaS and PaaS have gained significant momentum in the past few quarters, which improves competitive position against salesforce.com and Workday. Further, the introduction of Gen 2 IaaS data centers is expected to improve Oracle’s competitive prowess against Amazon. We believe the company’s growing cloud market share will continue to drive top-line growth for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, estimates have been going up ahead of the company's Q4 earnings release. However, the transition from on-premise licensing to cloud-based subscription business model will take some more time to complete, which will impact upcoming results. Moreover, higher investments on IaaS will affect gross margin expansion. Further, a strong U.S. dollar remains a headwind." (6/15/2017)
3. UBS AG analysts commented, "Hardware and services misses in ORCL's F3Q results were handily offset by Cloud and a surprise license upside, with disciplined opex ' G&A especially low on 1x items ' delivering 42.5% OPM, +100bps ahead of consensus. A lower tax rate also helped (UBSe ~3c impact), lifting F3Q EPS to 69c or 7c ahead of Street. This marks the first Q since Nov'14 ORCL has beat both consensus revs and EPS, and combined with 1) healthy ARR growth +73% cc - renders the reiterated FY $2B +40% y/y target more achievable, 2) indications more operating efficiency can be had (headcount -800 q/q the largest since May'10) - still targeting double-digit EPS growth in FY18 by net income improvement vs. buyback driven share count reduction, 3) demonstrable balance sheet strength - ORCL announced an unanticipated +27% dividend increase with results; 4) reasonable valuation; and 5) optionality from tax reform we think shares could garner incremental interest with inflecting fundamentals providing the basis for ORCL's valuation disconnect to narrow vs. peers and market multiples; maintain Buy." (3/16/2017)
4. Wedbush analysts commented, "ORCL's 3Q/Feb. looked better than its 2Q performance, based on our calculations of organic results. As we expected, SaaS and PaaS metrics benefited from the addition of NetSuite, but they also looked better organically. Also, good cost control and an improved tax rate give us reasons to be more positive on the outlook for FY18 EPS growth. However, we remain concerned that consensus expectations for FY18 revenues (about 3% implied organic constant-currency Y/Y) look too high. Although margins could improve next year as optics benefit from the cloud transition, we think they could be pressured longer-term due to a more competitive cloud pricing environment for enterprise applications and database. We would stay on the sidelines." (3/16/2017)
5. Barclays PLC analysts commented, "If the company continues to deliver we think investors would need to re-think the story which could lead to multiple expansion. FX continues to be a headwind but we are starting to see increasing cash flow from the cloud transition story. Hence, we raise our price target to $51 from $47 and reiterate our Overweight rating." (3/16/2017)

 Educational Background



 


New York University

                  Founded in 1831, New York University is now one of the largest private universities in the United States. Of the more than 3,000 colleges and universities in America, New York University is one of only 60 member institutions of the distinguished Association of American Universities.

From a student body of 158 during NYU's very first semester, enrollment has grown to more than 40,000 students attending 18 schools and colleges at five major centers in Manhattan and in sites in Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America. Today, students come from every state in the union and from 133 foreign countries. The faculty, which initially consisted of fourteen professors and lecturers (among them artist and inventor Samuel F. B. Morse), now totals over 3,100 full-time members whose research and teaching encompasses the humanities, the sciences, and the social sciences; the law; medicine; business; education; the fine arts, studio art, and the performing and cinematic arts; music; social work; public administration; the ancient world; and continuing and professional studies. With more than 2,500 courses offered, the University awards more than 25 different degrees.  Although overall the University is large, the individuals schools and colleges are small- to moderate-sized units—each with its own traditions, programs, and faculty – and there are many communities to be found within the NYU community based on interests, activities, and shared experiences.

The center of NYU is its Washington Square campus in the heart of Greenwich Village. One of the city's most creative and energetic communities, the Village is a historic neighborhood that has attracted generations of writers, musicians, artists, and intellectuals. NYU, in keeping with its founder’s vision, is “in and of the city”: the University – which has no walls and no gates – is deeply intertwined with New York City, drawing inspiration from its vitality.

In addition to its Manhattan locations, the University is also formally affiliated the Polytechnic Institute of NYU in Brooklyn, the second oldest school of engineering and technology in the country, and has research facilities, notably the Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine,  in Sterling Forest, near Tuxedo, New York.

And NYU has established itself as the first global network university, with a comprehensive liberal arts campus in Abu Dhabi – the first to be operated abroad by a major U.S. research university – and other sites for study and research in Accra, Ghana; Berlin, Germany; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Florence, Italy; London, England; Madrid, Spain; Paris, France; Prague, the Czech Republic; Shanghai, China; and Tel Aviv, Israel, among other locations.
