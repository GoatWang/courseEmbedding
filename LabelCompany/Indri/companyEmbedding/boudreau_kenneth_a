Sustainability






Our Company
American Made
At Coriander Designs, we are PROUD to manufacture all our products in America.  Since 1979, Coriander Designs business model of keeping its manufacturing in the USA has resulted in a smaller eco-footprint, local job creation and long term manufacturing stability.  By manufacturing all of our products at our Woodinville Washington headquarters we are able to be flexible in our product offerings, thus meeting the customers needs efficiently and effectively.  We have total control over materials that allows for the assurance of the highest quality.  Designed for your application / Built to last the test of time and ALL manufactured here in the United States of America.




History
The value of Family
Coriander Designs began in 1979 in the two car garage of founder Kenneth Boudreau. Mr. Boudreau believed his name was on each piece of furniture that left the “factory” doors. This resulted in extreme durability, masterful craftsmanship, and pleased customers. The superior products coupled with a dedication to customer service, has made Coriander Designs a responsive partner for the industry’s needs.
Starting with one design for an end table, and a corporate motto for eagerness to meet the customer’s desires, modifications have led to an endless catalog of unique seating and casegood products. Since the commencement of the design team in 1980, Coriander Designs has seen a parade of styles from traditional, to modern, to the unnamable. Whatever the style, whatever the shape, whatever the quantity, each item carries with it the promise of the founder, a promise of quality and durability. Moreover, customer service beyond the sale is synonymous with Coriander Designs.
With the 30th anniversary of the founding of Coriander Designs came a fresh perspective rooted in the same values. Carly Boudreau, second generation owner, brings an understanding of the unique contemporary demands, while ensuring the maintenance of the core values that made Coriander Designs the reliable provider by which it has become known.

A fusion of craftsmanship with state of the art machinery


Mortise and tenon joinery, kiln dried solids to levels of 7%, hand matched veneers, climate controlled storage, machinery exact to 1/1000th of a millimeter, laser sharpened tools, experienced and skilled craftsmen, all combine to ensure the highest quality product reaches the consumers. The average tenure of our employees is ten and half years. Each our Employees’ skills and experience can be seen and felt in the fantastic fit and finish of our products. All of Coriander Designs products are made from the finest quality, FAS Grade Lumber available. All stains are applied by hand and allowed to air dry. Then sprayed with a sealer coat of catalyzed varnish. After the sealer coat is dry, the item is hand sanded using 400 grit paper and 4 additional top coats of catalyzed varnish is applied. The catalyzed varnish is a high solid, water-white conversion varnish with a UV block.






Sustainability
Building a better future
At Coriander Designs, we are committed to incorporating sustainable materials and environmentally sound manufacturing practices, so that our family owned business can pass on the tradition to future generations. Based in the environmentally conscious Pacific Northwest, Coriander Designs has long been responsible for protecting their natural surroundings. Coriander Designs sought out and found formaldehyde free, low VOC, yet durable and reliable finishes. Coriander continues to seek novel ways to meet industry requirements and fulfill our responsibility to the environment. Every choice you make contributes to the health of the planet. At Coriander Designs, we are committed to utilizing renewable resources and earth friendly materials to contribute to a sustainable future. Living green can be an individual choice but we like to think of it as our community goal.


Green Series
Any item we produce can be made with to the highest environmental conscious standards by incorporating FSC Solid Woods and Cores,  CARB compliant Catalyzed Conversion Varnish, CFC Free Foam made with Recyclable Materials, Fabrics made from 100% recycled materials, Drawer Slides that are RoHS Compliant.


Recycling Everyday
Recycling has been integrated into every department, including retention ponds surrounding the factory to protect against the impact of storm runoff. Coriander Designs recycles the fall-down from production as well as all of our sawdust, and the fabric remnants are sent to design colleges


Car Pool
Because the average commuter travels approximately 39 miles each day and  add up to an extra 39 hours per year on the road due to gridlock. We offer incentives for finding alternative ways of getting to work.  We are proud to announce that 91% of Coriander Designs’ employees carpool, ride mass transit, or ride their bicycle to work daily.


Blanket Wrapped Shipping
Coriander’s preferred shipping method is blanket wrap. We re-use the blankets for every order. We have determined that blanket wrapped shipping is the most environmentally sound way of shipping and also holds the drivers more accountable to ensure the product has arrived in the condition it left the factory.
