Wire Harnesses

Automotive electric connection systems are becoming increasingly larger and more complex.  In line with this trend, we are constantly focused on thin, light weight, productive solutions that are friendly to the environment.


Steering Roll Connectors (SRC)

Through use of our flat harness technology, this component produces a signal that triggers deployment of the air bag. Furukawa Electric holds the top spot in market share for this product.





Connectors

We have developed a full line of compact, highly-reliable connector components, fully utilizing Furukawa Electric's high-performance materials.


Slide-door Harnesses

This component supplies continuous power to the sliding door regardless of position.  Our systems can provide superior flexibility and independence to your wiring systems with our compact, light, and streamlined structure.





Metal Core PCB for Junction Boxes and Relay Boxes

By reducing circuit width, we have achieved great reductions in box size though use of our "Metal Core PCB".  Our proprietary PCB solution provides uniform heat generation and distribution around relays resulting in a compact, technically-superior connection system.
