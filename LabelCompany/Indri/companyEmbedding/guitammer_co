Home Theater
 The ButtKicker low frequency transducer accurately reproduces bass and special effects from the subwoofer and .1 LFE sound tracks.

Gaming and Simulation
The ButtKicker Gamer lets you feel all of the action from your games and simulators.
Feel the gut-wrenching punch of machine-gun fire, the pounding of chopper blades, explosions, racing engines, gear shifts, rumble strips, landing gear, engine throttle and more.
Turn down or turn off your subwoofer and still feel all the bass - even while using headphones.

About The Guitammer Company




"Guitammer" comes from the conjunction of "guitar" and"hammer" and is pronounced, "git-ammer."





guitammer.com »

The Guitammer Company was originally founded by Ken McCaw, an accomplished musician, composer and producer, in order to commercialize a patented guitar accessory called the Hammer Jammer.
ButtKicker® brand low frequency audio transducers were developed to solve a problem Ken (a bass player) and his drummer had. They wanted to be able to feel the low end without turning the stage monitors up so loud that it disturbed the rest of the band.
Joining forces with Marvin Clamme, former sound engineer for Tom Jones, Merle Haggard, the Beach Boys and others Ken and Marvin worked together to develop the original ButtKicker transducer prototypes.
After several years of product development, a patent was issued for this new magnetically suspended transducer. ButtKicker brand low frequency audio transducers began to be sold in late 1999.
