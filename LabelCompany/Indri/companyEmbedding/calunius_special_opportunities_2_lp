I purchased three at that time and now am in need of more so here I am. The first ones I purchased worked fine and I will continue to use them as long as they perform as well as the first ones did.

With this order, I ordered more cartridges and received them the next day via USPS.  I was very surprised.  It seems that LD products listened to my previous comments and reacted appropriately.  That was amazing.  For any company to change how they do ship items based on feedback shows good customer support.  I am very happy with the cartridges and will be using many more of their cartridges in the future.

I was a General Appraiser and she a Residential Appraiser. We used LD Products for most of the Time we had our office at home. I have been well satisfied with LD products. Over time we accumulated a number of used cartridges.   When we used original Xerox cartridges they could be shipped back to them without our paying the cost of shipping. I don't know your current policy in that regard.    I plan to print out my order and mail payment probably prior to the 11th of July. Allowing five working days it should be on hand prior to the 18th.  RT                   Jul 26, 2017  Haven't yet opened product as it was bought to replace another still in use.

The quality of the toner is very good and consistent. Please work on improving the print quality towards the end of the cartridge life, after 6 months the print tends to be lighter with every print.

Description


Tweet




This summer, Kool G Rap will release his new solo album, Return Of The Don, which is entirely produced by MoSS and features a veritable who’s who list of new and familiar spitters; Freeway, Noreaga, Cormega, Raekwon, Sheek Louch, Saigon, Termanology, Fame, KXNG Crooked, Conway The Machine & Westside Gunn (the newest signees to Eminem’s Shady Records) and the late Sean Price.
“Rest in peace to Sean Price who I was fortunate enough to record with” G Rap commented. “What motivates me to get in the studio is really being in that creative zone that you cannot just enter on demand” G Rap stated. “It is more like an extremely powerful vibe that overcomes you. It’s triggered by hearing a particular track, or being inspired by another artist; or, a life experience that makes your mind and heart open up and lyrics just pour from your soul in the capacity of an avalanche. That’s what The Return Of The Don represents; an amalgamation of past, present and future and a tribute to some of my most favorite spitters worldwide; this is my salute to those artists."
Canadian born (and a Toronto resident), MoSS’ production credits are instantly recognizable and have resulted in over 2 million record sales worldwide. Ghostface Killah’s smash hit “Kilos”, Raekwon’s ”Have Mercy”, Obie Trice’s entire Special Reserve album and most recently his debut producer album, Marching To The Sound Of My Own Drum, which featured appearances from Joe Budden, DJ Premier, AZ, Joell Ortiz, Sean Price, Jon Connor, Skyzoo, Inspectah Deck, Havoc, Slum Village and others.
MoSS reflected on the creative journey that would become Return Of The Don. "G Rap and I have worked together a few times over the years and we reconnected and started recording songs that ended up being the foundation to The Return Of The Don. The album kind of took on a life of its own."

Joseph Abajian (DJ Jab) founded Fat Beats in 1994 with nothing more than a shoestring budget and an earnest obsession with the music, the culture, and the brotherhood of New York’s burgeoning rap scene. What began as a simple vinyl shop in Manhattan’s Lower East Side quickly became an integral hub for artists, both aspiring and established, to convene and collaborate on new projects. Joseph’s timing couldn’t have been more impeccable. When the 90’s cultural zeitgeist – and, in turn, the music industry establishment – chose hip-hop as its new arbiter of cool.International tourists and touring artists alike flocked to Fat Beats for rare vinyl, kindred spirits, and exclusive in-store performances from Jay Z, Eminem, Gang Starr, Outkast, Slum Village, Mos Def, and more. One thing was clear: the Fat Beats phenomenon could no longer be contained in a single basement shop.In the late nineties, Abajian proceeded to open new stores in Amsterdam, Tokyo, Los Angeles, and Atlanta. He further expanded the company’s profile to include global distribution and record label branches. Distribution has since proven to be the company’s strongest and most enduring enterprise. Today Fat Beats Distribution stands poised as one of the country’s pre-eminent distributors of vinyl & specialty item records: a proud survivor in an industry now famous for its mortality rate. Despite market fluctuations, technology innovations, and stylistic revolutions, Fat Beats has remained steadfast in its commitment to the timeless vinyl format and to the loyal community who keeps it spinning.

•We try and offer as many upcoming projects available for pre-order when the releases have moved into production. However, due to the nature of manufacturing and production, pre-order dates may change. If your pre-ordered items are holding your package from arriving please email us with a request to ship the in-stock items and pre-orders when they become available. 
•If your order contains pre-order items we will hold the package until all titles are available to ship. Please specify in the comments section of the checkout if you would like to:  a) hold your entire order until it can be entirely fulfilled or, b) have the in-stock items shipped immediately and the pre-ordered items ship when available. Please note that option B may require additional shipping charges as multiple packages will be shipped.
   
OUT OF STOCK ITEMS 
• Our stock rapidly changes and we try and set in place a system that avoids purchasing items that become out of stock. However, if a product ordered is out of stock, we will reach out and give you the chance to change or cancel your order. If you choose to cancel, you will be refunded in full.  
IMPORTANT BILLING ADDRESS & PHONE NUMBER  
• IMPORTANT: If the address or phone number supplied conflicts with other information provided, i.e. billing information versus shipping information, we may need to contact you to verify your purchase. Please be available to verify or write an explanation in the notes section during checkout explaining the conflicting information.
•Please make sure you give us your correct billing address and your correct billing phone number.  Again, it is highly important that you are available at the provided number or email submitted to speed up verification time enabling us to avoid fraudulent purchases.
 
RETURN POLICY

 • All sales are final. However, if the item ordered is different from the item you receive, please contact us and we can arrange to get you the desired product.
 
PRIVACY POLICY
• We are committed to protecting your privacy. There is an opt-in policy to receive marketing and other e-blasts about future products available as well as deals and coupons. If you do not wish to receive these emails you can opt out by simply removing the check from the marketing box below upon check out. We will never sell your email or personal information. 
 
SECURITY POLICY 
• Your payment and personal information is always safe. Our SSL (secure server software) is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. It encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name, and address, so that it cannot be read over the internet.
