JDRF Honors Terry and Louise Gregg with 2010 Angel Award | Business Wire


























































      JDRF Honors Terry and Louise Gregg with 2010 Angel Award
    





April 19, 2010 05:50 PM Eastern Daylight Time



SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM) today announced that The Greater Los Angeles 
      Chapter of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) will 
      bestow one of its highest honors, the 2010 Angel Award, to Terry and 
      Louise Gregg. The Greggs have long been active supporters and personal 
      contributors to diabetes research. The Greggs will receive the award at 
      the JDRF’s annual fundraiser gala on May 6, 2010 at the Beverly Hilton 
      Hotel. Past honorees include First Lady Nancy Reagan, award winning 
      singer/songwriter Garth Brooks, champion boxer Sugar Ray Leonard, 
      pediatric endocrinologist Francine Kaufman, and philanthropist Barbara 
      Davis.
    


      "The leadership, passion and commitment that Terry and Louise have shown 
      in the fight against diabetes have been uniquely incredible. They have 
      made a real impact that few others have done,” said Steve Edelman, 
      Professor of Medicine in the Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes & 
      Metabolism at the University of California, San Diego and founder and 
      director of Taking Control of Your Diabetes. ”Louise and I are honored 
      by this recognition and we will continue to work with those that are 
      motivated to making a difference in the diabetes world until a cure is 
      found,” said Gregg.
    

      Terrance H. Gregg is President and CEO of DexCom, Inc. He is also 
      currently a Special Venture Partner with Galen Partners, a private 
      equity firm specializing in the healthcare industry. Additionally Mr. 
      Gregg sits on the board of directors of “Taking Control of Your 
      Diabetes,” a non-profit educational program. In 2002 he retired as 
      President of Medtronic MiniMed, a world leader in diabetes management 
      systems. He became President and Chief Operating Officer of MiniMed, 
      Inc. in 1996 and was instrumental in Medtronic's $3.4 billion 
      acquisition of MiniMed in 2001. Mr. Gregg served as the 2003-2004 Chair 
      of the Research Foundation Board of the American Diabetes Association, 
      and in 2003, Mr. Gregg and his wife were recognized by the American 
      Diabetes Association with an award for Outstanding Service in Diabetes 
      Research Funding.
    

      Since its founding in 1970 by parents of children with Type 1 diabetes, 
      JDRF has awarded more than $1.3 billion to diabetes research grants. The 
      Los Angeles Chapter contributes roughly $4 million annually to diabetes 
      research.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements


      DexCom is a medical device company with a limited operating history. 
      Successful commercialization and sale of the company's products is 
      subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including product 
      performance, a lack of acceptance in the marketplace by physicians and 
      patients, the company's inability to manufacture products in commercial 
      quantities at an acceptable cost and quality level, possible delays in 
      the company's development programs, the inability of patients to receive 
      reimbursement from third-party payors and inadequate financial and other 
      resources. Certain of these risks and uncertainties, in addition to 
      other risks, are more fully described in the company's annual report on 
      Form 10-K for the period ending December 31, 2009, as filed with the 
      Securities and Exchange Commission on March 9, 2010.
