Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/25/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

But before you start sending out dozens of emails and making phone calls, sit down and think about your project. What's your budget? What is the scope of your project? Will you need more than one type of professional to complete your home improvement project? Can you afford to complete the full project now, or should you tackle it bit by bit?Once you've settled on your project’s priorities, budget and scope, it's time to start researching home design professionals. Don't sell yourself short and settle on the first professional you set your sights on. Make sure that you're working with someone local, who can get to the jobsite easily and efficiently. Look into the person’s reviews, ask to speak with former clients and to see previous jobs in person. Take a good look at their portfolio photos: How similar are these projects to your own? Be honest — that mansion might look beautiful, but it might not have a lot in common with your little bungalow.Reach out to multiple professionals — especially for larger projects — and don't settle for the first bid you hear. Comparing multiple Fort Worth, TX professionals' bids and experiences can help you find the one that’s best for you. Ask a lot of questions now, so you won't have unexpected answers later.Find a home design professional on Houzz. Narrow down your search by type of professional and location.

What does an interior designer do?A good home design professional will hone your style down to its very essence and be able to choose a functional layout that feels natural to you. Interior design companies can be involved as much or as little as the client desires. Many clients who hire an interior decorator in Fort Worth, TX — particularly those who are remodeling — have a good sense of how the room should look and what products they should use. Often clients will insist that interior decorators use the products already present in the house. Other times a designer will need to start from scratch — especially if this is a newly purchased or just-built home. An interior design company will need to figure out exactly what the client needs, which includes organizing rooms, picking flooring and wall colors, and finding furniture to complement it all. Sometimes that means he or she will have to recruit help from other Fort Worth, TX home professionals to help create the perfect look for your renovation. Here are some related professionals and vendors to complement the work of interior designers & decorators: Architects & Building Designers, General Contractors, Home Builders, Design-Build Firms, Photographers.Do your research before meeting with an interior designer or home decorator in Fort Worth, TX. Ask yourself what you want your space to become and what it will be used for. Figure out the extent of what you need help with, what your must-haves are and what your budget is. Interior design services can add up fast, so be up front with a potential design firm or individual from the beginning. Also, pick an interior decorator that fits your style. Browse through the portfolios of different Fort Worth interior design firms and decide if you would live in those houses. Just because you like something doesn’t mean you could live in it. There's a big difference! You can find more interior designers & decorators in Ft Worth, Ft. Worth, Arlington, North Richland Hills and Euless.Questions to ask when you meet with local Fort Worth interior designers: Can you give me a referral? (It makes a big difference to talk with a client who's worked with the designer before.) Can I see your design portfolio? When will the home renovation be done? Do you charge an hourly rate or a flat rate, or use the cost-plus method or a mixed method?Find an interior designer or home decorator in Fort Worth, TX on Houzz. Narrow your search in the Professionals section to find Fort Worth interior designers near you. You can also look through Fort Worth, TX photos to find a room you like, then contact the design firm who designed it. Professional Categories in Fort Worth
