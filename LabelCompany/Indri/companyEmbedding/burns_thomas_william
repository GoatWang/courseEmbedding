Thoughts and prayers to Thomas' family and friends. I want to share just one example of the good and kind things this man did. As a volunteer for Doberman Assistance Network (DAN) he provided a foster home for and helped rescue Doberman Pinschers who were stray or turned in to animal shelters. He fostered Sheila before helping her travel to her forever home with us in Nashville, TN. A few days after she got to us a care package from Thomas arrived filled with toys and treats for her. Just not fair that he had to go.

                My family and I have been using Thomas Burns as our attorney for many years. He is very dependable, trustworthy and very knowledgeable about the Law. One of the best things about Thomas is his compassion. He is so good with his clients. He makes you feel at ease and treats his clients like family. He is very good in the Court Room and handles each individual case with complete professionalism. More attorneys should be like him. I have and will always recommend Thomas as a very outstanding Lawyer

                At first, one of the nicest guys you will meet. But then.... like others have said: no work ethic, too busy playing & taking money to do any work, has the most unprofessional office staff I've ever seen, and will straight-up steal your money.He doesn't read emails or letters - so he's not listening. We hired him, he did NOTHING in 3 weeks and so we found someone else. Went to pick up the papers we gave him and get our money - he gave the papers back but not the money. He did NOTHING for the $$!

 Lawyer Response: 

                Client  retained me, paid small retainer to go to a hearing that was already set. We had to review 9 years of pleadings and do research. After 3 days and telling them they would probably lose they got upset and hired someone else, then wanted a refund.

William John Burns (October 19, 1861 – April 14, 1932), known as "America's Sherlock Holmes," is famous for having conducted a private investigation clearing Leo Frank of the murder of Mary Phagan,[1] and for serving as the director of the Bureau of Investigation (BOI) (predecessor to the FBI) from August 22, 1921 to May 10, 1924. He was born in Baltimore, Maryland and was educated in Columbus, Ohio. As a young man, Burns performed well as a Secret Service Agent and parleyed his reputation into the William J. Burns International Detective Agency, now a part of Securitas Security Services USA. A combination of natural ability as a detective combined with an instinct for publicity made Burns a national figure. His exploits made national news, the gossip columns of New York newspapers, and the pages of detective magazines, in which he published "true" crime stories based on his exploits.

Marriage and children[edit]
Burns married Annie M. Ressler in 1880. The couple had six children. Burns' sons, Raymond J. and William Sherman also worked as detectives for the William J. Burns National Detective Agency.[2]
Los Angeles Times bombing[edit]
The City of Los Angeles hired Burns to catch those responsible for the bombing of the Los Angeles Times building on October 1, 1910. Burns's son Raymond and police officers from the Detroit and Chicago police departments arrested Jim McNamara and associate Ortie McManigal on April 14, 1911 in Detroit. John McNamara was arrested later that month in Indianapolis, Indiana. Extradited to Los Angeles, the brothers pleaded guilty to murder in the bombing.[3]
BOI career[edit]
Burns was considered well qualified to direct the Bureau of Investigation, and was friends with President Warren Harding's Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty. Burns was confirmed as Director of the Bureau of Investigation on August 22, 1921. He continued to run the Burns Detective Agency throughout his tenure as Director of the BOI. Under Burns, the Bureau shrank from its 1920 high of 1,127 personnel to 600 employees in 1923. Burns was responsible for hiring the first female special agents, Alaska P. Davidson in 1922 and Jessie B. Duckstein in 1923.[4]
At the request of Attorney General Daugherty, Burns sent agents to investigate Montana Representative Thomas J. Walsh for evidence of criminal wrongdoing. The investigation was actually a pretext for retaliation; the congressman had been instrumental in opposing oil leases granted by Secretary of the Interior Albert Fall, a friend of Daugherty and fellow cabinet member. Burns later refused to turn over Department of Justice documents to Congressional investigators, who in turn began investigating the BOI; Senate hearing revelations of BOI misdeeds were avidly covered in the press, and became known as the Daugherty-Burns scandal. Burns' BOI field agents made visits to the offices of newspapers around the country who had presented the BOI's actions in a negative light; their clumsy attempts to intimidate newspaper editors caused a backlash in public opinion and Congress. Burns was forced to resign in 1924 at the request of Attorney General Harlan Fiske Stone[5] and on May 10, 1924, J. Edgar Hoover took over the position on a provisional basis.
Burns Detective Agency and Teapot Dome[edit]
Burns also became indirectly involved in the Teapot Dome Scandal, involving the secret leasing of naval oil reserve lands to private companies. In November 1927, Harry F. Sinclair went on trial in federal court for conspiracy to defraud the U. S. in the leasing of the Teapot Dome naval oil reserve. At the request of Sinclair oil executive Henry Mason Day, Burns secretly hired a squad of 14 men from the William J. Burns Detective Agency to "investigate" his jurors. Day arranged for their compensation and received their daily reports. Midway through the trial the government's investigators discovered Burns' agents, and a mistrial was immediately declared.
At a new hearing, Sinclair's defense was that he had had the jurors followed to protect them against federal influences; that in no case had the operatives made direct contact with the jurors. Sinclair was convicted on corruption charges and sentenced to six months in jail, Day to four months' imprisonment, William J. Burns to 15 days' imprisonment, and Burns' son, William Sherman Burns, was ordered to pay a $1,000 fine. William J. immediately appealed, and the Supreme Court later reversed his conviction (Sinclair v. United States, 279 US 749 - Supreme Court 1929).[6]
Postscript[edit]
After his retirement from the Burns Detective Agency, Burns moved to Florida and for several years published detective and mystery stories based on his long career. He died of a heart attack in Sarasota, Florida in April 1932.
Burns was portrayed by actor Paul Dooley in the television miniseries The Murder of Mary Phagan.

At a new hearing, Sinclair's defense was that he had had the jurors followed to protect them against federal influences; that in no case had the operatives made direct contact with the jurors. Sinclair was convicted on corruption charges and sentenced to six months in jail, Day to four months' imprisonment, William J. Burns to 15 days' imprisonment, and Burns' son, William Sherman Burns, was ordered to pay a $1,000 fine. William J. immediately appealed, and the Supreme Court later reversed his conviction (Sinclair v. United States, 279 US 749 - Supreme Court 1929).[6]
Postscript[edit]
After his retirement from the Burns Detective Agency, Burns moved to Florida and for several years published detective and mystery stories based on his long career. He died of a heart attack in Sarasota, Florida in April 1932.
Burns was portrayed by actor Paul Dooley in the television miniseries The Murder of Mary Phagan.

William John Burns (October 19, 1861 – April 14, 1932), known as "America's Sherlock Holmes," is famous for having conducted a private investigation clearing Leo Frank of the murder of Mary Phagan,[1] and for serving as the director of the Bureau of Investigation (BOI) (predecessor to the FBI) from August 22, 1921 to May 10, 1924. He was born in Baltimore, Maryland and was educated in Columbus, Ohio. As a young man, Burns performed well as a Secret Service Agent and parleyed his reputation into the William J. Burns International Detective Agency, now a part of Securitas Security Services USA. A combination of natural ability as a detective combined with an instinct for publicity made Burns a national figure. His exploits made national news, the gossip columns of New York newspapers, and the pages of detective magazines, in which he published "true" crime stories based on his exploits.

Marriage and children[edit]
Burns married Annie M. Ressler in 1880. The couple had six children. Burns' sons, Raymond J. and William Sherman also worked as detectives for the William J. Burns National Detective Agency.[2]
Los Angeles Times bombing[edit]
The City of Los Angeles hired Burns to catch those responsible for the bombing of the Los Angeles Times building on October 1, 1910. Burns's son Raymond and police officers from the Detroit and Chicago police departments arrested Jim McNamara and associate Ortie McManigal on April 14, 1911 in Detroit. John McNamara was arrested later that month in Indianapolis, Indiana. Extradited to Los Angeles, the brothers pleaded guilty to murder in the bombing.[3]
BOI career[edit]
Burns was considered well qualified to direct the Bureau of Investigation, and was friends with President Warren Harding's Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty. Burns was confirmed as Director of the Bureau of Investigation on August 22, 1921. He continued to run the Burns Detective Agency throughout his tenure as Director of the BOI. Under Burns, the Bureau shrank from its 1920 high of 1,127 personnel to 600 employees in 1923. Burns was responsible for hiring the first female special agents, Alaska P. Davidson in 1922 and Jessie B. Duckstein in 1923.[4]
At the request of Attorney General Daugherty, Burns sent agents to investigate Montana Representative Thomas J. Walsh for evidence of criminal wrongdoing. The investigation was actually a pretext for retaliation; the congressman had been instrumental in opposing oil leases granted by Secretary of the Interior Albert Fall, a friend of Daugherty and fellow cabinet member. Burns later refused to turn over Department of Justice documents to Congressional investigators, who in turn began investigating the BOI; Senate hearing revelations of BOI misdeeds were avidly covered in the press, and became known as the Daugherty-Burns scandal. Burns' BOI field agents made visits to the offices of newspapers around the country who had presented the BOI's actions in a negative light; their clumsy attempts to intimidate newspaper editors caused a backlash in public opinion and Congress. Burns was forced to resign in 1924 at the request of Attorney General Harlan Fiske Stone[5] and on May 10, 1924, J. Edgar Hoover took over the position on a provisional basis.
Burns Detective Agency and Teapot Dome[edit]
Burns also became indirectly involved in the Teapot Dome Scandal, involving the secret leasing of naval oil reserve lands to private companies. In November 1927, Harry F. Sinclair went on trial in federal court for conspiracy to defraud the U. S. in the leasing of the Teapot Dome naval oil reserve. At the request of Sinclair oil executive Henry Mason Day, Burns secretly hired a squad of 14 men from the William J. Burns Detective Agency to "investigate" his jurors. Day arranged for their compensation and received their daily reports. Midway through the trial the government's investigators discovered Burns' agents, and a mistrial was immediately declared.
At a new hearing, Sinclair's defense was that he had had the jurors followed to protect them against federal influences; that in no case had the operatives made direct contact with the jurors. Sinclair was convicted on corruption charges and sentenced to six months in jail, Day to four months' imprisonment, William J. Burns to 15 days' imprisonment, and Burns' son, William Sherman Burns, was ordered to pay a $1,000 fine. William J. immediately appealed, and the Supreme Court later reversed his conviction (Sinclair v. United States, 279 US 749 - Supreme Court 1929).[6]

Burns was portrayed by actor Paul Dooley in the television miniseries The Murder of Mary Phagan.
