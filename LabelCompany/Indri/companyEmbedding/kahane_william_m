AR Capital, the real estate investment company built by Nicholas S. Schorsch and William M. Kahane, said Monday that it would stop creating new investment products and close existing ones to new investors to focus on managing the $19 billion it has in current investments.The company cited “regulatory and market uncertainty” that was affecting its ability to raise investor money.The New York-based firm, once called American Realty Capital, is one of the biggest sponsors of nontraded real estate investment trusts, but it is in the center of a maelstrom.Its most recent troubles began with the collapse a week ago of a $378 million deal to sell a 60 percent stake of a newly formed company holding the $19 billion of assets to the private equity giant Apollo Global Management.

Then on Thursday, Massachusetts’s securities regulator accused an affiliate of the firm — Realty Capital Securities — of faking proxy votes for a September special meeting of shareholders in one of AR Capital’s sponsored investment vehicles. Continue reading the main story

Realty Capital Securities is part of RCS Capital, a publicly traded broker that said last week it was facing possible delisting by the New York Stock Exchange. Its share price has slumped since an accounting scandal at one of Mr. Schorsch’s investment vehicles forced him to resign from the management of American Realty Capital Properties and boards of affiliated entities last year.In its administrative complaint on Thursday, the Massachusetts securities division said the faked votes were for a shareholder meeting that was a prerequisite to having the deal with Apollo move forward.AR Capital said on Monday that Realty Capital Securities would discontinue proxy activities for AR Capital-sponsored vehicles because of the Massachusetts investigation.

AR Capital’s woes come as regulators take a closer look at how nontraded REITs are sold to investors. Nontraded REITs, which invest in various types of real estate, are typically sold through advisers. Unlike publicly traded REITs, nontraded REITs are difficult to sell or liquidate.“There were serious problems with their lack of transparency and the interrelationship with affiliated companies,” said Michael Kitces, the director of financial planning at Pinnacle Advisory Group in Columbia, Md.In September, the broker LPL Financial agreed to pay $1.4 million in a settlement with state regulators regarding its sales practices for nontraded REITs.Regulators have proposed new fiduciary standards for advisers and mandated new disclosures on fees and costs that cut into investors’ principal. AR Capital seems to be saying, Mr. Kitces said, “now that the market is requiring transparency, we don’t think we can sell these any more.”Mr. Kahane, AR Capital’s co-founder, said in a statement on Monday regarding the regulatory changes, “Until there is greater clarity, we have decided to sit this one out.”AR Capital said it would stop taking new money at year end for Business Development Corporation of America II, ARC Healthcare Trust III, New York City REIT II, ARC Hospitality Trust and ARC Global Trust II.

 Educational Background



BA, cum laude 


Occidental College

                  In 1887, the year a group of knowledge-thirsty Presbyterians founded "The Occidental University of Los Angeles, California," a Kansas prohibitionist named Harvey Wilcox purchased a ranch just west of the city, naming it Hollywood.
 
Tuition in 1888, the year Oxy opened its doors, was $50. The new college wasn't exactly swamped with applicants: 40 students enrolled that fall.
 
Southern California's oldest football rivalry? Not UCLA-USC. Oxy and Pomona first squared off in 1895 -- preceding those other guys by more than 30 years.
 
Student body president Clarence Spaulding became Oxy's first Rhodes Scholar in 1908. Today, Oxy still has more Rhodes Scholars (10) than USC (9).
 
Big changes came to campus in 1926: freshmen were required to live on campus for the first time, and the Oxy basketball team had to adjust to playing indoors after Alumni Gymnasium was built.
 
Sammy Lee '43's first gold medal in diving at the 1948 London Games wasn't Oxy's first Olympic hardware: Tigers have won a total of seven medals. If Oxy were a country, we'd be tied with Israel and Tunisia.
 
In 1992, with the nation's eyes on Los Angeles during the largest riots the country had seen since the '60s, Occidental was recognized on the front page of The Wall Street Journal for its forward-thinking stance on diversity. 
 
A knight who hits people with a chicken? A commanding officer of a naval base and the Girl Scouts? The James Dean of disability studies? There are some brilliant characters among our notable alumni.                




JD 


University of California, Los Angeles - School of Law

                  UCLA School of Law is the youngest top law school in the nation.  After more than 60 years, our school has never felt bound by outmoded ideas of how law should be taught or studied. Instead, beginning in the 1950s, UCLA created its own tradition - a tradition of innovation.                




MBA 


Stanford University - Stanford Graduate School of Business

                  The Stanford Graduate School of Business has built an international reputation based on its innovative programs, which include:

        Two-year MBA Program, designed to educate business leaders
        One-year Stanford Sloan Master’s Program for mid-career executives
        PhD Program for future academics
        Executive Education programs for experienced managers
        Faculty research program

Academic programs, including the two-year MBA, the 12-month Sloan Master's Program, and the PhD program, create a transformational student experience that reflects the tagline: Change lives. Change organizations. Change the world.
Today the state-of-the-art Knight Management Center complex enables Stanford's innovative, globalized MBA curriculum, offering flexible classroom spaces for hands-on experiential learning small-group leadership labs, and team-based learning. It engages faculty and students across Stanford University, as well as alumni, global executives, and the broader world community.

Congregation Emanu-El of the City of New York

                    Temple Emanu-El founded in 1845 is the the third oldest Reform Jewish congregation in the United States. Its odyssey mirrors that of the Jewish community in New York. Originally located on a remote corner on the Lower East Side, it moved progressively, both geographically and spiritually, further uptown, and is now located in the very heart of New York City, on the Upper East Side. With a membership of more than 2,100 families and more than 10,000 individuals, Emanu-El has one of the largest congregations of Jewish worshipers. Our Fifth Avenue Sanctuary, which seats 2,500, makes Emanu-El one of the most monumental Jewish houses of worship in the world. Within our walls, an enormous range of social, educational and cultural programs are offered.

Occidental College

                    In 1887, the year a group of knowledge-thirsty Presbyterians founded "The Occidental University of Los Angeles, California," a Kansas prohibitionist named Harvey Wilcox purchased a ranch just west of the city, naming it Hollywood.
 
Tuition in 1888, the year Oxy opened its doors, was $50. The new college wasn't exactly swamped with applicants: 40 students enrolled that fall.
 
Southern California's oldest football rivalry? Not UCLA-USC. Oxy and Pomona first squared off in 1895 -- preceding those other guys by more than 30 years.
 
Student body president Clarence Spaulding became Oxy's first Rhodes Scholar in 1908. Today, Oxy still has more Rhodes Scholars (10) than USC (9).
 
Big changes came to campus in 1926: freshmen were required to live on campus for the first time, and the Oxy basketball team had to adjust to playing indoors after Alumni Gymnasium was built.
 
Sammy Lee '43's first gold medal in diving at the 1948 London Games wasn't Oxy's first Olympic hardware: Tigers have won a total of seven medals. If Oxy were a country, we'd be tied with Israel and Tunisia.
 
In 1992, with the nation's eyes on Los Angeles during the largest riots the country had seen since the '60s, Occidental was recognized on the front page of The Wall Street Journal for its forward-thinking stance on diversity. 
 
A knight who hits people with a chicken? A commanding officer of a naval base and the Girl Scouts? The James Dean of disability studies? There are some brilliant characters among our notable alumni.

Schorsch partner William Kahane resigns as director of two AR Capital REITs
Latest shakeup of high ranking executives at AR Capital products






Nov 25, 2015 @ 2:48 pm
By 
	Bruce Kelly























+ Zoom




      The shakeout of AR Capital's high-ranking personnel continues. William Kahane, one of the co-founders of Nicholas Schorsch's AR Capital, resigned as a director from two real estate investment trusts, American Realty Capital New York City REIT Inc. and American Realty Capital Global Trust II Inc. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission from Tuesday, Mr. Kahane was replaced by Mike Weil, who, along with Mr. Schorsch and Mr. Kahane, was one of the five AR Capital partners.
				



In both instances, Mr. Kahane “did not resign pursuant to any disagreement with” the two companies, according to the SEC filings. Jesse Galloway, an AR Capital spokesman, did not return a call on Wednesday to comment. GALVIN COMPLAINTMr. Kahane's departure as director from the boards of two REITs is the latest in a flurry of personnel changes at AR Capital-branded products. Last Friday, Robert Grunewald “was removed from his position as president, chief investment officer and chief operating officer of” BDCA effective immediately, according to a filing with the SEC.BDCA is the AR Capital nontraded business development company that is at the center of an  administrative complaint filed earlier this month by Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin. The Massachusetts lawsuit alleges that Realty Capital Securities, a wholesale brokerage that helped market AR Capital products, fraudulently cast shareholder proxy votes.James Fisher, a BDCA managing director of middle market investing, is replacing Mr. Grunewald as president and chief operating officer.Meanwhile, Andrew Winer, president and chief investment officer, Global Net Lease Inc., a publicly traded real estate investment trust sponsored by AR Capital that listed earlier this year, also resigned on Friday, according to an SEC filing. Mr. Winer “stepped down by mutual agreement with the company to pursue other opportunities.” Patrick Goulding, the REIT's chief financial officer and treasurer also “stepped down” to pursue other opportunities, according to an SEC filing.
