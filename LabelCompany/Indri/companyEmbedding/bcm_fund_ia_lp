Welcome to Banes Capital Management, LLC 
 
Company Mission: 
While embracing the highest ethical and professional standards, BCM offers clients alternative investment strategies that deploy a balanced approach to achieving exceptional, risk-adjusted returns. 
Banes Capital Management, LLC (BCM), a Registered Investment Advisor, was founded by Joel Banes in 2005. Prior to starting BCM, Joel spent over twenty five years in the acquisition, management, and distribution of fixed income products. The foundation of BCM was built upon managing these very same income producing products which track prevailing interest rates. To that end, the BCM High Income Fund, LP (LP), was launched in 2006 and was quickly confronted with the worldwide economic and credit crisis which had many unpredictable, often devastating effects throughout the financial industry. This crisis spawned a multitude of government bailouts of competing and underperforming sectors. Navigating through this perilous time, the LP established a sound foundation for expansion into other income producing and capital growth management strategies.

Welcome to Banes Capital Group, LLC 
 
Company Mission: 
We provide comprehensive administrative services to wealth advisors, institutional fixed income independent brokers, funds (and other financial companies) with the highest level of professionalism and personal service.  
Banes Capital Group, LLC (BCG) provides administrative services to Banes Capital Management LLC, (BCM). BCM is the adviser to the BCM High Income Fund, LP (Fund), a leading buyer of SBA 7(a) and USDA loans. BCG also provides administrative services to financial advisors and registered representatives of independent institutional fixed income brokerages. BCG, entering its tenth year of business, is comprised of a team of dedicated professionals, many of whom bring over two decades of experience.  BCG is capable of handling a vast array of opportunities. 
Its team members have played key roles in the marketing, pooling and purchasing of SBA products, including building SBA pooling platforms for pool assemblers, structuring investor SBA loan and pool portfolios, and purchasing one of the largest non-bank SBA 7(a) loan origination operations. They have been instrumental in the sale and participation of the unguaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans, the liquidation of multiple portfolios, the largest of which had a par value of over $700 million, and closing multiple financing facilities as large as $400 million.
Collectively, Joel Banes, Chief Manager, and his team have faced virtually every financial climate, from placid to volatile. BCG gratefully attributes its success to the strength of the long term relationships it has with its client base.  BCG is committed to providing clients with the answers to their informational research requests and dedicated professional service.

But don't take our word for it




























"PitchBook data shows who the investors, founders, and other key players are of start-ups and venture capital firms. As simple as this may seem, it's not information that's widely avaliable - espcially not all in one place!"
