Merchant Cash Advance vs. Small Business Loan
 

 





 
Merchant Cash Advance
You can access funding from $5,000 to $300,000. Here’s how it works:


We purchase a set dollar amount of your business’s future credit/debit sales at a discounted price, we pay you this price in a lump sum cash funding.


We collect an agreed upon percentage of each future credit/debit transaction that you process. We do this directly through your processor, or we ACH the amount from your bank.


Your future payments vary based upon your future sales volume— so payments are cash flow friendly!
More questions on a merchant cash advance? Watch this video here to find out more.  
 




 
Small Business Loans
With this solution, you can access funding $5,000 to $500,000. The steps to get funding are easy:


We review your application and your banking and credit card processing history (if applicable) and consult with you on the loan amount, payment, and funding structure


We collect a set daily payment amount from your bank account via ACH debit


Your future payments are fixed so you can plan your future cash flow.
 

 



 
The Merchant Cash Advance Solution
If you have a history of credit card acceptance, then a Merchant Cash Advance may be just what you need. Your history of credit card volume is used to determine the amount of funds that can be advanced. A Merchant Cash Advance requires a minimal operating history and the lowest possible credit requirements. Your payments fluctuate, and are dependent upon the amount of your future credit card sales. The amount that you pay is either collected directly through the daily deposits of your merchant processing account or collected by daily ACH debit to your bank account.
 




 
The Small Business Loan Solution
This solution is ideal for the stronger credit profile, and business with strong consistent cash flow that desires a fixed payment structure. Additionally, the funding amount is not limited by your credit card processing volume. If you have at least 9 months operating history in your business, and prefer a fixed payment structure, then let us quote you a Small Business Loan. Funding time is still about 3 days after submission of your complete application package!

Merchant Cash Advance vs. Small Business Loan
 

 





 
Merchant Cash Advance
You can access funding from $5,000 to $300,000. Here’s how it works:


We purchase a set dollar amount of your business’s future credit/debit sales at a discounted price, we pay you this price in a lump sum cash funding.


We collect an agreed upon percentage of each future credit/debit transaction that you process. We do this directly through your processor, or we ACH the amount from your bank.


Your future payments vary based upon your future sales volume— so payments are cash flow friendly!

Small Business Loans
With this solution, you can access funding $5,000 to $500,000. The steps to get funding are easy:


We review your application and your banking and credit card processing history (if applicable) and consult with you on the loan amount, payment, and funding structure


We collect a set daily payment amount from your bank account via ACH debit


Your future payments are fixed so you can plan your future cash flow.
 

 



 
The Merchant Cash Advance Solution
If you have a history of credit card acceptance, then a Merchant Cash Advance may be just what you need. Your history of credit card volume is used to determine the amount of funds that can be advanced. A Merchant Cash Advance requires a minimal operating history and the lowest possible credit requirements. Your payments fluctuate, and are dependent upon the amount of your future credit card sales. The amount that you pay is either collected directly through the daily deposits of your merchant processing account or collected by daily ACH debit to your bank account.
 




 
The Small Business Loan Solution
This solution is ideal for the stronger credit profile, and business with strong consistent cash flow that desires a fixed payment structure. Additionally, the funding amount is not limited by your credit card processing volume. If you have at least 9 months operating history in your business, and prefer a fixed payment structure, then let us quote you a Small Business Loan. Funding time is still about 3 days after submission of your complete application package!
