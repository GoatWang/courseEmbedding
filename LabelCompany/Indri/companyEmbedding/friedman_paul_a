 The Appearance of fine lines on my thin lips caused my lipstick, to bleed into the lines
– Vanessa - Actual Patient

Do you see fine, thin lines all over your face, or deep lines between your eyebrows and around your mouth? Are the lines there all the time, or only during certain facial expressions? The answers to these questions will guide your treatment choices. Reducing lines and hollows will project the appearance of youth and health.
 
 


Almost eight years ago my dog, shasta attacked and bit me along the chin I needed two reconstructive surgeries.
– Kiana - Actual Patient

Scars and stretch marks are constant reminders of the past that can stand in the way of smooth, beautiful skin – but there is hope. Scar appearance can be improved by many therapies – from creams to dressings to injections. Laser therapy, a newer modality, has shown promising results in diminishing scar redness and appearance.

Our Patients Results




Scar Reduction
If you have a  highly visible scar, there are many laser procedures that can make it less  noticeable.  You may have considered  surgical reduction, but found it too expensive and inconvenient.  Acne scars or scars from injury or surgery  can all be made less prominent using lasers that will reduce the size and  redness of your facial scars.
Effective Scar Treatments

Intralesional injections of steroids
5-fluorouracil
Vbeam® Perfecta Laser
Fraxel®

Schedule Your Consultation
If you have scars, there is help available to you. One of our doctors at the Dermatology & Laser Surgery Center in Houston, Texas will evaluate your condition and then determine which treatment plan would best treat your individual needs. Please contact our office today to schedule your initial consultation.

XTRAC® Laser Therapy



Psoriasis and vitiligo are common skin conditions that can surface all across your body and occur at any age. Both stemming from autoimmune irregularities, psoriasis produces red lesions on the skin covered by a buildup of white skin flakes, while vitiligo is characterized by multiple white patches resulting from a lack of skin pigmentation. XTRAC® Therapy from can help you diminish psoriasis outbreaks or control the lack of pigmentation associated with vitiligo using state-of-the-art laser technology at Dermatology & Laser Surgery Center.
Benefits of the XTRAC® Laser System
Treatment of psoriasis and vitiligo with the XTRAC® Laser system is FDA-approved and is known to consistently yield effective, sustained results for both children and adults. In comparison to other psoriasis and vitiligo treatments, XTRAC® Therapy is pain-free, covered by many insurance companies, and typically requires no application of topical skin care ointments. Additionally, the XTRAC® Laser system has not been shown to cause any harmful side effects such as liver damage, UV ray exposure, birth defects, or heart disease.
How does XTRAC® Laser Therapy work?
Our dermatologists use the XTRAC® Laser system to direct a UVB beam at the affected areas of your skin over the course of multiple treatment sessions, depending on your specific needs. The concentrated laser energy passes through a liquid light guide system that helps to rapidly clear your skin in a non-invasive manner. The technology enables the doctors to calibrate laser intensity to safely and effectively treat each targeted area. XTRAC® Therapy is painless and can generally be performed in 20 minutes or less, depending on the number of areas needed to be addressed.
Results from XTRAC® Therapy
Individual results may vary, although initial results can generally be expected to show after three to four treatments and gradually improve as sessions continue. Symptom relief typically lasts for an extended period of time and considerably longer than other popular treatment options.
Schedule Your Consultation
For more information on the treatment of psoriasis or vitiligo with the XTRAC® Laser system, contact Dermatology & Laser Surgery Center. Our staff will be happy to answer any of your questions or help you schedule a consultation with our doctor.

Nevus of Ota



What is Nevus of Ota?
Nevus of Ota, also known as congenital melanosis bulbi or oculodermal melaocytosis, is a skin condition affecting the upper third of the dermis. Five times more common in women than men, Nevus of Ota results in a benign blue or gray patch, or hyperpigmentation on the face, and may or may not involve a coloring of the eye. The skin condition can be congenital or acquired, and occurs when an increased number of melanocytes, or cells responsible for the skin’s pigmentation, are present in the upper layers of skin’s dermis.
Treatments for Nevus of Ota
Dr. Paul Friedman utilizes the latest laser procedures to treat Nevus of Ota. As with all consultations, when a patient is considering treatment for Nevus of Ota with Q-switched lasers, our dermatologists will look at your skin and discuss the desired results with you. At the Dermatology and Laser Surgery Center, Q-Switched Alexandrite and Q-Switched Nd:YAG are ideal treatment methods for Nevus of Ota, as well as birthmarks and tattoo removal. In some cases, the Fraxel re:store laser may also be used alone or in combination with the Q-switched Nd:YAG laser for further improvement of the Nevus of Ota.
During the procedure, an anesthetic cream is used to minimize discomfort as the area is treated with the laser(s). Patients may experience some redness, swelling, or crusting of the area, which should be resolved within a few days from the procedure. The laser is designed to treat skin with a darker pigmentation, while leaving lighter tissues unaffected. Following the treatment sessions, the darker pigment in the treatment areas will fade, with significant improvement shown after each session.
Schedule a Consultation for Nevus of Ota
For more information about the treatment of Nevus of Ota, or to schedule a consultation at the Dermatology and Laser Surgery Center, contact our practice today.

Smoothbeam™



Both severe and mild cases of acne can cause permanent scarring. But Paul M. Friedman, M.D. in Houston, Texas has an excellent method to treat acne scars in the office setting. Utilizing advanced technology and his extensive experience, Dr. Friedman is able to treat your acne and acne scarring.














What is Smoothbeam™ Laser, What Does it Treat?
*

One such  advance is the Smoothbeam™ laser, which is an effective, gentle and safe treatment option for troublesome acne.This treatment uses a laser to target overactive sebaceous (oil) glands in your skin. It is these glands that are the root cause of acne. Medical lasers like Smoothbeam™ have been used for over two decades to treat many other medical conditions, not just acne and acne scarring.















How it Works
Very mild side effects may include slight redness or swelling that lasts only a few hours to a few days. Of course, recovery and side effects vary from patient to  patient. Dr. Friedman and his team will explain what to expect during and after your Smoothbeam™ laser acne treatment at the time of your visit. In very rare cases, some patients experience a temporary pigmentation change in the treated area.














If you already have scars from acne when you were younger, the Smoothbeam™ can help you, also. Collagen, which is at the same depth in skin as your sebaceous glands and is made of mostly water, is also targeted by the Smoothbeam™ laser light. The very slight dermal injury caused by the laser light stimulates the production and deposition of new organized collagen beneath the skin resulting in significant improvement in the appearance of your acne scars.














To learn more about acne, acne scarring, and how they can be treated, please contact one of our doctors at the Dermatology & Laser Surgery Center today.  He has successful treated thousands of patients suffering with acne and acne scarring just like you.

 Dermatologist Dr. Paul Friedman Gives Advice On How To Choose The Right Skin Care Product  
Published: 2011-06-02 by 
Ines Markovic in 
Skin Care 
 

 How many times did you find yourself in a drugstore or surfing the internet in search of a skin care product, and after buying and trying it, you realized that your skin doesn't like it? To avoid that from happening once again, read Dr. Paul Friedman's useful advices on how to pick the right skin care product.According to dermatologist Dr. Paul Friedman, “the skin care market is full of products that can help improve challenged skin, but many of my patients experience frustration with an oversaturated beauty market.” Here are some of the most common “beauty blunders” when it comes to buying and using consumer skin care products:- If you have acne-prone skin, avoid buying lotions that come in a jar or pot, says Dr. Friedman. Dipping your fingers into lotions every day introduces bacteria to the entire jar, and that can translate onto your skin, causing breakouts or infections.- Ask for recommendations, but proceed with caution. The old adage went, if you see a woman with great hair; ask where she had it done. The same can be applied to skin care – ask a friend what kind of moisturizer she likes and you might find your new favorite product, but keep in mind skin care is a unique experience: what works for some does not work for all.- If you are buying environmentally friendly products, watch out for those that are “paraben free.” Parabens have been singled out as potentially dangerous chemicals, but what most consumers don’t know is they are included in skincare items for a reason – to help them last longer. Most paraben-free products will spoil after a certain timeframe, which is usually listed on the package. Pay attention to this date and treat it almost like a food item, says Dr. Friedman.- You don’t need an “arsenal” of products to look your best. Many skin care companies sell their products in a series or grouping. According to Dr. Friedman, most women only need a gentle cleanser, daily moisturizer with SPF of 15 or higher, and a moisture-rich night cream to maintain a healthy complexion.- Read the (back of the) labels. Many products contain irritants like added fragrances or alcohols that can dry the skin. No matter what a package promises on the front, read the back carefully to ensure you are getting what’s advertised. If you have skin sensitivities towards certain foods, it is also important to look for essential oils, which are often derived from foods that can cause allergies in some people.- Don’t be fooled by clever marketing terminology. Product packaging is usually designed to do one thing: sell the product. Dr. Friedman says the last thing you should look for in a product is an appealing design. Be wary of claims like “dermatologist tested” or “allergy tested.” These phrases often carry little meaning.- Watch where you store your skin care. Different types of products, such as gels, may have temperature requirements in order to stay effective, notes Dr. Friedman. Leaving products in direct sunlight, in extreme heat or cold could also affect their performance. If there are no directions, Dr. Friedman notes products should be kept in cool, dry areas.And remember, the more you educate yourself, the better your chances are of finding a skin care routine that works for you. About Dr. Paul FriedmanPaul M. Friedman, M.D. is board-certified by the American Board of Dermatology, specializing in dermatologic laser surgery and Mohs micrographic surgery. He completed his residency in dermatology at the New York School of Medicine, one of the nation’s top dermatology residency programs. Dr. Friedman is the director of the DermSurgery Laser Center in Houston, Texas and also practices at the Laser & Skin Surgery Center of New York in Manhattan.  He is a Clinical Assistant Professor at the University of Texas Medical School, Department of Dermatology, and a Clinical Assistant Professor of Dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College. Dr. Friedman is on staff at Texas Children’s Hospital and Memorial-Hermann Hospital in Houston. For more information, visit www.friedmanmd.net.

Interview Paul Friedman – CEO, Incyte


The Bottom Line …
Drug discovery and development. We think of it as the product of brilliant scientific minds and skilled bench chemists. Maybe, but the driving force in these high-stakes gambles to bring a compound to market is located far from the lab and gene sequencing equipment. The action is in plush corporate boardrooms.
Last month, flush with cash and awash in operating losses, Incyte Corp (INCY, Nasdaq) elbowed aside both little biotechs and giant drug companies as it took the lead in fielding the first therapeutic drug for treatment of myelofibrosis.
Both in the U.S., where it’s going it alone and in the rest of the world where it teamed up with big pharma, Novartis – which took a share of the action by plunking down $150 million up front and providing milestone payments that could exceed $1 billion — Incyte has pulled out all the stops in its drive to market.
. The result? Ruxolitinib, the very first drug proven effective against splenomegaly and the worst of MF symptoms in controlled clinical trial, is poised to take the lion’s share of the MF market estimated at several hundred million dollars. With anticipated expansion to polycythemia vera and other blood disorders, revenues could exceed $1 billion over the next few years.
There are hurdles ahead:  FDA approval, while anticipated for December of this year, is by no means assured. And then there are competing existing therapies like Revlimid, Hydroxyurea, Pegasys…and new drugs in clinical trial rumored to have fewer side effects, notably YMI’s Cytopia 387 which has reported similar results plus an effect on anemia, And then there are radically different mono- and combination therapies emerging from the genetics labs in this fast moving competitive pipeline. Once past those hurdles, Incyte, which holds a long lead over the rest of the field, faces the marketing and distribution battle for clinical acceptance.
Rolling the dice in this mega-million dollar gamble is Incyte president and CEO Paul A. Friedman, M.D.,  Friedman, formerly a professor of medicine and pharmacology at Harvard Medical School was president of Dupont Pharmaceutical Research Labs before taking over as Incyte CEO in 2001. And standing around the table are thousands of myelofibrosis patients and caregivers whose bottom line is not at all complicated.
Is there a Ruxo prescription pill in our near future that will improve our condition while we wait for the silver bullet that will stop MF in its tracks?
A week after Ruxo was formally unveiled in Chicago to the America Society of Clinical Oncologists, we talked to Dr. Friedman. Participating were Pamela M. Murphy, vice president, corporate communications amd Zhenya Senyak for MPNforum. This is the transcript of that interview.
___________________________
Forum: I’d like to talk to you as an MF patient, from that perspective, our concerns or hopes that 424 will help relieve the worst of the symptoms
PF: OK
Forum: As I understand it now Ruxolitinib…where does that name come from?
Pam: –the nib is part of the kinase nomenclature.. Ruxo is a product of our team and got approved
PF: The generic names are tongue twisters at best We call it Ruxo 424
Forum: As I understand it now while effective in reducing spleen size, it’s not going to slow the progression of the disease. I have no information on the reduction of the JAK2 allele burden and I think it may contribute to anemia as well as thrombocytopenia (platelet destruction) as well as blood transfusion requirements
PF: You make it sound some something no one would want to take.
Forum: Believe me I would want to take it if needed.
PF: OK all those things are true but out of context and so we should probably take them one at a time. Neither study was big enough or lasted long enough to be statistically powered to show a survival benefit. There was no way to show any kind for survival benefit that would be statistically meaningful in either pivotal trial If you look at the deaths in both trials the data favors Ruxo but it’s not close to being a P value of less than .05. In both
studies what’s called the hazard ratio was between .67 and .7 in favor of Ruxo arms, where Ruxo was administered
So we will not have a claim for survival and I certainly cannot tell you unequivocally that there is a survival advantage but if you think about the following: In causes of death with MF only 25-20 percent are conversions to AML and many more are from complications of the disease other than transformation
And when you think about what some of those things are you might think that a drug that appears to do what Ruxo does could benefit people in that regard And so since we’re anticipating the drugs approval and once it gets approval it would be impossible to do a prospective placebo involved trial to evaluate survival, we have to use some kind of surrogate way of looking at what data we have . And Dr Verstovsek at MD Anderson and one of his colleagues In Italy is attempting to do that in the longer term data we have in the Phase II study that continues to run with some patients being on the drug for four years or more.
And when you look at that data and compare it to … a control group of demographically matched patients, the data is intriguing and suggestive of survival benefit. But we will not have a claim for that from the Phase III data. Just have to watch as Dr. Verstovsek and Dr. Passamonti’s data matures from Phase II to see how convincing the early intriguing results are
So that’s what I would say about your first (statement). The second one is there are symptoms that are related to the spleen depending on how big the spleen gets and there are symptoms that are related to the pro-inflammatory cytokines that MF patients often have, like interleukin 8. And by inhibiting the Janus kinases 1 and 2 we have a dramatic effect on spleen size with relief of symptoms that appear to be related completely or in part to big spleens and very rapid and dramatic and durable relief from symptoms that are due to the over active, proinflammatory cytokine pathways such as fatigue, night sweats, weight loss, poor appetite, bone pain, etc.
You are right. In inhibiting JAK2 you can cause bone marrow suppression. So the way we’ve gone about running the clinical trials, and the way we think the label will read, allows for the individual physician {to adjust} dosage for a given patient to maximize the therapeutic benefit and minimize the side effect profile which is essentially bone marrow suppression. It’s particularly important in MF patients, as you know, since the marrow is not functioning at maximum efficiency. So what we sometimes see in patients is a significant reduction in platelet count which in almost every patient can be taken care of by a dose reduction.
I think we had one patient on Ruxo and one on the placebo who had to drop out because of thrombocytopenia. That’s a trivial percentage of all the people who participated in the trial — and was the same in the European trial .. same for cytopenia in either arm, Ruxo or BAT.(Best Available Therapy)..
And then the other thing we do see is a decrease in hemoglobin that seems to become maximum about weeks 8 to 12 after you start on the drug and then interestingly there is compensation and the HG begins to go back up and by about 18-20 weeks and thereafter the HG level is slightly below the placebo level but there’s definite evidence of compensation which I think is a combination of decreasing the spleen size therefore the spleen is less of a trap for circulating red cells. Erythropoietin, which is a growth factor for red cells, goes up significantly when patients get Ruxo so that’s going to offset some of the inhibition of the JAK enzymes by Ruxo, of JAK2s specifically which is the JAK through which erythropoietin signals. And the other thing probably involved is something called Anemia Chronic Disease with high levels of systemic inflammation in diseases other than MF can be a damper on bone marrow functions. In any event some combination of those three things leads to compensation and the HG comes back to normal
What’s interesting about we presented at ASCO last week is even patients who have an onset high level anemia got the same level of splenic reduction and symptomatic benefit as those who didn’t have that happen. And the other interesting thing is when you look across the board over the six months of therapy and you look at patients who have transfusion requirements in either placebo or the Ruxo treated arm the number of units of red cells transfused per month was actually lower in the Ruxo arm than it was in the other placebo arm and so… in my opinion, the benefits outweigh these side effect issues,
Forum: What was your point about the transfusion, was it about the nature of the transfusion…?
PF: No it was fewer units of blood…so Ruxo makes more people become transfusion dependent than placebo does which would make sense because you are inhibiting erythropoietin but even in that setting when you look at transfusion dependent patients on Ruxo vs. transfusion dependent patients on placebo the number of units of blood that a patient got per month was less with Ruxo than placebo
Forum: Is that data in the final report?
PF: It’s on our website in the presentation by Dr. Verstovsek, on one of the slides
Forum: I want to talk to you about symptoms. At the ASCO meeting there was another report on the 20- MF symptoms, the Tefferi report, Vannuchi actually. It’s in the June MPNForum, 20 symptoms and their prevalence across an (MF) population ,relatively small 178 . I looked at those symptoms and wanted to know what portion would be addressed by Ruxo. For example some seem not to be. Your point about fatigue and its relation to EPO suppression does answer the primary one, the one that most of us feel –the fatigue – but depression , bone pain , loss of concentration, pruritis, headache — any effect noticeable? Those weren’t endpoints in your study, I know.
PF: So, bone pain is part of the Ruben Mesa symptom score and we had a very good statistically significant effect on bone pain. Fatigue is not part of his score but there are other ways of evaluating fatigue …and it’s pretty obvious from patient feedback that we’ve gotten that there’s a dramatic effect on fatigue. People feel much better. Pruritis is handled pretty well
The one (symptom), loss of concentration was one of the things that was done in COMFORT II . and that looked to be improved [Note: COMFORT is the Phase III, Ruxolinitib clinical trial, COntrolled MyeloFibrosis study with ORal Jak inhibiTor; COMFORT I was in the US and COMFORT II, in Europe.)
There were actually more reports on headache on Ruxo than placebo and they are mild and transient . I think they were incidental but if they ever get reported then they are reported Headache per se would probably… we don’t have data saying we improve the headache of MF but I don’t think that the reports of headache that we alluded to at ASCO that were grade one or two and were anything more than us looking at the data set and somebody having an occasional headache and reporting it
Forum: Were they dose dependent at all?
PF: They were not dose dependent … You have to report it and the incidence is higher than placebo but when I look at look at the data is looks like a casual but no causal association You can’t rule it out because that’s what the data suggests.. They’re mild and not chronic. If they even occur for one day or two days and were recorded in a diary for a six month period they would be listed when you actually did a tabulated workup of what you find.
Forum: Can I ask you about the study design itself? Specifically I’m interested in the BAT [Best Available Therapy] drugs and looked at the Claire Harrison presentation of COMFORT II and the BAT arm included totally unfamiliar drugs like nitrogen mustard…
PF: Well some of the things used in Europe aren’t really used here but I think the two most commonly used drugs were HU and high dose steroids.
Forum: Right but what was not used what hit my attention was only 4% of that group were the interferons. One of the things I most wanted to see was the comparison with Pegasys which is going through the same path, which relates to another question.
The BAT arm, to me, didn’t include enough of the current front line therapies. To some extent, if we are to make the comparison clear.not comparing alternative therapies with Ruxo strikes me as leaving a big gap in understanding how it works. Splenic reduction… I believe the endpoint was 35% or something like that? Well that’s achievable with Pegasys and in some cases with hydroxyurea as well
PF: Right. So what was used in Europe were those therapies that physicians in the trial chose to use It was not determined by us. We would have thought there would have been more interferons used but not in Europe
Pam: It’s not reimbursed there. Probably why it’s not used.
Forum: Interesting because the British standard of care — again I hate to keep quoting form the Forum — but in the lead article Claire Harrison talks about the therapies and the front line age-appropriate choices are the interferons.
PF: Right…I’m assuming that at some point that kind of study will get done and we’ll see what happens. I know there’s a lot of interest in Pegasys for PV and I guess there are some MF patients who are on it. When that study got done by Novartis there was not much being used
Forum: Richard Silver has published three papers recently. There are some strong advocates for Pegasys.
 PF: I don’t doubt that but we don’t have any comment to make on that. We don’t have any experience with it.
Forum: OK, that leads to a broader question. And I’m delighted that you’re in this game but why? I don’t understand exactly. Am I missing some major point? When Incyte got started on this project, who was involved? Why enter a relatively small market where there is competition from established therapies, other JAK2 inhibitors in trial now and other genetic trials under way.. How did you see this as promising?
We looked at diseases where we thought shutting down JAK signaling would have therapeutic benefit. There’s a list and MF is on the list and we’ll get fairly dramatic results.
PF: Well there are a lot of diseases where a JAK inhibitor can work. MF frankly, we thought would be the quickest path to a first approval and that has turned out to be the case although we’re not approved yet. I don’t want to put the cart before the horse. But for something like rheumatoid arthritis where these drugs work dramatically well there’s a much longer development path, an order of magnitude more patients who have to be studied and approved therapies.
We looked at diseases where we thought shutting down JAK signaling would have therapeutic benefit. There’s a list and MF is on the list and we’ll get fairly dramatic results. We have a number of compounds. We took one and put it into RA. Ruxo we felt we would keep in the MPN and broader oncology area. We have formulated Ruxo although we don’t call it that, we call it 424, as a topical cream for mild to moderate psoriasis. So we thought there were multiple therapeutic areas into which you could go and MF is just one of them and one we felt there was an obvious unfulfilled therapeutic need. And we thought we could develop the drug the quickest So that’s kind of why we went into it.
Forum: You’re expecting NDA approval by December
PF: We filed the NDA and all indications are we’re expecting they will do an expedited review but we don’t have a guarantee of that. If they do a regular review it would be four months later . We expect December approval.
Forum: Would that then apply to RA as well?
PF: No, that’s a different compound and it’s being developed by Eli Lilly. We have a partnership with them. Right, it’s totally different but early on we did study of 424 in RA and got spectacular results. We just felt the development pathways would be cleaner if we had a different compound for RA and psoriasis then a second one for MPNs
Forum: It seems to me that the approach at Incyte was to develop a drug that had larger applications than MF. Is that true?
PF: Well we’re a small company. MF and a portion of P Vera is not small for a small company The very fact that other companies knowing that we’re way ahead are still interested in these patient populations is a testament to the fact that there are a reasonable number of people suffering from MF and late stage PV that would benefit by having a new therapy. It’s not small to us. And that’s looking at it strictly as a CEO. I’m also an MD. I’ve had the good fortune once before to be able to bring a drug to market that turned out to be spectacularly useful to people which was Sustiva for HIV
Very different patient population but people benefited greatly by combining that drug with a nucleoside. And you know to be able to do it again gives me a great sense of having done something useful and accomplished things.
PAM: And I tell you that throughout our organization we’re pretty proud that we did this. And very committed to making a difference here.
Forum: I can’t speak for a patient population but I was relieved and delighted to read the announcement and to follow the progress of this and always a little baffled by how it was taking place… because you think we’re not a small population but it feels pretty infinitesimal to me A few thousand…
PF : 20, 000. That’s that MF population, something like 18, 500
Forum:  Just two more questions. One has to do with a competitor. YMI’s CYT327 appears to address spleen reduction while reducing anemia, at least that’s the way it was reported. I know it’s way behind where you guys are now. You want to say anything about it?
PF: Not really, I’d just as soon have them say what they want to say because every time I say anything it comes back to bite me. The data is very early. It’s not controlled. There are no MRI’s measuring spleen and when the “anemia benefit” was presented at ASCO last week it was not well received. They have a ways to go. It may turn out they have an advantage but what we’ve seen so far is not that convincing.
Forum: Last question. What’s next? Ruxo is another attempt at addressing the result of the signalling pathway reducing the JAK2 burden but not the cause. Is anyone going after the root causes of MPNs or MF?
PF: I think if people knew an exact target to go after they’d go after it. I think there are combination studies that can be done that could be more effective in normalizing bone marrow At this point I would say the precise etiology and pathogenesis is not crystal clear and so it would be hard to embark on something without having a target that you really were pretty sure was at the root of how the disease came to be. But I think there are combination studies that you could do … there are the HDAC inhibitors there are a number of things that make sense to try to see if those combinations might well have some benefit at the level of marrow. And it’s also not clear over a longer term that you might not see something with monotherapy.
We do see some drifting down of the allele burden but we don’t see normalization of bone marrow. I’m not optimist that that will happen. At this point I would say I don’t think the root cause of the disease is well enough known with a related target that you could go after it aggressively if you were where I am in a company So I think in the intermediate term what we have now is more ammunition with Ruxo which hopefully will be the first drug approved by the FDA and a breadth of combination therapy to see if we can get to a next better stage than where we are now.
Forum: Thank you, good to talk with you. Good luck.

Friedman Paul Erhardt

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Friedemann Paul Erhardt (November 5, 1943 – October 26, 2007) was a German American pioneering early television chef. He was known as "Chef Tell" to his 40 million Baby Boomer fans.[1][dead link] He is widely regarded as one of the first chefs to enjoy widespread popularity on American television. Former Philadelphia Inquirer food writer, Elaine Tait, wrote, "Chef Tell is America's pioneer TV showman chef whose food always tastes good." Erhardt's thick German accent reportedly made him the inspiration for the Swedish Chef, a well known Muppet character on The Muppet Show,[1] although this is denied by Brian Henson.

Early life[edit]
Friedemann Paul Erhardt was born in Stuttgart, Germany [1] on November 5, 1943. He was the son of a German newspaper publisher.[1] Erhardt earned the nickname "Tell" when he played the character William Tell in a school play. Later, when asked by his TV producer, Art Moore, what he would like to take as his TV persona, he replied, "I'm known as Tell, so call me 'Chef Tell.'"[1]
Erhardt began his mandatory, three-year training to be a cook and a chef at the age of 13. Following his apprenticeship and further study and work in several hotels and restaurants in Europe, in 1970, he graduated at the age of 27 as Germany's youngest master chef to that time. That same year, he led a team of chefs to the Gold Medal in the Cooking Olympics in West Germany, and was also named Chef of the Year. Two years later, invited by a former Miss Philadelphia, Janet Louise Nicoletti, whom he later married, he moved to the United States[1] where he became the Executive Chef at the Barclay Hotel in Philadelphia.
Television[edit]
Erhardt made his first television debut on a local Philadelphia television show called Dialing for Dollars in 1974.[1] He was employed as a chef at the Marriott Hotel on City Line Avenue at the time.[2] Now more commonly known as Chef Tell, his work on the show later earned him a regular 90-second cooking spot on a nationally syndicated show, PM Magazine.[1] He often used the phrase, with his thick accent, "very simple, very easy" while cooking during his PM Magazine spots. His career led to guest appearances on Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous and earned Chef Tell time on QVC.[1] He also hosted a show on PBS called In the Kitchen With Chef Tell.[1] Chef Tell was known for his speed, for using humor in his cooking shows, and for his famous sign-off, "I SEE YOU!"
"He was the first of the great showman chefs," commented Elaine Tait, the former restaurant critic for the Philadelphia Inquirer. "Up until his era, chefs stayed in the kitchen."[1]
Chef Tell's popularity with home cooks, and his German-accented personality, earned him a place in American popular culture as a true culinary icon. He was often parodied in comedy skits on Saturday Night Live and became a regular guest on LIVE! with Regis and Kathie Lee.[1]
In addition to his work in television, Chef Tell worked in a number of other culinary positions. He owned several restaurants in Philadelphia in the 1970s and 1980s.[1] Walt Disney World commissioned him to design and bake an enormous cake for Donald Duck's 50th birthday in 1984, which was part of a grand celebration at Walt Disney World in Florida. For over 10 years in the 1980s and '90's, he owned and operated Chef Tell's Grand Old House on Grand Cayman Island. He later opened two restaurants in neighboring Bucks County, Pennsylvania, the short-lived Harrow Inne in Ottsville and the famous Chef Tell’s Manor House in Upper Black Eddy, Pennsylvania.
Former U.S. President Richard Nixon, who often visited his daughter Julie Eisenhower in Pennsylvania, sometimes dined at another of Chef Tell's restaurants in Wayne.[3] Nixon personally sponsored Erhardt's citizenship application in 1986.[3] Nixon reportedly was the guest speaker at his oath of citizenship ceremony.[3] Senator Arlen Spector sent to Tell the US flag that flew over the US Congress building that day, at Nixon's request.
Chef Tell became a spokesperson for major corporate food and cookware product lines,[1] including Nordic Ware and Health Craft Cookware, among others. He also wrote and edited cookbooks,[1] and was a best-selling author as a result of his Chef Tell's Quick Cuisine cookbook. Another cookbook intended specifically for people with diabetes was never published after his death. Erhardt was diagnosed as diabetic, but overcame this condition, and a need for diabetic medicines, with dietary changes, and exercise.
Tell spent the last two and half years of his life teaching culinary skills at The Restaurant School at Walnut Hill College in Philadelphia.[1]
Death[edit]
Chef Tell died on October 26, 2007 of heart failure at his home in Upper Black Eddy, Pennsylvania.[1] He was 63 years old.[1] He is survived by his wife of 19 years, Bunny, his son, Torsten, and a grandson.[3]
Biography[edit]
Chef Tell's life story (off and on-camera) is captured in CHEF TELL The Biography of America's Pioneer TV Showman Chef by Ronald Joseph Kule, with forewords by TV hosts Regis Philbin and Chef Walter Staib. Published by Skyhorse Publishing in New York City, the hard cover, 452-page book containing 70 photos and never-published Chef Tell recipes, was released on October 1, 2013. Hard copy, eBook and AudioBook editions are available everywhere books are sold. Numerous five-star reviews attest to its fascination with celebrities, fans and readers.

Friedman Paul Erhardt

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Friedemann Paul Erhardt (November 5, 1943 – October 26, 2007) was a German American pioneering early television chef. He was known as "Chef Tell" to his 40 million Baby Boomer fans.[1][dead link] He is widely regarded as one of the first chefs to enjoy widespread popularity on American television. Former Philadelphia Inquirer food writer, Elaine Tait, wrote, "Chef Tell is America's pioneer TV showman chef whose food always tastes good." Erhardt's thick German accent reportedly made him the inspiration for the Swedish Chef, a well known Muppet character on The Muppet Show,[1] although this is denied by Brian Henson.

Early life[edit]
Friedemann Paul Erhardt was born in Stuttgart, Germany [1] on November 5, 1943. He was the son of a German newspaper publisher.[1] Erhardt earned the nickname "Tell" when he played the character William Tell in a school play. Later, when asked by his TV producer, Art Moore, what he would like to take as his TV persona, he replied, "I'm known as Tell, so call me 'Chef Tell.'"[1]
Erhardt began his mandatory, three-year training to be a cook and a chef at the age of 13. Following his apprenticeship and further study and work in several hotels and restaurants in Europe, in 1970, he graduated at the age of 27 as Germany's youngest master chef to that time. That same year, he led a team of chefs to the Gold Medal in the Cooking Olympics in West Germany, and was also named Chef of the Year. Two years later, invited by a former Miss Philadelphia, Janet Louise Nicoletti, whom he later married, he moved to the United States[1] where he became the Executive Chef at the Barclay Hotel in Philadelphia.
Television[edit]
Erhardt made his first television debut on a local Philadelphia television show called Dialing for Dollars in 1974.[1] He was employed as a chef at the Marriott Hotel on City Line Avenue at the time.[2] Now more commonly known as Chef Tell, his work on the show later earned him a regular 90-second cooking spot on a nationally syndicated show, PM Magazine.[1] He often used the phrase, with his thick accent, "very simple, very easy" while cooking during his PM Magazine spots. His career led to guest appearances on Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous and earned Chef Tell time on QVC.[1] He also hosted a show on PBS called In the Kitchen With Chef Tell.[1] Chef Tell was known for his speed, for using humor in his cooking shows, and for his famous sign-off, "I SEE YOU!"
"He was the first of the great showman chefs," commented Elaine Tait, the former restaurant critic for the Philadelphia Inquirer. "Up until his era, chefs stayed in the kitchen."[1]
Chef Tell's popularity with home cooks, and his German-accented personality, earned him a place in American popular culture as a true culinary icon. He was often parodied in comedy skits on Saturday Night Live and became a regular guest on LIVE! with Regis and Kathie Lee.[1]
In addition to his work in television, Chef Tell worked in a number of other culinary positions. He owned several restaurants in Philadelphia in the 1970s and 1980s.[1] Walt Disney World commissioned him to design and bake an enormous cake for Donald Duck's 50th birthday in 1984, which was part of a grand celebration at Walt Disney World in Florida. For over 10 years in the 1980s and '90's, he owned and operated Chef Tell's Grand Old House on Grand Cayman Island. He later opened two restaurants in neighboring Bucks County, Pennsylvania, the short-lived Harrow Inne in Ottsville and the famous Chef Tell’s Manor House in Upper Black Eddy, Pennsylvania.
Former U.S. President Richard Nixon, who often visited his daughter Julie Eisenhower in Pennsylvania, sometimes dined at another of Chef Tell's restaurants in Wayne.[3] Nixon personally sponsored Erhardt's citizenship application in 1986.[3] Nixon reportedly was the guest speaker at his oath of citizenship ceremony.[3] Senator Arlen Spector sent to Tell the US flag that flew over the US Congress building that day, at Nixon's request.
Chef Tell became a spokesperson for major corporate food and cookware product lines,[1] including Nordic Ware and Health Craft Cookware, among others. He also wrote and edited cookbooks,[1] and was a best-selling author as a result of his Chef Tell's Quick Cuisine cookbook.

Erhardt was diagnosed as diabetic, but overcame this condition, and a need for diabetic medicines, with dietary changes, and exercise.
Tell spent the last two and half years of his life teaching culinary skills at The Restaurant School at Walnut Hill College in Philadelphia.[1]
Death[edit]
Chef Tell died on October 26, 2007 of heart failure at his home in Upper Black Eddy, Pennsylvania.[1] He was 63 years old.[1] He is survived by his wife of 19 years, Bunny, his son, Torsten, and a grandson.[3]

Chef Tell's life story (off and on-camera) is captured in CHEF TELL The Biography of America's Pioneer TV Showman Chef by Ronald Joseph Kule, with forewords by TV hosts Regis Philbin and Chef Walter Staib.

                                        PHILADELPHIA (AP) - Friedman Paul Erhardt, a German-born cook known as "Chef Tell" who was one of America's pioneering television chefs, has died. He was 63. 

Erhardt died Friday of heart failure at his home in Upper Black Eddy, about 25 miles east of Allentown, his family said. 

Erhardt's jolly personality, thick German accent and wit made him a fixture on TV shows such as "Regis and Kathie Lee" and comedy skits on "Saturday Night Live." 

He was also said to be the inspiration for the Swedish chef on "The Muppet Show." 

Born in Stuttgart, the son of a newspaper owner, Erhardt earned the nickname "Tell" after playing William Tell in a school play. 

He trained in restaurants and hotels throughout Europe. 

He made his first appearance on a local Philadelphia TV show "Dialing for Dollars" in 1974. That was followed by a 90-second cooking spot on a nationally syndicated show, which blossomed into appearances on "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous," specials for QVC and a PBS program, "In the Kitchen With Chef Tell." 

He was also known on the Philadelphia dining scene as the owner of several restaurants in the 1970s and 80s and as a culinary educator, cookbook author and spokesman for major cookware and food product lines. Copyright © 2007 The Associated Press
