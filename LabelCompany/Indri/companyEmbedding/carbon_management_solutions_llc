CMS do anything to deny warranty claims



 



1 out of 5,
            


        reviewed on Oct 14, 2014    



Purchased a CMS solar pump (at my cost) to display at country shows, hoping to build a business stream in solar pumping.  At the very first show, it worked for 3 hours then stopped due to the controller blowing up.  Further investigation found that the supplied solar panels had no blocking diodes therefore every time someone walked in front of the solar array, it caused ripple currents which then blew up the controller.

We tested both the controller and the pump and found it was the controller which was faulty, not the pump.

Contacted CMS

 who wanted to know exact details of display installation then focused on the pump installation and found every possible reason why it had not been installed in accordance with the very detailed installation instructions.  They were not interested in the fact it was the controller, they found one obscure clause in the install instructions to deny a warranty claim.  As above, it worked for 3 hours before blowing up.

When pushed, they then said that shadows caused by people walking in front of the array was "abnormal" and therefore not a warranty issue.  According to CMS, cows will never walk in front of a solar array.  A tree will never cast a shadow.

Today I had a call from someone in Townsville - same issue (ripple currents blowing up his controller).  Exact same response from CMS - doing everything they can to deny him his warranty rights.

Do not buy CMS solar pumps unless you want a poorly designed shoddy product that lasts 3 hours and then a million excuses about why there is no warranty claim.  You get what you pay for - there is a reason they are cheap - bad design and bad service.

The systems approach involves using three patented technologies (Xeripave pavers, Haydite and EGRP®) to mitigate rain events.

Through the use of all of these technologies, stormwater is able to be captured and infiltration and water retention is able to be increased.

The Energy-passive Groundwater Recharge Product (EGRP®)  is a patented breakthrough innovation that manages surface and underground water in an eco-friendly and sustainable way.

 



Promotes infiltration
The EGRP® increases infiltration by establishing a connection between the surface and soil and rebalances the hydrologic cycle that was disrupted by impervious surfaces.



Promotes drainage
The EGRP® reduces stress on overburdened stormwater drainage systems by mitigating stormwater runoff and removing excess rain and groundwater from the surface.



Facilitates the movement of water
The EGRP® provides a path for water molecules to move by harnessing energy from the ground to push and pull the water to nearby soil particles.






Manages waterThe EGRP® helps rebalance groundwater conditions by establishing new ways water can move to, and through, the soil. The EGRP® also enhances the balance between wet and dry areas and distributes water in greater volumes of soil.



Improves moisture content The EGRP® equalizes soil moisture content by establishing a connection between the surface and soil. It also nourishes the root system by bringing moisture towards the surface during dry seasons.



Recharges groundwater
Groundwater recharge is a hydrologic process where water moves downward from surface water to groundwater. This process usually occurs in the vadose zone below plant roots and is often expressed as a flux to the water table surface. Through the facilitation of water movement and infiltration of water, the EGRP® provides more water volume underground.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
