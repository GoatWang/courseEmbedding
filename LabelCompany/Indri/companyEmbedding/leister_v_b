HEMTEK ST
smart efficiency



HEMTEK ST Welding Machine


                With the HEMTEK ST, you can weld hems easily, reliably, and efficiently. Thanks to the versatile hemming guide, welding is reproducible and precise. With the simple quick-clamp lock, you can mount or dismantle the HEMTEK on any table with very little effort. A weight integrated into the handle makes it possible to adjust the pressure of the pressure roller easily and steplessly.

UNIROOF AT/ST
versatile, easy to maintain, efficient



UNIROOF AT Automatic Welder


The UNIROOF AT/ST homogeneously welds thermoplastic plastic sealing sheets as well as bituminous materials, such as EPDM. But its ultra-thin housing design and movable transport axes is what really makes it stand out. It can fit in tight spaces just as easily as about or on top of a roof parapet. And with its integrated direct-driven, maintenance-free pressure wheel, it rises above the competitor products for its higher pressure and noticeably greater welding speed. It is a light-weight among roof machines with 17.5 kg and easily portable. Available as a fully regulated AT version with digital display or as a controlled ST version with potentiometer.


UNIROOF


MINIFLOOR Drive Unit
handy, economical, versatile

That significantly increases welding quality as well as reliability and makes work easier. Among MINIFLOOR’s special features: it can weld wall to wall so that welding the ends afterwards is not necessary. Seamlessly welds short joints and small surfaces almost twice as fast as by hand. Its dual axis drive ensures that it stays perfectly true to the groove. At just 5.3 kg it can be easily transported.

Additional features include: easy loading of material, natural flow of material through the machine and innovative handle ergonomics for easy carry and rest positions. The GEOSTAR is available in two performance classes: the standard GEOSTAR G5 and extended-wedge GEOSTAR G7.
