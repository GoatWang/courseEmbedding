					Some organization health care providers are made up of components that furnish different types of health care or have separate physical locations where health care is furnished. These components and physical locations are not themselves legal entities, but are part of the organization health care provider (which is a legal entity).
					A covered organization provider may decide that its subparts (if it has any) should have their own NPI numbers. If a subpart conducts any HIPAA standard transactions on its own (e.g., separately from its parent), it must obtain its own NPI number.

                                    I have been going to Dr. Abdalla for almost 10 years now and I hope he will deliver all my children in the future. I LOVE him he always has time for all my questions and concerns and always has time for his patients he is always very calm which makes me calm and whenever I have requested a call back he always calls me back and has time to talk to me. I would recommend? him to anyone and everyone he is great! Its hard to find good doctors sometimes and I am so glad to have found him! 


                                    Dr. Abdalla delivered all three of my children and I have recommended him to all my friends and family.  My sister and friends chose him as well and were very pleased with his service.
He is a great doctor.
