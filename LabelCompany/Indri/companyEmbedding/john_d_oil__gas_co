MENTOR, Ohio, June 3, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Gas Natural Inc. (NYSE MKT: EGAS) ("Gas Natural" or the "Company"), a holding company operating local distributing companies serving approximately 73,000 customers in seven states, announced today that it completed the acquisition for John D. Oil and Gas Marketing Company, LLC, ("John D. Marketing") for $2.9 million, paid by the issuance of 256,926 shares of Gas Natural's common stock at a price of $11.19 per share.  The purchase agreement provides for contingent earn out payments of additional common stock based on the achievement of certain financial milestones by John D. Marketing for a period of five years after the closing of the transaction.
Kevin J. Degenstein, President and COO, noted, "This acquisition strengthens our gas marketing operations and presents an opportunity to capture additional transportation customers in the region."
John D. Marketing is engaged in the acquisition and sale of approximately 1.3 billion cubic feet of natural gas annually to approximately 120 customers located primarily in Northeast Ohio.  Gas Natural obtained shareholder approval of the transaction on March 1, 2013, and subsequently obtained the necessary regulatory and other approvals.  Once integrated, Gas Natural plans to change the name of John D. Marketing to Gas Natural Resources.
About Gas Natural Inc. 
Gas Natural Inc., a holding company, distributes and sells natural gas to end-use residential, commercial, and industrial customers.  It distributes approximately 33 billion cubic feet of natural gas to approximately 69,000 customers through regulated utilities operating in Montana, Wyoming, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maine, North Carolina and Kentucky.  The Company's other operations include interstate pipeline, natural gas production, natural gas marketing and propane to 4,000 customers.  The Company's Montana public utility was originally incorporated in 1909.  Its strategy for growth is to expand throughput in the Maine and North Carolina markets while looking for acquisitions that are either adjacent to its existing utilities or in under saturated markets.
