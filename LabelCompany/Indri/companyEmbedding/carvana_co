Hertz shares jump 14% on Bloomberg report of self-driving partnership with Apple
Shares of Hertz Global Holdings Inc.  surged 14% Monday, after Bloomberg reported that Apple Inc.  is leasing a fleet of its cars to test self-driving technology. Apple is leasing Lexus RX450h SUVs from Hertz's Donlen fleet-management unit, Bloomberg reported, citing documents from the California Department of Motor Vehicles. The news comes hours after Alphabet Inc.  said its Waymo unit is tapping Avis Budget Group Inc.  to to provide support and maintenance services for Waymo's self-driving-car program. Avis shares jumped 12.5% on that news. Other car companies rose in sympathy, including Carvana Inc. , which was last up 9.6%.

Hertz shares jump 14% on Bloomberg report of self-driving partnership with Apple
Shares of Hertz Global Holdings Inc.  surged 14% Monday, after Bloomberg reported that Apple Inc.  is leasing a fleet of its cars to test self-driving technology. Apple is leasing Lexus RX450h SUVs from Hertz's Donlen fleet-management unit, Bloomberg reported, citing documents from the California Department of Motor Vehicles.

Cars in Vending Machines: Carvana Revenue Jumps 118% as Its Fast-Expansion Plan Unfolds
In its first quarterly report as a public company, Carvana reported a big jump in revenue -- and a wider net loss on heavy spending.

Newly public Carvana Co. (NYSE:CVNA), which sells used cars online and delivers them via distinctive "vending machine" retail facilities, reported on June 6 that its first-quarter loss widened to $38.4 million on revenue of $159.1 million. Excluding some costs, Carvana's net loss was $0.28 per share. That beat expectations: Wall Street analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected a loss of $0.29 per share on revenue of $157.7 million.

Data source: Carvana Co. "Ppts" = percentage points. "EBITDA margin" is a non-GAAP metric: EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) as a percentage of revenue. 
Carvana opened two new retail sites, or "markets," during the first quarter. It had a total of 23 markets as of March 31, 2017.

Carvana opened this brick-and-mortar "market" in Houston, Texas in December. Buyers can choose to have their new vehicles delivered, or to pick them up from the distinctive "vending machine" tower. Image source: Carvana Co.

About Carvana and its vending machines
Phoenix-based Carvana describes itself as "a leading eCommerce platform for buying used cars." The company was spun off from a privately owned car-dealership group, DriveTime Automotive Group, in 2014. It went public on April 28, 2017.
While its primary presence is online, Carvana is known for its distinctive brick-and-mortar retail sites, which it refers to as "markets." The markets feature glass "vending machine" towers that display -- and dispense, after a special oversize "coin" is deposited -- vehicles in inventory. The vending machines may seem whimsical, but there's a good business case for them: The distinctive experience helps differentiate Carvana from local used-car dealers, as well as from heavy-hitting rivals like CarMax (NYSE:KMX) and eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) eBay Motors. 
After Carvana's customers purchase their vehicles online, they can choose to have the new vehicles delivered, or to pick them up from one of the company's vending-machine facilities. 





Carvana as an investment
Carvana's initial public offering was priced at $15 a share, but it fetched just $13.50 when it opened on the New York Stock Exchange on April 28. The ride since then has been a decidedly bumpy one. 

CVNA data by YCharts. Carvana's stock price is shown from its initial public offering on April 28, 2017 through market close on June 6, 2017. Carvana's first-quarter earnings results were released after the market closed on June 6.
Investors have some real concerns. For starters, Carvana is burning cash quickly as it rushes to open more brick-and-mortar dealerships. And it's getting into the used-car business at a difficult time: Used-car prices have been falling for months as the market has struggled to absorb a glut of off-lease vehicles, the result of a boom in new-vehicle leasing that began earlier this decade.
But with the U.S. new-car market likely past its cyclical peak, and average new-car prices near all-time highs, there's a good chance that demand for used vehicles will pick up over the next year or two. With its distinctive branding and customer experience, Carvana could see significant growth.
What Carvana's CEO had to say
In a statement accompanying Carvana's first-ever earnings release, CEO Ernie Garcia talked up the company's opportunity:

We are excited to announce record revenue in our first earnings report as a newly public company. Our strong performance this quarter reflects a significant increase in retail units, as well as expansion into new markets. During the quarter, we made important enhancements to the customer experience through new product development, resulting in ongoing optimization from website through vehicle delivery. 
We continue to see increased consumer adoption of online car buying across our markets, charting a clear path to consistent growth within the $710 billion U.S. used auto market. Carvana's unique business model includes proprietary technology and assets, like the vending machines, that deliver customer experiences that position us to execute against our aggressive growth plans.






Looking ahead: Carvana's guidance for the second quarter and full year
Carvana expects its second-quarter results to shape up as follows:

Retail unit sales of 10,000 to 10,500.
Total revenue between $193 million and $203 million.
Total gross profit per unit of $1,375 to $1,425.
EBITDA margin between (18%) and (18.5%).

For the full year, Carvana expects:

Retail unit sales of 44,000 to 46,000 versus 18,761 in 2016.
Revenue of $850 million to $910 million versus $365 million in 2016.
Total gross profit per unit of $1,475 to $1,575 versus $1,023 in 2016.
EBITDA margin of (14%) to (16%) versus (23.2%) in 2016.
16 to 18 new market openings, to a total of 37 to 39 at the end of 2017.

        A common stock and the issuance of 15.0 million shares of Class A 
        common stock pursuant to our initial public offering
      

        We opened 2 new markets, bringing our end-of-quarter total to 23
      


Q2 and Fiscal 2017 Outlook


      We anticipate further unit and revenue growth, as well as total gross 
      profit per unit improvement. For Q2 2017, we expect:
    


        Retail unit sales of 10,000 – 10,500
      

        Total revenue of $193 million - $203 million
      

        Total gross profit per unit of $1,375 – $1,425
      

        EBITDA margin of (18%) - (18.5%)
      


      For fiscal year 2017, we expect:
    


        Retail unit sales of 44,000 – 46,000, an increase from 18,761 in 2016
      

        Revenue of $850 million – $910 million, an increase from $365 million 
        in 2016
      

        Total gross profit per unit of $1,475 - $1,575, an increase from 
        $1,023 in 2016
      

        EBITDA margin of (14%) - (16%), an improvement from (23.2%) in 2016
      

        16 – 18 new market openings, bringing our end-of-year total to 37 – 39
      


      For more information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures, please 
      see the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measurements to their most 
      directly comparable GAAP-based financial measurements included at the 
      end of this press release. Guidance for EBITDA margin excludes 
      depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense. We have not 
      reconciled EBITDA guidance to GAAP net loss as a result of the 
      uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, interest 
      expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure 
      guidance to the corresponding GAAP measure is not available without 
      unreasonable effort. Depreciation and amortization expense, which is a 
      component of the reconciliation between EBITDA and GAAP net loss, is 
      expected to be between 1.0% and 1.5% of total revenues for both Q2 2017 
      and FY 2017.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures


      As appropriate, we supplement our results of operations determined in 
      accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) 
      with certain non-GAAP financial measurements that are used by 
      management, and which we believe are useful to investors, as 
      supplemental operational measurements to evaluate our financial 
      performance. These measurements should not be considered in isolation or 
      as a substitute for reported GAAP results because they may include or 
      exclude certain items as compared to similar GAAP-based measurements, 
      and such measurements may not be comparable to similarly-titled 
      measurements reported by other companies. Rather, these measurements 
      should be considered as an additional way of viewing aspects of our 
      operations that provide a more complete understanding of our business. 
      We strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial 
      statements included in publicly filed reports in their entirety and not 
      rely solely on any one, single financial measurement or communication.
    

      Reconciliations of our non-GAAP measurements to their most directly 
      comparable GAAP-based financial measurements are included at the end of 
      this press release.

Adjusted Net Loss to Net Loss and Computation of Adjusted Net Loss

      Adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share are supplemental 
      measures of operating performance that do not represent and should not 
      be considered alternatives to net loss and net loss per share, as 
      determined under GAAP. We believe that adjusted net loss and adjusted

Net Loss to EBITDA


      EBITDA is a non-GAAP supplemental measure of operating performance that 
      does not represent and should not be considered an alternative to net 
      loss or cash flow from operations, as determined by GAAP. EBITDA is 
      defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense and 
      depreciation and amortization expense. We use EBITDA to measure the 
      operating performance of our business, excluding specifically identified 
      items that we do not believe directly reflect our core operations and 
      may not be indicative of our recurring operations. EBITDA may not be 
      comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other companies due 
      to potential differences in methods of calculations. A reconciliation of 
      EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is as 
      follows:

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
