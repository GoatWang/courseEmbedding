            Our adult Sunday School class is reading and sharing in the study of the book of Daniel using The Warren Wiersbe Bible Study Series. This is an exceptional study series and offers commentaries and questions that allow for each person to use the study of scripture to help them to realize how God works through us now as much as He has worked in believers lives in the Old Testament days.

            The Study Guide is every thing I hoped for. I like the fact you didn't have to purchase the Commentary BE Resoluted to use the guide. I did purchase both because I really wanted to dig deep into the book of Daniel. The questions in the study guide will take you as deep into the Word of God as you want to go. Has great suggestions on how to use as a small group study. I can't wait to get into the word.

Publisher's Description▼▲
Revolutionize Your Health  Once and for All During an afternoon of baptizing over 800 people, Pastor Rick Warren realized it was time for change. He told his congregation he needed to lose weight and asked if anyone wanted to join him. He thought maybe 200 people would sign up, instead he witnessed a movement unfold as 15,000 people lost over 260,000 pounds in the first year. With assistance from medical and fitness experts, Pastor Rick and thousands of people began a journey to transform their lives. Welcome to The Daniel Plan. Heres the secret sauce: The Daniel Plan is designed to be done in a supportive community relying on Gods instruction for living. When it comes to getting healthy, two are always better than one. Our research has revealed that people getting healthy together lose twice as much weight as those who do it alone. God never meant for you to go through life alone and that includes the journey to health. Unlike the thousands of other books on the market, this book is not about a new diet, guilt-driven gym sessions, or shame-driven fasts. The Daniel Plan shows you how the powerful combination of faith, fitness, food, focus, and friends will change your health forever, transforming you in the most head-turning way imaginablyfrom the inside out.

            I found this book to be inspiring. As I read it I felt that this may be the fitness plan that finally works for me. I've been dieting all my life and still am overweight. I am currently doing the detox plan and have lost 5 pounds. I feel healthier eating organic food and trying new foods. I recommend to anyone trying to lose weight. Trying to get healthier with God is far better than trying to do it by yourself. With God we can do anything. I don't know yet if it will meet my expectations or work for me so that's why I put 4s in but so far I feel healthier and that's great.

            The concept that there is more to getting healthier is more that what we eat has been well described with examples to follow. I am still at the beginning of my journey, but with this information I am hopeful.

            Life-changing concept about eating whole clean foods to initiate a closer walk with the Lord, a healthier outlook on life, and a way to lose weight that is Biblical and WORKS!! My husband and I have had amazing results. I would highly recommend this book to anyone desiring to change their lives for the long term.  It is not just another fad diet plan.

							Q:  
						
												Is it worth getting both the Daniel Plan and the Daniel Plan Cookcook? Also, will a husband who is automatically skeptical of healthy foods, thinking they will upset is irritable bowel syndrome symptoms, find these recipes worth trying?
					



								A:  
							

We would recommend checking with a health care professional before beginning any diet to avoid any potential complication with an existing medical condition.
