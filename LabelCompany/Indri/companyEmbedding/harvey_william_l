Command/HQ



 Losing Any Member of The Thin Blue Line is Unacceptable 


		I have many brothers and sisters, but losing any one of them is painful. We lose far too many every year and we need to aggressively work on reducing the number.
	




Command/HQ



 



 Do you put the Leader in Leadership? 


		What concerns me most is the turnover within law enforcement. If some data is true, most leave the profession because of bad bosses and poor management of personnel, not because of the work.
	




Command/HQ



 



 Strategic planning and thinking 


		In today's world, "flying by the seat of your pants," is no longer acceptable. With so many legal and character attacks waiting in the wings, we have to plan carefully and think about every step.
	




Command/HQ



 Chiefs Don't Need to Go Shopping 


		There are good reasons for the process of bids and large purchases. Done correctly, you can save yourself a lot of time and trouble normally wasted on unnecessary "shopping."
	




Command/HQ



 



 Law Enforcement's Blizzard Warning 


		Things they are a'changing. How we select and hire new recruits is being modified to suit the new generation? It's an ugly storm waiting to happen.
	




Command/HQ



 Tips for New Chiefs of Police 


		Never forget where you came from and always remember that your role is to be the leader of those whose shoulders you are standing on.
	




Command/HQ



 Have SNEW Unit Experience? 


		Do you have an officer with SNEW unit experience?  You DO have one and they are GOOD at their mission.  Get some!
	











Command/HQ



 Carving Out Your Legacy 


		How do you WANT to be remembered?  How you GET remembered is entirely up to you.
	




Command/HQ



 



 Desired Traits for the Future Leaders 


		What will be the desired traits for tomorrow's chiefs and law enforcement leaders?  It's not an easy question to answer, but let's figure it out... if we can.
	




Command/HQ



 



 Teaching Safety - It's a Leadership Role 


		Teaching and preaching safety is part of the Chief's job. If you are a Chief and you are NOT teaching such, you're failing in the performance of your duties.
	




On The Street



 



 Editorial: After the Lightning Strike 


		One Chief's take on the Orlando nightclub attack, observations about motivation and preparation.
	




Command/HQ



 Acquainting New Councilmembers With Your Department 


		We are not asking them to understand the full operational aspects, but just the basics will go a long way in their elected career.
	




Command/HQ



 If I Could Do It All Over 


		We all have a bit of retrospect, some more than others. All of us often ponder to ourselves ‘how would things be if I had gotten ‘do over’. I believe if you rounded up enough of us and got candid answers, you could write the pathway to a better...
	




Training & Careers



 Debit and Credit Leadership 


		What really are the hazards of the new chief’s position? You carry a burden about you all of the time; it never takes a day off. It is omnipresent and there is no escape from it.
	











Command/HQ



 The Social Life of a Chief 


		While some believe that Chiefs have a busy social life that is all fun and relaxation, albeit in uniform, that just isn't so. The social life of a Chief isn't near as exciting as you might think.
	




Command/HQ



 The Chief's Real Job Description 


		The biggest job isn't always written into a formal job description. In some occupations, like law enforcement, leadership carries responsibilities that can't always be quantified but can be easily observed.
	




Command/HQ



 Skills for the New Supervisor 


		Nobody told you that being a supervisor was a cakewalk. It is hard work and can get better with experience.
	




Command/HQ



 Leadership's Role in Officer Safety 


		If you're going to be a law enforcement leader who displays lives active concern for the safety of the officers under your command, it's more than just talking the talk. You have to walk the walk.
	




Training & Careers



 Plight of the FNG 


		What does it mean to be the Fabulous New Guy/Girl? It means a delightful mix of ribbing, criticism, poking fun, lots of help, education, mentoring and... so much more.
	




Command/HQ



 Facing Law Enforcement’s Newest Era 


		Movements, protests, lack of support and immense scrutiny; that's what we seem to face looking forward in the realm of law enforcement. Are you prepared?
	




Training & Careers



 Advice to a New Officer 


		When a Chief with 30+ years of experience offers advice to new officers, it behooves them to pay attention.  So... PAY ATTENTION (if you're a new officer).
	











Training & Careers



 Job Seeking is More Than the Application 


		Landing a job is hard work and requires personal effort
	




Command/HQ



 Advice to a New FTO 


		Your first assignment as an FTO will be most challenging. It can also be your most rewarding. Here are a few tips on how to make it the more positive experience - for both you AND your rookie.
	




Command/HQ



 Blue Flu Remedy 


		Do you really have the flu? Or is there another issue affecting your motivation? Check yourself.
