At North Shore Hair Transplant Specialists, we use precision controlled techniques that have changed the way donor grafts are harvested and placed. N.S.H.T.S also uses the expansion technique, microscopic ultra refined follicular dissection and extraction, feathering techniques, unique hairline framework design and an intricate 2 layer trichophytic closure for the FU procedure. This provides natural looking density in one procedure.
