Winklevoss Capital Management Offices – New York City


Firm
BR Design Associates

Client
Winklevoss Capital,

                            5,000 sqft
                        

Year

New York, 
United States, 


Industry
Financial / Investments,  

BR Design Associates has designed a new office space for New York City-based investment firm Winklevoss Capital Management.
Winklevoss Capital Management wanted to create an office where they could establish their new firm as well as provide an ‘incubator’ space where the startups in their portfolio could grow before having to invest in their own office spaces. To achieve this goal, the concept was to have a very open and simple space, which would foster collaboration within and even between different startups, as well as provide smaller private spaces for private conversations. In addition to amenities like a lounge and pantry, outfitted with collaborative media: space furniture, the office also has state of the art technology to control- via iPad- all lighting, window treatments, and ambient sound, including a full size DJ Booth for after hours.
Tyler and Cameron have the only two private offices in the space, flanking the main conference room; however, they are glass-enclosed to maintain transparency, as the twins want to be accessible and visible, reflecting their hands-on, active involvement in the growth of their investments. The main conference room also has fully retractable sliding glass doors that allow the space to merge with the adjacent open lounge area for large team meetings or even after-hours events and dancing. A refined white and grey color palette- with a punch of pink- further emphasize this playful yet professional work environment along with a mix of custom modern furniture, vintage classics, and open benching.
