	ABOUT



	THIS PROSPECTUS





	This prospectus is part of a registration statement that we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, using a “shelf” registration process.  Under the shelf process, the selling shareholders may from time to time use this prospectus to sell or otherwise dispose of the securities described in this prospectus in one or more offerings.  This prospectus provides you with a general description of the securities that the selling shareholders may offer.  Each time this prospectus is used to offer securities, we may provide a prospectus supplement and, if applicable, a pricing supplement, that will contain specific information about the terms of that offering.  Any prospectus supplement and any pricing supplement also may add, update or change information contained in this prospectus.  You should read this prospectus, any prospectus supplement and any pricing prospectus, together with additional information described and contained in the documents referred to under the heading “Where You Can Find More Information” and “Incorporation of Certain Documents by Reference.”  The selling shareholders are only offering these securities in states where the offer is permitted.


	 


	The registration statement that contains this prospectus, including the exhibits to the registration statement, contains additional information about us and the securities offered under this prospectus.  That registration statement can be read at the SEC’s web site or at the SEC’s offices referenced under the heading “Where You Can Find More Information.”



	 







	RISK FACTORS


	 


	You should carefully consider the specific risks set forth under the caption “Risk Factors” in any applicable prospectus supplement and under the caption “Risk Factors” in any of our filings with the SEC pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, incorporated by reference herein, before making an investment decision.  For more information see “Where You Can Find More Information” and “Incorporation of Certain Documents by Reference.”



	 







	FORWARD‑LOOKING STATEMENTS


	 


	We make statements in this prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference that are considered forward‑looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.  Such forward‑looking statements are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to them.  The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “may,” “estimate,” “expect,” and similar expressions, and variations of such terms or the negative of such terms, are intended to identify such forward‑looking statements.


	 


	All forward‑looking statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions.  If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any such forward‑looking statements.  Important factors that could cause or contribute to such difference include those referenced under “Risk Factors” in this prospectus and any accompanying prospectus supplement and in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10‑K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, incorporated by reference into this prospectus.  You should not place undue reliance on such forward‑looking statements, which speak only as of their dates.  We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward‑looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  You should carefully consider the information referenced under the heading “Risk Factors.”


	 





	ABOUT GENCO


	 


	We are a New York City-based company, incorporated in the Marshall Islands in 2004.  We transport iron ore, coal, grain, steel products and other drybulk cargoes along worldwide shipping routes through the ownership and operation of drybulk carrier vessels.  Excluding the Genco Leader and the Genco Acheron, which were sold on November 4, 2016 and December 12, 2016, respectively, our fleet currently consists of 65 drybulk vessels, including 13 Capesize, six Panamax, four Ultramax, 21 Supramax, five Handymax and 16 Handysize drybulk carriers, with an


	 









	Table of Contents








	aggregate carrying capacity of approximately 4,907,000 dwt, and the average age of our fleet is currently approximately 9.5 years.  We seek to deploy our vessels on time charters, spot market-related time charters or in vessel pools trading in the spot market, to reputable charterers, including Cargill International S.A., Swissmarine Services S.A. and the Clipper Logger Pool and Clipper Sapphire Pool, in which Clipper Group acts as the pool manager.  The majority of the vessels in our current fleet are presently engaged under time charter, spot market-related time charter and vessel pool contracts that expire (assuming the option periods in the time charters are not exercised) between January 2017 and July 2017. Our common stock has traded on the NYSE under the trading symbol “GNK” since July 20, 2015, prior to which it traded on the OTC Bulletin Board, the NYSE, the OTCQB marketplace, and the OTC Pink marketplace.


	 


	Our management team and our other employees are responsible for the commercial and strategic management of our fleet.  Commercial management includes the negotiation of charters for vessels, managing the mix of various types of charters, such as time charters, voyage charters and spot market-related time charters, and monitoring the performance of our vessels under their charters.  Strategic management includes locating, purchasing, financing and selling vessels.  We currently contract with three independent technical managers to provide technical management of our fleet at a lower cost than we believe would be possible in-house.  Technical management involves the day-to-day management of vessels, including performing routine maintenance, attending to vessel operations and arranging for crews and supplies.  Members of our New York City-based management team oversee the activities of our independent technical managers.





	Our principal executive offices are located at 299 Park Avenue, 12th Floor, New York, New York 10171, and our telephone number is (646) 443-8550.


	 


	We urge that appropriate caution be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in any of our liabilities and/or our securities. See “Risk Factors.”





	RECENT DEVELOPMENTS


	 


	On November 10, 2016, we entered into a senior secured term loan facility (the “New Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of up to $400,000,000 with Nordea Bank Finland plc, New York Branch, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (publ), DVB Bank SE, ABN AMRO Capital USA LLC, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, Deutsche Bank AG Filiale Deutschlandgeschäft, Crédit Industriel et Commercial, and BNP Paribas. On November 15, 2016, the proceeds under the New Facility were used to refinance our $100 Million Term Loan Facility, $253 Million Term Loan Facility, $148 Million Credit Facility, $22 Million Term Loan Facility, $44 Million Term Loan Facility, and 2015 Revolving Credit Facility (the “Prior Facilities”), each of which facilities are described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016, which is incorporated herein by reference.  In addition, on November 15, 2016, we entered into agreements with our lenders to amend agreements for our $98 Million Facility and our 2014 Term Loan Facilities (each as defined in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016).  We entered into the New Facility and the other agreements described above to address our previously disclosed liquidity and covenant compliance issues.  These agreements are described in further detail in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on November 15, 2016, which is incorporated herein by reference.


	 


	In addition, pursuant to stock purchase agreements entered into on October 6 and 27, 2016, we completed a $125 million private placement of our Series A Preferred Stock to fulfill conditions under the New Facility and the other agreements described above, all of which has been converted to common stock.  Further details of the private placement and subsequent conversion are set forth below under “Selling Stockholders” and in our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on November 15, 2016 and January 4, 2017.

	Limitations on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors


	 


	The BCA authorizes corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of directors and officers to corporations and their shareholders for monetary damages for breaches of directors’ fiduciary duties.  Our second amended and restated articles of incorporation include a provision that eliminates the personal liability of directors for monetary damages for actions taken as a director to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.


	 


	Our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws provide that we must indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent authorized by applicable law.  We are also expressly authorized, under our amended and restated bylaws, to advance certain expenses (including attorneys’ fees and disbursements and court costs) to our directors and officers and carry directors’ and officers’ insurance providing indemnification for our directors, officers and certain employees for some liabilities.  We believe that these indemnification provisions and insurance are useful to attract and retain qualified directors and executive officers.


	 


	The limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their fiduciary duties.  These provisions may also have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our shareholders.  In addition, your investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to these indemnification provisions.


	 


	Anti‑takeover Effects of Certain Provisions of Our Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws


	 


	Several provisions of our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, which are summarized below, may have anti‑takeover effects. These provisions are intended to avoid costly takeover battles, lessen our vulnerability to a hostile change of control and enhance the ability of our board of directors to maximize shareholder value in connection with any unsolicited offer to acquire us. However, these anti‑takeover provisions could also discourage, delay or prevent (1) the merger or acquisition of us by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise that a shareholder may consider in its best interest and (2) the removal of incumbent officers and directors.


	 


	Limited Actions by Shareholders


	 


	Our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws provide that any action required or permitted to be taken by our shareholders must be effected at an annual or special meeting of shareholders or by the unanimous written consent of our shareholders. Our second amended and restated


	 




	5









	Table of Contents








	articles of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws provide that, subject to certain exceptions, our Chairman, President, or Secretary at the direction of the board of directors or our Secretary at the request in writing by any one or more shareholders that hold, in the aggregate, at least a majority of the outstanding registered shares of the Corporation entitled to vote may call special meetings of our shareholders. The business transacted at the special meeting is limited to the purposes stated in the notice.





	Advance Notice Requirements for Shareholder Proposals and Director Nominations


	 


	Our amended and restated bylaws provide that shareholders seeking to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring business before an annual meeting of shareholders must provide timely notice of their proposal in writing to the corporate secretary. Generally, to be timely, a shareholder’s notice must be received at our principal executive offices not less than 120 days nor more than 150 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders. Our amended and restated bylaws also specify requirements as to the form and content of a shareholder’s notice. These provisions may impede shareholder’s ability to bring matters before an annual meeting of shareholders or make nominations for directors at an annual meeting of shareholders.



	 







	SELLING SHAREHOLDERS


	 


	In October 2016, we entered into stock purchase agreements (the “Purchase Agreements”) with the selling shareholders, including (among others) funds or related entities managed by Centerbridge Partners, L.P. or its affiliates (“Centerbridge”), funds or related entities managed by Strategic Value Partners, LLC or its affiliates (“SVP”), and funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, LLC (“Apollo” and, collectively with Centerbridge and SVP, the “Initial Investors”), representing the Company’s three largest shareholders, for the purchase of Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”), for an aggregate of $125 million in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.  On November 15, 2016, pursuant to the Purchase Agreements, we completed the private placement of 27,061,856 shares of Series A Preferred Stock — 25,773,196 shares at a price per share of $4.85, and an additional 1,288,660 shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued on a pro rata basis to the Initial Investors pursuant to certain of the Purchase Agreements as a commitment fee in respect of Initial Investors’ commitment to purchase shares under such Purchase Agreements (the “Commitment Fee”). Each selling shareholder represented that it was an accredited investor within the meaning of Regulation D under the Securities Act.


	 


	The Series A Preferred Stock sold pursuant to the Purchase Agreements was automatically and mandatorily converted into the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, following approval by our shareholders of such conversion at a special meeting of shareholders held on January 4, 2017 (the “Special Meeting”).


	 


	Pursuant to the initial Purchase Agreements entered into with the Initial Investors, we agreed (subject to shareholder approval, which was obtained at the Special Meeting) to increase of the size of our board of directors from eight members to nine members and to grant to the Initial Investors the right to nominate one designee or, if certain ownership requirements are met by the applicable Initial Investor, two designees of such Initial Investor to our board of directors.


	 


	Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreements, the Company has entered into Registration Rights Agreements with selling shareholders (the “Registration Rights Agreements”).  The Registration Rights Agreements require, among other things, that we file one or more “resale” registration statements, registering under the Securities Act the offer and sale of all of the common stock issued or to be issued to the selling shareholders upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock.  This registration statement is one such registration statement.


	 


	Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreements, we are registering shares of common stock covered by this prospectus for re-offers and resales by the selling shareholders named in the table below.  We are registering these shares to permit selling shareholders to resell their shares when they deem appropriate.  A selling shareholder may resell all, a portion or none of such shareholder’s shares at any time and from time to time.  Selling shareholders may also sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of some or all of their shares of our common stock in transactions

	exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.  We do not know when or in what amounts the selling shareholders may offer shares for sale under this prospectus and any prospectus supplement.  We will

	 

	pay all expenses incurred with respect to the registration of the shares of common stock owned by the selling shareholders, other than underwriting fees, discounts or commissions, which will be borne by the selling shareholders.





	Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC.  Information in the table below with respect to beneficial ownership is based on information that has been furnished by each of the selling shareholders, as well as information reported on Schedules 13D or 13G and other public documents filed with the SEC. We have not sought to verify such information. Information concerning the selling shareholders may change from time to time. Any changes to the information provided below may be set forth in a supplement to this prospectus, in a post-effective amendment or in filings we make with the SEC under the Exchange Act.


	 


	Information about additional selling shareholders, if any, including their identities and the common stock to be registered on their behalf, may be set forth in a prospectus supplement, in a post-effective amendment or in filings that we make with the SEC under the Exchange Act.


	 


	The term “selling shareholder” includes the shareholders named below and their respective transferees, assignees, pledges, donees and other successors who later come to hold any of the selling shareholders’ interests in the shares other than through a public sale, any of whom may from time to time offer shares under this prospectus.


	 


	The following table sets forth the names of the selling shareholders (and/or the beneficial owners) and the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by each of them as of the date of this prospectus. There are currently no agreements, arrangements or understandings with respect to the sale of any of the shares.

	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION


	 


	Each selling shareholder of the securities and any of their pledgees, assignees and successors-in-interest may, from time to time, sell any or all of their securities covered hereby on the principal trading market or any other stock exchange, market or trading facility on which the securities are traded or in private transactions.  These sales may be at fixed or negotiated prices.  A selling shareholder may use any one or more of the following methods when selling securities:


	 



	•

	          

	ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker dealer solicits purchasers;



	 



	•

	          

	block trades in which the broker dealer will attempt to sell the securities as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;



	 



	•

	          

	purchases by a broker dealer as principal and resale by the broker dealer for its account;



	 



	•

	          

	an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable exchange;



	 



	•

	          

	privately negotiated transactions;



	 



	•

	Table of Contents









	•

	          

	a combination of any such methods of sale; or



	 



	•

	          

	any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law.



	 


	The selling shareholders may also sell securities under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, if available, rather than under this prospectus.


	 


	In connection with the sale of the securities or interests therein, the selling shareholders may enter into derivative or other hedging transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions.  These financial institutions may in turn engage engage in short sales of the securities in the course of hedging the positions they assume, deliver this prospectus in connection with some or all of those sales and use the shares covered by this prospectus to close out any short position created in connection with those sales.  The selling shareholders may also sell securities short and deliver these securities to close out their short positions or pledge or grant a security interest in some or all of our common stock covered by this prospectus to support a derivative or hedging position or other obligation and, if the selling shareholders default in the performance of their obligations, the pledgees or secured parties may offer and sell our common stock from time to time pursuant to this prospectus.


	 


	The selling shareholders and any broker-dealers or agents that are involved in selling the securities may be deemed to be “underwriters” within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales.  In such event, any commissions received by such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the resale of the securities purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting commissions or discounts under the Securities Act.  Each selling shareholder has informed the Company that it does not have any written or oral agreement or understanding, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute the securities.


	 


	In addition to the foregoing, the Initial Investors may also, from time to time, authorize dealers, acting as our agents, to offer and sell securities.  At the time a particular offering of securities is made, a prospectus supplement, if required, will be distributed, which will set forth the aggregate amount of shares of common stock being offered and the terms of the offering, including the name or names of any underwriters, dealers, brokers or agents, if any.  In connection with the sale of securities, or the purchasers of securities for whom the underwriters may act as agents, may compensate underwriters in the form of underwriting discounts or commissions.  If underwriters or dealers are used in the sale, the securities will be acquired by the underwriters or dealers for their own account and may be resold from time to time in one or more transactions, at a fixed price or prices, which may be changed, or at market prices prevailing at the time of the sale, or at prices related to such prevailing market prices, or at negotiated prices.  The securities may be offered to the public either through underwriting syndicates represented by one or more managing underwriters or directly by one or more of such firms.  Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement, if any,  the obligations of underwriters or dealers to purchase the securities offered will be subject to certain conditions precedent and the underwriters or dealers will be obligated to purchase all of the offered securities if any are purchased.  Any public offering price and any discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid by underwriters or dealers to other dealers may be changed from time to time.


	 


	We will describe in any applicable prospectus supplement any compensation the Initial Investors pay to underwriters or agents in connection with the offering of securities, and any discounts, concessions or commissions allowed by underwriters to participating dealers.  Dealers and agents participating in the distribution of securities may be deemed to be underwriters, and any discounts and commissions received by them and any profit realized by them on resale of the securities may be deemed to be underwriting discounts and commissions.  The Initial Investors may enter into agreements to indemnify underwriters, dealers and agents against certain civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and to reimburse these persons for certain expenses.


	 


	To the extent that the Initial Investors make sales to or through one or more underwriters or agents in at-the-market offerings, they may do so pursuant to the terms of a distribution agreement between the Initial Investors and the underwriters or agents.  If the Initial Investors engage in at-the-market sales pursuant to a distribution agreement, they will sell shares of our common stock to or through one or more underwriters or agents, which may


	 




	12









	Table of Contents








	act on an agency basis or on a principal basis.  During the term of any such agreement, the Initial Investors may sell shares on a daily basis in exchange transactions or otherwise as they may agree with the underwriters or agents.  The distribution agreement will provide that any shares of our common stock sold will be sold at prices related to the then prevailing market prices for our common stock.  Therefore, exact figures regarding proceeds that will be raised or commissions to be paid cannot be determined at this time and will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement, if any.  Pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement, the Initial Investors also may agree to sell, and the relevant underwriters or agents may agree to solicit offers to purchase, blocks of our common stock or other securities.  The terms of each such distribution agreement will be set forth in more detail in the applicable prospectus supplement, if any.  In the event that any underwriter or agent acts as principal, or broker-dealer acts as underwriter, it may engage in certain transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of our securities.  We will describe any such activities in any prospectus supplement relating to the transaction.


	 


	If indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, if any, the Initial Investors may authorize underwriters or other persons acting as their agents to solicit offers by institutions or other suitable purchasers to purchase the securities from the Initial Investors at the public offering price set forth in such prospectus supplement, pursuant to delayed delivery contracts providing for payment and delivery on the date or dates stated in such prospectus supplement.  These purchasers may include, among others, commercial and savings banks, insurance companies, pension funds, investment companies and educational and charitable institutions.  Delayed delivery contracts will be subject to the condition that the purchase of the securities covered by the delayed delivery contracts will not at the time of delivery be prohibited under the laws of any jurisdiction in the United States to which the purchaser is subject.  The underwriters and agents will not have any responsibility with respect to the validity or performance of these contracts.


	 


	To facilitate the offering of securities, certain persons participating in the offering may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain, or otherwise affect the price of the securities.  This may include over-allotments or short sales of the securities, which involve the sale by persons participating in the offering of more securities than we sold to them.  In these circumstances, these persons would cover such over-allotments or short positions by making purchases in the open market or by exercising their over-allotment option, if any.  In addition, these persons may stabilize or maintain the price of the securities by bidding for or purchasing securities in the open market or by imposing penalty bids, whereby selling concessions allowed to dealers participating in the offering may be reclaimed if securities sold by them are repurchased in connection with stabilization transactions.  The effect of these transactions may be to stabilize or maintain the market price of the securities at a level above that which might otherwise prevail in the open market.  These transactions may be discontinued at any time.


	 


	Certain of the underwriters, dealers or agents and their associates may engage in transactions with and perform services for us in the ordinary course of our business for which they receive compensation.


	 


	The Company is required to pay certain fees and expenses incurred by the Company incident to the registration of the securities.  The Company has agreed to indemnify the selling shareholders against certain losses, claims, damages and liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.


	 


	Any securities covered by this prospectus which qualify for sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act may be sold under Rule 144 rather than under this prospectus. The selling shareholders have advised us that there is no underwriter or coordinating broker acting in connection with the proposed sale of the resale securities by the selling shareholders.


	 


	We agreed to keep this prospectus effective until the earlier of (i) the date on which the securities may be resold by the selling shareholders without registration and without regard to any volume or manner-of-sale limitations by reason of Rule 144, without the requirement for the Company to be in compliance with the current public information under Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect or (ii) all of the securities have been sold pursuant to this prospectus or Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect.  The resale securities will be sold only through registered or licensed brokers or dealers if required under applicable state securities laws. In addition, in certain states, the resale securities covered hereby may not be sold

	Table of Contents








	unless they have been registered or qualified for sale in the applicable state or an exemption from the registration or qualification requirement is available and is complied with.


	 


	We have informed the selling shareholders that the anti-manipulation provisions of Regulation M under the Exchange Act may apply to their sales of common stock.  In addition, to the extent applicable, we will make copies of this prospectus (as it may be supplemented or amended from time to time) available to the selling shareholders for the purpose of satisfying the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act.

	our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which contains our audited consolidated financial statements for the most recent fiscal year for which those statements have been filed. Pursuant to ASU 2015-03, “Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (Subtopic 835-30),” for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, we are required to present debt issuance costs in the balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of as deferred charge assets. The application of this standard results in a retrospective elimination of deferred charges and a corresponding decrease of debt, and affects the balance sheet of years ended December 31, 2011 – 2015. This reclassification does not impact net income (loss) as previously reported or any prior amounts reported on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), or the consolidated statements of cash flows. The balance sheet financial information for the years ended December 31, 2011 – 2015 has been updated to reflect the adoption of ASU 2015-03 as presented in the table below.

	Indemnification of Directors and Officers






	 


	We are Marshall Islands corporation. The BCA provides that Marshall Islands corporations may indemnify any of their directors or officers who are or are threatened to be a party to any legal action resulting from fulfilling their duties to the corporation against reasonable expenses, judgments and fees (including attorneys’ fees) incurred in connection with such action if the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of no contest, or its equivalent, will not create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. However, no indemnification will be permitted in cases where it is determined that the director or officer was liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his duty to the corporation, unless the court in which such action was brought determines that the person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity, and then only for the expenses that the court deems proper. A corporation is permitted to advance payment for expenses occurred in defense of an action if its board of directors decides to do so. In addition, Marshall Islands corporations may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the corporation against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in such capacity whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of the BCA.


	 


	Our second amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted under the BCA. The SEC has indicated that, to the extent that indemnification for liabilities arising under U.S. federal securities laws may be permitted to directors or officers under the BCA or our second amended and restated articles of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws, such indemnification is against public policy and thus unenforceable.

	Item 17.



	Undertakings






	 



	(a)

	    

	The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:



	 



	(1)

	   

	To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement:



	 



	(i)

	      

	To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;



	 



	(ii)

	     

	To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in this registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the “Calculation of Registration Fee” table in the effective registration statement; and



	 



	(iii)

	    

	To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in this registration statement or any material change to such information in this registration statement;



	 



	provided, however

	, that paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) above do not apply if the information required to be included in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the Commission by the registrant pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are incorporated by reference in this registration statement, or is contained in a form of prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) that is part of this registration statement.


	 



	(2)

	   

	That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial

	bona fide

	offering thereof.



	 



	(3)

	   

	To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.



	 



	(4)

	   

	That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:



	 



	(i)

	      

	Each prospectus filed by a registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the date the filed prospectus was deemed part of and included in this registration statement; and



	 



	(ii)

	     

	Each prospectus required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2), (b)(5) or (b)(7) as part of a registration statement in reliance on Rule 430B relating to an offering made pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i), (vii) or (x) for the purpose of providing the information required by Section 10(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 shall be deemed to be part of and included in this registration statement as of the earlier of the date such form of prospectus is first used after effectiveness or the date of the first contract of sale of securities in the offering described in the prospectus.  As provided in Rule 430B, for liability purposes of the issuer and any person that is at that date an underwriter, such date shall be deemed to be a new effective date of the registration statement relating to the securities in the registration statement to which the prospectus relates, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial

	bona fide

	offering thereof. 

	Provided, however

	, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of this registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into this registration statement or prospectus that is part of this registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such effective date, supersede or modify any statement that was made in this registration statement or prospectus that was part of this registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such effective date.



	 



	(5)

	   

	That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:



	 









	Table of Contents








	The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:


	 



	(i)

	      

	Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;



	 



	(ii)

	     

	Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant;



	 



	(iii)

	    

	The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and



	 



	(iv)

	    

	Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.



	 



	(b)

	   

	The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each filing of the registrant’s annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that is incorporated by reference in this registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial

	bona fide

	offering thereof.



	 



	(c)

	    

	If any securities registered under this registration statement are to be offered to existing security holders pursuant to warrants or rights and any securities not taken by security holders are to be reoffered to the public, the undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to supplement the prospectus, after the expiration of the subscription period, to set forth the results of the subscription offer, the transactions by the underwriters during the subscription period, the amount of unsubscribed securities to be purchased by the underwriters, and the terms of any subsequent reoffering thereof.  If any public offering by the underwriters is to be made on terms differing from those set forth on the cover page of the prospectus, a post-effective amendment will be filed to set forth the terms of such offering.



	 



	(d)

	   

	The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to file an application for the purpose of determining the eligibility of the trustee to act under subsection (a) of Section 310 of the Trust Indenture Act in accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed by the Commission under Section 305(b)(2) of the Trust Indenture Act.



	 



	(e)

	   

	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable.  In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.



	 



	(f)

	    

	The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that:



	 



	(1)

	    

	For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective.



	 



	(2)

	    

	For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial

	bona fide

	offering thereof.
