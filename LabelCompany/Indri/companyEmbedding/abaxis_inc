What technology does the VetScan HM5 utilize?
The VetScan HM5 uses a combination of chemical differentiation and impedance technology to provide the 5-part WBC differential. With impedance technology, electrically neutral blood cells generate an electrical pulse as they each pass through an electronically charged aperture. Cell counts are determined by the number of pulses measured in a given volume of blood over a set period of time. The size of the pulse generated is directly proportional to the volume of each cell. This size discrimination, along with susceptibility to various lysing agents, distinguishes the cell types and provides basis for the 5-part differential. The size of the VetScan HM5 aperture was specifically designed to accommodate veterinary blood cells, thereby providing optimal differentiation.


What type of sample is used?
Hematology analyses require EDTA-treated blood (from lavender or purple top tubes containing potassium EDTA only). It is important to ensure that your sample is well mixed and contains optimal proportions of blood and EDTA. The following guidelines should be followed: Fill each tube at least half-full with blood to eliminate dilution errors. Thoroughly mix each sample by gently inverting the filled potassium EDTA sample tube by hand 10 to 15 times to avoid clot formation. If possible, run the sample immediately after mixing. If testing is delayed and the sample is placed on a rocker, be sure to mix it thoroughly again before analysis by gently inverting the tube 10 to 15 times. This ensures the homogeneity of the sample. Do not shake samples. Doing so can damage the blood cells, and can form micro-bubbles that will cause inaccurate results. Never use a rocker for samples smaller than 1.0 ml. Rockers do not mix samples. Feline samples frequently demonstrate platelet aggregations (clumps). Vortex mixing for up to 10 seconds can disaggregate these clumps with no adverse effect on the sample. Some practitioners find that collecting blood from the medial saphenous vein using a vacutainer minimizes platelet clumping.

For further information on sample collection and handling, refer to our Tech Brief, "Sample Collection and Handling".


What species are supported?
Fifteen species are supported on the VetScan HM5. In 5-part differential mode: Dog, Cat, Horse, Cow, Alpaca and Llama. In the 3-part differential mode, currently validated species are: mouse, rabbit, rat, ferret, pig, goat, monkey, sheep and guinea pig.



What maintenance is recommended for the VetScan HM5?
As with any cell counter, the analyzer must be kept clean to avoid build up of debris and particle interference in the system. Performing the simple and easy preventative maintenance will keep the HM5 in optimal operating condition, thus ensuring peak performance, and high quality results.


What is the shelf-life of the VetScan HM5 hematology reagents?
Shelf life is 24 months from date of manufacture. Open reagent packs should be used within 26 weeks (~5 months).



What parameters are reported with the VetScan HM5?
22 parameters complete blood with cellular histograms are provided:

WBC

WBC: Total White Blood Cell Count Graphical WBC and EOS histograms provide added information about sample integrity and contents. 
LYM: lymphocytes and lymphocyte percentage 
MON: monocytes and monocyte percentage 
NEU: neutrophil and neutrophil percentage 
EOS: eosinophil and eosinophil percentage 
BAS: basophil and basophile percentage

RBC

HGB: Hemoglobin 
HCT: Hematocrit

RBC: Red Blood Cell count and indices: 
MCV: Mean Cell Volume 
MCH: Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin 
MCHC: Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration 
RDW: Red Cell Distribution Width 
Graphical RBC Histogram is included.

PLT

PLT: Platelet, or thrombocyte, count and parameters: 
MPV: Mean Platelet Volume 
PCT: Platelet hematocrit 
PDW: Platelet Distribution Width 
Graphical Platelet Histogram is included.



How can I avoid platelet clumping? 
Platelet clumping is a fairly common occurrence, especially in feline samples. This clumping may prevent accurate counting by both automated systems and manual slide counting. There are, however, a number of methods you may employ to minimize platelet clumping. 

Preventative Measures

Draw sample from medial saphenous vein while the cat is held in a lateral recumbent position; stroke gently to reduce stress.
Draw sample directly into EDTA tube (e.g. Monovette system) and mix thoroughly, immediately (or transfer immediately to EDTA tube from syringe and mix thoroughly).
Even with these preventative measures, feline platelet clumping is not always avoidable but can be minimized.


What are the power requirements needed to operate the system?
The VetScan HM5 System requires 100-240 volts AC, 50-60 Hz or 12 volts DC. Abaxis recommends that the VetScan HM5 be plugged into a surge protector designed for use with a computer. Abaxis recommends the use of an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) if the VetScan HM5 will be used in an area prone to electrical surges or power outages.



What is a blank and why is it needed?
A blank measurement checks the cleanliness of the VetScan HM5 fluidics systems, and is used to establish a baseline for sample measurements. The results of a blank are used to determine if the background will affect the test results, and whether the analyzer needs cleaning or maintenance. A blank must be run every 12 hours. Each blank measurement remains valid for 12 hours of continuous operation, after which the analyzer displays "BLANK needed," and a new blank must be run. Acceptable blank measurement readings, which match the criteria below, must be accepted to reset the instrument.

WBC <0.5 x 10e3 cells/μl 
HB <10 g/l 
RBC <0.05 x10e6 cells/μl 
PLT <25 x10e3 cells/μl 
EOS <0.1 x10e3 cells/μl


I just changed my reagent pack and my VetScan HM5 still says the reagents are empty or out of date.
The reagent status needs to be reset. Press Utilities, Maintenance, reagent status, change. This will reset the volume to 100% for the reagents and 0% for waste and change the install date to today's date.


My VetScan HM5 has the message, "One or more of your reagent sensors has been disabled." What should I do?
This message is informing you that one of the sensors used to detect the reagents flowing into the VetScan HM5 has been turned off. In order to achieve the most accurate test results, it is advised to turn on all the sensors and calibrate. To do this, select Utilities, Settings, Fluid Sensors. Ensure all the sensors are turned on by filling in the black box to the left of the sensor name; then calibrate the sensors.


Can my data be saved to an external disk?
The VetScan HM5 can store up to 5,000 complete test results in its internal database, results are stored chronologically by date and time. You can retrieve these results anytime. Data can be downloaded to a USB flash drive or a compatible data-management system.


How many tests will I get from my reagent pack?
The throughput of the reagent pack varies depending on the number of tests you run a day. The more tests run in a day, the more you'll get from your reagent pack. Clinics that typically run 3-6 tests a day typically receive 90-120 tests from their reagent pack. However, running extra cleaning, priming, and blanking will increase the consumption of the reagent pack, therefore decreasing the reagent pack yield. Properly maintaining the VetScan HM5 will help increase the yield of the reagent pack.


What kind of external printer can I use with my VetScan HM5?
For a current list of compatible printers, contact Technical Support or refer to your operators' manual for a complete list (see page 3-3).


Can I use my VetScan HM5 to communicate with my lab management software?
Please check with your practice management software supplier for updates/details.



What is the purpose of the different reagents in a reagent pack?
Diluent: Isotonic saline solution is used to dilute whole blood specimens and to rinse the analyzer's fluidic system between analyses. 
Rinse: Used to rinse the analyzer after a sample run. 
Cleaner: Used in the fluidic system cleaning process. 
Lyse: Used to create hemolysate for three-part WBC differential and for total WBC and HGB. 
Lyse2: Used to dilute whole blood and differentially lyse white blood cells, leaving eosinophils for the EOS count.


How Does it Work?
The VetScan HM5 Hematology System produces accurate cell counts based on impedance technology. It delivers a 22-parameter CBC analysis, including a 5-part WBC differential and four cellular histograms.

Is the VS2 a "one test at a time" system?
No. The VS2 offers a variety of assays in a number of preconfigured panels for the utmost flexibility, while requiring only seconds of hands-on time, and providing the lowest possible operating costs.


Do I need a separate instrument for electrolytes or blood gases?
No. The VS2 offers Na+, K+, tCO2, and Cl- which can be run on the same unit, test procedure, and sample.


Can the analyzer detect a flawed or defective rotor?
Yes. The VS2's extensive Intelligent Quality Control (iQC) detects any flaw or potential anomaly in the rotor. Abaxis also provides a Performance Guarantee covering manufacture defective rotors. (This does not include cancellations or assay suppressions due to improper rotor storage, operator error, or poor sample integrity.)


How many species can the VS2 store for reference ranges?
In addition to cat, dog, and horse, the VS2 includes pre-determined specie labels for entering your own reference ranges, and also provides 99 open labels for adding further species.


How many result records can the VS2 hold?
The VS2 stores the results of the last 5000 rotors run. Thereafter, the VS2 replaces the oldest record with the most recent.


What maintenance does the VS2 require?
The only required maintenance is cleaning the air filter on the back of the analyzer.


Does the VS2 require calibration?
No. Unlike any other system, the VS2 reagents are factory calibrated. The analyzer reads calibration values from the barcode on the rotor itself. The VS2 then calibrates its optics automatically for each measurement, and measures optical absorbance to determine the concentration of each analyte.


Does the VS2 need surge protection or an uninterruptible power supply?
Abaxis recommends plugging the VS2 into a surge protector designed for use with a computer. Abaxis also recommends using an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) in areas prone to electrical surges or power outages.


Can I connect the VS2 to an external computer?
"Yes. Sample results and status reports can be transmitted to a computer (through a USB port) whenever calculated or prepared. You can use popular terminal emulation software to collect the data from the VS2. The data is delivered in raw ASCII format, and can easily be converted to text for use in other applications.

For information about optional Ethernet connectivity capabilities, or ASTM or XML connections, contact Abaxis Technical Service, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, at 1-800-822-2947.

The VS2 also interfaces with many commercial veterinary data management software packages. For information on compatible packages, check with your software vendor, or contact Abaxis Technical Service."


What types of samples can I run on the VS2?
Whole blood, serum or plasma.


Is precision pipetting required?
No. Adding approximately 100-120µL of sample is sufficient. (Make sure not to overfill the chamber, or internal spills can result.) The VS2's on-board microfluidics handle the rest.


Can I use sodium heparin?
No. This anticoagulant can alter results. We recommend using lithium heparin with the VS2.


Can I use whole blood directly in a rotor?
No. Syringes might be heparinized with sodium heparin anticoagulant, which is not recommended for use with the VS2. Instead, transfer the sample to a green top lithium heparin tube before loading into the rotor.


If I inadvertently run an outdated rotor, do I risk inaccurate results?
The analyzer checks the rotor and cancels the run if the rotor is outdated. This makes it essential to set your VS2 to the correct date and time.


What is the shelf life of rotors?
"Rotor shelf life depends on the type of rotor, but averages approximately 9 to 18 months from the date of manufacture. See the package label to determine the rotor expiration date. To ensure optimal performance through the expiration date, the rotors must be refrigerated at 2-8° C (36-46° F), and used one at a time directly from the refrigerator.
Note: Do not store rotors in the freezer or along side of a freezer component within a refrigerator. This freezes the diluent pack, which prevents it from running properly in the instrument."


If a rotor was exposed to heat do I risk unreliable results as with other systems? Or if it's run too cold?
Always store rotors in the appropriate conditions to help ensure accurate results. Rotors may tolerate brief exposure to heat or cold, but excessive exposure to extreme temperatures suppresses reporting of some results, since the VS2's extensive built-in iQC mechanisms protect against reporting results for potentially compromised analytes.


Do rotors require warm-up before use?
No. In fact, you should use rotors directly from the refrigerator.


Does hemolysis, lipemia, or icterus affect the results on the VetScan VS2?
Endogenous substances such as hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus affect all blood chemistries, regardless of the type, size, or cost of the analysis instrument. The VetScan VS2 is the only point-of-care analyzer that assesses and suppresses hemolysis, lipemia, and icterus by determining assay-by-assay the level at which these substances could affect the reliability of the results, and bringing this to the user's attention.


What do the tilde (~ ~ ~) symbols in the results mean?
"These symbols mean that the VS2's iQC algorithm is functioning correctly and results for that particular chemistry analysis were suppressed. If the VS2 cannot assure reliable results because of sample quality, endogenous substances, or immeasurable analysis, the analyzer suppresses the results rather than simply report unreliable numbers.
"


What happens if I run a rotor under the wrong species?
The analyzer is specifically calibrated for different species. If a rotor is run under the wrong species bank, the results will be unusable, and the rotor must be run again under the correct species.


Can the VS2 results be transmitted to my lab management software?
Most lab management software is compatible with Abaxis equipment. Check with your software company to be certain.


Can I back up the results on my VS2?
No, but you can print out reference ranges and results, or transfer them for storage in your lab management software.


Can patients other than equine, large animal, or avian use the Equine, Large Animal and Avian profiles?
No. Profiles and reference ranges are designed for the specific species indicated on the package label. Running samples of other species can provide inaccurate results because some analytes are species-specific. See the rotor package insert for more information.

ABAX. The company manufactures portable Medical (human) and Veterinary (animal) blood analysis systems that provide clinicians with rapid blood constituent measurements in medical and veterinarian markets worldwide. Abaxis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past one month, Abaxishas been trading above the Zacks categorized Medical - Products industry. Per the last trading price, the company has gained 8.8%, compared to the 4.6% gain of the broader industry.We are encouraged to note that Abaxis has been working on expanding its portfolio of rapid test menu over the recent past. Earlier, the company signed a partnership with the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) to develop a wellness testing initiative to improve veterinary blood work compliance and implementing preventive care. We believe successful expansion of the product portfolio will boost the top line and help foray into new regions. We also expect the distribution relationship with Henry Schein Animal Health, Patterson Veterinary Supply and Abbott Point of Care to expand its market presence in North America as well as Europe.Also, the company is successfully selling Piccolo instruments globally. To date, Abaxis’ Piccolo is the only point-of-care technology that can deliver comprehensive diagnostic grade chemistry results within the 15-minute visit window that retailers target. During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the company sold 200 Piccolo Xpress instruments to Fuzhou Kelian Medical Devices, Ltd., a point-of-care diagnostics distributor based in China. Under the distribution agreement with Abbott , the company continues to sell and distribute Piccolo instruments to Catapult Health LLC and specified customer segments in the U.S. The company’s consistent efforts to capture a lion’s share of the diagnostic test global market are encouraging.On the flip side, over the last three months, a comparative analysis of Abaxis’ forward P/E (F12M basis) multiple reflects a gloomy picture that might be a cause for investor concern. Abbott currently trades at a P/E ratio of 41.40, overvalued when compared with 21.35 of the Zacks-categorized Medical Product industry. In fact, comparing the company’s current P/E level with its own range (median of 38.1) depicts that the stock is a little overvalued. Also, currency headwinds and a competitive landscape are major dampeners.Key PicksA few top-ranked medical stocks are Align Technology, Inc. ALGN, Inogen, Inc. INGN and Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc. AXDX. Notably, Inogen sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Align Technology and Accelerate Diagnostics carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Align Technology has an expected long-term adjusted earnings growth of almost 24.1%. The stock added roughly 30.4% over the last three months.Inogen has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 17.5%. The stock gained around 21.9% over the last three months.Accelerate Diagnostics has an expected long-term adjusted earnings growth of 30%. The stock added roughly 12.9% over the last three months.5 Trades Could Profit "Big-League" from Trump Policies Read MoreIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

Abaxis (ABAX) Product Portfolio Strong, Competition Rife

By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

 On Jun 28, we issued an updated research report on California-based  Abaxis, Inc. ABAX  . The company manufactures portable Medical (human) and Veterinary (animal) blood analysis systems that provide clinicians with rapid blood constituent measurements in medical and veterinarian markets worldwide. Abaxis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Over the past one month, Abaxishas been trading above the Zacks categorized Medical - Products  industry. Per the last trading price, the company has gained 8.8%, compared to the 4.6% gain of the broader industry. We are encouraged to note that Abaxis has been working on expanding its portfolio of rapid test menu over the recent past. Earlier, the company signed a partnership with the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) to develop a wellness testing initiative to improve veterinary blood work compliance and implementing preventive care. We believe successful expansion of the product portfolio will boost the top line and help foray into new regions. We also expect the distribution relationship with Henry Schein Animal Health, Patterson Veterinary Supply and Abbott Point of Care to expand its market presence in North America as well as Europe.    Also, the company is successfully selling Piccolo instruments globally. To date, Abaxis' Piccolo is the only point-of-care technology that can deliver comprehensive diagnostic grade chemistry results within the 15-minute visit window that retailers target. During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the company sold 200 Piccolo Xpress instruments to Fuzhou Kelian Medical Devices, Ltd., a point-of-care diagnostics distributor based in China. Under the distribution agreement with Abbott , the company continues to sell and distribute Piccolo instruments to Catapult Health LLC and specified customer segments in the U.S. The company's consistent efforts to capture a lion's share of the diagnostic test global market are encouraging. On the flip side, over the last three months, a comparative analysis of Abaxis' forward P/E (F12M basis) multiple reflects a gloomy picture that might be a cause for investor concern. Abbott currently trades at a P/E ratio of 41.40, overvalued when compared with 21.35 of the Zacks-categorized Medical Product industry. In fact, comparing the company's current P/E level with its own range (median of 38.1) depicts that the stock is a little overvalued. Also, currency headwinds and a competitive landscape are major dampeners.  Key Picks  A few top-ranked medical stocks are Align Technology, Inc. ALGN  , Inogen, Inc. INGN  and Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc. AXDX  . Notably, Inogen sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Align Technology and Accelerate Diagnostics carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see   the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here.   Align Technology has an expected long-term adjusted earnings growth of almost 24.1%. The stock added roughly 30.4% over the last three months. Inogen has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 17.5%. The stock gained around 21.9% over the last three months. Accelerate Diagnostics has an expected long-term adjusted earnings growth of 30%. The stock added roughly 12.9% over the last three months.  5 Trades Could Profit "Big-League" from Trump   Policies  If the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course. Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.
