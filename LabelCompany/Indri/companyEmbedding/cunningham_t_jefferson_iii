M&T Bank Corporation and Premier National Bancorp, Inc. Complete Merger


M&T Bank Corporation and Premier National Bancorp, Inc. Complete Merger
BUFFALO, N.Y. - Feb. 10, 2001--M&T Bank
Corporation (NYSE: MTB) today announced the completion of its
acquisition of Premier National Bancorp, Inc. (AMEX:PNB),
and the merger of Premier's banking subsidiary, Premier National Bank,
into Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company (``M&T Bank''), M&T's
principal commercial bank subsidiary.
All 34 former Premier banking offices are reopening beginning
today as offices of M&T Bank. As a result of the acquisition, M&T has
the leading share of deposits in the mid-Hudson Valley and will
maintain more than 50 banking offices in the region. M&T now has more
than 470 branches in New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland and West
Virginia, and has combined assets of approximately $30 billion.
Former Premier chairman and chief executive officer T. Jefferson
Cunningham, III becomes a director of M&T and M&T Bank, and chairman
of M&T Bank's Hudson Valley Advisory Board. ``With this strategic
merger, Premier has joined forces with a bank long-known for its
commitment to customer service and for its dedication to the
communities it serves. M&T has the unique ability to bring our
customers the financial product and service capabilities of a larger
institution while maintaining the local expertise, experience and
decision-making ability of a community bank,'' Cunningham said.
Robert G. Wilmers, chairman, president and chief executive officer
of M&T and chairman and chief executive officer of M&T Bank, said,
``Our merger with Premier gives M&T the top market share in the
mid-Hudson Valley - and will significantly strengthen our presence in
and commitment to the region. The merger also enhances our leading
position in Upstate New York, where M&T has succeeded by developing an
in-depth understanding of its markets and its customers.''
M&T acquired Premier for $21.00 per share in a transaction valued
at $340 million. 50% of the Premier shares outstanding on the date of
the merger agreement were exchanged for M&T common stock at an
exchange rate of 0.3091 of an M&T share for each Premier common share
exchanged and the remainder were exchanged for $21.00 in cash. The
merger was structured as a tax-free exchange for shareholders to the
extent they received stock, and was accounted for as a purchase
transaction.
The actual proration and allocation of stock and cash paid to
shareholders will be announced in a press release to be issued after
the proration has been calculated.
M&T is also the parent company of M&T Bank, N.A. (Oakfield, New
York).
