Benefits

                        Each Atmosphere Collection™ candle is masterfully crafted with multi-layered notes to create a rich fragrance experience.  Encased in elegant glass, the candles are crafted of a blend of soy and paraffin waxes with a 30-hour* burn time. 
                    


Directions

Always trim wick to 1/4 inch before use.  Keep matches and foreign objects away from lit candle.  Place candle on a flat, heat-resistant surface away from drafts.  Keep lit candles away from anything that can catch fire.  Do not move lit candle. Wait until wax hardens to move a candle.  Stop using your Glade® Jar Candle, Glade® 2in1 Candle, Crafted Soy Candle, and Large Candle when 1/4 inch of wax remains. 



Safety

To prevent fire, burn within sight.  Never burn on or near anything that can catch fire.  Keep out of reach of children and pets.  Do not use if glass is chipped or cracked.  Trim wick to 1/4 inch before each lighting.  Keep candle free of matches and all material.  Do not burn on cold, wet or unstable surface.  Burn away from drafts.  Never touch or move while lit, or until wax hardens.  Never burn more than four hours.  Stop use when 1/4 inch of wax remains.  Do not extinguish with water.  Do not reuse. Discard after use.

Benefits

                        Each Atmosphere Collection™ candle is masterfully crafted with multi-layered notes to create a rich fragrance experience.  Encased in elegant glass, the candles are crafted of a blend of soy and paraffin waxes with a 30-hour* burn time. 
                    


Directions

Always trim wick to 1/4 inch before use.  Keep matches and foreign objects away from lit candle.  Place candle on a flat, heat-resistant surface away from drafts.  Keep lit candles away from anything that can catch fire.  Do not move lit candle. Wait until wax hardens to move a candle.  Stop using your Glade® Jar Candle, Glade® 2in1 Candle, Crafted Soy Candle, and Large Candle when 1/4 inch of wax remains. 



Safety

To prevent fire, burn within sight.  Never burn on or near anything that can catch fire.  Keep out of reach of children and pets.  Do not use if glass is chipped or cracked.  Trim wick to 1/4 inch before each lighting.  Keep candle free of matches and all material.  Do not burn on cold, wet or unstable surface.  Burn away from drafts.  Never touch or move while lit, or until wax hardens.  Never burn more than four hours.  Stop use when 1/4 inch of wax remains.  Do not extinguish with water.  Do not reuse. Discard after use.
