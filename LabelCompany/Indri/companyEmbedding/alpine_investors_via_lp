Alpine Investors V SBIC, LP Acquires ARCOM




 
PRESS RELEASE – Read it on BusinessWire
SALT LAKE CITY, Oct. 5, 2016 — Alpine Investors V SBIC, LP (Alpine), announced today that it has purchased Salt Lake City-based ARCOM, a leader in AEC software solutions that integrate building specification content.
ARCOM is a strategic partner to the American Institute of Architects (AIA) and maintains and distributes the organization’s AIA MasterSpec content, which is used by 88 percent of the top architectural and engineering firms in the United States.
“The U.S. non-residential construction market, which is just now starting to reap the tremendous benefits brought by technology, is forecast to grow for the next decade,” said Mark Strauch, a partner at Alpine and now a board member at ARCOM. “Our market research quickly identified ARCOM as a well-respected leader in delivering productivity-enhancing software solutions to provide the rich specification content needed by architects, engineers, designers and specification professionals. This combination of untapped market opportunity and the company’s established leadership was very attractive to us.”
Christopher Bushnell, AIA, who had served as ARCOM’s President and CEO for 10 years, will retire at the end of the year. Jim Contardi, a CEO-in-residence at Alpine, has assumed the role as CEO at ARCOM.
“I am thrilled to join the industry leaders at ARCOM to lead us into the next chapter,” said Contardi. “This talented team has built a strong foundation for growth and together, with Alpine’s support, we will scale ARCOM to provide the next level of innovative solutions to the architectural, engineering and construction (AEC) market. This is just the first step into an exciting future.”
“ARCOM has a long history of providing leadership in the architecture and building design industry through delivery of MasterSpec, a product created by AIA for its members,” said AIA Executive Vice President / CEO, Robert Ivy, FAIA. “We are very confident in the new ownership of ARCOM and its new CEO, Jim Contardi, and our mutual investment in the future of MasterSpec.”

Alpine Investors VI Closes at $532 Million Hard Cap






June 16, 2017 11:07 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Alpine Investors (“Alpine”), a San Francisco based private equity firm 
      specializing in high growth, founder-owned, lower middle market 
      companies in software and business services, announced the final closing 
      of its sixth fund, Alpine Investors VI, LP, (“Alpine VI” or the “Fund”) 
      at its hard cap of $532 million of capital commitments.
    


      Alpine VI officially launched at year end and was quickly 
      oversubscribed. The Fund has significantly expanded its investor base 
      garnering demand from leading endowments, family offices, foundations, 
      gatekeepers and pension plans.
    

      “We are thrilled to have built such a wonderful base of high-caliber and 
      like-minded investors,” commented Graham Weaver, Managing Partner of 
      Alpine. “We are excited to continue our strategy of delivering 
      outstanding returns to our limited partners and building long-term 
      relationships with our CEOs and management teams over multiple funds.”
    

      “Alpine’s CEO-in-Residence strategy allows the firm to buy high quality 
      businesses in need of institutional management, where competition is 
      relatively scarce. This approach clearly resonated with investors,” said 
      Jennifer Cho Rinehart, CEO of Acalyx Advisors, which served as exclusive 
      placement advisor.
    

      Hogan Lovells served as legal counsel to Alpine.

Press release issued by Alpine Investors in respect of Alpine Investors VI


 



Alpine Investors VI Closes At $532 Million Hard Cap
June 15, 2017 – Alpine Investors (“Alpine”), a San Francisco based private equity firm specializing in high growth, founder‐owned, lower middle market companies in software and business services, announced the final closing of its sixth fund, Alpine Investors VI, LP, (“Alpine VI” or the “Fund”) at its hard cap of $532 million of capital commitments.
Alpine VI officially launched at year end and was quickly oversubscribed. The Fund has significantly expanded its investor base garnering demand from leading endowments, family offices, foundations, gatekeepers and pension plans.
“We are thrilled to have built such a wonderful base of high‐caliber and like‐minded investors,” commented Graham Weaver, Managing Partner of Alpine. “We are excited to continue our strategy of delivering outstanding returns to our limited partners and building long‐term relationships with our CEOs and management teams over multiple funds.”
“Alpine’s CEO‐in‐Residence strategy allows the firm to buy high quality businesses in need of institutional management, where competition is relatively scarce. This approach clearly resonated with investors,” said Jennifer Cho Rinehart, CEO of Acalyx Advisors, which served as exclusive placement advisor.
Hogan Lovells served as legal counsel to Alpine.
