Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Headquartered in Dallas, Texas, ALON USA Energy, Inc. was an independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products, operating primarily in the western and south-central regions of the United States.
With a refining capacity of nearly 217,000 barrels per day, Alon owned and operated heavy crude oil refineries in Big Spring, Texas, and Paramount, Long Beach and Bakersfield, California (collectively known as the California refineries), as well as a light crude oil refinery in Krotz Springs, Louisiana.
Alon was a leading marketer of asphalt, which it distributes primarily through asphalt terminals located predominately in the southwestern and western United States.
ALON Brands, Inc., the retail and branded marketing subsidiary of Alon USA, marketed and supplied ALON motor fuels to independent and company-owned retail locations. ALON Brands was the largest licensee of 7-Eleven in the U.S., operating more than 300 convenience stores in Texas and New Mexico.
In July 2017, Delek US Holdings purchased Alon USA in an all-stock transaction.

Expansion[edit]
Alon U.S.A. announced it would buy Paramount Petroleum Corp. for $307 million cash, and assume $100 million in debt. The deal closed in August 2006.
Alon U.S.A. also plans to buy the assets of Edgington Oil Co. for $52 million cash, a deal delayed in closing due to an FTC request for further information.
Among Paramount's assets are a 54,000 barrels per day (8,600 m3/d) refinery in Paramount, California, and seven asphalt terminals. Edgington is a topping refinery located in Long Beach, California with a listed capacity of about 40,000 barrels per day (6,400 m3/d).
In July 2006 Alon USA closed on the transaction to purchase 40 convenience stores from Good Time Stores.
In March 2007 Alon USA announced that it would purchase Abilene Based Skinny's convenience stores for 70 million dollars.
In May 2008 Valero announced they had sold the 85,000 BPD Krotz Springs, Louisiana refinery to Alon USA for $433 million.
On June 2, 2010 Alon announced that it has completed the acquisition of the Bakersfield, California refinery from Big West of California, LLC, a subsidiary of Flying J Inc. The purchase price of the Bakersfield transaction, including substantially all of the assets of Big West, consists of $40 million in cash. The Company also acquired the Bakersfield refinery's existing inventory as of the closing date of the transaction. The Bakersfield refinery is located in California's Central Valley and has the capacity to refine up to 70,000 barrels per day of crude oil. The refinery is supplied by crude oil produced in the San Joaquin Valley with its products marketed in California, and is a major provider of motor fuels in central California.
Merger with Delek US[edit]
On July 1, 2017, Delek US Holdings Inc., Brentwood, Tenn., completed its purchase of Alon Israel Oil Co. Ltd.’s US-based refining and marketing subsidiary Alon USA Energy Inc.[3]As part of the all-stock transaction, Delek acquired the remaining 53% of Alon USA’s common stock not already owned by Delek. The combined company will be led primarily by Delek US’ existing management team.
Refinery explosion[edit]
On February 18, 2008, an explosion occurred at an oil refinery in Big Spring, Texas owned by Alon USA. The plant employs about 170 employees and has a capacity of 70,000 barrels (11,000 m3) of oil a day. This event has caused portions of Interstate 20 to be shut down. Initial reports state that four workers were injured.[4] In addition to the four workers, a passing motorist on Interstate 20 sustained an injury when debris struck her vehicle, according to local reports.[5] According to a press release by the company on February 19, the explosion occurred in the area around the propylene splitter unit, although the cause has not yet been determined.[6] Information on the company's website states that ALON USA acquired ownership of the Big Spring, Texas refinery in August 2000, when ALON Israel Oil Company Ltd. purchased the U.S. fuels marketing and refining assets of Atofina Petrochemicals, Inc. (FINA). The refinery has been in service for more than 75 years, and produces fuel products and asphalt for the southwestern United States. It was constructed in 1928 by the original owner, Joshua Cosden.

Headquartered in Dallas, Texas, ALON USA Energy, Inc. was an independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products, operating primarily in the western and south-central regions of the United States.
With a refining capacity of nearly 217,000 barrels per day, Alon owned and operated heavy crude oil refineries in Big Spring, Texas, and Paramount, Long Beach and Bakersfield, California (collectively known as the California refineries), as well as a light crude oil refinery in Krotz Springs, Louisiana.
Alon was a leading marketer of asphalt, which it distributes primarily through asphalt terminals located predominately in the southwestern and western United States.
ALON Brands, Inc., the retail and branded marketing subsidiary of Alon USA, marketed and supplied ALON motor fuels to independent and company-owned retail locations. ALON Brands was the largest licensee of 7-Eleven in the U.S., operating more than 300 convenience stores in Texas and New Mexico.
In July 2017, Delek US Holdings purchased Alon USA in an all-stock transaction.

Expansion[edit]
Alon U.S.A. announced it would buy Paramount Petroleum Corp. for $307 million cash, and assume $100 million in debt. The deal closed in August 2006.
Alon U.S.A. also plans to buy the assets of Edgington Oil Co. for $52 million cash, a deal delayed in closing due to an FTC request for further information.
Among Paramount's assets are a 54,000 barrels per day (8,600 m3/d) refinery in Paramount, California, and seven asphalt terminals. Edgington is a topping refinery located in Long Beach, California with a listed capacity of about 40,000 barrels per day (6,400 m3/d).
In July 2006 Alon USA closed on the transaction to purchase 40 convenience stores from Good Time Stores.
In March 2007 Alon USA announced that it would purchase Abilene Based Skinny's convenience stores for 70 million dollars.
In May 2008 Valero announced they had sold the 85,000 BPD Krotz Springs, Louisiana refinery to Alon USA for $433 million.
On June 2, 2010 Alon announced that it has completed the acquisition of the Bakersfield, California refinery from Big West of California, LLC, a subsidiary of Flying J Inc. The purchase price of the Bakersfield transaction, including substantially all of the assets of Big West, consists of $40 million in cash. The Company also acquired the Bakersfield refinery's existing inventory as of the closing date of the transaction. The Bakersfield refinery is located in California's Central Valley and has the capacity to refine up to 70,000 barrels per day of crude oil. The refinery is supplied by crude oil produced in the San Joaquin Valley with its products marketed in California, and is a major provider of motor fuels in central California.
Merger with Delek US[edit]
On July 1, 2017, Delek US Holdings Inc., Brentwood, Tenn., completed its purchase of Alon Israel Oil Co. Ltd.’s US-based refining and marketing subsidiary Alon USA Energy Inc.[3]As part of the all-stock transaction, Delek acquired the remaining 53% of Alon USA’s common stock not already owned by Delek. The combined company will be led primarily by Delek US’ existing management team.
Refinery explosion[edit]
On February 18, 2008, an explosion occurred at an oil refinery in Big Spring, Texas owned by Alon USA. The plant employs about 170 employees and has a capacity of 70,000 barrels (11,000 m3) of oil a day. This event has caused portions of Interstate 20 to be shut down. Initial reports state that four workers were injured.[4] In addition to the four workers, a passing motorist on Interstate 20 sustained an injury when debris struck her vehicle, according to local reports.[5] According to a press release by the company on February 19, the explosion occurred in the area around the propylene splitter unit, although the cause has not yet been determined.[6] Information on the company's website states that ALON USA acquired ownership of the Big Spring, Texas refinery in August 2000, when ALON Israel Oil Company Ltd. purchased the U.S. fuels marketing and refining assets of Atofina Petrochemicals, Inc. (FINA). The refinery has been in service for more than 75 years, and produces fuel products and asphalt for the southwestern United States. It was constructed in 1928 by the original owner, Joshua Cosden.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
