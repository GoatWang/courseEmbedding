Customer Agreement




 In order to finish processing, please submit a physical copy of this signed customer agreement along with your payment.


	This Customer Agreement (this "Agreement") is made and entered into by and between Rosland Capital LLC, a Delaware limited liability company with a principal place of business located at 11766 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1200, Los Angeles, California 90025 ("Rosland Capital"), and the person(s) or entity identified on the signature page hereof ("Customer") for the purchase, sale and delivery of precious metals, coins and other products offered by Rosland Capital (collectively, the "Products"). The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall apply to all transactions between Customer and Rosland Capital. Download PDF
1. Purchases and Payments.
	1.1 Customer may place an order (each, a "Purchase Order") with a Rosland Capital representative (each, a "Rosland Capital Representative") by telephone for the purchase, sale and delivery of Products which shall have the same effect as if the Purchase Order was made in writing. Customer's Purchase Order will be confirmed during a recorded confirmation with a Rosland Capital Representative to ensure the details of the Purchase Order are correct and will include the price, quantity, method of payment and delivery and other material terms of the Purchase Order. Purchase Orders for bullion cannot be accepted prior to Rosland’s receipt of good funds, and after receipt of such funds the final terms of the Purchase Order will be confirmed during a recorded confirmation with a Rosland Capital Representative.

	1.2 Rosland Capital will send Customer a written confirmation of each Purchase Order (the "Confirmation") at the address provided by Customer to Rosland Capital. The amount due under the Purchase Order (the "Purchase Price") shall be due and payable in full to Rosland Capital within ten (10) business days of the recorded Confirmation, in the case of a transaction involving proof, semi-numismatic, numismatic or premium coins, and on or before the date of the recorded Confirmation, in the case of a transaction involving bullion (in either case, the "Payment Period"). Failure to pay the Purchase Price within the Payment Period shall constitute a default by Customer. Upon such default, Rosland Capital will be relieved of all its obligations under the Purchase Order and may recover from Customer the difference between the Purchase Price agreed to by Customer for the Products and Rosland Capital's actual resale price for the Products at the time of default, up to four percent (4%) of the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of 1.1 and 1.2, purchases made on-line at www.RoslandCapital.com shall be subject to the payment provisions set forth on-line by Rosland Capital from time to time.
	1.3 Customer agrees to pay the Purchase Price by personal check, credit card or bank wire (except that any payments for bullion shall be made by check or bank wire only). The Purchase Price specified in a Purchase Order shall include, without limitation, all shipping, handling, storage, delivery, taxes, assessments and other fees imposed on transactions involving the Products. All amounts stated in a Purchase Order are in U.S. Dollars and all payments made by Customer to Rosland Capital under a Purchase Order shall be made in the U.S. and in U.S. Dollars.
2. Delivery. Rosland Capital shall ship the Products to Customer, or Customer’s appointed agent or designee, in accordance with the terms of the applicable Purchase Order, within fourteen (14) business days (or such lesser period as required by law) of Rosland Capital’s actual receipt of the full Purchase Price from Customer. Title to the Products purchased by Customer and risk of loss thereto shall pass to Customer upon Customer’s, or Customer’s appointed agent's or designee's, actual receipt of the Products. Customer shall be responsible for all shipping and handling charges incurred in connection with the delivery of the Products and Customer acknowledges that shipping and handling charges will vary depending on the weight, value, destination and method of shipment of the Products.
  
3. Buy-Back Policy and Customer Service. If in the future you decide that you would like to sell any precious metal or coin products purchased from Rosland Capital, as a service to our customers, Rosland Capital will provide you the opportunity to sell such products back to us at the current market value determined by Rosland Capital for such products on the day the sale to us is completed. You are, of course, free to sell to others, but we believe that you may receive a higher net price by selling to Rosland Capital because we are familiar with the products we have sold you, and do not charge any additional fees or commissions when making such purchases. Due to market conditions and other factors, you may receive less than what you originally paid. Rosland Capital will make payment for any purchased Product within sixty (60) days of the date of receipt of the Products from Customer.Our buy-back policy is a voluntary service to our customers and is subject to withdrawal or change without notice. We may also purchase products not originally sold by Rosland Capital; however, such purchases are subject to additional fees and/or commissions at current market rates.Rosland Capital maintains a dedicated customer service department that handles all customer services, including liquidation requests, refund requests and complaints. Rosland Capital’s Chief Compliance Officer can be reached by phone at (800) 967-5151 or by email at services@RoslandCapital.com.
 
4. Refunds and Returns. Rosland Capital provides Customer the right to receive a full refund of the Purchase Price for the return of undamaged and unused Products; provided, however, that Rosland Capital receives written notice of Customer's intention to return the Products within seven (7) days after the date that Customer receives the Products, and provided, further, that such Products are returned to Rosland Capital within ten (10) business days following receipt by Rosland Capital of notice of cancellation from Customer. Customer’s “receipt” of the Products is deemed to occur at the earliest of: (a) the date that Customer receives actual possession of the Products or (b) the date that Customer receives written confirmation from Rosland Capital that the Products have been deposited on Customer’s behalf in an independent depository. Rosland Capital shall, upon written notice of cancellation and receipt of the Products in the same condition as delivered, issue a full refund of the Purchase Price to Customer within thirty (30) days of the date of Rosland Capital's receipt of the returned Products from Customer.
 
5. Classifications. Rosland Capital's classification of a particular Product as bullion, numismatic, semi-numismatic or premium expresses Rosland Capital's opinion and other precious metal dealers or investors may classify the same Product differently. The classification of a particular Product depends on a number of objective and subjective factors and any classification may change over time. Rosland Capital's spread and prices are based on Rosland Capital's classification determinations. Bullion may be in bar or coin form, and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content. Its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal, which is its current market price. Numismatic coins (including proof coins) are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand, scarcity, dates, condition and grades, and less so on precious metal content. Semi-numismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain, as well as other factors such as supply and demand. Premium coins include numismatic and semi-numismatic coins, as well as proof coins and Exclusive Specialty coins of limited mintage, whose value derives from their quality and limited supply, as well as their precious metal content. Exclusive Specialty coins are typically of high quality, limited mintage, high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source; Rosland Capital determines which products are designated Exclusive Specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors. Precious metals that have lower precious metal content, which may include some numismatics, will have a lower “melt value”, which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price. For example, if the spot price of gold is $1,000 per ounce, a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of $1,000.6. Spread. The difference between the Purchase Price Customer pays for Products under a Purchase Order and the price that Rosland Capital actually pays for the Products purchased by Customer under such Purchase Order is known as the "spread" and it is stated as a percentage of the Purchase Price paid by the Customer.  Spreads charged to Customer under a particular transaction may differ significantly from spreads charged to other customers in similar transactions or spreads charged to Customer in other transactions. The spread on Rosland Capital's premium, semi-numismatic and numismatic coins typically ranges between 17% and 33%. The spread on Rosland Capital's bullion typically ranges between 4% and 21%. (For example, if Rosland Capital’s quoted price for a numismatic coin was $300 and included a 20% spread, Rosland Capital’s cost for that coin would be $240. If Rosland Capital’s quoted price for a bullion coin was $300 and included a 5% spread, Rosland Capital’s cost for that coin would be $285.) The spread on Rosland Capital's IRA (as defined below) transactions typically ranges between 17% and 25%. The foregoing spreads are approximations and the spreads at any time and for any given transaction may be significantly different. Exclusive Specialty coins designated by Rosland Capital are only sold by Rosland Capital from sources and based on designs exclusive to Rosland Capital at prices set by Rosland Capital based on their quality, limited mintage, precious metal content and branded or unique source, without any reference to any “spread,” which does not apply to this classification of coins.
 7. Pricing. The prices quoted by Rosland Capital for the Products are established by Rosland Capital upon its analysis of each item and may change many times during the day. The prices quoted by Rosland Capital for the Products are not tied to prices quoted by any other organization and there are no established daily limits on the amount those prices may change. Rosland Capital reserves the right to increase or decrease its prices at its sole discretion at any time. Customer is encouraged to compare Rosland Capital’s prices with those offered by other dealers. 
 8. Taxes. Tax consequences of transactions with Rosland Capital are the sole responsibility of Customer. Customer shall pay to Rosland Capital any sales, use or other tax applicable to transactions involving the Products.
 9. Security. Customer hereby grants Rosland Capital a lien and security interest in the Products in Rosland Capital's possession or control that Customer orders pursuant to a Purchase Order as collateral for any amounts owed by Customer to Rosland Capital under this Agreement, any Purchase Order or otherwise. Customer agrees to execute such additional documents as may be necessary to perfect or evidence this security interest.
 
10. Electronic Recordation. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Rosland Capital may choose, in its sole discretion, to monitor or record Customer's telephone conversations with any Rosland Capital Representative. Unless otherwise specifically agreed to by Rosland Capital in writing, Rosland Capital does not consent to the recording of telephone conversations with any Rosland Capital Representative by Customer or any third party. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital will not record all telephone conversations and that Rosland Capital does not guarantee that any recordings of any particular telephone conversation will be retained or are capable of being retrieved.
  
11. Customer Representations. Customer hereby represents to Rosland Capital that (i) Customer is of legal age and capacity and has the requisite powers, authority, and rights necessary to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations under this Agreement; (ii) Customer is not a party, and will not become a party, to any agree­ment, obligation, or understanding that is inconsistent with this Agreement or mightlimit or impair Customer's performance of its obligations under this Agreement; (iii) Customer is an experienced investor who understands the risks and obligations involved under this Agreement; and (iv) Customer's transactions under this Agreement shall be for investment or other commercial purposes and not for any personal, family, household or other consumer purposes.
 
12. Acknowledgements.12.1 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital is a dealer in precious metals, coins and other related products. Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital is not an exchange or brokerage house or a financial or investment advisor and that neither Rosland Capital nor any Rosland Capital Representative acts as an agent or fiduciary for any of Rosland Capital's Customers.12.2 Customer acknowledges that purchases of the Products involve substantial risks. Market prices are volatile and unpredictable and may be affected by a variety of factors, including, without limitation, general economic conditions, political events, mon­etary policies of various countries, and fluctuations in production and demand. It is impossible to forecast accurately how or to what degree the foregoing or other factors will affect market prices. What is suitable for one customer with a given financial means may not be suitable for other customers with the same financial means.12.3 Customer acknowledges that purchases of the Products are speculative and volatile, and prices may rise and fall over time. Customer acknowledges that profit can only be made if prices for the Products rise in an amount over the Purchase Price paid by Customer for the Products and that Customer may still incur a loss despite favorable price movements.12.4 Customer acknowledges that Customer is financially and emotionally able to enter into transactions which are contemplated by this Agreement and is sensitive to and able to accept the risks and to meet the financial commitments being made under this Agreement.  12.5 Customer acknowledges that grades and descriptions of Products are opinions and not statements of fact, and are based on standards and interpretations that change over time. Rosland Capital uses contemporary grading standards and inter­pretations to grade its Products or relies upon the opinions of third party grading services such as Numismatic Guaranty Corporation and Professional Coin Grading Service. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital does not guarantee that its Products will achieve the same grades from any third party grading service in the future.12.6 Customer acknowledges that Customer is responsible for all purchases made on Customer's account. If Customer believes that a Purchase Order has been entered into for Customer's account without Customer's authorization, Customer shall immedi­ately notify Rosland Capital's Compliance Department at: compliance@RoslandCapital.com. Similarly, if Customer believes that any Rosland Capital Representative has made a verbal or written representation that is inconsistent with the terms or risks set forth herein or is unprofessional or offensive in nature, Customer will notify Rosland Capital's Compliance Department immediately. Customer further acknowledges that if Customer fails to make the required notification within ten (10) business days following the date on which the event first became known to Customer, Customer waives all rights to contest such mat­ter.12.7 Rosland Capital Representatives may from time to time discuss the general direction of various financial markets. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital Representatives cannot guarantee any market movement. Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital Representatives are not licensed as investment advisors and are not making any specific recommendations concerning any forms of investment. Rosland Capital and the Rosland Capital Representatives are not agents for Customer, have different financial interests and incentives from Customer and owe no fiduciary duty to Customer. Rosland Capital Representatives are commissioned salespersons whose commissions are greatest on numismatic, semi-numismatic and premium items and least on bullion. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital believes precious metals and coins are appropriate for 5% to 20% of a portfolio, although certain individuals or organizations might recommend a different percentage. Customer agrees to independently determine what percentage is appropriate for Customer based upon Customer’s individual circumstance. 12.8 Customer acknowledges that Customer has conducted and will conduct Customer's own research and analysis regarding the Products that Customer may purchase from Rosland Capital and Customer will not rely upon any statements made by a Rosland Capital Representative concerning the future value of the Products that Customer may purchase from Rosland Capital. Rosland Capital does not provide investment or financial advice. Customer acknowledges that precious metals and coins do not earn interest or current income.12.9 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital’s policy with respect to the 1930’s gold recall by the Government is as follows: “In 1933, the U.S. Government, by Executive Order, prohibited the private ownership of certain quantities of gold bars and coins.  There were several exceptions to this ban, including allowing people to own “gold coins having a recognized special value to collectors of rare and unusual coins.”  At the time the United States was on the gold standard.  Since 1971 the United States has not been on the gold standard.  The Executive Order prohibiting private ownership was repealed in 1974.  Currently, there are no restrictions on gold ownership, and the ability of the U.S. Government to recall gold is limited to times of war and requires action by the President or Congress.  No one can say with certainty if or how the U.S. Government might prohibit ownership of gold in the future, or whether any particular gold product might be exempt from any future prohibitions.”12.10 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital’s policy with respect to the reportability of precious metals is as follows: “Many of our customers are concerned about personal privacy or disclosing that they own precious metals.  Accordingly, they often choose to purchase precious metals that do not require disclosure of personal information such as name, address and social security number when they sell such precious metals. Currently, certain bullion, semi-numismatic and numismatic coins do not require disclosure of such personal information when a customer sells them.”12.11 Customer acknowledges that Customer has read Rosland Capital’s brochure, which provides additional information about the risks of buying and selling precious metals and coins. This brochure is updated period­ically and it is Customer's responsibility to remain up to date by requesting a copy of the most recent version at Rosland Capital's website, www.RoslandCapital.com.12.12 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital may provide information about companies which provide trustee and custodian services for Individual Retirement Accounts ("IRA) as a convenience to its customers.  Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital is independent from and not affiliated with any of the companies which may provide those services. It is Customer's responsibility to independently select the IRA service company suitable for Customer. Rosland Capital shall have no liability or responsibility for any loss or damage resulting from Customer's dealings with any IRA service company.13.

The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall apply to all transactions between Customer and Rosland Capital. Download PDF
1. Purchases and Payments.
	1.1 Customer may place an order (each, a "Purchase Order") with a Rosland Capital representative (each, a "Rosland Capital Representative") by telephone for the purchase, sale and delivery of Products which shall have the same effect as if the Purchase Order was made in writing. Customer's Purchase Order will be confirmed during a recorded confirmation with a Rosland Capital Representative to ensure the details of the Purchase Order are correct and will include the price, quantity, method of payment and delivery and other material terms of the Purchase Order. Purchase Orders for bullion cannot be accepted prior to Rosland’s receipt of good funds, and after receipt of such funds the final terms of the Purchase Order will be confirmed during a recorded confirmation with a Rosland Capital Representative.

	1.2 Rosland Capital will send Customer a written confirmation of each Purchase Order (the "Confirmation") at the address provided by Customer to Rosland Capital. The amount due under the Purchase Order (the "Purchase Price") shall be due and payable in full to Rosland Capital within ten (10) business days of the recorded Confirmation, in the case of a transaction involving proof, semi-numismatic, numismatic or premium coins, and on or before the date of the recorded Confirmation, in the case of a transaction involving bullion (in either case, the "Payment Period"). Failure to pay the Purchase Price within the Payment Period shall constitute a default by Customer. Upon such default, Rosland Capital will be relieved of all its obligations under the Purchase Order and may recover from Customer the difference between the Purchase Price agreed to by Customer for the Products and Rosland Capital's actual resale price for the Products at the time of default, up to four percent (4%) of the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of 1.1 and 1.2, purchases made on-line at www.RoslandCapital.com shall be subject to the payment provisions set forth on-line by Rosland Capital from time to time.
	1.3 Customer agrees to pay the Purchase Price by personal check, credit card or bank wire (except that any payments for bullion shall be made by check or bank wire only). The Purchase Price specified in a Purchase Order shall include, without limitation, all shipping, handling, storage, delivery, taxes, assessments and other fees imposed on transactions involving the Products. All amounts stated in a Purchase Order are in U.S. Dollars and all payments made by Customer to Rosland Capital under a Purchase Order shall be made in the U.S. and in U.S. Dollars.
2. Delivery. Rosland Capital shall ship the Products to Customer, or Customer’s appointed agent or designee, in accordance with the terms of the applicable Purchase Order, within fourteen (14) business days (or such lesser period as required by law) of Rosland Capital’s actual receipt of the full Purchase Price from Customer.

Customer shall be responsible for all shipping and handling charges incurred in connection with the delivery of the Products and Customer acknowledges that shipping and handling charges will vary depending on the weight, value, destination and method of shipment of the Products.
  
3. Buy-Back Policy and Customer Service. If in the future you decide that you would like to sell any precious metal or coin products purchased from Rosland Capital, as a service to our customers, Rosland Capital will provide you the opportunity to sell such products back to us at the current market value determined by Rosland Capital for such products on the day the sale to us is completed. You are, of course, free to sell to others, but we believe that you may receive a higher net price by selling to Rosland Capital because we are familiar with the products we have sold you, and do not charge any additional fees or commissions when making such purchases. Due to market conditions and other factors, you may receive less than what you originally paid. Rosland Capital will make payment for any purchased Product within sixty (60) days of the date of receipt of the Products from Customer.Our buy-back policy is a voluntary service to our customers and is subject to withdrawal or change without notice. We may also purchase products not originally sold by Rosland Capital; however, such purchases are subject to additional fees and/or commissions at current market rates.Rosland Capital maintains a dedicated customer service department that handles all customer services, including liquidation requests, refund requests and complaints. Rosland Capital’s Chief Compliance Officer can be reached by phone at (800) 967-5151 or by email at services@RoslandCapital.com.
 
4. Refunds and Returns. Rosland Capital provides Customer the right to receive a full refund of the Purchase Price for the return of undamaged and unused Products; provided, however, that Rosland Capital receives written notice of Customer's intention to return the Products within seven (7) days after the date that Customer receives the Products, and provided, further, that such Products are returned to Rosland Capital within ten (10) business days following receipt by Rosland Capital of notice of cancellation from Customer. Customer’s “receipt” of the Products is deemed to occur at the earliest of: (a) the date that Customer receives actual possession of the Products or (b) the date that Customer receives written confirmation from Rosland Capital that the Products have been deposited on Customer’s behalf in an independent depository. Rosland Capital shall, upon written notice of cancellation and receipt of the Products in the same condition as delivered, issue a full refund of the Purchase Price to Customer within thirty (30) days of the date of Rosland Capital's receipt of the returned Products from Customer.
 
5. Classifications. Rosland Capital's classification of a particular Product as bullion, numismatic, semi-numismatic or premium expresses Rosland Capital's opinion and other precious metal dealers or investors may classify the same Product differently. The classification of a particular Product depends on a number of objective and subjective factors and any classification may change over time. Rosland Capital's spread and prices are based on Rosland Capital's classification determinations. Bullion may be in bar or coin form, and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content. Its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal, which is its current market price. Numismatic coins (including proof coins) are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand, scarcity, dates, condition and grades, and less so on precious metal content. Semi-numismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain, as well as other factors such as supply and demand. Premium coins include numismatic and semi-numismatic coins, as well as proof coins and Exclusive Specialty coins of limited mintage, whose value derives from their quality and limited supply, as well as their precious metal content. Exclusive Specialty coins are typically of high quality, limited mintage, high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source; Rosland Capital determines which products are designated Exclusive Specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors. Precious metals that have lower precious metal content, which may include some numismatics, will have a lower “melt value”, which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price. For example, if the spot price of gold is $1,000 per ounce, a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of $1,000.6. Spread. The difference between the Purchase Price Customer pays for Products under a Purchase Order and the price that Rosland Capital actually pays for the Products purchased by Customer under such Purchase Order is known as the "spread" and it is stated as a percentage of the Purchase Price paid by the Customer.  Spreads charged to Customer under a particular transaction may differ significantly from spreads charged to other customers in similar transactions or spreads charged to Customer in other transactions. The spread on Rosland Capital's premium, semi-numismatic and numismatic coins typically ranges between 17% and 33%. The spread on Rosland Capital's bullion typically ranges between 4% and 21%. (For example, if Rosland Capital’s quoted price for a numismatic coin was $300 and included a 20% spread, Rosland Capital’s cost for that coin would be $240. If Rosland Capital’s quoted price for a bullion coin was $300 and included a 5% spread, Rosland Capital’s cost for that coin would be $285.) The spread on Rosland Capital's IRA (as defined below) transactions typically ranges between 17% and 25%. The foregoing spreads are approximations and the spreads at any time and for any given transaction may be significantly different. Exclusive Specialty coins designated by Rosland Capital are only sold by Rosland Capital from sources and based on designs exclusive to Rosland Capital at prices set by Rosland Capital based on their quality, limited mintage, precious metal content and branded or unique source, without any reference to any “spread,” which does not apply to this classification of coins.
 7. Pricing. The prices quoted by Rosland Capital for the Products are established by Rosland Capital upon its analysis of each item and may change many times during the day. The prices quoted by Rosland Capital for the Products are not tied to prices quoted by any other organization and there are no established daily limits on the amount those prices may change. Rosland Capital reserves the right to increase or decrease its prices at its sole discretion at any time. Customer is encouraged to compare Rosland Capital’s prices with those offered by other dealers. 
 8. Taxes. Tax consequences of transactions with Rosland Capital are the sole responsibility of Customer. Customer shall pay to Rosland Capital any sales, use or other tax applicable to transactions involving the Products.
 9. Security. Customer hereby grants Rosland Capital a lien and security interest in the Products in Rosland Capital's possession or control that Customer orders pursuant to a Purchase Order as collateral for any amounts owed by Customer to Rosland Capital under this Agreement, any Purchase Order or otherwise. Customer agrees to execute such additional documents as may be necessary to perfect or evidence this security interest.
 
10. Electronic Recordation. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Rosland Capital may choose, in its sole discretion, to monitor or record Customer's telephone conversations with any Rosland Capital Representative. Unless otherwise specifically agreed to by Rosland Capital in writing, Rosland Capital does not consent to the recording of telephone conversations with any Rosland Capital Representative by Customer or any third party. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital will not record all telephone conversations and that Rosland Capital does not guarantee that any recordings of any particular telephone conversation will be retained or are capable of being retrieved.

12. Acknowledgements.12.1 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital is a dealer in precious metals, coins and other related products. Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital is not an exchange or brokerage house or a financial or investment advisor and that neither Rosland Capital nor any Rosland Capital Representative acts as an agent or fiduciary for any of Rosland Capital's Customers.12.2 Customer acknowledges that purchases of the Products involve substantial risks. Market prices are volatile and unpredictable and may be affected by a variety of factors, including, without limitation, general economic conditions, political events, mon­etary policies of various countries, and fluctuations in production and demand. It is impossible to forecast accurately how or to what degree the foregoing or other factors will affect market prices. What is suitable for one customer with a given financial means may not be suitable for other customers with the same financial means.12.3 Customer acknowledges that purchases of the Products are speculative and volatile, and prices may rise and fall over time. Customer acknowledges that profit can only be made if prices for the Products rise in an amount over the Purchase Price paid by Customer for the Products and that Customer may still incur a loss despite favorable price movements.12.4 Customer acknowledges that Customer is financially and emotionally able to enter into transactions which are contemplated by this Agreement and is sensitive to and able to accept the risks and to meet the financial commitments being made under this Agreement.  12.5 Customer acknowledges that grades and descriptions of Products are opinions and not statements of fact, and are based on standards and interpretations that change over time. Rosland Capital uses contemporary grading standards and inter­pretations to grade its Products or relies upon the opinions of third party grading services such as Numismatic Guaranty Corporation and Professional Coin Grading Service. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital does not guarantee that its Products will achieve the same grades from any third party grading service in the future.12.6 Customer acknowledges that Customer is responsible for all purchases made on Customer's account. If Customer believes that a Purchase Order has been entered into for Customer's account without Customer's authorization, Customer shall immedi­ately notify Rosland Capital's Compliance Department at: compliance@RoslandCapital.com. Similarly, if Customer believes that any Rosland Capital Representative has made a verbal or written representation that is inconsistent with the terms or risks set forth herein or is unprofessional or offensive in nature, Customer will notify Rosland Capital's Compliance Department immediately. Customer further acknowledges that if Customer fails to make the required notification within ten (10) business days following the date on which the event first became known to Customer, Customer waives all rights to contest such mat­ter.12.7 Rosland Capital Representatives may from time to time discuss the general direction of various financial markets. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital Representatives cannot guarantee any market movement. Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital Representatives are not licensed as investment advisors and are not making any specific recommendations concerning any forms of investment. Rosland Capital and the Rosland Capital Representatives are not agents for Customer, have different financial interests and incentives from Customer and owe no fiduciary duty to Customer. Rosland Capital Representatives are commissioned salespersons whose commissions are greatest on numismatic, semi-numismatic and premium items and least on bullion. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital believes precious metals and coins are appropriate for 5% to 20% of a portfolio, although certain individuals or organizations might recommend a different percentage. Customer agrees to independently determine what percentage is appropriate for Customer based upon Customer’s individual circumstance. 12.8 Customer acknowledges that Customer has conducted and will conduct Customer's own research and analysis regarding the Products that Customer may purchase from Rosland Capital and Customer will not rely upon any statements made by a Rosland Capital Representative concerning the future value of the Products that Customer may purchase from Rosland Capital. Rosland Capital does not provide investment or financial advice. Customer acknowledges that precious metals and coins do not earn interest or current income.12.9 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital’s policy with respect to the 1930’s gold recall by the Government is as follows: “In 1933, the U.S. Government, by Executive Order, prohibited the private ownership of certain quantities of gold bars and coins.  There were several exceptions to this ban, including allowing people to own “gold coins having a recognized special value to collectors of rare and unusual coins.”  At the time the United States was on the gold standard.  Since 1971 the United States has not been on the gold standard.  The Executive Order prohibiting private ownership was repealed in 1974.  Currently, there are no restrictions on gold ownership, and the ability of the U.S. Government to recall gold is limited to times of war and requires action by the President or Congress.  No one can say with certainty if or how the U.S. Government might prohibit ownership of gold in the future, or whether any particular gold product might be exempt from any future prohibitions.”12.10 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital’s policy with respect to the reportability of precious metals is as follows: “Many of our customers are concerned about personal privacy or disclosing that they own precious metals.  Accordingly, they often choose to purchase precious metals that do not require disclosure of personal information such as name, address and social security number when they sell such precious metals. Currently, certain bullion, semi-numismatic and numismatic coins do not require disclosure of such personal information when a customer sells them.”12.11 Customer acknowledges that Customer has read Rosland Capital’s brochure, which provides additional information about the risks of buying and selling precious metals and coins. This brochure is updated period­ically and it is Customer's responsibility to remain up to date by requesting a copy of the most recent version at Rosland Capital's website, www.RoslandCapital.com.12.12 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital may provide information about companies which provide trustee and custodian services for Individual Retirement Accounts ("IRA) as a convenience to its customers.  Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital is independent from and not affiliated with any of the companies which may provide those services. It is Customer's responsibility to independently select the IRA service company suitable for Customer. Rosland Capital shall have no liability or responsibility for any loss or damage resulting from Customer's dealings with any IRA service company.13.

Add Stability to Your Retirement Mix

					Including gold and other precious metals in your portfolio lowers your risk by diversifying from paper assets,
                        thus hedging against the economy and inflation. Through turbulent times, such as an economic downturn,
					gold and other precious metals retain value and are trusted to strengthen and secure wealth, where paper
                        assets may not.
				

					The IRS regulates and controls the products that can be added to your precious metals-backed IRA. That’s why it’s important to choose an industry authority like
                        Rosland Capital, so you know you are working with professionals and have access to excellent IRA-eligible products.

Is a Gold or Silver IRA Right for You?


						Gold and silver IRAs are becoming more and more common these days. Whether it's because the most recent
                           recession has inspired Americans to seek out more diverse types of retirement funds, or simply because
                           families want more protection for their money, there is a lot of buzz surrounding precious metal-backed
                           retirement accounts today.
					

						Whatever your reason for looking into an IRA backed by precious metals might be, it’s always a good idea
                           to gather as much information as possible so that when the time comes to make a change or an upgrade,
                           you feel comfortable doing so.
					



What are Gold and Silver IRAs?

					When you back an IRA with either gold or silver (or both), you are making the decision to protect your
                       retirement funds against the types of fluctuations in the market that could have disastrous implications
                       on your overall portfolio. A precious metals IRA is a self-directed, government-approved retirement
                       account backed by physical gold, silver or other metals, such as platinum or palladium.

The National Economy and Your IRA






							In many cases, gold and silver can provide a better chance of financial security than other types of IRAs. The answer is pretty simple.
						

							Conventional IRAs are often heavy with stocks and bonds. In previous eras, when the national economy was more robust and stable, this method proved to be successful.
						

							But today these paper assets are becoming too risky for many people, especially after events like the Great Recession, which led to many people's retirement accounts being significantly reduced over a very short period of time.
						

							Backing your IRA with precious metals like gold and silver can provide more protection against these threats by diversifying your portfolio, as well as helping to safeguard your money from inflation, economic fluctuation and unfavorable legislative policies.

Gold and Silver IRAs - How Can They Protect Your Nest Egg?

					Gold and silver IRAs offer a unique alternative to conventional retirement plans by enabling you to add precious metals, including gold coins,
                       silver, platinum and palladium, in addition to more traditional types of investments, such as mutual funds.
				

					These Precious Metals IRAs have become increasingly popular in recent years as more uncertainty grows around the health of the global economy. By adding gold and silver to your retirement account,
                       you can help shield your money from future economic turmoil and have peace of mind about your buying power in retirement.
				

					How exactly can gold and silver IRAs provide this unique level of protection? Let's look at some of their key benefits.
				
Benefits of Gold and Silver IRAs


Diversification

							We can't stress this enough: diversification is crucial to every person's portfolio, especially when it comes to retirement savings. Gold and silver IRAs allow you to hold assets that are rarely
                               found in employer-sponsored 401(k)s and conventional IRAs. This means you can greatly diversify your holdings, rather than keeping all your eggs in one "paper" basket.
						
Protection against the volatile stock market

							When the stock market tumbles, even the so-called "safest" mutual funds and bonds can take a hit, and retirement accounts can suffer greatly. If it happens to you right before retirement
                               (as it did to many during the Great Recession), you could be forced to continue working for many years to come. Diversifying your portfolio with precious metals helps protect your
                               retirement money by shielding it from the volatility associated with stocks and other paper assets.
						


Safeguard against the declining dollar

							Many people who buy gold and silver do so as a hedge against inflation and the declining U.S. dollar. As the dollar loses value, Americans essentially lose wealth and purchasing power.
                               If the value continues to shrink, paper-heavy portfolios could be worth a lot less in retirement. On the other hand, the value of precious metals, like gold, tends to increase as the dollar drops.
                               By placing precious metals in an IRA, you can thus preserve your buying power and safeguard your money from the effects of inflation.
						
Tax benefits

							Keep in mind that a Precious Metals IRA comes with the same tax benefits as a conventional IRA. The biggest difference is that you can maintain those tax benefits while experiencing all the
                               other benefits of purchasing precious metals.
						
Growth Potential

							Aside from the security, many people purchase gold and silver specifically for their growth potential, which isn't affected by the same forces as those in the stock market. As finite resources,
                               gold and silver have inherent value and an ever-increasing global demand.

                           This means that you don’t need to make another initial deposit to get the ball rolling.
					

						What you do need to find is a precious metals professional to work with. Obviously, there’s no shortage of firms advertising their experience, expertise and proven track record. Without any sort
                           of verification or third party certificates, these promises are just words.

                           and commitment to our customers.

How to Get Started


1



							A Rosland Capital representative will explain to you how a Gold and Precious Metals IRA works, so you can decide if the option is right for you.
						


2



							If you decide that an IRA fits your needs, the representative will send you the necessary forms from Equity International,
                               the IRA administrators, together with Rosland Capital's own customer agreement.
						


3



							After you have signed and completed the required forms, your Rosland Capital representative will create an account for you and
                               discuss various options for your IRA, including which coins qualify for inclusion.
						


4



							After Equity receives funding, either directly from you or via transfer of an existing IRA, your Rosland Capital
                               representative arranges for the precious metals to be moved directly to the depository in Delaware, where each
                               IRA-holder's gold is kept in separate, secure storage.
						


5



							You will then be a client of Equity Institutional, and will pay the
                               appropriate fees for administration and storage.
						


6



							When you reach 70.5 years of age and must take distributions, then you may choose to take distributions in physical gold,
                               provided the IRA contains precious metals of the appropriate value.

                               customer’s decisions alone, and purchases and sales should be made subject to the customer’s own research, prudence and judgment.

 In order to finish processing, please submit a physical copy of this signed customer agreement along with your payment.


	This Customer Agreement (this "Agreement") is made and entered into by and between Rosland Capital LLC, a Delaware limited liability company with a principal place of business located at 11766 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1200, Los Angeles, California 90025 ("Rosland Capital"), and the person(s) or entity identified on the signature page hereof ("Customer") for the purchase, sale and delivery of precious metals, coins and other products offered by Rosland Capital (collectively, the "Products"). The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall apply to all transactions between Customer and Rosland Capital. Download PDF
1. Purchases and Payments.
	1.1 Customer may place an order (each, a "Purchase Order") with a Rosland Capital representative (each, a "Rosland Capital Representative") by telephone for the purchase, sale and delivery of Products which shall have the same effect as if the Purchase Order was made in writing. Customer's Purchase Order will be confirmed during a recorded confirmation with a Rosland Capital Representative to ensure the details of the Purchase Order are correct and will include the price, quantity, method of payment and delivery and other material terms of the Purchase Order. Purchase Orders for bullion cannot be accepted prior to Rosland’s receipt of good funds, and after receipt of such funds the final terms of the Purchase Order will be confirmed during a recorded confirmation with a Rosland Capital Representative.

	1.2 Rosland Capital will send Customer a written confirmation of each Purchase Order (the "Confirmation") at the address provided by Customer to Rosland Capital. The amount due under the Purchase Order (the "Purchase Price") shall be due and payable in full to Rosland Capital within ten (10) business days of the recorded Confirmation, in the case of a transaction involving proof, semi-numismatic, numismatic or premium coins, and on or before the date of the recorded Confirmation, in the case of a transaction involving bullion (in either case, the "Payment Period"). Failure to pay the Purchase Price within the Payment Period shall constitute a default by Customer. Upon such default, Rosland Capital will be relieved of all its obligations under the Purchase Order and may recover from Customer the difference between the Purchase Price agreed to by Customer for the Products and Rosland Capital's actual resale price for the Products at the time of default, up to four percent (4%) of the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of 1.1 and 1.2, purchases made on-line at www.RoslandCapital.com shall be subject to the payment provisions set forth on-line by Rosland Capital from time to time.
	1.3 Customer agrees to pay the Purchase Price by personal check, credit card or bank wire (except that any payments for bullion shall be made by check or bank wire only). The Purchase Price specified in a Purchase Order shall include, without limitation, all shipping, handling, storage, delivery, taxes, assessments and other fees imposed on transactions involving the Products. All amounts stated in a Purchase Order are in U.S. Dollars and all payments made by Customer to Rosland Capital under a Purchase Order shall be made in the U.S. and in U.S. Dollars.
2. Delivery. Rosland Capital shall ship the Products to Customer, or Customer’s appointed agent or designee, in accordance with the terms of the applicable Purchase Order, within fourteen (14) business days (or such lesser period as required by law) of Rosland Capital’s actual receipt of the full Purchase Price from Customer. Title to the Products purchased by Customer and risk of loss thereto shall pass to Customer upon Customer’s, or Customer’s appointed agent's or designee's, actual receipt of the Products. Customer shall be responsible for all shipping and handling charges incurred in connection with the delivery of the Products and Customer acknowledges that shipping and handling charges will vary depending on the weight, value, destination and method of shipment of the Products.
  
3. Buy-Back Policy and Customer Service. If in the future you decide that you would like to sell any precious metal or coin products purchased from Rosland Capital, as a service to our customers, Rosland Capital will provide you the opportunity to sell such products back to us at the current market value determined by Rosland Capital for such products on the day the sale to us is completed. You are, of course, free to sell to others, but we believe that you may receive a higher net price by selling to Rosland Capital because we are familiar with the products we have sold you, and do not charge any additional fees or commissions when making such purchases. Due to market conditions and other factors, you may receive less than what you originally paid. Rosland Capital will make payment for any purchased Product within sixty (60) days of the date of receipt of the Products from Customer.Our buy-back policy is a voluntary service to our customers and is subject to withdrawal or change without notice. We may also purchase products not originally sold by Rosland Capital; however, such purchases are subject to additional fees and/or commissions at current market rates.Rosland Capital maintains a dedicated customer service department that handles all customer services, including liquidation requests, refund requests and complaints. Rosland Capital’s Chief Compliance Officer can be reached by phone at (800) 967-5151 or by email at services@RoslandCapital.com.
 
4. Refunds and Returns. Rosland Capital provides Customer the right to receive a full refund of the Purchase Price for the return of undamaged and unused Products; provided, however, that Rosland Capital receives written notice of Customer's intention to return the Products within seven (7) days after the date that Customer receives the Products, and provided, further, that such Products are returned to Rosland Capital within ten (10) business days following receipt by Rosland Capital of notice of cancellation from Customer. Customer’s “receipt” of the Products is deemed to occur at the earliest of: (a) the date that Customer receives actual possession of the Products or (b) the date that Customer receives written confirmation from Rosland Capital that the Products have been deposited on Customer’s behalf in an independent depository. Rosland Capital shall, upon written notice of cancellation and receipt of the Products in the same condition as delivered, issue a full refund of the Purchase Price to Customer within thirty (30) days of the date of Rosland Capital's receipt of the returned Products from Customer.
 
5. Classifications. Rosland Capital's classification of a particular Product as bullion, numismatic, semi-numismatic or premium expresses Rosland Capital's opinion and other precious metal dealers or investors may classify the same Product differently. The classification of a particular Product depends on a number of objective and subjective factors and any classification may change over time. Rosland Capital's spread and prices are based on Rosland Capital's classification determinations. Bullion may be in bar or coin form, and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content. Its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal, which is its current market price. Numismatic coins (including proof coins) are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand, scarcity, dates, condition and grades, and less so on precious metal content. Semi-numismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain, as well as other factors such as supply and demand. Premium coins include numismatic and semi-numismatic coins, as well as proof coins and Exclusive Specialty coins of limited mintage, whose value derives from their quality and limited supply, as well as their precious metal content. Exclusive Specialty coins are typically of high quality, limited mintage, high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source; Rosland Capital determines which products are designated Exclusive Specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors. Precious metals that have lower precious metal content, which may include some numismatics, will have a lower “melt value”, which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price. For example, if the spot price of gold is $1,000 per ounce, a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of $1,000.6. Spread. The difference between the Purchase Price Customer pays for Products under a Purchase Order and the price that Rosland Capital actually pays for the Products purchased by Customer under such Purchase Order is known as the "spread" and it is stated as a percentage of the Purchase Price paid by the Customer.  Spreads charged to Customer under a particular transaction may differ significantly from spreads charged to other customers in similar transactions or spreads charged to Customer in other transactions. The spread on Rosland Capital's premium, semi-numismatic and numismatic coins typically ranges between 17% and 33%. The spread on Rosland Capital's bullion typically ranges between 4% and 21%. (For example, if Rosland Capital’s quoted price for a numismatic coin was $300 and included a 20% spread, Rosland Capital’s cost for that coin would be $240. If Rosland Capital’s quoted price for a bullion coin was $300 and included a 5% spread, Rosland Capital’s cost for that coin would be $285.) The spread on Rosland Capital's IRA (as defined below) transactions typically ranges between 17% and 25%. The foregoing spreads are approximations and the spreads at any time and for any given transaction may be significantly different. Exclusive Specialty coins designated by Rosland Capital are only sold by Rosland Capital from sources and based on designs exclusive to Rosland Capital at prices set by Rosland Capital based on their quality, limited mintage, precious metal content and branded or unique source, without any reference to any “spread,” which does not apply to this classification of coins.
 7. Pricing. The prices quoted by Rosland Capital for the Products are established by Rosland Capital upon its analysis of each item and may change many times during the day. The prices quoted by Rosland Capital for the Products are not tied to prices quoted by any other organization and there are no established daily limits on the amount those prices may change. Rosland Capital reserves the right to increase or decrease its prices at its sole discretion at any time. Customer is encouraged to compare Rosland Capital’s prices with those offered by other dealers. 
 8. Taxes. Tax consequences of transactions with Rosland Capital are the sole responsibility of Customer. Customer shall pay to Rosland Capital any sales, use or other tax applicable to transactions involving the Products.
 9. Security. Customer hereby grants Rosland Capital a lien and security interest in the Products in Rosland Capital's possession or control that Customer orders pursuant to a Purchase Order as collateral for any amounts owed by Customer to Rosland Capital under this Agreement, any Purchase Order or otherwise. Customer agrees to execute such additional documents as may be necessary to perfect or evidence this security interest.
 
10. Electronic Recordation. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Rosland Capital may choose, in its sole discretion, to monitor or record Customer's telephone conversations with any Rosland Capital Representative. Unless otherwise specifically agreed to by Rosland Capital in writing, Rosland Capital does not consent to the recording of telephone conversations with any Rosland Capital Representative by Customer or any third party. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital will not record all telephone conversations and that Rosland Capital does not guarantee that any recordings of any particular telephone conversation will be retained or are capable of being retrieved.
  
11. Customer Representations. Customer hereby represents to Rosland Capital that (i) Customer is of legal age and capacity and has the requisite powers, authority, and rights necessary to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations under this Agreement; (ii) Customer is not a party, and will not become a party, to any agree­ment, obligation, or understanding that is inconsistent with this Agreement or mightlimit or impair Customer's performance of its obligations under this Agreement; (iii) Customer is an experienced investor who understands the risks and obligations involved under this Agreement; and (iv) Customer's transactions under this Agreement shall be for investment or other commercial purposes and not for any personal, family, household or other consumer purposes.
 
12. Acknowledgements.12.1 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital is a dealer in precious metals, coins and other related products. Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital is not an exchange or brokerage house or a financial or investment advisor and that neither Rosland Capital nor any Rosland Capital Representative acts as an agent or fiduciary for any of Rosland Capital's Customers.12.2 Customer acknowledges that purchases of the Products involve substantial risks. Market prices are volatile and unpredictable and may be affected by a variety of factors, including, without limitation, general economic conditions, political events, mon­etary policies of various countries, and fluctuations in production and demand. It is impossible to forecast accurately how or to what degree the foregoing or other factors will affect market prices. What is suitable for one customer with a given financial means may not be suitable for other customers with the same financial means.12.3 Customer acknowledges that purchases of the Products are speculative and volatile, and prices may rise and fall over time. Customer acknowledges that profit can only be made if prices for the Products rise in an amount over the Purchase Price paid by Customer for the Products and that Customer may still incur a loss despite favorable price movements.12.4 Customer acknowledges that Customer is financially and emotionally able to enter into transactions which are contemplated by this Agreement and is sensitive to and able to accept the risks and to meet the financial commitments being made under this Agreement.  12.5 Customer acknowledges that grades and descriptions of Products are opinions and not statements of fact, and are based on standards and interpretations that change over time. Rosland Capital uses contemporary grading standards and inter­pretations to grade its Products or relies upon the opinions of third party grading services such as Numismatic Guaranty Corporation and Professional Coin Grading Service. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital does not guarantee that its Products will achieve the same grades from any third party grading service in the future.12.6 Customer acknowledges that Customer is responsible for all purchases made on Customer's account. If Customer believes that a Purchase Order has been entered into for Customer's account without Customer's authorization, Customer shall immedi­ately notify Rosland Capital's Compliance Department at: compliance@RoslandCapital.com. Similarly, if Customer believes that any Rosland Capital Representative has made a verbal or written representation that is inconsistent with the terms or risks set forth herein or is unprofessional or offensive in nature, Customer will notify Rosland Capital's Compliance Department immediately. Customer further acknowledges that if Customer fails to make the required notification within ten (10) business days following the date on which the event first became known to Customer, Customer waives all rights to contest such mat­ter.12.7 Rosland Capital Representatives may from time to time discuss the general direction of various financial markets. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital Representatives cannot guarantee any market movement. Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital Representatives are not licensed as investment advisors and are not making any specific recommendations concerning any forms of investment. Rosland Capital and the Rosland Capital Representatives are not agents for Customer, have different financial interests and incentives from Customer and owe no fiduciary duty to Customer. Rosland Capital Representatives are commissioned salespersons whose commissions are greatest on numismatic, semi-numismatic and premium items and least on bullion. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital believes precious metals and coins are appropriate for 5% to 20% of a portfolio, although certain individuals or organizations might recommend a different percentage. Customer agrees to independently determine what percentage is appropriate for Customer based upon Customer’s individual circumstance. 12.8 Customer acknowledges that Customer has conducted and will conduct Customer's own research and analysis regarding the Products that Customer may purchase from Rosland Capital and Customer will not rely upon any statements made by a Rosland Capital Representative concerning the future value of the Products that Customer may purchase from Rosland Capital. Rosland Capital does not provide investment or financial advice. Customer acknowledges that precious metals and coins do not earn interest or current income.12.9 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital’s policy with respect to the 1930’s gold recall by the Government is as follows: “In 1933, the U.S. Government, by Executive Order, prohibited the private ownership of certain quantities of gold bars and coins.  There were several exceptions to this ban, including allowing people to own “gold coins having a recognized special value to collectors of rare and unusual coins.”  At the time the United States was on the gold standard.  Since 1971 the United States has not been on the gold standard.  The Executive Order prohibiting private ownership was repealed in 1974.  Currently, there are no restrictions on gold ownership, and the ability of the U.S. Government to recall gold is limited to times of war and requires action by the President or Congress.  No one can say with certainty if or how the U.S. Government might prohibit ownership of gold in the future, or whether any particular gold product might be exempt from any future prohibitions.”12.10 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital’s policy with respect to the reportability of precious metals is as follows: “Many of our customers are concerned about personal privacy or disclosing that they own precious metals.  Accordingly, they often choose to purchase precious metals that do not require disclosure of personal information such as name, address and social security number when they sell such precious metals. Currently, certain bullion, semi-numismatic and numismatic coins do not require disclosure of such personal information when a customer sells them.”12.11 Customer acknowledges that Customer has read Rosland Capital’s brochure, which provides additional information about the risks of buying and selling precious metals and coins. This brochure is updated period­ically and it is Customer's responsibility to remain up to date by requesting a copy of the most recent version at Rosland Capital's website, www.RoslandCapital.com.12.12 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital may provide information about companies which provide trustee and custodian services for Individual Retirement Accounts ("IRA) as a convenience to its customers.  Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital is independent from and not affiliated with any of the companies which may provide those services. It is Customer's responsibility to independently select the IRA service company suitable for Customer. Rosland Capital shall have no liability or responsibility for any loss or damage resulting from Customer's dealings with any IRA service company.13.

3. Buy-Back Policy and Customer Service. If in the future you decide that you would like to sell any precious metal or coin products purchased from Rosland Capital, as a service to our customers, Rosland Capital will provide you the opportunity to sell such products back to us at the current market value determined by Rosland Capital for such products on the day the sale to us is completed. You are, of course, free to sell to others, but we believe that you may receive a higher net price by selling to Rosland Capital because we are familiar with the products we have sold you, and do not charge any additional fees or commissions when making such purchases. Due to market conditions and other factors, you may receive less than what you originally paid. Rosland Capital will make payment for any purchased Product within sixty (60) days of the date of receipt of the Products from Customer.Our buy-back policy is a voluntary service to our customers and is subject to withdrawal or change without notice. We may also purchase products not originally sold by Rosland Capital; however, such purchases are subject to additional fees and/or commissions at current market rates.Rosland Capital maintains a dedicated customer service department that handles all customer services, including liquidation requests, refund requests and complaints. Rosland Capital’s Chief Compliance Officer can be reached by phone at (800) 967-5151 or by email at services@RoslandCapital.com.
 
4. Refunds and Returns. Rosland Capital provides Customer the right to receive a full refund of the Purchase Price for the return of undamaged and unused Products; provided, however, that Rosland Capital receives written notice of Customer's intention to return the Products within seven (7) days after the date that Customer receives the Products, and provided, further, that such Products are returned to Rosland Capital within ten (10) business days following receipt by Rosland Capital of notice of cancellation from Customer. Customer’s “receipt” of the Products is deemed to occur at the earliest of: (a) the date that Customer receives actual possession of the Products or (b) the date that Customer receives written confirmation from Rosland Capital that the Products have been deposited on Customer’s behalf in an independent depository. Rosland Capital shall, upon written notice of cancellation and receipt of the Products in the same condition as delivered, issue a full refund of the Purchase Price to Customer within thirty (30) days of the date of Rosland Capital's receipt of the returned Products from Customer.
 
5. Classifications. Rosland Capital's classification of a particular Product as bullion, numismatic, semi-numismatic or premium expresses Rosland Capital's opinion and other precious metal dealers or investors may classify the same Product differently. The classification of a particular Product depends on a number of objective and subjective factors and any classification may change over time. Rosland Capital's spread and prices are based on Rosland Capital's classification determinations. Bullion may be in bar or coin form, and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content. Its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal, which is its current market price. Numismatic coins (including proof coins) are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand, scarcity, dates, condition and grades, and less so on precious metal content. Semi-numismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain, as well as other factors such as supply and demand. Premium coins include numismatic and semi-numismatic coins, as well as proof coins and Exclusive Specialty coins of limited mintage, whose value derives from their quality and limited supply, as well as their precious metal content. Exclusive Specialty coins are typically of high quality, limited mintage, high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source; Rosland Capital determines which products are designated Exclusive Specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors. Precious metals that have lower precious metal content, which may include some numismatics, will have a lower “melt value”, which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price. For example, if the spot price of gold is $1,000 per ounce, a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of $1,000.6. Spread. The difference between the Purchase Price Customer pays for Products under a Purchase Order and the price that Rosland Capital actually pays for the Products purchased by Customer under such Purchase Order is known as the "spread" and it is stated as a percentage of the Purchase Price paid by the Customer.  Spreads charged to Customer under a particular transaction may differ significantly from spreads charged to other customers in similar transactions or spreads charged to Customer in other transactions. The spread on Rosland Capital's premium, semi-numismatic and numismatic coins typically ranges between 17% and 33%. The spread on Rosland Capital's bullion typically ranges between 4% and 21%. (For example, if Rosland Capital’s quoted price for a numismatic coin was $300 and included a 20% spread, Rosland Capital’s cost for that coin would be $240. If Rosland Capital’s quoted price for a bullion coin was $300 and included a 5% spread, Rosland Capital’s cost for that coin would be $285.) The spread on Rosland Capital's IRA (as defined below) transactions typically ranges between 17% and 25%. The foregoing spreads are approximations and the spreads at any time and for any given transaction may be significantly different. Exclusive Specialty coins designated by Rosland Capital are only sold by Rosland Capital from sources and based on designs exclusive to Rosland Capital at prices set by Rosland Capital based on their quality, limited mintage, precious metal content and branded or unique source, without any reference to any “spread,” which does not apply to this classification of coins.
 7. Pricing. The prices quoted by Rosland Capital for the Products are established by Rosland Capital upon its analysis of each item and may change many times during the day. The prices quoted by Rosland Capital for the Products are not tied to prices quoted by any other organization and there are no established daily limits on the amount those prices may change. Rosland Capital reserves the right to increase or decrease its prices at its sole discretion at any time. Customer is encouraged to compare Rosland Capital’s prices with those offered by other dealers. 
 8. Taxes. Tax consequences of transactions with Rosland Capital are the sole responsibility of Customer. Customer shall pay to Rosland Capital any sales, use or other tax applicable to transactions involving the Products.
 9. Security. Customer hereby grants Rosland Capital a lien and security interest in the Products in Rosland Capital's possession or control that Customer orders pursuant to a Purchase Order as collateral for any amounts owed by Customer to Rosland Capital under this Agreement, any Purchase Order or otherwise. Customer agrees to execute such additional documents as may be necessary to perfect or evidence this security interest.
 
10. Electronic Recordation. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Rosland Capital may choose, in its sole discretion, to monitor or record Customer's telephone conversations with any Rosland Capital Representative. Unless otherwise specifically agreed to by Rosland Capital in writing, Rosland Capital does not consent to the recording of telephone conversations with any Rosland Capital Representative by Customer or any third party. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital will not record all telephone conversations and that Rosland Capital does not guarantee that any recordings of any particular telephone conversation will be retained or are capable of being retrieved.
  
11. Customer Representations. Customer hereby represents to Rosland Capital that (i) Customer is of legal age and capacity and has the requisite powers, authority, and rights necessary to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations under this Agreement; (ii) Customer is not a party, and will not become a party, to any agree­ment, obligation, or understanding that is inconsistent with this Agreement or mightlimit or impair Customer's performance of its obligations under this Agreement; (iii) Customer is an experienced investor who understands the risks and obligations involved under this Agreement; and (iv) Customer's transactions under this Agreement shall be for investment or other commercial purposes and not for any personal, family, household or other consumer purposes.
 
12. Acknowledgements.12.1 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital is a dealer in precious metals, coins and other related products. Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital is not an exchange or brokerage house or a financial or investment advisor and that neither Rosland Capital nor any Rosland Capital Representative acts as an agent or fiduciary for any of Rosland Capital's Customers.12.2 Customer acknowledges that purchases of the Products involve substantial risks. Market prices are volatile and unpredictable and may be affected by a variety of factors, including, without limitation, general economic conditions, political events, mon­etary policies of various countries, and fluctuations in production and demand. It is impossible to forecast accurately how or to what degree the foregoing or other factors will affect market prices. What is suitable for one customer with a given financial means may not be suitable for other customers with the same financial means.12.3 Customer acknowledges that purchases of the Products are speculative and volatile, and prices may rise and fall over time. Customer acknowledges that profit can only be made if prices for the Products rise in an amount over the Purchase Price paid by Customer for the Products and that Customer may still incur a loss despite favorable price movements.12.4 Customer acknowledges that Customer is financially and emotionally able to enter into transactions which are contemplated by this Agreement and is sensitive to and able to accept the risks and to meet the financial commitments being made under this Agreement.  12.5 Customer acknowledges that grades and descriptions of Products are opinions and not statements of fact, and are based on standards and interpretations that change over time. Rosland Capital uses contemporary grading standards and inter­pretations to grade its Products or relies upon the opinions of third party grading services such as Numismatic Guaranty Corporation and Professional Coin Grading Service. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital does not guarantee that its Products will achieve the same grades from any third party grading service in the future.12.6 Customer acknowledges that Customer is responsible for all purchases made on Customer's account. If Customer believes that a Purchase Order has been entered into for Customer's account without Customer's authorization, Customer shall immedi­ately notify Rosland Capital's Compliance Department at: compliance@RoslandCapital.com. Similarly, if Customer believes that any Rosland Capital Representative has made a verbal or written representation that is inconsistent with the terms or risks set forth herein or is unprofessional or offensive in nature, Customer will notify Rosland Capital's Compliance Department immediately. Customer further acknowledges that if Customer fails to make the required notification within ten (10) business days following the date on which the event first became known to Customer, Customer waives all rights to contest such mat­ter.12.7 Rosland Capital Representatives may from time to time discuss the general direction of various financial markets. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital Representatives cannot guarantee any market movement. Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital Representatives are not licensed as investment advisors and are not making any specific recommendations concerning any forms of investment. Rosland Capital and the Rosland Capital Representatives are not agents for Customer, have different financial interests and incentives from Customer and owe no fiduciary duty to Customer. Rosland Capital Representatives are commissioned salespersons whose commissions are greatest on numismatic, semi-numismatic and premium items and least on bullion. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital believes precious metals and coins are appropriate for 5% to 20% of a portfolio, although certain individuals or organizations might recommend a different percentage. Customer agrees to independently determine what percentage is appropriate for Customer based upon Customer’s individual circumstance. 12.8 Customer acknowledges that Customer has conducted and will conduct Customer's own research and analysis regarding the Products that Customer may purchase from Rosland Capital and Customer will not rely upon any statements made by a Rosland Capital Representative concerning the future value of the Products that Customer may purchase from Rosland Capital. Rosland Capital does not provide investment or financial advice. Customer acknowledges that precious metals and coins do not earn interest or current income.12.9 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital’s policy with respect to the 1930’s gold recall by the Government is as follows: “In 1933, the U.S. Government, by Executive Order, prohibited the private ownership of certain quantities of gold bars and coins.  There were several exceptions to this ban, including allowing people to own “gold coins having a recognized special value to collectors of rare and unusual coins.”  At the time the United States was on the gold standard.  Since 1971 the United States has not been on the gold standard.  The Executive Order prohibiting private ownership was repealed in 1974.  Currently, there are no restrictions on gold ownership, and the ability of the U.S. Government to recall gold is limited to times of war and requires action by the President or Congress.  No one can say with certainty if or how the U.S. Government might prohibit ownership of gold in the future, or whether any particular gold product might be exempt from any future prohibitions.”12.10 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital’s policy with respect to the reportability of precious metals is as follows: “Many of our customers are concerned about personal privacy or disclosing that they own precious metals.  Accordingly, they often choose to purchase precious metals that do not require disclosure of personal information such as name, address and social security number when they sell such precious metals. Currently, certain bullion, semi-numismatic and numismatic coins do not require disclosure of such personal information when a customer sells them.”12.11 Customer acknowledges that Customer has read Rosland Capital’s brochure, which provides additional information about the risks of buying and selling precious metals and coins. This brochure is updated period­ically and it is Customer's responsibility to remain up to date by requesting a copy of the most recent version at Rosland Capital's website, www.RoslandCapital.com.12.12 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital may provide information about companies which provide trustee and custodian services for Individual Retirement Accounts ("IRA) as a convenience to its customers.  Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital is independent from and not affiliated with any of the companies which may provide those services. It is Customer's responsibility to independently select the IRA service company suitable for Customer. Rosland Capital shall have no liability or responsibility for any loss or damage resulting from Customer's dealings with any IRA service company.13.

The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall apply to all transactions between Customer and Rosland Capital. Download PDF
1. Purchases and Payments.
	1.1 Customer may place an order (each, a "Purchase Order") with a Rosland Capital representative (each, a "Rosland Capital Representative") by telephone for the purchase, sale and delivery of Products which shall have the same effect as if the Purchase Order was made in writing. Customer's Purchase Order will be confirmed during a recorded confirmation with a Rosland Capital Representative to ensure the details of the Purchase Order are correct and will include the price, quantity, method of payment and delivery and other material terms of the Purchase Order. Purchase Orders for bullion cannot be accepted prior to Rosland’s receipt of good funds, and after receipt of such funds the final terms of the Purchase Order will be confirmed during a recorded confirmation with a Rosland Capital Representative.

	1.2 Rosland Capital will send Customer a written confirmation of each Purchase Order (the "Confirmation") at the address provided by Customer to Rosland Capital. The amount due under the Purchase Order (the "Purchase Price") shall be due and payable in full to Rosland Capital within ten (10) business days of the recorded Confirmation, in the case of a transaction involving proof, semi-numismatic, numismatic or premium coins, and on or before the date of the recorded Confirmation, in the case of a transaction involving bullion (in either case, the "Payment Period"). Failure to pay the Purchase Price within the Payment Period shall constitute a default by Customer. Upon such default, Rosland Capital will be relieved of all its obligations under the Purchase Order and may recover from Customer the difference between the Purchase Price agreed to by Customer for the Products and Rosland Capital's actual resale price for the Products at the time of default, up to four percent (4%) of the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of 1.1 and 1.2, purchases made on-line at www.RoslandCapital.com shall be subject to the payment provisions set forth on-line by Rosland Capital from time to time.
	1.3 Customer agrees to pay the Purchase Price by personal check, credit card or bank wire (except that any payments for bullion shall be made by check or bank wire only). The Purchase Price specified in a Purchase Order shall include, without limitation, all shipping, handling, storage, delivery, taxes, assessments and other fees imposed on transactions involving the Products. All amounts stated in a Purchase Order are in U.S. Dollars and all payments made by Customer to Rosland Capital under a Purchase Order shall be made in the U.S. and in U.S. Dollars.
2. Delivery. Rosland Capital shall ship the Products to Customer, or Customer’s appointed agent or designee, in accordance with the terms of the applicable Purchase Order, within fourteen (14) business days (or such lesser period as required by law) of Rosland Capital’s actual receipt of the full Purchase Price from Customer. Title to the Products purchased by Customer and risk of loss thereto shall pass to Customer upon Customer’s, or Customer’s appointed agent's or designee's, actual receipt of the Products. Customer shall be responsible for all shipping and handling charges incurred in connection with the delivery of the Products and Customer acknowledges that shipping and handling charges will vary depending on the weight, value, destination and method of shipment of the Products.
  
3. Buy-Back Policy and Customer Service. If in the future you decide that you would like to sell any precious metal or coin products purchased from Rosland Capital, as a service to our customers, Rosland Capital will provide you the opportunity to sell such products back to us at the current market value determined by Rosland Capital for such products on the day the sale to us is completed. You are, of course, free to sell to others, but we believe that you may receive a higher net price by selling to Rosland Capital because we are familiar with the products we have sold you, and do not charge any additional fees or commissions when making such purchases. Due to market conditions and other factors, you may receive less than what you originally paid. Rosland Capital will make payment for any purchased Product within sixty (60) days of the date of receipt of the Products from Customer.Our buy-back policy is a voluntary service to our customers and is subject to withdrawal or change without notice. We may also purchase products not originally sold by Rosland Capital; however, such purchases are subject to additional fees and/or commissions at current market rates.Rosland Capital maintains a dedicated customer service department that handles all customer services, including liquidation requests, refund requests and complaints. Rosland Capital’s Chief Compliance Officer can be reached by phone at (800) 967-5151 or by email at services@RoslandCapital.com.
 
4. Refunds and Returns. Rosland Capital provides Customer the right to receive a full refund of the Purchase Price for the return of undamaged and unused Products; provided, however, that Rosland Capital receives written notice of Customer's intention to return the Products within seven (7) days after the date that Customer receives the Products, and provided, further, that such Products are returned to Rosland Capital within ten (10) business days following receipt by Rosland Capital of notice of cancellation from Customer. Customer’s “receipt” of the Products is deemed to occur at the earliest of: (a) the date that Customer receives actual possession of the Products or (b) the date that Customer receives written confirmation from Rosland Capital that the Products have been deposited on Customer’s behalf in an independent depository. Rosland Capital shall, upon written notice of cancellation and receipt of the Products in the same condition as delivered, issue a full refund of the Purchase Price to Customer within thirty (30) days of the date of Rosland Capital's receipt of the returned Products from Customer.
 
5. Classifications. Rosland Capital's classification of a particular Product as bullion, numismatic, semi-numismatic or premium expresses Rosland Capital's opinion and other precious metal dealers or investors may classify the same Product differently. The classification of a particular Product depends on a number of objective and subjective factors and any classification may change over time. Rosland Capital's spread and prices are based on Rosland Capital's classification determinations. Bullion may be in bar or coin form, and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content. Its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal, which is its current market price. Numismatic coins (including proof coins) are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand, scarcity, dates, condition and grades, and less so on precious metal content. Semi-numismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain, as well as other factors such as supply and demand. Premium coins include numismatic and semi-numismatic coins, as well as proof coins and Exclusive Specialty coins of limited mintage, whose value derives from their quality and limited supply, as well as their precious metal content. Exclusive Specialty coins are typically of high quality, limited mintage, high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source; Rosland Capital determines which products are designated Exclusive Specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors. Precious metals that have lower precious metal content, which may include some numismatics, will have a lower “melt value”, which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price. For example, if the spot price of gold is $1,000 per ounce, a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of $1,000.6. Spread. The difference between the Purchase Price Customer pays for Products under a Purchase Order and the price that Rosland Capital actually pays for the Products purchased by Customer under such Purchase Order is known as the "spread" and it is stated as a percentage of the Purchase Price paid by the Customer.  Spreads charged to Customer under a particular transaction may differ significantly from spreads charged to other customers in similar transactions or spreads charged to Customer in other transactions. The spread on Rosland Capital's premium, semi-numismatic and numismatic coins typically ranges between 17% and 33%. The spread on Rosland Capital's bullion typically ranges between 4% and 21%. (For example, if Rosland Capital’s quoted price for a numismatic coin was $300 and included a 20% spread, Rosland Capital’s cost for that coin would be $240. If Rosland Capital’s quoted price for a bullion coin was $300 and included a 5% spread, Rosland Capital’s cost for that coin would be $285.) The spread on Rosland Capital's IRA (as defined below) transactions typically ranges between 17% and 25%. The foregoing spreads are approximations and the spreads at any time and for any given transaction may be significantly different. Exclusive Specialty coins designated by Rosland Capital are only sold by Rosland Capital from sources and based on designs exclusive to Rosland Capital at prices set by Rosland Capital based on their quality, limited mintage, precious metal content and branded or unique source, without any reference to any “spread,” which does not apply to this classification of coins.
 7. Pricing. The prices quoted by Rosland Capital for the Products are established by Rosland Capital upon its analysis of each item and may change many times during the day. The prices quoted by Rosland Capital for the Products are not tied to prices quoted by any other organization and there are no established daily limits on the amount those prices may change. Rosland Capital reserves the right to increase or decrease its prices at its sole discretion at any time. Customer is encouraged to compare Rosland Capital’s prices with those offered by other dealers. 
 8. Taxes. Tax consequences of transactions with Rosland Capital are the sole responsibility of Customer. Customer shall pay to Rosland Capital any sales, use or other tax applicable to transactions involving the Products.
 9. Security. Customer hereby grants Rosland Capital a lien and security interest in the Products in Rosland Capital's possession or control that Customer orders pursuant to a Purchase Order as collateral for any amounts owed by Customer to Rosland Capital under this Agreement, any Purchase Order or otherwise. Customer agrees to execute such additional documents as may be necessary to perfect or evidence this security interest.
 
10. Electronic Recordation. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Rosland Capital may choose, in its sole discretion, to monitor or record Customer's telephone conversations with any Rosland Capital Representative. Unless otherwise specifically agreed to by Rosland Capital in writing, Rosland Capital does not consent to the recording of telephone conversations with any Rosland Capital Representative by Customer or any third party. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital will not record all telephone conversations and that Rosland Capital does not guarantee that any recordings of any particular telephone conversation will be retained or are capable of being retrieved.
  
11. Customer Representations. Customer hereby represents to Rosland Capital that (i) Customer is of legal age and capacity and has the requisite powers, authority, and rights necessary to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations under this Agreement; (ii) Customer is not a party, and will not become a party, to any agree­ment, obligation, or understanding that is inconsistent with this Agreement or mightlimit or impair Customer's performance of its obligations under this Agreement; (iii) Customer is an experienced investor who understands the risks and obligations involved under this Agreement; and (iv) Customer's transactions under this Agreement shall be for investment or other commercial purposes and not for any personal, family, household or other consumer purposes.
 
12. Acknowledgements.12.1 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital is a dealer in precious metals, coins and other related products. Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital is not an exchange or brokerage house or a financial or investment advisor and that neither Rosland Capital nor any Rosland Capital Representative acts as an agent or fiduciary for any of Rosland Capital's Customers.12.2 Customer acknowledges that purchases of the Products involve substantial risks. Market prices are volatile and unpredictable and may be affected by a variety of factors, including, without limitation, general economic conditions, political events, mon­etary policies of various countries, and fluctuations in production and demand. It is impossible to forecast accurately how or to what degree the foregoing or other factors will affect market prices. What is suitable for one customer with a given financial means may not be suitable for other customers with the same financial means.12.3 Customer acknowledges that purchases of the Products are speculative and volatile, and prices may rise and fall over time. Customer acknowledges that profit can only be made if prices for the Products rise in an amount over the Purchase Price paid by Customer for the Products and that Customer may still incur a loss despite favorable price movements.12.4 Customer acknowledges that Customer is financially and emotionally able to enter into transactions which are contemplated by this Agreement and is sensitive to and able to accept the risks and to meet the financial commitments being made under this Agreement.  12.5 Customer acknowledges that grades and descriptions of Products are opinions and not statements of fact, and are based on standards and interpretations that change over time. Rosland Capital uses contemporary grading standards and inter­pretations to grade its Products or relies upon the opinions of third party grading services such as Numismatic Guaranty Corporation and Professional Coin Grading Service. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital does not guarantee that its Products will achieve the same grades from any third party grading service in the future.12.6 Customer acknowledges that Customer is responsible for all purchases made on Customer's account. If Customer believes that a Purchase Order has been entered into for Customer's account without Customer's authorization, Customer shall immedi­ately notify Rosland Capital's Compliance Department at: compliance@RoslandCapital.com. Similarly, if Customer believes that any Rosland Capital Representative has made a verbal or written representation that is inconsistent with the terms or risks set forth herein or is unprofessional or offensive in nature, Customer will notify Rosland Capital's Compliance Department immediately. Customer further acknowledges that if Customer fails to make the required notification within ten (10) business days following the date on which the event first became known to Customer, Customer waives all rights to contest such mat­ter.12.7 Rosland Capital Representatives may from time to time discuss the general direction of various financial markets. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital Representatives cannot guarantee any market movement. Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital Representatives are not licensed as investment advisors and are not making any specific recommendations concerning any forms of investment. Rosland Capital and the Rosland Capital Representatives are not agents for Customer, have different financial interests and incentives from Customer and owe no fiduciary duty to Customer. Rosland Capital Representatives are commissioned salespersons whose commissions are greatest on numismatic, semi-numismatic and premium items and least on bullion. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital believes precious metals and coins are appropriate for 5% to 20% of a portfolio, although certain individuals or organizations might recommend a different percentage. Customer agrees to independently determine what percentage is appropriate for Customer based upon Customer’s individual circumstance. 12.8 Customer acknowledges that Customer has conducted and will conduct Customer's own research and analysis regarding the Products that Customer may purchase from Rosland Capital and Customer will not rely upon any statements made by a Rosland Capital Representative concerning the future value of the Products that Customer may purchase from Rosland Capital. Rosland Capital does not provide investment or financial advice. Customer acknowledges that precious metals and coins do not earn interest or current income.12.9 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital’s policy with respect to the 1930’s gold recall by the Government is as follows: “In 1933, the U.S. Government, by Executive Order, prohibited the private ownership of certain quantities of gold bars and coins.  There were several exceptions to this ban, including allowing people to own “gold coins having a recognized special value to collectors of rare and unusual coins.”  At the time the United States was on the gold standard.  Since 1971 the United States has not been on the gold standard.  The Executive Order prohibiting private ownership was repealed in 1974.  Currently, there are no restrictions on gold ownership, and the ability of the U.S. Government to recall gold is limited to times of war and requires action by the President or Congress.  No one can say with certainty if or how the U.S. Government might prohibit ownership of gold in the future, or whether any particular gold product might be exempt from any future prohibitions.”12.10 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital’s policy with respect to the reportability of precious metals is as follows: “Many of our customers are concerned about personal privacy or disclosing that they own precious metals.  Accordingly, they often choose to purchase precious metals that do not require disclosure of personal information such as name, address and social security number when they sell such precious metals. Currently, certain bullion, semi-numismatic and numismatic coins do not require disclosure of such personal information when a customer sells them.”12.11 Customer acknowledges that Customer has read Rosland Capital’s brochure, which provides additional information about the risks of buying and selling precious metals and coins. This brochure is updated period­ically and it is Customer's responsibility to remain up to date by requesting a copy of the most recent version at Rosland Capital's website, www.RoslandCapital.com.12.12 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital may provide information about companies which provide trustee and custodian services for Individual Retirement Accounts ("IRA) as a convenience to its customers.  Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital is independent from and not affiliated with any of the companies which may provide those services. It is Customer's responsibility to independently select the IRA service company suitable for Customer. Rosland Capital shall have no liability or responsibility for any loss or damage resulting from Customer's dealings with any IRA service company.13.

		The beauty and power of America, captured in the graceful Striding Liberty design by Augustus Saint Gaudens for the 1907-1933 $20 U.S. Double Eagle gold coin is the basis for the American Gold Eagle coin. The reverse depicts a nest of American eagles signifying the strength and security of American families. The quality and purity are guaranteed by the U.S. government, and by law, only gold mined in The United States is used in the minting of American Gold Eagles.  Since its introduction in 1986, its four sizes, 1 oz., ½ oz., ¼ oz. and 1/10 oz., have become one of the world’s most widely traded gold bullion coins.

		The Royal Canadian Mint is known throughout the world for its impeccable standards of quality and purity in all its products.  Because of its fine gold purity (.9999+), its flawless quality and its appealing design, the Canadian Gold Maple Leaf in particular, first minted in 1979, has become the preferred coin for many investors around the world today. The RCM’s insistence upon faultless planchets (the pure gold blanks from which coins are struck) has led to an enviable reputation among demanding investors and collectors.

It features the symbol of South Africa, the lithe and graceful Springbok antelope, on the reverse side. The obverse of the Krugerrand features Paul Kruger, the last president of the Republic of South Africa.  The South African Krugerrand was the first modern government-issued gold bullion coin.  It’s marketing campaigns during the 1970’s and 1980’s paved the way for its popularity among the gold bullion coins of today.

A-Mark Precious Metals Inc.
SOXHUB Customer Success Story



Ivy Huang
Director of Internal Audit
EY, IRF CORP. A-MARK PRECIOUS METALS







Founded in 1965, A-Mark Precious Metals is a leader in precious metals with the largest dealer network in North America.
In addition to being an authorized buyer of the U.S. Mint's gold, silver, and platinum products, A-Mark is also an official distributor for many of the world's largest mints, including those of Britain, Canada, Australia and Austria. For a company with less than 60 employees, A-Mark recorded an impressive $6 billion in annual revenues last financial year.

  "The company is growing rapidly and we are international. We provide not just precious metal trading but also storage and leasing of precious metals."
  

Before SOXHUB
In the early months after the company went public, A-Mark’s internal audit team faced numerous challenges with their Sarbanes-Oxley compliance efforts. Be it performing walkthroughs, testing controls or documenting results, they couldn’t settle on an efficient way to communicate to process owners and share statuses with the management.
“Pre-SOXHUB, our internal audit environment was mostly managing everything (all the documentation, control information) in shared folders and the main pain point was the clutter of information and documentation. It was really difficult to give a good picture of the status and also it made communication inside the company difficult.”
Access to real-time information
Implementing SOXHUB transformed the way SOX compliance was performed at A-Mark. The tool’s single control web page design was an instant hit among all the users. Moreover, SOXHUB’s dashboard brought a lot of transparency and visibility to the compliance process, providing stakeholders with a real-time snapshot of the current status.
“It gives you a one-stop real-time glance of the status, that’s the most important thing for an internal audit. You don’t have to go to a different folder for test papers and supporting documents, then a different folder for narratives and another folder for walkthroughs. Now you have everything at your fingertips!”
Further, SOXHUB made the process of generating reports effortless for A-Mark users. Instead of filtering large data and then running pivot tables, users could now generate custom reports at the click of a button by selecting the required columns, all from a single page view.
Managing the Audit Team is simpler
SOXHUB provided A-Mark with a single reliable platform to manage all activities related to SOX compliance. Through the tool, the Director of Internal Audit could review and comment on the work performed by other team members, while constantly tracking the status of their work.
“SOXHUB has made management of my audit team very easy because all the information is synced.  Everybody has access to real-time information.  I can leave review notes and then tag my staff in SOXHUB.  And I see other replies and status in real-time.”

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100.

A-Mark Precious Metals
There are countless private minting facilities and refineries in the United States, and the number seems to be growing with each passing year. Capitalizing on the upward trend of precious metals in recent years, refiners have either opened their doors in recent years or expanded their portfolio of silver and gold products. A-Mark Precious Metals has been a “leader in precious metals since 1965,” and their brand awareness has only grown along with the increase in the popularity of silver, gold, platinum, and palladium in the past decade.
Silver.com is proud to carry a variety of A-Mark products, and these includes silver rounds and investment grade silver bars. Browse through the collection of A-Mark silver products available online today at Silver.com.
A-Mark Silver Rounds
One of the most prominent products offered by A-Mark is its Liberty Bell silver rounds. These 1 oz silver products are an excellent alternative to bullion coin programs and more costly minted ingot bars. Silver.com offers the chance to purchase the most popular product available from A-Mark Mint, its signature 1 oz Silver Round. The rounds in this listing are available to you in mint-sealed tubes, with each round verified in Brilliant Uncirculated condition. Rounds in BU condition have no signs of wear and tear, but may have spotted surfaces, contact marks from the striking process, or breaks in the luster.
The obverse face of the 1 oz A-Mark Silver Liberty Bell Round celebrates the Liberty Bell. From its wooden yoke to its iconic crack that extends to its lip, viewers are certain to appreciate the detailed rendering of this national treasure. Unfurling above the Liberty Bell is a scroll, which reads: “Life Liberty Happiness” in reference to the inalienable rights outlined in the Declaration of Independence. Inscribed underneath the bell is the A-Mark logo accompanied by the purity of the round.
On reverse side of the round features the image of a heraldic eagle. This well-known emblem depicts the national bird with its wings outstretched as it upholds a star-spangled shield. In its talons, it grasps an olive branch along with a set of arrows. Further emphasizing the patriotic motif of this illustration is the arch formation of stars, appearing behind the Eagle. As a final touch, artists have engraved the round’s weight and purity along with the words “LIBERTY SILVER” in a circular border around the eagle.
Why Choose Silver Rounds?
Silver rounds are a popular means of investing, and building a collector’s portfolio, for many numismatists. There are many reasons for the popularity of silver rounds. Viewed as a snapshot of the current economic climate, silver rounds are surging in popularity for the exact same reason as bullion coins such as the American Silver Eagle, Canadian Silver Maple Leaf, and Chinese Silver Panda: silver prices. While gold and platinum have shot to record highs at various points in recent years, silver prices are shrinking.
Lower silver prices push more investors into the marketplace. These individuals look to invest their hard-earned cash in silver now while prices are low, allowing them to purchase greater quantities of silver and hold onto those with the long-term goal of seeing silver prices rise. The greatest benefit that silver rounds have compared to popular bullion coins such as those mentioned above is the producer. Yes, coins from the United States Mint, Royal Canadian Mint, and Perth Mint (among others) are in high demand, and they are among the highest quality coins available today. However, there are two hurdles preventing average investors and new investors from getting into the market.
First, many of the sovereign coins released by these mints are restricted in production on one level or another. For example, Perth Mint coins such as the Australian Silver Kookaburra and Australian Silver Koala have limited mintages (usually maxed at 1 million) that restrict the amount available on an annual basis. In the case of the American Silver Eagle, the United States Mint strikes the coins to meet demand. However, the Mint has been forced to institute an allocation program restricting the volume at times to meet the immense demand for silver coins.
More importantly, the coins struck by these mints have higher premiums over the spot price of silver. The demand for these coins and the limited mintage of each leads to higher prices, making it difficult for collectors to regularly purchase the designs they covet and tougher for new investors to break into the market. If you’ve been considering the purchase of silver rounds as part of your investment portfolio or collection, browse the complete variety of JM Bullion silver rounds below.
A-Mark Silver Bars
Silver bars are a popular option for any investors, offering the opportunity to invest in larger quantities of silver without procuring more products (such as coins) and consuming more space in the process. Additionally, some silver bars are produced as cast products that offer some of the lowest premiums over the spot price of silver you’ll find on the market today.
Among those options is the 10 oz A-Mark Silver Bar. This simple product from A-Mark features only the mint’s own designs and is available at extremely affordable prices. On the obverse side of the 10 oz. A-Mark Silver Bar you’ll find the large-font, bold image of the A-Mark logo. This design features a stylized letter “A” with horizontal lines swooping off to its right-hand side. Below it are engravings of the mint name, the bar’s purity, metal content, and weight.
Flip the bar over and you’ll find a repeating text pattern on the reverse. This test is set at a 45-degree angle across the bar, reading from the lower left to the upper right of the bar’s reverse face. The included text reads “.999+,” “Pure Silver,” and “10 oz. Troy A-Mark.”
Why Choose Silver Bars?
There is no more popular product in the world right now than a silver bar. Investors and collectors alike are flocking to silver because, despite its high prices, it’s still an incredible investment vehicle that offers individuals protection against the volatility of the modern stock market. Humans have long looked to precious metals as a means of protecting individual wealth, and mints around the globe have responded in recent years with an expanding portfolio of silver bars.
Modern silver bars are more than just bland precious metal products with uninspiring designs. While there is always a pure product available for the investor that is easy to store and transport, there are also an increasing number of silver bars available that feature unique designs, offering the perfect combination between .999 purity and the creativity often reserved only for gold and silver coins.
Hand-poured bars offer the simplest option and lowest prices for silver bars. As the name suggests, each of these bars started out as melted silver (or gold in some cases) that is poured by hand into a mold that reflects the basic design a mint or refinery is going for.
There are no computers involved in the production of hand-poured bars, and as a result you will often find minor imperfections in the overall finish of the product. Each product will have its own, unique finish because of the manner in which it cools into a hardened form. This, of course, is all part of the allure of hand-poured products.
Conversely, minted ingots are highly refined in appearance, and come with higher prices. Refiners start by manufacturing long, flat cast bars to serve as the blanks upon which minted ingots will eventually be formed. Traditionally this was done by creating a long mold that was used in the production of cast bars. These molds made it possible to create cast blanks with the precise width, thickness, and length required to make minted ingots.
To speed up the process, modern refiners will often use a continuous casting process instead. This produces bar stock of the required width and thickness on a continuous basis that is then fed into a continuous casting machine. Throughout a very complex process, the cast blanks are melted under induction heating or resistance heating to form minted ingot shapes that match exact specifications.
The new bars are then broken down in a rolling mill to reduce the larger batches down to the required thickness, and an interstage annealing process occurs that recrystallizes the grain structure of the metals and improves the surface finish of the bar. The rolling mill, combined with a strip annealing furnace help refine the bars to their required thickness. Further exposure to a gauging mill refines the bars even more, before they are eventually sent to the blanking press where each individual bar is punched out of the strip to prepare for striking process, at which point mint marks and designs are added to the finished product.

 In order to finish processing, please submit a physical copy of this signed customer agreement along with your payment.


	This Customer Agreement (this "Agreement") is made and entered into by and between Rosland Capital LLC, a Delaware limited liability company with a principal place of business located at 11766 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1200, Los Angeles, California 90025 ("Rosland Capital"), and the person(s) or entity identified on the signature page hereof ("Customer") for the purchase, sale and delivery of precious metals, coins and other products offered by Rosland Capital (collectively, the "Products"). The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall apply to all transactions between Customer and Rosland Capital. Download PDF
1. Purchases and Payments.
	1.1 Customer may place an order (each, a "Purchase Order") with a Rosland Capital representative (each, a "Rosland Capital Representative") by telephone for the purchase, sale and delivery of Products which shall have the same effect as if the Purchase Order was made in writing. Customer's Purchase Order will be confirmed during a recorded confirmation with a Rosland Capital Representative to ensure the details of the Purchase Order are correct and will include the price, quantity, method of payment and delivery and other material terms of the Purchase Order. Purchase Orders for bullion cannot be accepted prior to Rosland’s receipt of good funds, and after receipt of such funds the final terms of the Purchase Order will be confirmed during a recorded confirmation with a Rosland Capital Representative.

	1.2 Rosland Capital will send Customer a written confirmation of each Purchase Order (the "Confirmation") at the address provided by Customer to Rosland Capital. The amount due under the Purchase Order (the "Purchase Price") shall be due and payable in full to Rosland Capital within ten (10) business days of the recorded Confirmation, in the case of a transaction involving proof, semi-numismatic, numismatic or premium coins, and on or before the date of the recorded Confirmation, in the case of a transaction involving bullion (in either case, the "Payment Period"). Failure to pay the Purchase Price within the Payment Period shall constitute a default by Customer. Upon such default, Rosland Capital will be relieved of all its obligations under the Purchase Order and may recover from Customer the difference between the Purchase Price agreed to by Customer for the Products and Rosland Capital's actual resale price for the Products at the time of default, up to four percent (4%) of the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of 1.1 and 1.2, purchases made on-line at www.RoslandCapital.com shall be subject to the payment provisions set forth on-line by Rosland Capital from time to time.
	1.3 Customer agrees to pay the Purchase Price by personal check, credit card or bank wire (except that any payments for bullion shall be made by check or bank wire only). The Purchase Price specified in a Purchase Order shall include, without limitation, all shipping, handling, storage, delivery, taxes, assessments and other fees imposed on transactions involving the Products. All amounts stated in a Purchase Order are in U.S. Dollars and all payments made by Customer to Rosland Capital under a Purchase Order shall be made in the U.S. and in U.S. Dollars.
2. Delivery. Rosland Capital shall ship the Products to Customer, or Customer’s appointed agent or designee, in accordance with the terms of the applicable Purchase Order, within fourteen (14) business days (or such lesser period as required by law) of Rosland Capital’s actual receipt of the full Purchase Price from Customer. Title to the Products purchased by Customer and risk of loss thereto shall pass to Customer upon Customer’s, or Customer’s appointed agent's or designee's, actual receipt of the Products. Customer shall be responsible for all shipping and handling charges incurred in connection with the delivery of the Products and Customer acknowledges that shipping and handling charges will vary depending on the weight, value, destination and method of shipment of the Products.
  
3. Buy-Back Policy and Customer Service. If in the future you decide that you would like to sell any precious metal or coin products purchased from Rosland Capital, as a service to our customers, Rosland Capital will provide you the opportunity to sell such products back to us at the current market value determined by Rosland Capital for such products on the day the sale to us is completed. You are, of course, free to sell to others, but we believe that you may receive a higher net price by selling to Rosland Capital because we are familiar with the products we have sold you, and do not charge any additional fees or commissions when making such purchases. Due to market conditions and other factors, you may receive less than what you originally paid. Rosland Capital will make payment for any purchased Product within sixty (60) days of the date of receipt of the Products from Customer.Our buy-back policy is a voluntary service to our customers and is subject to withdrawal or change without notice. We may also purchase products not originally sold by Rosland Capital; however, such purchases are subject to additional fees and/or commissions at current market rates.Rosland Capital maintains a dedicated customer service department that handles all customer services, including liquidation requests, refund requests and complaints. Rosland Capital’s Chief Compliance Officer can be reached by phone at (800) 967-5151 or by email at services@RoslandCapital.com.
 
4. Refunds and Returns. Rosland Capital provides Customer the right to receive a full refund of the Purchase Price for the return of undamaged and unused Products; provided, however, that Rosland Capital receives written notice of Customer's intention to return the Products within seven (7) days after the date that Customer receives the Products, and provided, further, that such Products are returned to Rosland Capital within ten (10) business days following receipt by Rosland Capital of notice of cancellation from Customer. Customer’s “receipt” of the Products is deemed to occur at the earliest of: (a) the date that Customer receives actual possession of the Products or (b) the date that Customer receives written confirmation from Rosland Capital that the Products have been deposited on Customer’s behalf in an independent depository. Rosland Capital shall, upon written notice of cancellation and receipt of the Products in the same condition as delivered, issue a full refund of the Purchase Price to Customer within thirty (30) days of the date of Rosland Capital's receipt of the returned Products from Customer.
 
5. Classifications. Rosland Capital's classification of a particular Product as bullion, numismatic, semi-numismatic or premium expresses Rosland Capital's opinion and other precious metal dealers or investors may classify the same Product differently. The classification of a particular Product depends on a number of objective and subjective factors and any classification may change over time. Rosland Capital's spread and prices are based on Rosland Capital's classification determinations. Bullion may be in bar or coin form, and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content. Its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal, which is its current market price. Numismatic coins (including proof coins) are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand, scarcity, dates, condition and grades, and less so on precious metal content. Semi-numismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain, as well as other factors such as supply and demand. Premium coins include numismatic and semi-numismatic coins, as well as proof coins and Exclusive Specialty coins of limited mintage, whose value derives from their quality and limited supply, as well as their precious metal content. Exclusive Specialty coins are typically of high quality, limited mintage, high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source; Rosland Capital determines which products are designated Exclusive Specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors. Precious metals that have lower precious metal content, which may include some numismatics, will have a lower “melt value”, which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price. For example, if the spot price of gold is $1,000 per ounce, a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of $1,000.6. Spread. The difference between the Purchase Price Customer pays for Products under a Purchase Order and the price that Rosland Capital actually pays for the Products purchased by Customer under such Purchase Order is known as the "spread" and it is stated as a percentage of the Purchase Price paid by the Customer.  Spreads charged to Customer under a particular transaction may differ significantly from spreads charged to other customers in similar transactions or spreads charged to Customer in other transactions. The spread on Rosland Capital's premium, semi-numismatic and numismatic coins typically ranges between 17% and 33%. The spread on Rosland Capital's bullion typically ranges between 4% and 21%. (For example, if Rosland Capital’s quoted price for a numismatic coin was $300 and included a 20% spread, Rosland Capital’s cost for that coin would be $240. If Rosland Capital’s quoted price for a bullion coin was $300 and included a 5% spread, Rosland Capital’s cost for that coin would be $285.) The spread on Rosland Capital's IRA (as defined below) transactions typically ranges between 17% and 25%. The foregoing spreads are approximations and the spreads at any time and for any given transaction may be significantly different. Exclusive Specialty coins designated by Rosland Capital are only sold by Rosland Capital from sources and based on designs exclusive to Rosland Capital at prices set by Rosland Capital based on their quality, limited mintage, precious metal content and branded or unique source, without any reference to any “spread,” which does not apply to this classification of coins.
 7. Pricing. The prices quoted by Rosland Capital for the Products are established by Rosland Capital upon its analysis of each item and may change many times during the day. The prices quoted by Rosland Capital for the Products are not tied to prices quoted by any other organization and there are no established daily limits on the amount those prices may change. Rosland Capital reserves the right to increase or decrease its prices at its sole discretion at any time. Customer is encouraged to compare Rosland Capital’s prices with those offered by other dealers. 
 8. Taxes. Tax consequences of transactions with Rosland Capital are the sole responsibility of Customer. Customer shall pay to Rosland Capital any sales, use or other tax applicable to transactions involving the Products.
 9. Security. Customer hereby grants Rosland Capital a lien and security interest in the Products in Rosland Capital's possession or control that Customer orders pursuant to a Purchase Order as collateral for any amounts owed by Customer to Rosland Capital under this Agreement, any Purchase Order or otherwise. Customer agrees to execute such additional documents as may be necessary to perfect or evidence this security interest.
 
10. Electronic Recordation. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Rosland Capital may choose, in its sole discretion, to monitor or record Customer's telephone conversations with any Rosland Capital Representative. Unless otherwise specifically agreed to by Rosland Capital in writing, Rosland Capital does not consent to the recording of telephone conversations with any Rosland Capital Representative by Customer or any third party. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital will not record all telephone conversations and that Rosland Capital does not guarantee that any recordings of any particular telephone conversation will be retained or are capable of being retrieved.
  
11. Customer Representations. Customer hereby represents to Rosland Capital that (i) Customer is of legal age and capacity and has the requisite powers, authority, and rights necessary to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations under this Agreement; (ii) Customer is not a party, and will not become a party, to any agree­ment, obligation, or understanding that is inconsistent with this Agreement or mightlimit or impair Customer's performance of its obligations under this Agreement; (iii) Customer is an experienced investor who understands the risks and obligations involved under this Agreement; and (iv) Customer's transactions under this Agreement shall be for investment or other commercial purposes and not for any personal, family, household or other consumer purposes.
 
12. Acknowledgements.12.1 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital is a dealer in precious metals, coins and other related products. Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital is not an exchange or brokerage house or a financial or investment advisor and that neither Rosland Capital nor any Rosland Capital Representative acts as an agent or fiduciary for any of Rosland Capital's Customers.12.2 Customer acknowledges that purchases of the Products involve substantial risks. Market prices are volatile and unpredictable and may be affected by a variety of factors, including, without limitation, general economic conditions, political events, mon­etary policies of various countries, and fluctuations in production and demand. It is impossible to forecast accurately how or to what degree the foregoing or other factors will affect market prices. What is suitable for one customer with a given financial means may not be suitable for other customers with the same financial means.12.3 Customer acknowledges that purchases of the Products are speculative and volatile, and prices may rise and fall over time. Customer acknowledges that profit can only be made if prices for the Products rise in an amount over the Purchase Price paid by Customer for the Products and that Customer may still incur a loss despite favorable price movements.12.4 Customer acknowledges that Customer is financially and emotionally able to enter into transactions which are contemplated by this Agreement and is sensitive to and able to accept the risks and to meet the financial commitments being made under this Agreement.  12.5 Customer acknowledges that grades and descriptions of Products are opinions and not statements of fact, and are based on standards and interpretations that change over time. Rosland Capital uses contemporary grading standards and inter­pretations to grade its Products or relies upon the opinions of third party grading services such as Numismatic Guaranty Corporation and Professional Coin Grading Service. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital does not guarantee that its Products will achieve the same grades from any third party grading service in the future.12.6 Customer acknowledges that Customer is responsible for all purchases made on Customer's account. If Customer believes that a Purchase Order has been entered into for Customer's account without Customer's authorization, Customer shall immedi­ately notify Rosland Capital's Compliance Department at: compliance@RoslandCapital.com. Similarly, if Customer believes that any Rosland Capital Representative has made a verbal or written representation that is inconsistent with the terms or risks set forth herein or is unprofessional or offensive in nature, Customer will notify Rosland Capital's Compliance Department immediately. Customer further acknowledges that if Customer fails to make the required notification within ten (10) business days following the date on which the event first became known to Customer, Customer waives all rights to contest such mat­ter.12.7 Rosland Capital Representatives may from time to time discuss the general direction of various financial markets. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital Representatives cannot guarantee any market movement. Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital Representatives are not licensed as investment advisors and are not making any specific recommendations concerning any forms of investment. Rosland Capital and the Rosland Capital Representatives are not agents for Customer, have different financial interests and incentives from Customer and owe no fiduciary duty to Customer. Rosland Capital Representatives are commissioned salespersons whose commissions are greatest on numismatic, semi-numismatic and premium items and least on bullion. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital believes precious metals and coins are appropriate for 5% to 20% of a portfolio, although certain individuals or organizations might recommend a different percentage. Customer agrees to independently determine what percentage is appropriate for Customer based upon Customer’s individual circumstance. 12.8 Customer acknowledges that Customer has conducted and will conduct Customer's own research and analysis regarding the Products that Customer may purchase from Rosland Capital and Customer will not rely upon any statements made by a Rosland Capital Representative concerning the future value of the Products that Customer may purchase from Rosland Capital. Rosland Capital does not provide investment or financial advice. Customer acknowledges that precious metals and coins do not earn interest or current income.12.9 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital’s policy with respect to the 1930’s gold recall by the Government is as follows: “In 1933, the U.S. Government, by Executive Order, prohibited the private ownership of certain quantities of gold bars and coins.  There were several exceptions to this ban, including allowing people to own “gold coins having a recognized special value to collectors of rare and unusual coins.”  At the time the United States was on the gold standard.  Since 1971 the United States has not been on the gold standard.  The Executive Order prohibiting private ownership was repealed in 1974.  Currently, there are no restrictions on gold ownership, and the ability of the U.S. Government to recall gold is limited to times of war and requires action by the President or Congress.  No one can say with certainty if or how the U.S. Government might prohibit ownership of gold in the future, or whether any particular gold product might be exempt from any future prohibitions.”12.10 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital’s policy with respect to the reportability of precious metals is as follows: “Many of our customers are concerned about personal privacy or disclosing that they own precious metals.  Accordingly, they often choose to purchase precious metals that do not require disclosure of personal information such as name, address and social security number when they sell such precious metals. Currently, certain bullion, semi-numismatic and numismatic coins do not require disclosure of such personal information when a customer sells them.”12.11 Customer acknowledges that Customer has read Rosland Capital’s brochure, which provides additional information about the risks of buying and selling precious metals and coins. This brochure is updated period­ically and it is Customer's responsibility to remain up to date by requesting a copy of the most recent version at Rosland Capital's website, www.RoslandCapital.com.12.12 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital may provide information about companies which provide trustee and custodian services for Individual Retirement Accounts ("IRA) as a convenience to its customers.  Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital is independent from and not affiliated with any of the companies which may provide those services. It is Customer's responsibility to independently select the IRA service company suitable for Customer. Rosland Capital shall have no liability or responsibility for any loss or damage resulting from Customer's dealings with any IRA service company.13.

Purchase Orders for bullion cannot be accepted prior to Rosland’s receipt of good funds, and after receipt of such funds the final terms of the Purchase Order will be confirmed during a recorded confirmation with a Rosland Capital Representative.

	1.2 Rosland Capital will send Customer a written confirmation of each Purchase Order (the "Confirmation") at the address provided by Customer to Rosland Capital. The amount due under the Purchase Order (the "Purchase Price") shall be due and payable in full to Rosland Capital within ten (10) business days of the recorded Confirmation, in the case of a transaction involving proof, semi-numismatic, numismatic or premium coins, and on or before the date of the recorded Confirmation, in the case of a transaction involving bullion (in either case, the "Payment Period"). Failure to pay the Purchase Price within the Payment Period shall constitute a default by Customer. Upon such default, Rosland Capital will be relieved of all its obligations under the Purchase Order and may recover from Customer the difference between the Purchase Price agreed to by Customer for the Products and Rosland Capital's actual resale price for the Products at the time of default, up to four percent (4%) of the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of 1.1 and 1.2, purchases made on-line at www.RoslandCapital.com shall be subject to the payment provisions set forth on-line by Rosland Capital from time to time.
	1.3 Customer agrees to pay the Purchase Price by personal check, credit card or bank wire (except that any payments for bullion shall be made by check or bank wire only). The Purchase Price specified in a Purchase Order shall include, without limitation, all shipping, handling, storage, delivery, taxes, assessments and other fees imposed on transactions involving the Products. All amounts stated in a Purchase Order are in U.S. Dollars and all payments made by Customer to Rosland Capital under a Purchase Order shall be made in the U.S. and in U.S. Dollars.
2. Delivery. Rosland Capital shall ship the Products to Customer, or Customer’s appointed agent or designee, in accordance with the terms of the applicable Purchase Order, within fourteen (14) business days (or such lesser period as required by law) of Rosland Capital’s actual receipt of the full Purchase Price from Customer.

Customer shall be responsible for all shipping and handling charges incurred in connection with the delivery of the Products and Customer acknowledges that shipping and handling charges will vary depending on the weight, value, destination and method of shipment of the Products.
  
3. Buy-Back Policy and Customer Service. If in the future you decide that you would like to sell any precious metal or coin products purchased from Rosland Capital, as a service to our customers, Rosland Capital will provide you the opportunity to sell such products back to us at the current market value determined by Rosland Capital for such products on the day the sale to us is completed. You are, of course, free to sell to others, but we believe that you may receive a higher net price by selling to Rosland Capital because we are familiar with the products we have sold you, and do not charge any additional fees or commissions when making such purchases. Due to market conditions and other factors, you may receive less than what you originally paid. Rosland Capital will make payment for any purchased Product within sixty (60) days of the date of receipt of the Products from Customer.Our buy-back policy is a voluntary service to our customers and is subject to withdrawal or change without notice. We may also purchase products not originally sold by Rosland Capital; however, such purchases are subject to additional fees and/or commissions at current market rates.Rosland Capital maintains a dedicated customer service department that handles all customer services, including liquidation requests, refund requests and complaints. Rosland Capital’s Chief Compliance Officer can be reached by phone at (800) 967-5151 or by email at services@RoslandCapital.com.
 
4. Refunds and Returns. Rosland Capital provides Customer the right to receive a full refund of the Purchase Price for the return of undamaged and unused Products; provided, however, that Rosland Capital receives written notice of Customer's intention to return the Products within seven (7) days after the date that Customer receives the Products, and provided, further, that such Products are returned to Rosland Capital within ten (10) business days following receipt by Rosland Capital of notice of cancellation from Customer. Customer’s “receipt” of the Products is deemed to occur at the earliest of: (a) the date that Customer receives actual possession of the Products or (b) the date that Customer receives written confirmation from Rosland Capital that the Products have been deposited on Customer’s behalf in an independent depository. Rosland Capital shall, upon written notice of cancellation and receipt of the Products in the same condition as delivered, issue a full refund of the Purchase Price to Customer within thirty (30) days of the date of Rosland Capital's receipt of the returned Products from Customer.
 
5. Classifications. Rosland Capital's classification of a particular Product as bullion, numismatic, semi-numismatic or premium expresses Rosland Capital's opinion and other precious metal dealers or investors may classify the same Product differently. The classification of a particular Product depends on a number of objective and subjective factors and any classification may change over time. Rosland Capital's spread and prices are based on Rosland Capital's classification determinations. Bullion may be in bar or coin form, and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content. Its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal, which is its current market price. Numismatic coins (including proof coins) are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand, scarcity, dates, condition and grades, and less so on precious metal content. Semi-numismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain, as well as other factors such as supply and demand. Premium coins include numismatic and semi-numismatic coins, as well as proof coins and Exclusive Specialty coins of limited mintage, whose value derives from their quality and limited supply, as well as their precious metal content. Exclusive Specialty coins are typically of high quality, limited mintage, high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source; Rosland Capital determines which products are designated Exclusive Specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors. Precious metals that have lower precious metal content, which may include some numismatics, will have a lower “melt value”, which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price. For example, if the spot price of gold is $1,000 per ounce, a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of $1,000.6. Spread. The difference between the Purchase Price Customer pays for Products under a Purchase Order and the price that Rosland Capital actually pays for the Products purchased by Customer under such Purchase Order is known as the "spread" and it is stated as a percentage of the Purchase Price paid by the Customer.  Spreads charged to Customer under a particular transaction may differ significantly from spreads charged to other customers in similar transactions or spreads charged to Customer in other transactions. The spread on Rosland Capital's premium, semi-numismatic and numismatic coins typically ranges between 17% and 33%. The spread on Rosland Capital's bullion typically ranges between 4% and 21%. (For example, if Rosland Capital’s quoted price for a numismatic coin was $300 and included a 20% spread, Rosland Capital’s cost for that coin would be $240. If Rosland Capital’s quoted price for a bullion coin was $300 and included a 5% spread, Rosland Capital’s cost for that coin would be $285.) The spread on Rosland Capital's IRA (as defined below) transactions typically ranges between 17% and 25%. The foregoing spreads are approximations and the spreads at any time and for any given transaction may be significantly different. Exclusive Specialty coins designated by Rosland Capital are only sold by Rosland Capital from sources and based on designs exclusive to Rosland Capital at prices set by Rosland Capital based on their quality, limited mintage, precious metal content and branded or unique source, without any reference to any “spread,” which does not apply to this classification of coins.
 7. Pricing. The prices quoted by Rosland Capital for the Products are established by Rosland Capital upon its analysis of each item and may change many times during the day. The prices quoted by Rosland Capital for the Products are not tied to prices quoted by any other organization and there are no established daily limits on the amount those prices may change. Rosland Capital reserves the right to increase or decrease its prices at its sole discretion at any time. Customer is encouraged to compare Rosland Capital’s prices with those offered by other dealers. 
 8. Taxes. Tax consequences of transactions with Rosland Capital are the sole responsibility of Customer. Customer shall pay to Rosland Capital any sales, use or other tax applicable to transactions involving the Products.
 9. Security. Customer hereby grants Rosland Capital a lien and security interest in the Products in Rosland Capital's possession or control that Customer orders pursuant to a Purchase Order as collateral for any amounts owed by Customer to Rosland Capital under this Agreement, any Purchase Order or otherwise. Customer agrees to execute such additional documents as may be necessary to perfect or evidence this security interest.
 
10. Electronic Recordation. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Rosland Capital may choose, in its sole discretion, to monitor or record Customer's telephone conversations with any Rosland Capital Representative. Unless otherwise specifically agreed to by Rosland Capital in writing, Rosland Capital does not consent to the recording of telephone conversations with any Rosland Capital Representative by Customer or any third party. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital will not record all telephone conversations and that Rosland Capital does not guarantee that any recordings of any particular telephone conversation will be retained or are capable of being retrieved.
  
11. Customer Representations. Customer hereby represents to Rosland Capital that (i) Customer is of legal age and capacity and has the requisite powers, authority, and rights necessary to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations under this Agreement; (ii) Customer is not a party, and will not become a party, to any agree­ment, obligation, or understanding that is inconsistent with this Agreement or mightlimit or impair Customer's performance of its obligations under this Agreement; (iii) Customer is an experienced investor who understands the risks and obligations involved under this Agreement; and (iv) Customer's transactions under this Agreement shall be for investment or other commercial purposes and not for any personal, family, household or other consumer purposes.
 
12. Acknowledgements.12.1 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital is a dealer in precious metals, coins and other related products. Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital is not an exchange or brokerage house or a financial or investment advisor and that neither Rosland Capital nor any Rosland Capital Representative acts as an agent or fiduciary for any of Rosland Capital's Customers.12.2 Customer acknowledges that purchases of the Products involve substantial risks. Market prices are volatile and unpredictable and may be affected by a variety of factors, including, without limitation, general economic conditions, political events, mon­etary policies of various countries, and fluctuations in production and demand. It is impossible to forecast accurately how or to what degree the foregoing or other factors will affect market prices. What is suitable for one customer with a given financial means may not be suitable for other customers with the same financial means.12.3 Customer acknowledges that purchases of the Products are speculative and volatile, and prices may rise and fall over time. Customer acknowledges that profit can only be made if prices for the Products rise in an amount over the Purchase Price paid by Customer for the Products and that Customer may still incur a loss despite favorable price movements.12.4 Customer acknowledges that Customer is financially and emotionally able to enter into transactions which are contemplated by this Agreement and is sensitive to and able to accept the risks and to meet the financial commitments being made under this Agreement.  12.5 Customer acknowledges that grades and descriptions of Products are opinions and not statements of fact, and are based on standards and interpretations that change over time. Rosland Capital uses contemporary grading standards and inter­pretations to grade its Products or relies upon the opinions of third party grading services such as Numismatic Guaranty Corporation and Professional Coin Grading Service. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital does not guarantee that its Products will achieve the same grades from any third party grading service in the future.12.6 Customer acknowledges that Customer is responsible for all purchases made on Customer's account. If Customer believes that a Purchase Order has been entered into for Customer's account without Customer's authorization, Customer shall immedi­ately notify Rosland Capital's Compliance Department at: compliance@RoslandCapital.com. Similarly, if Customer believes that any Rosland Capital Representative has made a verbal or written representation that is inconsistent with the terms or risks set forth herein or is unprofessional or offensive in nature, Customer will notify Rosland Capital's Compliance Department immediately. Customer further acknowledges that if Customer fails to make the required notification within ten (10) business days following the date on which the event first became known to Customer, Customer waives all rights to contest such mat­ter.12.7 Rosland Capital Representatives may from time to time discuss the general direction of various financial markets. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital Representatives cannot guarantee any market movement. Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital Representatives are not licensed as investment advisors and are not making any specific recommendations concerning any forms of investment. Rosland Capital and the Rosland Capital Representatives are not agents for Customer, have different financial interests and incentives from Customer and owe no fiduciary duty to Customer. Rosland Capital Representatives are commissioned salespersons whose commissions are greatest on numismatic, semi-numismatic and premium items and least on bullion. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital believes precious metals and coins are appropriate for 5% to 20% of a portfolio, although certain individuals or organizations might recommend a different percentage. Customer agrees to independently determine what percentage is appropriate for Customer based upon Customer’s individual circumstance. 12.8 Customer acknowledges that Customer has conducted and will conduct Customer's own research and analysis regarding the Products that Customer may purchase from Rosland Capital and Customer will not rely upon any statements made by a Rosland Capital Representative concerning the future value of the Products that Customer may purchase from Rosland Capital. Rosland Capital does not provide investment or financial advice. Customer acknowledges that precious metals and coins do not earn interest or current income.12.9 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital’s policy with respect to the 1930’s gold recall by the Government is as follows: “In 1933, the U.S. Government, by Executive Order, prohibited the private ownership of certain quantities of gold bars and coins.  There were several exceptions to this ban, including allowing people to own “gold coins having a recognized special value to collectors of rare and unusual coins.”  At the time the United States was on the gold standard.  Since 1971 the United States has not been on the gold standard.  The Executive Order prohibiting private ownership was repealed in 1974.  Currently, there are no restrictions on gold ownership, and the ability of the U.S. Government to recall gold is limited to times of war and requires action by the President or Congress.  No one can say with certainty if or how the U.S. Government might prohibit ownership of gold in the future, or whether any particular gold product might be exempt from any future prohibitions.”12.10 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital’s policy with respect to the reportability of precious metals is as follows: “Many of our customers are concerned about personal privacy or disclosing that they own precious metals.  Accordingly, they often choose to purchase precious metals that do not require disclosure of personal information such as name, address and social security number when they sell such precious metals. Currently, certain bullion, semi-numismatic and numismatic coins do not require disclosure of such personal information when a customer sells them.”12.11 Customer acknowledges that Customer has read Rosland Capital’s brochure, which provides additional information about the risks of buying and selling precious metals and coins. This brochure is updated period­ically and it is Customer's responsibility to remain up to date by requesting a copy of the most recent version at Rosland Capital's website, www.RoslandCapital.com.12.12 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital may provide information about companies which provide trustee and custodian services for Individual Retirement Accounts ("IRA) as a convenience to its customers.  Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital is independent from and not affiliated with any of the companies which may provide those services. It is Customer's responsibility to independently select the IRA service company suitable for Customer. Rosland Capital shall have no liability or responsibility for any loss or damage resulting from Customer's dealings with any IRA service company.13.

Refunds and Returns. Rosland Capital provides Customer the right to receive a full refund of the Purchase Price for the return of undamaged and unused Products; provided, however, that Rosland Capital receives written notice of Customer's intention to return the Products within seven (7) days after the date that Customer receives the Products, and provided, further, that such Products are returned to Rosland Capital within ten (10) business days following receipt by Rosland Capital of notice of cancellation from Customer. Customer’s “receipt” of the Products is deemed to occur at the earliest of: (a) the date that Customer receives actual possession of the Products or (b) the date that Customer receives written confirmation from Rosland Capital that the Products have been deposited on Customer’s behalf in an independent depository. Rosland Capital shall, upon written notice of cancellation and receipt of the Products in the same condition as delivered, issue a full refund of the Purchase Price to Customer within thirty (30) days of the date of Rosland Capital's receipt of the returned Products from Customer.
 
5. Classifications. Rosland Capital's classification of a particular Product as bullion, numismatic, semi-numismatic or premium expresses Rosland Capital's opinion and other precious metal dealers or investors may classify the same Product differently. The classification of a particular Product depends on a number of objective and subjective factors and any classification may change over time. Rosland Capital's spread and prices are based on Rosland Capital's classification determinations. Bullion may be in bar or coin form, and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content. Its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal, which is its current market price. Numismatic coins (including proof coins) are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand, scarcity, dates, condition and grades, and less so on precious metal content. Semi-numismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain, as well as other factors such as supply and demand. Premium coins include numismatic and semi-numismatic coins, as well as proof coins and Exclusive Specialty coins of limited mintage, whose value derives from their quality and limited supply, as well as their precious metal content. Exclusive Specialty coins are typically of high quality, limited mintage, high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source; Rosland Capital determines which products are designated Exclusive Specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors. Precious metals that have lower precious metal content, which may include some numismatics, will have a lower “melt value”, which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price. For example, if the spot price of gold is $1,000 per ounce, a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of $1,000.6. Spread. The difference between the Purchase Price Customer pays for Products under a Purchase Order and the price that Rosland Capital actually pays for the Products purchased by Customer under such Purchase Order is known as the "spread" and it is stated as a percentage of the Purchase Price paid by the Customer.  Spreads charged to Customer under a particular transaction may differ significantly from spreads charged to other customers in similar transactions or spreads charged to Customer in other transactions. The spread on Rosland Capital's premium, semi-numismatic and numismatic coins typically ranges between 17% and 33%. The spread on Rosland Capital's bullion typically ranges between 4% and 21%. (For example, if Rosland Capital’s quoted price for a numismatic coin was $300 and included a 20% spread, Rosland Capital’s cost for that coin would be $240. If Rosland Capital’s quoted price for a bullion coin was $300 and included a 5% spread, Rosland Capital’s cost for that coin would be $285.) The spread on Rosland Capital's IRA (as defined below) transactions typically ranges between 17% and 25%. The foregoing spreads are approximations and the spreads at any time and for any given transaction may be significantly different. Exclusive Specialty coins designated by Rosland Capital are only sold by Rosland Capital from sources and based on designs exclusive to Rosland Capital at prices set by Rosland Capital based on their quality, limited mintage, precious metal content and branded or unique source, without any reference to any “spread,” which does not apply to this classification of coins.
 7. Pricing. The prices quoted by Rosland Capital for the Products are established by Rosland Capital upon its analysis of each item and may change many times during the day. The prices quoted by Rosland Capital for the Products are not tied to prices quoted by any other organization and there are no established daily limits on the amount those prices may change. Rosland Capital reserves the right to increase or decrease its prices at its sole discretion at any time. Customer is encouraged to compare Rosland Capital’s prices with those offered by other dealers. 
 8. Taxes. Tax consequences of transactions with Rosland Capital are the sole responsibility of Customer. Customer shall pay to Rosland Capital any sales, use or other tax applicable to transactions involving the Products.
 9. Security. Customer hereby grants Rosland Capital a lien and security interest in the Products in Rosland Capital's possession or control that Customer orders pursuant to a Purchase Order as collateral for any amounts owed by Customer to Rosland Capital under this Agreement, any Purchase Order or otherwise. Customer agrees to execute such additional documents as may be necessary to perfect or evidence this security interest.
 
10. Electronic Recordation. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Rosland Capital may choose, in its sole discretion, to monitor or record Customer's telephone conversations with any Rosland Capital Representative. Unless otherwise specifically agreed to by Rosland Capital in writing, Rosland Capital does not consent to the recording of telephone conversations with any Rosland Capital Representative by Customer or any third party. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital will not record all telephone conversations and that Rosland Capital does not guarantee that any recordings of any particular telephone conversation will be retained or are capable of being retrieved.
  
11. Customer Representations. Customer hereby represents to Rosland Capital that (i) Customer is of legal age and capacity and has the requisite powers, authority, and rights necessary to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations under this Agreement; (ii) Customer is not a party, and will not become a party, to any agree­ment, obligation, or understanding that is inconsistent with this Agreement or mightlimit or impair Customer's performance of its obligations under this Agreement; (iii) Customer is an experienced investor who understands the risks and obligations involved under this Agreement; and (iv) Customer's transactions under this Agreement shall be for investment or other commercial purposes and not for any personal, family, household or other consumer purposes.
 
12. Acknowledgements.12.1 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital is a dealer in precious metals, coins and other related products. Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital is not an exchange or brokerage house or a financial or investment advisor and that neither Rosland Capital nor any Rosland Capital Representative acts as an agent or fiduciary for any of Rosland Capital's Customers.12.2 Customer acknowledges that purchases of the Products involve substantial risks. Market prices are volatile and unpredictable and may be affected by a variety of factors, including, without limitation, general economic conditions, political events, mon­etary policies of various countries, and fluctuations in production and demand. It is impossible to forecast accurately how or to what degree the foregoing or other factors will affect market prices. What is suitable for one customer with a given financial means may not be suitable for other customers with the same financial means.12.3 Customer acknowledges that purchases of the Products are speculative and volatile, and prices may rise and fall over time. Customer acknowledges that profit can only be made if prices for the Products rise in an amount over the Purchase Price paid by Customer for the Products and that Customer may still incur a loss despite favorable price movements.12.4 Customer acknowledges that Customer is financially and emotionally able to enter into transactions which are contemplated by this Agreement and is sensitive to and able to accept the risks and to meet the financial commitments being made under this Agreement.  12.5 Customer acknowledges that grades and descriptions of Products are opinions and not statements of fact, and are based on standards and interpretations that change over time. Rosland Capital uses contemporary grading standards and inter­pretations to grade its Products or relies upon the opinions of third party grading services such as Numismatic Guaranty Corporation and Professional Coin Grading Service. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital does not guarantee that its Products will achieve the same grades from any third party grading service in the future.12.6 Customer acknowledges that Customer is responsible for all purchases made on Customer's account. If Customer believes that a Purchase Order has been entered into for Customer's account without Customer's authorization, Customer shall immedi­ately notify Rosland Capital's Compliance Department at: compliance@RoslandCapital.com. Similarly, if Customer believes that any Rosland Capital Representative has made a verbal or written representation that is inconsistent with the terms or risks set forth herein or is unprofessional or offensive in nature, Customer will notify Rosland Capital's Compliance Department immediately. Customer further acknowledges that if Customer fails to make the required notification within ten (10) business days following the date on which the event first became known to Customer, Customer waives all rights to contest such mat­ter.12.7 Rosland Capital Representatives may from time to time discuss the general direction of various financial markets. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital Representatives cannot guarantee any market movement. Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital Representatives are not licensed as investment advisors and are not making any specific recommendations concerning any forms of investment. Rosland Capital and the Rosland Capital Representatives are not agents for Customer, have different financial interests and incentives from Customer and owe no fiduciary duty to Customer. Rosland Capital Representatives are commissioned salespersons whose commissions are greatest on numismatic, semi-numismatic and premium items and least on bullion. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital believes precious metals and coins are appropriate for 5% to 20% of a portfolio, although certain individuals or organizations might recommend a different percentage. Customer agrees to independently determine what percentage is appropriate for Customer based upon Customer’s individual circumstance. 12.8 Customer acknowledges that Customer has conducted and will conduct Customer's own research and analysis regarding the Products that Customer may purchase from Rosland Capital and Customer will not rely upon any statements made by a Rosland Capital Representative concerning the future value of the Products that Customer may purchase from Rosland Capital. Rosland Capital does not provide investment or financial advice. Customer acknowledges that precious metals and coins do not earn interest or current income.12.9 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital’s policy with respect to the 1930’s gold recall by the Government is as follows: “In 1933, the U.S. Government, by Executive Order, prohibited the private ownership of certain quantities of gold bars and coins.  There were several exceptions to this ban, including allowing people to own “gold coins having a recognized special value to collectors of rare and unusual coins.”  At the time the United States was on the gold standard.  Since 1971 the United States has not been on the gold standard.  The Executive Order prohibiting private ownership was repealed in 1974.  Currently, there are no restrictions on gold ownership, and the ability of the U.S. Government to recall gold is limited to times of war and requires action by the President or Congress.  No one can say with certainty if or how the U.S. Government might prohibit ownership of gold in the future, or whether any particular gold product might be exempt from any future prohibitions.”12.10 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital’s policy with respect to the reportability of precious metals is as follows: “Many of our customers are concerned about personal privacy or disclosing that they own precious metals.  Accordingly, they often choose to purchase precious metals that do not require disclosure of personal information such as name, address and social security number when they sell such precious metals. Currently, certain bullion, semi-numismatic and numismatic coins do not require disclosure of such personal information when a customer sells them.”12.11 Customer acknowledges that Customer has read Rosland Capital’s brochure, which provides additional information about the risks of buying and selling precious metals and coins. This brochure is updated period­ically and it is Customer's responsibility to remain up to date by requesting a copy of the most recent version at Rosland Capital's website, www.RoslandCapital.com.12.12 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital may provide information about companies which provide trustee and custodian services for Individual Retirement Accounts ("IRA) as a convenience to its customers.  Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital is independent from and not affiliated with any of the companies which may provide those services. It is Customer's responsibility to independently select the IRA service company suitable for Customer. Rosland Capital shall have no liability or responsibility for any loss or damage resulting from Customer's dealings with any IRA service company.13.

Add Stability to Your Retirement Mix

					Including gold and other precious metals in your portfolio lowers your risk by diversifying from paper assets,
                        thus hedging against the economy and inflation. Through turbulent times, such as an economic downturn,
					gold and other precious metals retain value and are trusted to strengthen and secure wealth, where paper
                        assets may not.
				

					The IRS regulates and controls the products that can be added to your precious metals-backed IRA. That’s why it’s important to choose an industry authority like
                        Rosland Capital, so you know you are working with professionals and have access to excellent IRA-eligible products.

Is a Gold or Silver IRA Right for You?


						Gold and silver IRAs are becoming more and more common these days. Whether it's because the most recent
                           recession has inspired Americans to seek out more diverse types of retirement funds, or simply because
                           families want more protection for their money, there is a lot of buzz surrounding precious metal-backed
                           retirement accounts today.
					

						Whatever your reason for looking into an IRA backed by precious metals might be, it’s always a good idea
                           to gather as much information as possible so that when the time comes to make a change or an upgrade,
                           you feel comfortable doing so.
					



What are Gold and Silver IRAs?

					When you back an IRA with either gold or silver (or both), you are making the decision to protect your
                       retirement funds against the types of fluctuations in the market that could have disastrous implications
                       on your overall portfolio. A precious metals IRA is a self-directed, government-approved retirement
                       account backed by physical gold, silver or other metals, such as platinum or palladium.

The National Economy and Your IRA






							In many cases, gold and silver can provide a better chance of financial security than other types of IRAs. The answer is pretty simple.
						

							Conventional IRAs are often heavy with stocks and bonds. In previous eras, when the national economy was more robust and stable, this method proved to be successful.
						

							But today these paper assets are becoming too risky for many people, especially after events like the Great Recession, which led to many people's retirement accounts being significantly reduced over a very short period of time.
						

							Backing your IRA with precious metals like gold and silver can provide more protection against these threats by diversifying your portfolio, as well as helping to safeguard your money from inflation, economic fluctuation and unfavorable legislative policies.

Gold and Silver IRAs - How Can They Protect Your Nest Egg?

					Gold and silver IRAs offer a unique alternative to conventional retirement plans by enabling you to add precious metals, including gold coins,
                       silver, platinum and palladium, in addition to more traditional types of investments, such as mutual funds.
				

					These Precious Metals IRAs have become increasingly popular in recent years as more uncertainty grows around the health of the global economy. By adding gold and silver to your retirement account,
                       you can help shield your money from future economic turmoil and have peace of mind about your buying power in retirement.
				

					How exactly can gold and silver IRAs provide this unique level of protection? Let's look at some of their key benefits.
				
Benefits of Gold and Silver IRAs


Diversification

							We can't stress this enough: diversification is crucial to every person's portfolio, especially when it comes to retirement savings. Gold and silver IRAs allow you to hold assets that are rarely
                               found in employer-sponsored 401(k)s and conventional IRAs. This means you can greatly diversify your holdings, rather than keeping all your eggs in one "paper" basket.
						
Protection against the volatile stock market

							When the stock market tumbles, even the so-called "safest" mutual funds and bonds can take a hit, and retirement accounts can suffer greatly. If it happens to you right before retirement
                               (as it did to many during the Great Recession), you could be forced to continue working for many years to come. Diversifying your portfolio with precious metals helps protect your
                               retirement money by shielding it from the volatility associated with stocks and other paper assets.
						


Safeguard against the declining dollar

							Many people who buy gold and silver do so as a hedge against inflation and the declining U.S. dollar. As the dollar loses value, Americans essentially lose wealth and purchasing power.
                               If the value continues to shrink, paper-heavy portfolios could be worth a lot less in retirement. On the other hand, the value of precious metals, like gold, tends to increase as the dollar drops.
                               By placing precious metals in an IRA, you can thus preserve your buying power and safeguard your money from the effects of inflation.
						
Tax benefits

							Keep in mind that a Precious Metals IRA comes with the same tax benefits as a conventional IRA. The biggest difference is that you can maintain those tax benefits while experiencing all the
                               other benefits of purchasing precious metals.
						
Growth Potential

							Aside from the security, many people purchase gold and silver specifically for their growth potential, which isn't affected by the same forces as those in the stock market. As finite resources,
                               gold and silver have inherent value and an ever-increasing global demand.

						What you do need to find is a precious metals professional to work with. Obviously, there’s no shortage of firms advertising their experience, expertise and proven track record. Without any sort
                           of verification or third party certificates, these promises are just words.

How to Get Started


1



							A Rosland Capital representative will explain to you how a Gold and Precious Metals IRA works, so you can decide if the option is right for you.
						


2



							If you decide that an IRA fits your needs, the representative will send you the necessary forms from Equity International,
                               the IRA administrators, together with Rosland Capital's own customer agreement.
						


3



							After you have signed and completed the required forms, your Rosland Capital representative will create an account for you and
                               discuss various options for your IRA, including which coins qualify for inclusion.
						


4



							After Equity receives funding, either directly from you or via transfer of an existing IRA, your Rosland Capital
                               representative arranges for the precious metals to be moved directly to the depository in Delaware, where each
                               IRA-holder's gold is kept in separate, secure storage.
						


5



							You will then be a client of Equity Institutional, and will pay the
                               appropriate fees for administration and storage.
						


6



							When you reach 70.5 years of age and must take distributions, then you may choose to take distributions in physical gold,
                               provided the IRA contains precious metals of the appropriate value.

	This Customer Agreement (this "Agreement") is made and entered into by and between Rosland Capital LLC, a Delaware limited liability company with a principal place of business located at 11766 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1200, Los Angeles, California 90025 ("Rosland Capital"), and the person(s) or entity identified on the signature page hereof ("Customer") for the purchase, sale and delivery of precious metals, coins and other products offered by Rosland Capital (collectively, the "Products"). The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall apply to all transactions between Customer and Rosland Capital. Download PDF
1. Purchases and Payments.
	1.1 Customer may place an order (each, a "Purchase Order") with a Rosland Capital representative (each, a "Rosland Capital Representative") by telephone for the purchase, sale and delivery of Products which shall have the same effect as if the Purchase Order was made in writing. Customer's Purchase Order will be confirmed during a recorded confirmation with a Rosland Capital Representative to ensure the details of the Purchase Order are correct and will include the price, quantity, method of payment and delivery and other material terms of the Purchase Order. Purchase Orders for bullion cannot be accepted prior to Rosland’s receipt of good funds, and after receipt of such funds the final terms of the Purchase Order will be confirmed during a recorded confirmation with a Rosland Capital Representative.

	1.2 Rosland Capital will send Customer a written confirmation of each Purchase Order (the "Confirmation") at the address provided by Customer to Rosland Capital. The amount due under the Purchase Order (the "Purchase Price") shall be due and payable in full to Rosland Capital within ten (10) business days of the recorded Confirmation, in the case of a transaction involving proof, semi-numismatic, numismatic or premium coins, and on or before the date of the recorded Confirmation, in the case of a transaction involving bullion (in either case, the "Payment Period"). Failure to pay the Purchase Price within the Payment Period shall constitute a default by Customer. Upon such default, Rosland Capital will be relieved of all its obligations under the Purchase Order and may recover from Customer the difference between the Purchase Price agreed to by Customer for the Products and Rosland Capital's actual resale price for the Products at the time of default, up to four percent (4%) of the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of 1.1 and 1.2, purchases made on-line at www.RoslandCapital.com shall be subject to the payment provisions set forth on-line by Rosland Capital from time to time.
	1.3 Customer agrees to pay the Purchase Price by personal check, credit card or bank wire (except that any payments for bullion shall be made by check or bank wire only). The Purchase Price specified in a Purchase Order shall include, without limitation, all shipping, handling, storage, delivery, taxes, assessments and other fees imposed on transactions involving the Products. All amounts stated in a Purchase Order are in U.S. Dollars and all payments made by Customer to Rosland Capital under a Purchase Order shall be made in the U.S. and in U.S. Dollars.
2. Delivery. Rosland Capital shall ship the Products to Customer, or Customer’s appointed agent or designee, in accordance with the terms of the applicable Purchase Order, within fourteen (14) business days (or such lesser period as required by law) of Rosland Capital’s actual receipt of the full Purchase Price from Customer. Title to the Products purchased by Customer and risk of loss thereto shall pass to Customer upon Customer’s, or Customer’s appointed agent's or designee's, actual receipt of the Products. Customer shall be responsible for all shipping and handling charges incurred in connection with the delivery of the Products and Customer acknowledges that shipping and handling charges will vary depending on the weight, value, destination and method of shipment of the Products.
  
3. Buy-Back Policy and Customer Service. If in the future you decide that you would like to sell any precious metal or coin products purchased from Rosland Capital, as a service to our customers, Rosland Capital will provide you the opportunity to sell such products back to us at the current market value determined by Rosland Capital for such products on the day the sale to us is completed. You are, of course, free to sell to others, but we believe that you may receive a higher net price by selling to Rosland Capital because we are familiar with the products we have sold you, and do not charge any additional fees or commissions when making such purchases. Due to market conditions and other factors, you may receive less than what you originally paid. Rosland Capital will make payment for any purchased Product within sixty (60) days of the date of receipt of the Products from Customer.Our buy-back policy is a voluntary service to our customers and is subject to withdrawal or change without notice. We may also purchase products not originally sold by Rosland Capital; however, such purchases are subject to additional fees and/or commissions at current market rates.Rosland Capital maintains a dedicated customer service department that handles all customer services, including liquidation requests, refund requests and complaints. Rosland Capital’s Chief Compliance Officer can be reached by phone at (800) 967-5151 or by email at services@RoslandCapital.com.
 
4. Refunds and Returns. Rosland Capital provides Customer the right to receive a full refund of the Purchase Price for the return of undamaged and unused Products; provided, however, that Rosland Capital receives written notice of Customer's intention to return the Products within seven (7) days after the date that Customer receives the Products, and provided, further, that such Products are returned to Rosland Capital within ten (10) business days following receipt by Rosland Capital of notice of cancellation from Customer. Customer’s “receipt” of the Products is deemed to occur at the earliest of: (a) the date that Customer receives actual possession of the Products or (b) the date that Customer receives written confirmation from Rosland Capital that the Products have been deposited on Customer’s behalf in an independent depository. Rosland Capital shall, upon written notice of cancellation and receipt of the Products in the same condition as delivered, issue a full refund of the Purchase Price to Customer within thirty (30) days of the date of Rosland Capital's receipt of the returned Products from Customer.
 
5. Classifications. Rosland Capital's classification of a particular Product as bullion, numismatic, semi-numismatic or premium expresses Rosland Capital's opinion and other precious metal dealers or investors may classify the same Product differently. The classification of a particular Product depends on a number of objective and subjective factors and any classification may change over time. Rosland Capital's spread and prices are based on Rosland Capital's classification determinations. Bullion may be in bar or coin form, and its value primarily depends on its precious metal content. Its value fluctuates with the “spot price” of the precious metal, which is its current market price. Numismatic coins (including proof coins) are coins whose value primarily depends on factors such as demand, scarcity, dates, condition and grades, and less so on precious metal content. Semi-numismatic coins are coins that have some bullion value and thus their value may fluctuate with the spot price of the precious metal they contain, as well as other factors such as supply and demand. Premium coins include numismatic and semi-numismatic coins, as well as proof coins and Exclusive Specialty coins of limited mintage, whose value derives from their quality and limited supply, as well as their precious metal content. Exclusive Specialty coins are typically of high quality, limited mintage, high precious metal content and often from a branded or other unique source; Rosland Capital determines which products are designated Exclusive Specialty coins based upon the foregoing factors. Precious metals that have lower precious metal content, which may include some numismatics, will have a lower “melt value”, which is determined by multiplying the precious metal content of a coin or bar by its spot price. For example, if the spot price of gold is $1,000 per ounce, a coin containing one ounce of gold has a melt value of $1,000.6. Spread. The difference between the Purchase Price Customer pays for Products under a Purchase Order and the price that Rosland Capital actually pays for the Products purchased by Customer under such Purchase Order is known as the "spread" and it is stated as a percentage of the Purchase Price paid by the Customer.  Spreads charged to Customer under a particular transaction may differ significantly from spreads charged to other customers in similar transactions or spreads charged to Customer in other transactions. The spread on Rosland Capital's premium, semi-numismatic and numismatic coins typically ranges between 17% and 33%. The spread on Rosland Capital's bullion typically ranges between 4% and 21%. (For example, if Rosland Capital’s quoted price for a numismatic coin was $300 and included a 20% spread, Rosland Capital’s cost for that coin would be $240. If Rosland Capital’s quoted price for a bullion coin was $300 and included a 5% spread, Rosland Capital’s cost for that coin would be $285.) The spread on Rosland Capital's IRA (as defined below) transactions typically ranges between 17% and 25%. The foregoing spreads are approximations and the spreads at any time and for any given transaction may be significantly different. Exclusive Specialty coins designated by Rosland Capital are only sold by Rosland Capital from sources and based on designs exclusive to Rosland Capital at prices set by Rosland Capital based on their quality, limited mintage, precious metal content and branded or unique source, without any reference to any “spread,” which does not apply to this classification of coins.
 7. Pricing. The prices quoted by Rosland Capital for the Products are established by Rosland Capital upon its analysis of each item and may change many times during the day. The prices quoted by Rosland Capital for the Products are not tied to prices quoted by any other organization and there are no established daily limits on the amount those prices may change. Rosland Capital reserves the right to increase or decrease its prices at its sole discretion at any time. Customer is encouraged to compare Rosland Capital’s prices with those offered by other dealers. 
 8. Taxes. Tax consequences of transactions with Rosland Capital are the sole responsibility of Customer. Customer shall pay to Rosland Capital any sales, use or other tax applicable to transactions involving the Products.
 9. Security. Customer hereby grants Rosland Capital a lien and security interest in the Products in Rosland Capital's possession or control that Customer orders pursuant to a Purchase Order as collateral for any amounts owed by Customer to Rosland Capital under this Agreement, any Purchase Order or otherwise. Customer agrees to execute such additional documents as may be necessary to perfect or evidence this security interest.
 
10. Electronic Recordation. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Rosland Capital may choose, in its sole discretion, to monitor or record Customer's telephone conversations with any Rosland Capital Representative. Unless otherwise specifically agreed to by Rosland Capital in writing, Rosland Capital does not consent to the recording of telephone conversations with any Rosland Capital Representative by Customer or any third party. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital will not record all telephone conversations and that Rosland Capital does not guarantee that any recordings of any particular telephone conversation will be retained or are capable of being retrieved.
  
11. Customer Representations. Customer hereby represents to Rosland Capital that (i) Customer is of legal age and capacity and has the requisite powers, authority, and rights necessary to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations under this Agreement; (ii) Customer is not a party, and will not become a party, to any agree­ment, obligation, or understanding that is inconsistent with this Agreement or mightlimit or impair Customer's performance of its obligations under this Agreement; (iii) Customer is an experienced investor who understands the risks and obligations involved under this Agreement; and (iv) Customer's transactions under this Agreement shall be for investment or other commercial purposes and not for any personal, family, household or other consumer purposes.
 
12. Acknowledgements.12.1 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital is a dealer in precious metals, coins and other related products. Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital is not an exchange or brokerage house or a financial or investment advisor and that neither Rosland Capital nor any Rosland Capital Representative acts as an agent or fiduciary for any of Rosland Capital's Customers.12.2 Customer acknowledges that purchases of the Products involve substantial risks. Market prices are volatile and unpredictable and may be affected by a variety of factors, including, without limitation, general economic conditions, political events, mon­etary policies of various countries, and fluctuations in production and demand. It is impossible to forecast accurately how or to what degree the foregoing or other factors will affect market prices. What is suitable for one customer with a given financial means may not be suitable for other customers with the same financial means.12.3 Customer acknowledges that purchases of the Products are speculative and volatile, and prices may rise and fall over time. Customer acknowledges that profit can only be made if prices for the Products rise in an amount over the Purchase Price paid by Customer for the Products and that Customer may still incur a loss despite favorable price movements.12.4 Customer acknowledges that Customer is financially and emotionally able to enter into transactions which are contemplated by this Agreement and is sensitive to and able to accept the risks and to meet the financial commitments being made under this Agreement.  12.5 Customer acknowledges that grades and descriptions of Products are opinions and not statements of fact, and are based on standards and interpretations that change over time. Rosland Capital uses contemporary grading standards and inter­pretations to grade its Products or relies upon the opinions of third party grading services such as Numismatic Guaranty Corporation and Professional Coin Grading Service. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital does not guarantee that its Products will achieve the same grades from any third party grading service in the future.12.6 Customer acknowledges that Customer is responsible for all purchases made on Customer's account. If Customer believes that a Purchase Order has been entered into for Customer's account without Customer's authorization, Customer shall immedi­ately notify Rosland Capital's Compliance Department at: compliance@RoslandCapital.com. Similarly, if Customer believes that any Rosland Capital Representative has made a verbal or written representation that is inconsistent with the terms or risks set forth herein or is unprofessional or offensive in nature, Customer will notify Rosland Capital's Compliance Department immediately. Customer further acknowledges that if Customer fails to make the required notification within ten (10) business days following the date on which the event first became known to Customer, Customer waives all rights to contest such mat­ter.12.7 Rosland Capital Representatives may from time to time discuss the general direction of various financial markets. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital Representatives cannot guarantee any market movement. Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital Representatives are not licensed as investment advisors and are not making any specific recommendations concerning any forms of investment. Rosland Capital and the Rosland Capital Representatives are not agents for Customer, have different financial interests and incentives from Customer and owe no fiduciary duty to Customer. Rosland Capital Representatives are commissioned salespersons whose commissions are greatest on numismatic, semi-numismatic and premium items and least on bullion. Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital believes precious metals and coins are appropriate for 5% to 20% of a portfolio, although certain individuals or organizations might recommend a different percentage. Customer agrees to independently determine what percentage is appropriate for Customer based upon Customer’s individual circumstance. 12.8 Customer acknowledges that Customer has conducted and will conduct Customer's own research and analysis regarding the Products that Customer may purchase from Rosland Capital and Customer will not rely upon any statements made by a Rosland Capital Representative concerning the future value of the Products that Customer may purchase from Rosland Capital. Rosland Capital does not provide investment or financial advice. Customer acknowledges that precious metals and coins do not earn interest or current income.12.9 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital’s policy with respect to the 1930’s gold recall by the Government is as follows: “In 1933, the U.S. Government, by Executive Order, prohibited the private ownership of certain quantities of gold bars and coins.  There were several exceptions to this ban, including allowing people to own “gold coins having a recognized special value to collectors of rare and unusual coins.”  At the time the United States was on the gold standard.  Since 1971 the United States has not been on the gold standard.  The Executive Order prohibiting private ownership was repealed in 1974.  Currently, there are no restrictions on gold ownership, and the ability of the U.S. Government to recall gold is limited to times of war and requires action by the President or Congress.  No one can say with certainty if or how the U.S. Government might prohibit ownership of gold in the future, or whether any particular gold product might be exempt from any future prohibitions.”12.10 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital’s policy with respect to the reportability of precious metals is as follows: “Many of our customers are concerned about personal privacy or disclosing that they own precious metals.  Accordingly, they often choose to purchase precious metals that do not require disclosure of personal information such as name, address and social security number when they sell such precious metals. Currently, certain bullion, semi-numismatic and numismatic coins do not require disclosure of such personal information when a customer sells them.”12.11 Customer acknowledges that Customer has read Rosland Capital’s brochure, which provides additional information about the risks of buying and selling precious metals and coins. This brochure is updated period­ically and it is Customer's responsibility to remain up to date by requesting a copy of the most recent version at Rosland Capital's website, www.RoslandCapital.com.12.12 Customer acknowledges that Rosland Capital may provide information about companies which provide trustee and custodian services for Individual Retirement Accounts ("IRA) as a convenience to its customers.  Customer further acknowledges that Rosland Capital is independent from and not affiliated with any of the companies which may provide those services. It is Customer's responsibility to independently select the IRA service company suitable for Customer. Rosland Capital shall have no liability or responsibility for any loss or damage resulting from Customer's dealings with any IRA service company.13.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
