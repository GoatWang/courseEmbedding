	Gary L. Cowger was very nearly steered to a career in baseball. A high school mechanical drawing teacher encouraged him to apply instead to the General Motors Institute (now Kettering University) in 1970. He thanks that teacher to this very day.

	For a "car guy" who was also interested in engineering, GMI turned out to be the perfect place. His schooling led to a 45-year career (1965-2009) with General Motors and his eventual election to the National Academy of Engineering for his contributions to the GM Global Manufacturing System, which has dramatically improved flexibility, quality, and productivity in automotive manufacturing. Under his leadership, GM's overall productivity improved 25 percent over six years.

	Mr. Cowger's early interest in cars also garnered a friendship with Jay Leno, a famed car enthusiast, and also to his ownership of the Corvette produced for the fiftieth anniversary of that automobile. Now he's honored with the M. Eugene Merchant Manufacturing Medal of ASME/SME, given to an exceptional individual who has had significant influence on and responsibility for improving the productivity and efficiency of the manufacturing operation.







        Mr. Cowger had a 45-year career (1965-2009) with General Motors.
    


He has held several senior positions at General Motors, including president and managing director of GM de Mexico (1994-97); chairman of Adam Opel, AG (1998); group vice president of manufacturing and labor relations (1999-2001); and president of GM North America (2002-05). Prior to his retirement in 2009, Mr. Cowger was group vice president of General Motors global manufacturing and labor relations (2005-09). In this position he was responsible for directing all of GM’s manufacturing, manufacturing engineering, and labor relations activities worldwide, and was a member of the Automotive Strategy Board and the Automotive Product Board.

	Mr. Cowger began his career at the GM Assembly Division plant in Kansas City, KS, as a co-op student of General Motors Institute. He held various manufacturing and engineering positions at the Fairfax Plant in Kansas City and the Oldsmobile Division in Lansing, MI, before being appointed plant manager of the Wentzville Assembly Center in Missouri in 1982 and complex manager at the Lordstown, OH, assembly and stamping plants in 1985. In 1987 he was appointed manufacturing manager for the Cadillac Division and was instrumental in Cadillac's winning the Malcolm Baldrige Award. He also was executive-in-charge of advanced manufacturing engineering at the GM Technical Center.

	Mr. Cowger continues making contributions to industry as chairman and chief executive officer of GLC Ventures, LLC, a Bloomfield Hills, MI, management consultancy on business, manufacturing, and technology strategy. He is chairman of the board of trustees at Kettering University and serves on the board of directors of Delphi Corp.

	Over the past 25 years, Mr. Cowger has contributed many articles to publications, participated in press interviews, and presented keynote speeches at numerous forums.

	Mr. Cowger received his bachelor's degree in industrial engineering from General Motors Institute. He earned his master's degree in management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1978. He holds an honorary doctorate of humane letters (2002) from Lindenwood College and an honorary doctorate of engineering (2007) from Kettering University.


            Under Gary Cowger's leadership of its manufacturing system, GM saw overall productivity improve 25 percent over six years.

Making Value: Integrating Manufacturing, Design, and Innovation to Thrive in the Changing Global Economy
Manufacturing is in a period of dramatic transformation. But in the United States, public and political dialogue is simplistically focused almost entirely on the movement of certain manufacturing jobs overseas to low-wage countries.



   



The NAE Workshop on Making Value: Integrating Manufacturing, Design, and Innovation to Thrive in the Changing Global Economy was held June 11-12, 2012 in Washington, D.C.

The Changing Nature of Manufacturing, Design, and Innovation

Cutting-edge technological developments and business models have the potential to revolutionize manufacturing, design, and innovation in the United States and globally. Innovations in nanotechnology, biotechnology, and robotics are enabling new production processes that can generate entirely novel types of products. Advances in information technology are facilitating a closer integration of the customer into business processes than ever before. What lies ahead at the intersection of manufacturing, design, and innovation? How is the increased focus on the entire customer experience influencing products, production, and business models? How will Americans be affected by these changes?

Digitization, Productivity and Jobs Power Point





The Future of Work

U.S. manufacturing employment has decreased from more than 19 million in 1980 to less than 14 million today. Although these numbers imply a decline of job opportunities in manufacturing, the reality of how work is transforming on and off the factory floor is far from simple. How are developments in technology and business models changing the nature of work in manufacturing, design, and innovation? What lies ahead in a world of increasing automation, intelligent products, agile production, and customer-experience-driven manufacturing? What types and scale of job opportunities are emerging? How can the workforce prepare for this future?

Building the Ecosystem to Support Entrepreneurship Power Point





Building the Ecosystem for the Future of Manufacturing, Design and Innovation

In recent years, the concept of a “manufacturing ecosystem” has emerged to describe the interconnected system of individual companies both drawing on and contributing to shared resources, including workforce talent, infrastructure, and networks of suppliers and partners. What is the state of the manufacturing, design, and innovation ecosystem? How is this ecosystem changing in response to increased global integration, emerging technologies, and transforming business models? What are the weakest links in the value-chains within this ecosystem? Where are the opportunities to improve the value that the nation receives from the global ecosystem of manufacturing, design, and innovation?
