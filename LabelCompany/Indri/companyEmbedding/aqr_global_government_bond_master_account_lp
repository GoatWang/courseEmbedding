This video is not a complete analysis of every material fact regarding any country, market, industry, security or fund. Because market and economic conditions are subject to change, comments, opinions and analyses are rendered as of February 6, 2017, and may change without notice. A portfolio manager’s assessment of a particular security, investment or strategy is not intended as individual investment advice or a recommendation or solicitation to buy, sell or hold any security or to adopt any investment strategy; it is intended only to provide insight into the fund’s portfolio selection process. Holdings are subject to change. The value of investments can go down as well as up, and investors may not get back the full amount invested.

The funds have a fee waiver associated with any investment they make in a Franklin Templeton money fund and/or other Franklin Templeton fund, contractually guaranteed through April 30, 2018. Fund investment results reflect the fee waiver; without this waiver, the results would have been lower.
The funds’ 30-day standardized yields are calculated over a trailing 30-day period using the yield to maturity on bonds and/or the dividends accrued on stocks. The yields may not equal the funds’ actual income distribution rates, which reflects the funds’ past dividends paid to shareholders.
The funds offer multiple share classes, which are subject to different fees and expenses that will affect their performance. Visit the fund information page for performance and fee details for other share classes: Templeton Global Bond Fund / Templeton Global Total Return Fund.
Effective 1/1/97, Templeton Global Bond Fund began offering Advisor Class shares. For periods prior to the fund's Advisor Class inception date, a restated figure is used based on the fund's oldest share class, Class A performance, excluding the effect of Class A's maximum initial sales charge but reflecting the effect of the Class A Rule 12b-1 fees; and for periods after the fund's Advisor Class inception date, actual Advisor Class performance is used, reflecting all charges and fees applicable to that class.

What are the risks?
All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal.
Templeton Global Bond Fund
Currency rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time, and can reduce returns. Derivatives, including currency management strategies, involve costs and can create economic leverage in the portfolio which may result in significant volatility and cause the fund to participate in losses (as well as enable gains) on an amount that exceeds the fund's initial investment. The fund may not achieve the anticipated benefits, and may realize losses when a counterparty fails to perform as promised. The markets for particular securities or types of securities are or may become relatively illiquid. Reduced liquidity will have an adverse impact on the security's value and on the fund's ability to sell such securities when necessary to meet the fund's liquidity needs or in response to a specific market event. Foreign securities involve special risks, including currency fluctuations and economic and political uncertainties. Investments in emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors, in addition to those associated with these markets' smaller size and lesser liquidity. Investments in lower-rated bonds include higher risk of default and loss of principal. Changes in interest rates will affect the value of the fund's portfolio and its share price and yield. Bond prices generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates. As the prices of bonds in the fund adjust to a rise in interest rates, the fund's share price may decline. The fund is also non-diversified, which involves the risk of greater price fluctuation than a more diversified portfolio. Changes in the financial strength of a bond issuer or in a bond's credit rating may affect its value.

Reduced liquidity will have an adverse impact on the security's value and on the fund's ability to sell such securities when necessary to meet the fund's liquidity needs or in response to a specific market event. Foreign securities involve special risks, including currency fluctuations (which may be significant over the short term) and economic and political uncertainties; investments in emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors. Sovereign debt securities are subject to various risks in addition to those relating to debt securities and foreign securities generally, including, but not limited to, the risk that a government entity may be unwilling or unable to pay interest and repay principal on its sovereign debt, or otherwise meet its obligations when due. Investments in lower-rated bonds include higher risk of default and loss of principal. Bond prices generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates. As the prices of bonds in the fund adjust to a rise in interest rates, the fund's share price may decline. Changes in the financial strength of a bond issuer or in a bond's credit rating may affect its value. These and other risk considerations are discussed in the funds' prospectus.
For more information on any funds, contact your financial advisor or download a prospectus. Investors should carefully consider a fund’s investment goals, risks, sales charges and expenses before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing or sending money.

What Are the Risks?
All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal. Bond prices generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates. Thus, as the prices of bonds adjust to a rise in interest rates, the share price may decline. Investments in foreign securities involve special risks including currency fluctuations, economic instability and political developments. Investments in emerging market countries involve heightened risks related to the same factors, in addition to those associated with these markets’ smaller size, lesser liquidity and lack of established legal, political, business and social frameworks to support securities markets. Such investments could experience significant price volatility in any given year. High yields reflect the higher credit risk associated with these lower-rated securities and, in some cases, the lower market prices for these instruments. Interest rate movements may affect the share price and yield. Stock prices fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and dramatically, due to factors affecting individual companies, particular industries or sectors, or general market conditions. Treasuries, if held to maturity, offer a fixed rate of return and fixed principal value; their interest payments and principal are guaranteed.

Global Macro Shifts











WHAT IS GLOBAL MACRO SHIFTS?


Global Macro Shifts is a research-based briefing on global economies featuring the analysis and views of Dr. Michael Hasenstab and senior members of Templeton Global Macro.



Latest edition



Trade and Taxes in a World with Borders
US policy continues to be an important topic for investors throughout the world. Recently, the potential for US corporate tax reform and a border adjustment tax (BAT) stirred debate not only within the US government but also among global investors. Templeton Global Macro examines how a BAT would work, its likely effect on prices and exchange rates, its implications for the longer-term macroeconomic outlook, its impact on different domestic sectors and trade flows, and the potential ramifications for international trade relations.​

Actively Prepared for Rising Rates








While many said they believed rates would eventually head upwards, not all managers were as proactive as Dr. Hasenstab about positioning their portfolios for the shift.

This video is not a complete analysis of every material fact regarding any country, market, industry, security or fund. Because market and economic conditions are subject to change, comments, opinions and analyses are rendered as of February 6, 2017, and may change without notice. A portfolio manager’s assessment of a particular security, investment or strategy is not intended as individual investment advice or a recommendation or solicitation to buy, sell or hold any security or to adopt any investment strategy; it is intended only to provide insight into the fund’s portfolio selection process. Holdings are subject to change. The value of investments can go down as well as up, and investors may not get back the full amount invested.
1. Source: FactSet Research, Morningstar. March 31, 2017. Indexes are unmanaged, and one cannot invest directly in an index. They do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges. Important data provider notices and terms are available at www.franklintempletondatasources.com.
The funds have a fee waiver associated with any investment they make in a Franklin Templeton money fund and/or other Franklin Templeton fund, contractually guaranteed through April 30, 2018. Fund investment results reflect the fee waiver; without this waiver, the results would have been lower.
The funds’ 30-day standardized yields are calculated over a trailing 30-day period using the yield to maturity on bonds and/or the dividends accrued on stocks. The yields may not equal the funds’ actual income distribution rates, which reflects the funds’ past dividends paid to shareholders.
The funds offer multiple share classes, which are subject to different fees and expenses that will affect their performance. Visit the fund information page for performance and fee details for other share classes: Templeton Global Bond Fund / Templeton Global Total Return Fund.
Effective 1/1/97, Templeton Global Bond Fund began offering Advisor Class shares. For periods prior to the fund's Advisor Class inception date, a restated figure is used based on the fund's oldest share class, Class A performance, excluding the effect of Class A's maximum initial sales charge but reflecting the effect of the Class A Rule 12b-1 fees; and for periods after the fund's Advisor Class inception date, actual Advisor Class performance is used, reflecting all charges and fees applicable to that class.
Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index is a market-capitalization weighted index representing the U.S. investment-grade fixed rate taxable bond market.

What are the risks?
All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal.
Templeton Global Bond Fund
Currency rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time, and can reduce returns. Derivatives, including currency management strategies, involve costs and can create economic leverage in the portfolio which may result in significant volatility and cause the fund to participate in losses (as well as enable gains) on an amount that exceeds the fund's initial investment. The fund may not achieve the anticipated benefits, and may realize losses when a counterparty fails to perform as promised. The markets for particular securities or types of securities are or may become relatively illiquid. Reduced liquidity will have an adverse impact on the security's value and on the fund's ability to sell such securities when necessary to meet the fund's liquidity needs or in response to a specific market event. Foreign securities involve special risks, including currency fluctuations and economic and political uncertainties. Investments in emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors, in addition to those associated with these markets' smaller size and lesser liquidity. Investments in lower-rated bonds include higher risk of default and loss of principal. Changes in interest rates will affect the value of the fund's portfolio and its share price and yield. Bond prices generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates. As the prices of bonds in the fund adjust to a rise in interest rates, the fund's share price may decline. The fund is also non-diversified, which involves the risk of greater price fluctuation than a more diversified portfolio. Changes in the financial strength of a bond issuer or in a bond's credit rating may affect its value.

Foreign securities involve special risks, including currency fluctuations (which may be significant over the short term) and economic and political uncertainties; investments in emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors. Sovereign debt securities are subject to various risks in addition to those relating to debt securities and foreign securities generally, including, but not limited to, the risk that a government entity may be unwilling or unable to pay interest and repay principal on its sovereign debt, or otherwise meet its obligations when due. Investments in lower-rated bonds include higher risk of default and loss of principal. Bond prices generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates. As the prices of bonds in the fund adjust to a rise in interest rates, the fund's share price may decline. Changes in the financial strength of a bond issuer or in a bond's credit rating may affect its value. These and other risk considerations are discussed in the funds' prospectus.
For more information on any funds, contact your financial advisor or download a prospectus. Investors should carefully consider a fund’s investment goals, risks, sales charges and expenses before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing or sending money.

What Are the Risks?
All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal. Bond prices generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates. Thus, as the prices of bonds adjust to a rise in interest rates, the share price may decline. Investments in foreign securities involve special risks including currency fluctuations, economic instability and political developments. Investments in emerging market countries involve heightened risks related to the same factors, in addition to those associated with these markets’ smaller size, lesser liquidity and lack of established legal, political, business and social frameworks to support securities markets. Such investments could experience significant price volatility in any given year. High yields reflect the higher credit risk associated with these lower-rated securities and, in some cases, the lower market prices for these instruments. Interest rate movements may affect the share price and yield. Stock prices fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and dramatically, due to factors affecting individual companies, particular industries or sectors, or general market conditions. Treasuries, if held to maturity, offer a fixed rate of return and fixed principal value; their interest payments and principal are guaranteed.

Global Macro Shifts











WHAT IS GLOBAL MACRO SHIFTS?


Global Macro Shifts is a research-based briefing on global economies featuring the analysis and views of Dr. Michael Hasenstab and senior members of Templeton Global Macro.



Latest edition



Trade and Taxes in a World with Borders
