Faculty » Howard Friedman 
 ABOUT PROFESSOR FRIEDMAN: Howard S. Friedman is Distinguished Professor of Psychology at the University of California, Riverside. His scientific work on health and longevity has drawn wide attention in the scientific community and has been featured in popular media worldwide. For three decades, Dr. Friedman has studied personality predictors of longevity, developing a scientific understanding of the "disease-prone personality" and the "self-healing personality."
His newest book is: The Longevity Project: Surprising Discoveries for Health and Long Life from the Landmark Eight-Decade Study. NY: Hudson Street Press. Based on the most extensive study of longevity ever conducted, The Longevity Project shows what really impacts our health and lifespan — including friends, family, personality patterns, and work. 
 In 2008, the Association for Psychological Science (APS) awarded him the James McKeen Cattell Fellow award, citing his research and ideas that are "changing how we think about the nature of health." Dr. Friedman is also the recipient of the career award for "Outstanding Contributions to Health Psychology" from the American Psychological Association (Div. 38). Professor Friedman is an elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS); the American Psychological Association (APA); and the Society of Behavioral Medicine. In 2015, he was selected for the Faculty Research Lecturer Award, the highest honor that the UCR Academic Senate bestows.

 Dr. Friedman is the Editor of the Journal of Nonverbal Behavior. His research on nonverbal expressiveness and personal charisma has been widely applied in health promotion, leadership training, medical education, and viral marketing. 
 His books include: The Oxford Handbook of Health Psychology (Oxford, 2011); Foundations of Health Psychology (Oxford 2006; named an "Outstanding Academic Title" by Choice); The Self-Healing Personality: Why Some People Achieve Health and Others Succumb to Illness (Henry Holt 1991; iUniverse 2000; reprinted in French and German);  Personality and Disease (Wiley, 1990; also available in Japanese edition);  Health Psychology (Prentice Hall, 2002); and  Hostility, Coping, and Health (American Psychological Association, 1992). He was Editor-in-chief of the Encyclopedia of Mental Health (Academic Press, 1998; named a "Best Reference Source of 1998" from Library Journal). 
 Professor Friedman is also known for his textbooks: Personality: Classic Theories and Modern Research 5e (Allyn & Bacon, 2012) and  The Personality Reader (Allyn and Bacon, 2008). He has received UCR's Distinguished Teaching Award, as well as the Outstanding Teacher award from the Western Psychological Association (WPA). In 2012, he was awarded the Elizabeth Hurlock Beckman Award Trust prize "for inspiring students to make a difference in the community." See http://newsroom.ucr.edu/2829.
 A magna cum laude graduate of Yale University, Friedman received his doctorate from Harvard University, where he was a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellow. For further information about current scientific research in the Friedman lab, please follow the appropriate links.

Comments


Alabama-based ProAssurance Corp. announced a series of promotions and reporting realignments.
Effective immediately, Howard H. Friedman is the president of the Healthcare Professional Liability Group within ProAssurance. Chief Financial Officer Edward (Ned) L. Rand assumes additional duties as executive vice president, as does Jeffrey P. Lisenby, general counsel for ProAssurance.
Under Friedman’s leadership, the Healthcare Professional Liability Group will encompass all MPL-focused activities within ProAssurance, as well as the operations of all MPL subsidiaries, including PICA, led by its President Ross E. Taubman, D.P.M., and ProAssurance Mid-Continent Underwriters. Friedman will also oversee the company’s investment in its Lloyd’s Syndicate.
ProAssurance’s non-MPL subsidiaries and lines of business will report to Rand. This will include Eastern Insurance, led by its president, Michael L. Boguski, and Medmarc, led by its president, Mary Todd Peterson, who will also be responsible for our Legal Professional Liability business. Rand will continue to oversee traditional accounting, finance, investment, and investor relations functions, and will be responsible for the organization’s information systems and project management office.
Lisenby will continue in his role as general counsel for ProAssurance. The company’s legal, compliance, and human resources departments will continue reporting to him and he will also be responsible for ProAssurance’s various owned and leased facilities. As corporate secretary, Lisenby will continue to focus on corporate governance and will work closely with the board of directors.
Other personnel changes were also approved by the board:

Kelly B. Brewer was named vice president and chief accounting officer; she will be responsible for all accounting activities within ProAssurance and its subsidiaries.
Lawrence K. Cochran was named vice president, chief investment officer and head of treasury and will be responsible for all investing decisions and treasury activities within ProAssurance and its subsidiaries.
Michael A. Stoeckert was named vice president and chief technology officer.
Kathryn A. Neville was named vice president and chief compliance officer.
Richard J. Enders was named vice president and chief of internal audit.

ProAssurance is an insurance company specializing in medical professional liability, products liability for medical technology and life sciences and legal professional liability. It is based in Birmingham, Alabama.

Item Description: The American Physical Society, Lancaster, 1969. 1st Edition. FIRST EDITION IN ORIGINAL WRAPS OF THE FIRST EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE OF THE EXISTENCE OF QUARKS WITHIN THE ATOMIC NUCLEUS. In demonstrating that quarks are real particles, Friedman, Kendall, and Taylor confirmed Murray Gell-Mann's hypothesis on their existence; for their discovery, the trio were awarded the 1990 Nobel Prize in Physics. Gell-Mann's landmark work positing the 'idea' of quarks was based on the assumption that strongly interacting particles he classified (called hadrons) were all "built up from more elementary constituents" - that he famously called 'quarks' (Levinovitz, The Nobel Prize, 44). Few people, however, "believed that quarks were real particles. Despite many searches in accelerators and in cosmic rays, no one had found an isolated quark? As Gell-Mann himself said: 'Such particles [quarks] presumably are not real but we may use them in our field theory anyway'" (Alan Lightman, The Discoveries, pp. 457-). Friedman, Kendall, and Taylor proved the existence of quarks by using "high-energy electrons from the then new accelerator, and [showing] that they bounced back in an unexpected way from the protons and neutrons in a gas target" (Quinn, The Mystery of the Missing Antimatter, 97). "Friedman's group was startled? to observe that the scattering pattern suggested not that the positive charge of the proton was uniformly spread out, but rather that charges were confined to point-like centers within the protons. Further experiments determined that the source of these point charges existing within the protons (and neutrons) were indeed evidence of the recently proposed elementary particle, the quark" (Manhattan Rare Books). "The electrons ricocheted off hard point-like objects inside the proton. These were soon shown to be identical with the quarks, thus simplifying the physicist's picture of the world; but the results could not be entirely explained by quarks alone. The Nobel Prize-winning experiment indicated that the proton also contained electrically neutral constituents. These were soon found to be "gluons," particles gluing the quarks together in protons and other particles. A new rung on the ladder of creation had revealed itself and a new epoch in the history of physics had begun" (Nobel Prize Award Ceremony, 1990). CONDITION & DETAILS: Lancaster: The American Physical Society. (10.5 x 9 inches; 263 x 225mm). Physical Review Letters, 23, 16, October 20, 1969. Fine condition inside and out.
