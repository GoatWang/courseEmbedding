Godbold Family Foundation Scholarship








The guiding principle of the Godbold Scholarship Program is to provide economic access while rewarding academic achievement.
Francis S. (Bo) Godbold earned a bachelor's degree from Georgia Tech in Industrial Engineering in 1965 and went on to earn an MBA from Harvard in 1969. Mr. Godbold built a successful career in the financial services industry and currently is Vice Chairman for Raymond James Financial, Inc. He and his wife, Betsy, as well as their children, John Godbold (AE 1991) and Laura Blair, established the Godbold Family Foundation, and in 1999, they initiated an undergraduate scholarship program through their family foundation to help academically qualified students who face financial challenges in meeting their educational goals.
Mr. Godbold and his family continue to grow the scholarship program along with Georgia Tech, fulfilling the financial need of some of Georgia Tech’s top young scholars. The Godbold family hopes that the Godbold Scholarships will inspire the students who receive them to succeed in life and, in time, become Tech scholarship donors themselves.
In order to be considered for a Godbold Scholarship the student must:

complete the regular financial aid application process.
be an entering freshman from specific counties in South Carolina, Florida, North Carolina, and Tennessee
have an SAT score of 1500 or higher (combination of math and verbal scores only)
demonstrate financial need
be an on-time applicant

Godbold Scholars receive 100% of their financial need. The need is met with Institute gift aid that is matched with a Godbold Scholarship in combination with a $2,500 Work Study opportunity.
The Godbold Scholarship is an annual offer that may be renewed for up to three additional years (a total of eight semesters). Future eligibility and awards will be based upon your academic achievement, financial need, and availability of funds.

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?
