                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

      presale report titled 'CNH Equipment Trust 2013-A', dated Feb. 11, 2013, 
      which is available on Fitch's web site. The presale report details how 
      Fitch addresses the key rating drivers summarized below.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High AG Concentration: The 2013-A collateral pool consists of 93.23% AG 
      and 6.77% CO. While the 2013-A AG concentration is consistent, albeit 
      slightly lower, with CNH Capital securitizations going back to 2009, the 
      AG concentrations in all these transactions are up significantly versus 
      CNH Capital transactions issued prior to 2009, which consisted of 
      approximately 18%-32% CO.
    

      Consistent Collateral Concentrations: The pool contains 49.04% used 
      equipment, which is comparable to 2012-D (not rated by Fitch [NR]) 
      (45.55%) but lower than 2012-C (NR) and 2012-B at 47.47% and 50.22%, 
      respectively. Furthermore, the pool consists of 81.60% annual pay 
      contracts, which historically have experienced a lower level of losses 
      compared to other payment types.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement: Hard credit enhancement for the 2013-A 
      transaction is unchanged from the prior two transactions. Class A hard 
      credit enhancement remains at 4.50%. However, excess spread has declined 
      to 1.68% (per annum [p.a.]) from 1.82% and 1.85% in 2012-D (NR) and 
      2.12-C (NR), respectively.
    

      Quality Origination, Underwriting, and Servicing Platform: CNH Capital 
      has demonstrated adequate abilities as originator, underwriter, and 
      servicer, as evidenced by historical delinquency and loss performance of 
      securitized trusts and the managed portfolio.
    

      Integrity of Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction 
      should provide that a bankruptcy of the trust would not impair the 
      timeliness of payments on the securities.

      The ratings above were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and 
      therefore, Fitch has been compensated for the provision of the ratings.
