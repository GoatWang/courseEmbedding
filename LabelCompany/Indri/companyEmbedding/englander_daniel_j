Daniel J. Englander Named To Healthways Board Of Directors






Business Wire




Mar 17, 2014 7:00 AM EDT













 




























































  The Board of Directors of Healthways (NASDAQ: HWAY), the largest independent global provider of well-being improvement solutions, said today that it has named Daniel J. Englander, founder and managing partner of Ursula Capital Partners, as a Director. Mr. Englander will join the Board immediately and also stand for election at the Company’s 2014 annual meeting.  “Dan brings an experienced independent investor and financial perspective to our Board,” said John W. Ballantine, Chairman of the Healthways Board. “He has been an investor in Healthways since 2005, knows our business well and understands the markets for our well-being improvement solutions. We look forward to working with him as he provides additional strategic, financial and public markets insight into the Board’s deliberations.”  Mr. Englander, 44, founded Ursula Capital Partners, a New York City-based investment firm, in 2004 and currently serves as its managing partner.

What Makes Us Different?
Property Data + People Data
Our reports include the traditional info you’d expect to find about a property (ownership, deeds, tax info, etc.), but we dig deeper and offer background records on people too.
Find criminal background records on owners, registered sex offenders in the neighborhood, and more.










The Extras We Include, for FREE


Run criminal background checks on previous owners, their associates, or the neighbors. Get to know the whole story.



Know your new neighborhood by seeing sex offender information, which may include names, addresses, and criminal convictions.



Easy to use reporting. Just enter an address, a name, or even a phone number and we will give you all the information we have.

See what people like you are saying about BeenVerified







Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"

Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."

U.S. News & World Report
