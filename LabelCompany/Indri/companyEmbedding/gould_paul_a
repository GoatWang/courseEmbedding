Paul Gould
Senior Designer








As an expert user experience (UX) practitioner, Paul designs coherent, compelling interactions and experiences that people use with confidence and satisfaction. 
Paul leads projects and builds relationships with clients across many domains including: banking, healthcare, energy, defense, government, industrial controls, consumer products, education and non-profit. He works with clients to properly frame problems, identify and address internal politics, manage risk, and get traction early on projects that often involve complex information and challenges of scale.
He also serves as a lead instructor for LUMA Institute—a MAYA spinoff—where he teaches people how to apply human-centered design methods as a way to collaborate effectively and to advance innovative practices within their teams and organizations.
Paul often speaks at conferences and workshops about the intersection of business, design and human experience. He also contributed to Exposing the Magic of Design: A Practitioner’s Guide to the Methods and Theory of Synthesis, published by Oxford University Press.

My Superpower
Lateral and abstract thinking, plus a side dose of improvisation.
Quote That Inspires Me
“There’s only one rule that I know of, babies—God damn it, you’ve got to be kind.”
-Kurt Vonnegut
Books I Love
My childhood public library was my second home—an old mansion with nooks and fireplaces and dark wood. I loved the high-fidelity, high-bandwidth experience of being surrounded by the entire collection. Those books in that environment lured me into a life of curious and creative inquiry outside the confines of my own head.
Movies I Love
I have a weakness for old black and white movies from the 1930s and 40s and I enjoy the widescreen Technicolor-era mastery of Hitchcock. But what sticks in my head are files such as Terry Gilliam’s Brazil for the tragicomic, disturbingly plausible future in which things are malignantly extended to their logical and hilarious/terrible conclusions.
Earliest Memory of Using Something High-Tech
I was fascinated by my dad’s cameras and audio equipment, particularly the satisfying clicks of the switches and buttons and the warm lighting of the dials and level meters. My earliest computing experiences involved using a comb to slip the lock of my middle school earth science teacher’s classroom before school so that I could use his TRS-80. I taught myself BASIC so that I could make Star Wars games.
