Atlas Travel® Insurance 
Get Quote Apply Online








For international travel, Atlas Travel® Insurance provides customizable coverage for travelers looking to cover specific needs while abroad.
International travel can represent financial risk. The benefits of many standard medical insurance policies do not apply beyond the borders of your home country. An Atlas Travel® Insurance
                                        plan can be the difference between a trip ruined by unexpected illness or injury, versus a trip with access to quality care and financial help if the unexpected strikes.
HCC has developed two Atlas Travel® plans that offer a complete package of international benefits available 24 hours a day. Atlas America® provides coverage for non-U.S. citizens traveling outside their home country while Atlas International provides coverage for US citizens traveling outside their home country.
Important things you should know about Atlas Visitors Insurance
There are many different types of insurance policies that are around today, but one of the best ones you can try out is the Atlas America Visitor Insurance policy. The medical insurance policy is available to visitors in the United States, as well as all foreign tourists who are traveling to the United States for business or for leisure. There is massive demand for this travel insurance package, because it is available for new immigrants in the United States, as well as international students, and overseas travelers as well.

Pre-existing conditions — charges resulting directly or indirectly from any pre-existing condition, as herein defined, are excluded from this insurance unless it is a sudden and unexpected outbreak or recurrence that is of short duration and requires urgent care. Under Atlas Travel®, no coverage is available for known, scheduled, required, or expected medical care, drugs, or treatments existent or necessary prior to the effective date of coverage.
Routine medical examinations
Routine pre-natal care, pregnancy, child birth, and post-natal care

Does Atlas Travel® provide any coverage while I am in my home country?
Atlas Travel® does offer medical expense coverage in your home country in the following situations:

                                                Benefit Period –Atlas Travel® will cover eligible medical expenses in the member’s home country for 90 days after the beginning of treatment so long as the related illness or injury began while the certificate was still in effect and treatment began while the member was outside their home country.

                                                Incidental Home Country Coverage – For U.S. citizens, medical expenses are only covered during incidental trips home totaling no more than 15 days per three-month period of coverage. Incidental visit time must be used within the three-month period earned, and the member must continue his or her international trip in order to be eligible for this benefit. Medical expenses for non-U.S. citizens will be covered up to a maximum of 30 days for any three-month period. Medical expenses incurred in your home country will not be covered if your purpose for returning to your home country is to obtain treatment of an illness or injury that began while traveling. 
Will Atlas Travel® cover me on trips of a year or longer?

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The discussion and analysis presented below provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which contains our financial statements.  The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements were made. The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those made, projected or implied in the forward-looking statements. We believe the assumptions underlying the financial statements are reasonable. However, our financial statements included herein may not necessarily reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the future.  BUSINESS OVERVIEW  Atlas America Series 25-2004 (B) L.P. ("we", "us" or the "Partnership") is a Delaware limited partnership and formed on January 21, 2004 with Atlas Resources, LLC serving as its Managing General Partner and Operator ("Atlas Resources" or the "MGP"). Atlas Resources is an indirect subsidiary of Atlas Resource Partners, L.P. ("ARP") 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    ARP, +0.00%
 On February 27, 2015, the MGP's ultimate parent, Atlas Energy, L.P. ("Atlas Energy"), which was a publicly traded master-limited partnership, was acquired by Targa Resources Corp. and distributed to Atlas Energy's unitholders 100% of the limited liability company interests in ARP's general partner, Atlas Energy Group, LLC ("Atlas Energy Group"; OTCQX: ATLS). Atlas Energy Group became a separate, publicly traded company and the ultimate parent of the MGP as a result of the distribution. Following the distribution, Atlas Energy Group continues to manage ARP's operations and activities through its ownership of the ARP's general partner interest.  The Partnership has drilled and currently operates wells located in Pennsylvania, Tennessee and West Virginia. The Partnership has no employees and relies on the MGP for management, which in turn, relies on its parent company, Atlas Energy Group (February 27, 2015 and prior, Atlas Energy), for administrative services.  The Partnership's operating cash flows are generated from its wells, which produce natural gas and oil. Produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated and/or third-party gas gathering systems. The Partnership intends to produce its wells until they are depleted or become uneconomical to produce at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold. The Partnership does not expect to drill additional wells and expects no additional funds will be required for drilling.  The economic viability of the Partnership's production is based on a variety of factors including proved developed reserves that it can expect to recover through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of additional required extraction equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well; and through currently installed extraction equipment and related infrastructure which is operational at the time of the reserves estimate (if the extraction is by means not involving drilling, completing or reworking a well). There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proven reserves and in projecting future net revenues.  The prices at which the Partnership's natural gas and oil will be sold are uncertain and the Partnership is not guaranteed a specific natural gas price for the sale of its natural gas production. Changes in natural gas and oil prices have a significant impact on the Partnership's cash flow and the value of its reserves. Lower natural gas and oil prices may not only decrease the Partnership's revenues, but also may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that the Partnership can produce economically.  Historically, there has been no need to borrow funds from the MGP to fund operations as the cash flow from our operations has been adequate to fund our obligations and distributions to our partners. However, the recent significant declines in commodity prices have challenged our ability to fund our operations and may make it uneconomical to produce our wells until they are depleted, as we originally intended. Accordingly, the MGP determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The MGP intends as necessary, to continue our operations and to fund our obligations for at least the next twelve months. The MGP has concluded that such undertaking is sufficient to alleviate the doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.  The following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. Our operating cash flows are generated from our wells, which primarily produce natural gas, but also some oil. Our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated and/or third-party gas gathering systems. Our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production. We pay our MGP, as operator, a monthly well supervision fee, which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as:  ? Well tending, routine maintenance and adjustment;  ? Reading meters, recording production, pumping, maintaining appropriate books and records; and  ? Preparation of reports for us and government agencies.  The well supervision fees, however, do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment, materials and brine disposal. If these expenses are incurred, we pay cost for third-party services, materials and a competitive charge for service performed directly by our MGP or its affiliates. Also, beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production, our MGP, as operator, may retain $200 per month, per well, to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well. As of December 31, 2015, our MGP withheld $322,300 of net production revenue for this purpose.  MARKETS AND COMPETITION  The availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us, and the price obtained, depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production, imports of foreign natural gas and oil, political instability or terrorist acts in gas and oil producing countries and regions, market demand, competition from other energy sources, the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce, other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity, availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities. Our MGP is responsible for selling our production. During 2015 and 2014, we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil. Product availability and price are the principal means of competing in selling natural gas and oil production. While it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry, we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry.  Natural Gas. The MGP markets the majority of our natural gas production to gas marketers directly or to third-party plant operators who process and market the gas. The sales price of natural gas produced is a function of the market in the area and typically tied to a regional index. The production area and pricing indices for the Appalachian Basin are Dominion South Point, Tennessee Gas Pipeline and Transco Leidy Line, Columbia Appalachia, NYMEX and Transco Zone 5.  We do not hold firm transportation obligations on any pipeline that requires payment of transportation fees regardless of natural gas production volumes. As is customary in certain of our other operating areas, we occasionally commit a predictable portion of monthly production to the purchaser in order to maintain a gathering agreement.  Crude Oil. Crude oil produced from our wells flows directly into leasehold storage tanks where it is picked up by an oil company or a common carrier acting for an oil company. The crude oil is typically sold at the prevailing spot market price for each region, less appropriate trucking charges. We do not have delivery commitments for fixed and determinable quantities of crude oil in any future periods under existing contracts or agreements.  Natural Gas Liquids. NGLs are extracted from the natural gas stream by processing and fractionation plants enabling the remaining "dry" gas to meet pipeline specifications for transport to end users or marketers operating on the receiving pipeline. The resulting dry natural gas is sold as described above and our NGLs are generally priced using the Mont Belvieu (TX) or Conway (KS) regional processing indices. The cost to process and fractionate the NGLs from the gas stream is typically either a volumetric fee for the gas and liquids processed or a volumetric retention by the processing and fractionation facility. We do not have delivery commitments for fixed and determinable quantities of NGLs in any future periods under existing contracts or agreements.  For the year ended December 31, 2015, Chevron Natural Gas and Atmos Energy Marketing, LLC accounted for approximately 60% and 10%, respectively of our total natural gas, oil and NGL production revenues, with no other single customer accounting for more than 10% of revenues for this period.  GENERAL TRENDS AND OUTLOOK  We expect our business to be affected by the following key trends. Our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results.  The natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids commodity price markets have suffered significant declines during the fourth quarter of 2014 and throughout 2015. The causes of these declines are based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, a significant increase in natural gas, oil and NGL production. While we anticipate continued high levels of exploration and production activities over the long-term in the areas in which we operate, fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments in the development of new natural gas, oil and NGL reserves.  Our future gas and oil reserves, production, cash flow, and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders, depend on our success in producing our current reserves efficiently. We face the challenge of natural production declines and volatile natural gas, oil and NGL prices. As initial reservoir pressures are depleted, natural gas and oil production from particular wells decreases.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  GAS AND OIL PRODUCTION: The following table sets forth information related to our production revenues, volumes, sales prices, production costs and depletion during the periods indicated:   Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 Production revenues (in thousands): Gas $ 291 $ 769 Oil 43 97 Liquids 6 26 Total $ 340 $ 892 Production volumes: Gas (mcf/day) 480 577 Oil (bbls/day) 2 3 Liquids (bbls/day) 1 1 Total (mcfe/day) 498 601 Average sales price: (1) Gas (per mcf) (2) $ 1.66 $ 3.69 Oil (per bbl) $ 48.91 $ 89.86 Liquids (per bbl) $ 18.70 $ 49.95 Production costs: As a percent of revenues 144 % 79 % Per mcfe $ 2.68 $ 3.21 Depletion per mcfe $ 0.37 $ 1.25  (1) Average sales prices represent accrual basis pricing after reversing the effect of previously recognized gains resulting from prior period impairment charges.  (2) Average gas prices are calculated by including in total revenue derivative gains previously recognized into income in connection with prior period impairment charges and dividing by the total volume for the period. Previously recognized derivative gains were $8,700 for the year ended December 31, 2014.  Natural Gas Revenues. Our natural gas revenues were $291,300 and $769,400 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $478,100 (62%). The $478,100 decrease in natural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year was attributable to a $348,900 decrease in natural gas prices after the effect of financial hedges, which were driven by market conditions, and a $129,200 decrease in production volumes. Our production volumes decreased to 480 mcf per day for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 577 mcf per day for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of 97 (17%) mcf per day. The price we receive for our natural gas is primarily a result of the index driven agreements (see item 1:"Business-Contractual Revenue Arrangements"). Thus, the price we receive for our natural gas may vary significantly each month as the underlying index changes in response to market conditions. The decrease in production volumes is mostly due to the normal decline inherent in the life of the wells in addition to wells shut-in due to it being uneconomical to continue production in the current pricing environment.  Oil Revenues. We drilled wells primarily to produce natural gas, rather than oil, but some wells have limited oil production. Our oil revenues were $42,800 and $96,700 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $53,900 (56%). The $53,900 decrease in oil revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year was attributable to a $35,800 decrease in oil prices and a $18,100 decrease in production volumes. Our production volumes decreased to 2.40 bbls per day for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 2.95 bbls per day for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of 0.55 bbl per day (19%).  Natural Gas Liquids Revenue. The majority of our wells produce "dry gas", which is composed primarily of methane and requires no additional processing before being transported and sold to the purchaser. Some wells, however, produce "wet gas", which contains larger amounts of ethane and other associated hydrocarbons (i.e. "natural gas liquids") that must be removed prior to transporting the gas. Once removed, these natural gas liquids are sold to various purchasers. Our natural gas liquids revenues were $5,600 and $25,500 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $19,900 (78%). The $19,900 decrease in liquid revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year was attributable to a $10,500 decrease in production volumes, and a $9,400 decrease in liquid prices. Our production volumes were 0.82 and 1.40 bbls per day for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of 0.58 (41%) bbl per day.  Gain on Mark-to-Market Derivatives. On January 1, 2015, we discontinued hedge accounting for our qualified commodity derivatives. As such, subsequent changes in fair value of these derivatives are recognized immediately within gain on mark-to-market derivatives on our statements of operations. The fair values of these commodity derivative instruments as of December 31, 2014, which were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income within partners' capital on our balance sheet, will be reclassified to our statements of operations in the future at the time the originally hedged physical transactions settle.  We recognized a gain on mark-to-market derivatives of $12,900 for the year ended December 31, 2015. This gain was due primarily to mark-to-market gains in the current year primarily related to the change in natural gas prices during the year. There were no gains or losses on mark-to-market derivatives during the year ended December 31, 2014.  Costs and Expenses. Production expenses were $488,000 and $706,900 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $218,900 (31%). This decrease was a result of lower transportation expenses due to lower natural gas sales prices and production volumes as wells were shut-in due to being uneconomical in the current pricing environment.  Depletion of our gas and oil properties as a percentage of gas and oil revenues was 20% and 31% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This change was primarily attributable to changes in gas and oil reserve quantities and to a lesser extent revenues, product prices and production volumes and changes in the depletable cost basis of gas and oil properties.  General and administrative expenses were $132,800 and $145,400 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $12,600 (9%). These expenses include third-party costs for services as well as the monthly administrative fees charged by our MGP and vary from period to period due to the costs and services provided to us.  Impairment of gas and oil properties during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, were $763,300 and $2,334,600, respectively. At least annually, we compare the carrying value of our proved developed gas and oil producing properties to their estimated fair market value. To the extent our carrying value exceeds the estimated fair market value, an impairment charge is recognized. As a result of this assessment, an impairment charge was recognized during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. This charge is based on reserve quantities, future market prices and our carrying value. We cannot provide any assurance that similar charges may or may not be taken in future periods.  Liquidity and Capital Resources. We are generally limited to the amount of funds generated by the cash flow from our operations to fund our obligations and make distributions to our partners.  The natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids commodity price markets have suffered significant declines during the fourth quarter of 2014 and throughout 2015. The extreme ongoing volatility in the energy industry and commodity prices will likely continue to impact our outlook. We have experienced downward revisions of our natural gas and oil reserves volumes and values due to the significant declines in commodity prices. Our MGP continues to implement various cost saving measures to reduce our operating and general and administrative costs, including renegotiating contracts with contractors, suppliers and service providers, reducing the number of staff and contractors and deferring and eliminating discretionary costs. Our MGP will continue to be opportunistic and aggressive in managing our cost structure and, in turn, our liquidity to meet our operating needs. To the extent commodity prices remain low or decline further, or we experience other disruptions in the industry, our ability to fund our operations and make distributions may be further impacted, and could result in the MGP's decision to liquidate our operations.  Historically, there has been no need to borrow funds from the MGP to fund operations as the cash flow from our operations has been adequate to fund our obligations and distributions to our partners. However, the recent significant declines in commodity prices have challenged our ability to fund our operations and may make it uneconomical to produce our wells until they are depleted, as we originally intended. Accordingly, the MGP determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The MGP intends as necessary, to continue our operations and to fund our obligations for at least the next twelve months. The MGP has concluded that such undertaking is sufficient to alleviate the doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.  If, however, the MGP were to decide to liquidate our operations, the liquidation valuation of the Partnership's assets and liabilities would be determined by an independent expert. It is possible that based on such determination, we would not be able to make any liquidation distributions to our limited partners. A liquidation could result in the transfer of the post-liquidation assets and liabilities of the Partnership to the MGP and would occur without any further contributions from or distributions to the limited partners.  There was no cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash provided by operating activities were $152,200 the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was due to a decrease in net earnings before depletion, net non-cash (gain) loss on derivative value, impairment, and accretion of $325,600, a decrease in the change in asset retirement receivable-affiliate of $289,700, a decrease in accounts receivable trade-affiliate of $139,100, a decrease in accrued liabilities of $2,000, partially offset by an increase in the change in accounts payable trade-affiliate of $550,200, an increase in the change in the amounts payable to limited partners of $53,900, and an increase in the change in asset retirement obligation settled of $100, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.  There was no cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015. The cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $200 resulting from the sale of tangible equipment.  There was no cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash used in financing activities was $169,700 for the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was due to a decrease in cash distributions to partners.  Our MGP may withhold funds for future plugging and abandonment costs. Through December 31, 2015, our MGP has withheld $322,300 of funds for this purpose. Any additional funds, if required, will be obtained from production revenues or borrowings from our MGP or its affiliates, which are not contractually committed to make loans to us. The amount that we may borrow at any one time may not at any time exceed 5% of our total subscriptions, and we will not borrow from third-parties.  Impairment  During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized impairment expense of $763,300 and $2,334,600, respectively, related to gas and oil properties being in excess of our estimate of their fair value at December 31, 2015 and 2014. The estimate of fair value of these gas and oil properties was impacted by, among other factors, the deterioration of natural gas and oil prices.  ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION  Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the release of regulated materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection or human health or safety (see "Item 1:  Environmental laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last 25 years, and we anticipate that such changes will continue. Trends in environmental regulation include increased reporting obligations and placing more restrictions and limitations on operations, such as emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants; generation and disposal of wastes, including wastes that may have technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive materials; and use, storage and handling of chemical substances that may impact human health, the environment and/or threatened or endangered species. Other increasingly stringent environmental restrictions and limitations have resulted in increased operating costs for us and other similar businesses throughout the United States. It is possible that the costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations may continue to increase. We will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and to plan accordingly, but there can be no assurance that we will identify and properly anticipate each such change, or that our efforts will prevent material costs, if any, from rising.  CHANGES IN PRICES AND INFLATION  Our revenues and the value of our assets have been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas and oil market prices. Natural gas and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict.  Inflation affects the operating expenses of our operations. Inflationary trends may occur if commodity prices were to increase, since such an increase may cause the demand for energy equipment and services to increase, thereby increasing the costs of acquiring or obtaining such equipment and services. While we anticipate that inflation will affect our future operating costs, we cannot predict the timing or amounts of any such effects.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of actual revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results may differ from the estimates on which our financial statements are prepared at any given point of time. Changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include revenue and expense accruals, depletion and amortization, impairment, fair value of derivative instruments and the probability of forecasted transactions. We summarize our significant accounting policies within our financial statements (see "item 8:Financial Statements") included in this . . .  Apr 15, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED)  Forward-Looking Statements  When used in this Form 10-Q, the words "believes", "anticipates," "expects" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results stated or implied in this document. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to forward-looking statements which we may make to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Form 10-Q or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.  General  Atlas America Series 25-2004 (B) L.P. ("we", "us" or the "Partnership") is a Delaware limited partnership, formed on January 21, 2004 with Atlas Resources, LLC serving as its Managing General Partner and Operator ("Atlas Resources" or the "MGP"). Atlas Resources is an indirect subsidiary of Atlas Resource Partners, L.P. ("ARP") 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    ARP, +0.00%
 On February 27, 2015, the MGP's ultimate parent, Atlas Energy, L.P. ("Atlas Energy"), which was a publicly traded master-limited partnership, was acquired by Targa Resources Corp. and distributed to Atlas Energy's unitholders 100% of the limited liability company interests in ARP's general partner, Atlas Energy Group, LLC ("Atlas Energy Group"; NYSE: ATLS). Atlas Energy Group became a separate, publicly traded company and the ultimate parent of the MGP as a result of the distribution. Following the distribution, Atlas Energy Group continues to manage ARP's operations and activities through its ownership of the ARP's general partner interest.  We have drilled and currently operate wells located in Pennsylvania, Tennessee and West Virginia. We have no employees and rely on our MGP for management, which in turn, relies on its parent company, Atlas Energy Group (February 27, 2015 and prior, Atlas Energy), for administrative services.  We intend to continue to produce our wells until they are depleted or become uneconomical to produce, at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold. We expect that no other wells will be drilled and no additional funds will be required for drilling.  Overview  The following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. Our operating cash flows are generated from our wells, which produce primarily natural gas, but also some oil. Our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated and/or third-party gas gathering systems. Our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production. We pay our MGP, as operator, a monthly well supervision fee, which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as:  � well tending, routine maintenance and adjustment;  � reading meters, recording production, pumping, maintaining appropriate books and records; and  � preparation of reports for us and government agencies.  The well supervision fees, however, do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment, materials and brine disposal. If these expenses are incurred, we pay cost for third-party services, materials and a competitive charge for services performed directly by our MGP or its affiliates. Also, beginning one year after each of our wells have been placed into production, our MGP, as operator, may retain $200 per month, per well, to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well. As of June 30, 2015, our MGP has withheld $118,300 of net production revenues for this purpose.  Markets and Competition  The availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us, and the price obtained, depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production, imports of foreign natural gas and oil, political instability or terrorist acts in gas and oil producing countries and regions, market demand, competition from other energy sources, the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce, other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity, availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities. Our MGP is responsible for selling our production. During 2014 and the first six months of 2015, we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil. Product availability and price are the principal means of competing in selling natural gas and oil production. While it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry, we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry.  Results of Operations The following table sets forth information relating to our production revenues, volumes, sales prices, production costs and depletion during the periods indicated: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2015 2014 2015 2014 Production revenues (in thousands): Gas $ 58 $ 273 $ 172 $ 536 Oil 13 6 30 30 Liquids 1 4 3 16 Total $ 72 $ 283 $ 205 $ 582 Production volumes: Gas (Mcf/day) (1) 411 650 462 607 Oil (bbl/day) (1) 2 1 3 2 Liquids (bbl/day) (1) - 1 1 2 Total (Mcfe/day) (1) 423 662 486 631 Average sales prices: (2) Gas (per Mcf) (1) (3) $ 1.55 $ 4.67 $ 2.06 $ 4.92 Oil (per bbl) (1) $ 64.48 $ 101.53 $ 56.58 $ 93.34 Liquids (per bbl) (1) $ 13.55 $ 37.83 $ 22.98 $ 54.79 Production costs: As a percent of revenues 170 % 71 % 130 % 66 % Per Mcfe (1) $ 3.14 $ 3.36 $ 3.05 $ 3.39 Depletion per Mcfe $ 0.54 $ 0.89 $ 0.50 $ 0.87  (1) "Mcf" represents thousand cubic feet, "Mcfe" represents thousand cubic feet equivalent, and "bbl" represents barrels. Bbl is converted to Mcfe using the ratio of six Mcfs to one bbl.  (2) Average sales prices represent accrual basis pricing after adjusting for the effect of previously recognized gains resulting from prior period impairment charges.  (3) Average gas prices are calculated by including in total revenue derivative gains previously recognized into income in connection with prior period impairment charges and dividing by the total volume for the period. Previously recognized derivative gains were $2,900 for the three months ended June 30, 2014. Previously recognized derivative gains were $4,300 for the six months ended June 30, 2014.  Natural Gas Revenues. Our natural gas revenues were $58,100 and $273,500 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $215,400 (79%). The $215,400 decrease in natural gas revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $114,600 decrease in our natural gas sales prices after the effect of financial hedges, which were driven by market conditions, and a $100,800 decrease in production volumes. Our production volumes decreased to 411 Mcf per day for the three months ended June 30, 2015 from 650 Mcf per day for the three months ended June 30, 2014, a decrease of 239 Mcf per day (37%). The overall decrease in natural gas production volumes for the three months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the prior year similar period resulted primarily from the normal decline inherent in the life of a well and a decrease in the number of producing wells due to wells shut-in due to a decline in natural gas prices.  Our natural gas revenues were $172,000 and $536,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $364,000 (68%). The $364,000 decrease in natural gas revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $235,400 decrease in our natural gas sales prices after the effect of financial hedges, which were driven by market conditions, and a $128,600 decrease in production volumes. Our production volumes decreased to 462 Mcf per day for the six months ended June 30, 2015 from 607 Mcf per day for the six months ended June 30, 2014, a decrease of 145 Mcf per day (24%). The overall decrease in natural gas production volumes for the six months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the prior year similar period resulted primarily from the normal decline inherent in the life of a well and a decrease in the number of producing wells due to wells shut-in due to a decline in natural gas prices.  Oil Revenues. We drill wells primarily to produce natural gas, rather than oil, but some wells have limited oil production. Our oil revenues were $13,000 and $5,600 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, an increase of $7,400 (132%). The $7,400 increase in oil revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $15,000 increase in production volumes, partially offset by a $7,600 decrease in oil prices. Our production volumes increased to 2.22 bbls per day for the three months ended June 30, 2015 from 0.60 bbls per day for the three months ended June 30, 2014, an increase of 1.62 bbls per day (270%).  Our oil revenues were $29,500 and $30,200 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $700 (2%). The $700 decrease in oil revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to an $18,500 increase in production volumes, partially offset by a $19,200 decrease in oil prices. Our production volumes increased to 2.88 bbls per day for the six months ended June 30, 2015 from 1.79 bbls per day for the six months ended June 30, 2014, an increase of 1.09 bbls per day (61%).  Natural Gas Liquids Revenue. The majority of our wells produce "dry gas", which is composed primarily of methane and requires no additional processing before being transported and sold to the purchaser. Some wells, however, produce "wet gas", which contains larger amounts of ethane and other associated hydrocarbons (i.e. "natural gas liquids") that must be removed prior to transporting the gas. Once removed, these natural gas liquids are sold to various purchasers. Our natural gas liquids revenues were $500 and $3,700 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $3,200 (86%). The $3,200 decrease in liquid revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributed to a $2,300 decrease in production volumes and a $900 decrease in natural gas liquid prices. Our production volumes decreased to 0.39 bbls per day for the three months ended June 30, 2015 from 1.09 bbls per day for the three months ended June 30, 2014, a decrease of 0.70 bbls per day (64%).  Our natural gas liquids revenues were $2,600 and $15,700 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $13,100 (83%). The $13,100 decrease in natural gas liquids revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $9,500 decrease in production volumes and a $3,600 decrease in natural gas liquid prices. Our production volumes decreased to 0.63 bbls per day for the six months ended June 30, 2015 from 1.58 bbls per day for the six months ended June 30, 2014, a decrease of 0.95 bbls per day (60%).  Costs and Expenses. Production expenses were $121,800 and $202,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $80,200 (40%). Production expenses were $266,200 and $385,300 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $119,100 (31%). The decreases for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 were mostly due to a decrease in well supervision fees and a decrease in transportation fees. The lower transportation fees were a result of lower revenues.  Depletion of oil and gas properties as a percentage of oil and gas revenues was 29% and 19% for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and 22% and 17% for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These percentage changes are directly attributable to changes in revenues, oil and gas reserve quantities, product prices and production volumes and changes in the depletable cost basis of oil and gas properties.  General and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were $33,200 and $33,100, respectively, an increase of $100 (0.3%). For the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, these expenses were $69,200 and $71,600, respectively, a decrease of $2,400 (3%). These expenses include third-party costs for services as well as the monthly administrative fees charged by our MGP. The changes for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 are primarily due to third-party costs as compared to the prior year similar periods.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Cash provided by operating activities decreased $91,100 in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $0 as compared to $91,100 for the six months ended June 30, 2014. This decrease was mostly due to a decrease in net income before a net non-cash loss on derivative value, depletion and accretion of $262,300, a decrease in the change in asset retirement receivable-affiliate of $97,000, and a decrease in the change in accrued liabilities of $2,800. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in accounts payable trade-affiliate of $205,600, and an increase in the change in accounts receivable trade-affiliate of $55,700, and the change in limited partner payable of $9,600 and the change in asset retirement obligations settled of $100 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2014.  Cash used in financing activities was $108,400 for the six months ended June 30, 2014. This was due to cash distributions to partners. There was no cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2015.  Our MGP may withhold funds for future plugging and abandonment costs. Through June 30, 2015, our MGP has withheld $118,300 of funds for this purpose. Any additional funds, if required, will be obtained from production revenues or borrowings from our MGP or its affiliates, which are not contractually committed to make loans to us. The amount that we may borrow at any one time may not at any time exceed 5% of our total subscriptions, and we will not borrow from third-parties.  We are generally limited to the amount of funds generated by the cash flows from our operations, which we believe is adequate to fund future operations and distributions to our partners. Historically, there has been no need to borrow funds from our MGP to fund operations.  Critical Accounting Policies  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to our asset retirement obligations, depletion and certain accrued receivables and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of significant accounting policies we have adopted and followed in the preparation of our financial statements is included within "Notes to Financial Statements" in Part I, Item 1, "Financial Statements" in this quarterly report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.

	P.

	report;












	3.  





	Based
	on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information
	included in this report, fairly present in all material respects

	report;












	4.  





	The

	15d-15(e)):












	a)  





	Designed
	such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure
	controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to

	by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
	which
	this report is being prepared;









	b)  





	Designed
	such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal

	to
	materially affect, the registrant’s internal control over financial
	reporting; and












	5.  





	The
	registrant’s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our
	most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting,
	to
	the registrant’s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant’s
	board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent
	functions):












	a)  





	All
	significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
	operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
	reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant’s ability to record,
	process, summarize and report financial information;
	and









	b)  





	Any
	fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
	employees who have a significant role in the registrant’s internal control
	over financial reporting.

Atlas Travel® Insurance
                    Comprehensive plan without sub limits













Atlas Travel® Insurance 
Get Quote Apply Online








For international travel, Atlas Travel® Insurance provides customizable coverage for travelers looking to cover specific needs while abroad.
International travel can represent financial risk. The benefits of many standard medical insurance policies do not apply beyond the borders of your home country. An Atlas Travel® Insurance
                                        plan can be the difference between a trip ruined by unexpected illness or injury, versus a trip with access to quality care and financial help if the unexpected strikes.
HCC has developed two Atlas Travel® plans that offer a complete package of international benefits available 24 hours a day. Atlas America® provides coverage for non-U.S. citizens traveling outside their home country while Atlas International provides coverage for US citizens traveling outside their home country.
Important things you should know about Atlas Visitors Insurance
There are many different types of insurance policies that are around today, but one of the best ones you can try out is the Atlas America Visitor Insurance policy. The medical insurance policy is available to visitors in the United States, as well as all foreign tourists who are traveling to the United States for business or for leisure. There is massive demand for this travel insurance package, because it is available for new immigrants in the United States, as well as international students, and overseas travelers as well.

Finally taking that trip you’ve always dreamed of to the United States? Whether you’re planning to travel solo or with your family for work, school, or pleasure, you’re probably equal parts excited and stressed.
For international visitors unfamiliar with the U.S. healthcare system, questions of health and safety can be a major source of travel anxiety. Would you be able to seek treatment if you suffered an injury or unexpected illness while exploring the country? Would your medical expenses be covered by your home country health insurance policy?
If the answer to either of these questions is no, then it’s time to explore your travel medical insurance options.
What is Atlas America insurance?
Atlas America is a travel medical insurance policy for non-U.S. citizens and residents visiting the United States. Available to individuals, families, and groups, Atlas America insurance can cover individuals from most countries who are at least 14 days old and traveling to the U.S. from abroad.
Policies must cover a minimum of 5 days, though you do not have to travel all 5 days to be eligible for coverage. Coverage is available up to 364 days.

Why do I need insurance for my trip to the U.S.?
Your home country health insurance policy may not cover you across international lines – or it may provide very limited international coverage. And in the United States, people are responsible for their own healthcare costs, meaning you’ll be financially responsible for any medical expenses stemming from an unexpected illness or injury.
According to healthcare.gov, a broken leg can cost up to $7,500 to fix in the United States, and the average cost of a 3-day hospital stay is around $30,000.
Travel medical insurance, as noted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), can reduce “the cost of a medical emergency" and the resulting “financial burden on travelers" by providing access to quality care and financial help if the unexpected occurs as you travel throughout the United States.
It can also serve as evidence that you’ll be able to pay for medical expenses incurred during your time in the U.S., which may be required if you need a visa to enter the country.


What benefits does Atlas America provide?
Atlas America insurance provides benefits for eligible medical expenses incurred in the U.S., including Hospital Room and Board, Local Ambulance, Emergency Medical Evacuation, Intensive Care Unit, and all other eligible costs.
It also provides supplemental travel benefits like Trip Interruption, Travel Delay, and Lost Checked Luggage.
Key features of Atlas America insurance include:

Up to $2,000,000 in maximum coverage per covered injury or illness and per certificate period
Your choice of deductible ranging from $0 to $2,500 per certificate period
Coinsurance at 80% of the next $5,000 of eligible expenses after the deductible, then 100% to the maximum coverage limit. Within the Preferred Provider Network (PPO), coinsurance is waived and eligible expenses are paid at 100% after the deductible, up to the overall maximum.
Provider network with over 5,000 hospitals and more than 90,000 healthcare facilities throughout the U.S.
Free travel assistance services available in multiple languages 365 days a year

Other Atlas America highlights:

Accidental Death & Dismemberment (AD&D)
Repatriation of Remains
Political Evacuation

Personal Liability

Does Atlas America meet visa requirements?
As a USA visitor, you may need a visa in order to gain entry to the United States. Whether or not you’ll need a visa is determined by your country of citizenship. The type of visa you'll need is dependent on the purpose of your travel.
Here are just a few common USA visitor visa types:

Visitor Visa: For people coming to the U.S. for a short period of time – typically 6 months or less – to visit children or relatives, tour, or vacation
Temporary Worker Visa: For individuals coming to the U.S. for a fixed period of time to receive job training or perform short-term or seasonal work
J-1 Visa: For USA visitors enrolling in work-and-study-based exchange programs in order to teach, study, conduct research, or receive on-site job training in the U.S.

In order to be approved for your visa, you’ll need to fulfill visa requirements. While your visa may not require you to have travel medical insurance, it may require you to show proof of funds to cover expenses incurred in the United States.
One way to evidence these funds is to purchase a travel medical policy like Atlas America, which provides policyholders with a visa letter to serve as proof of medical coverage.
Atlas America also meets the minimum insurance requirements of a J-1 visa as established by the U.S. Department of State.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
