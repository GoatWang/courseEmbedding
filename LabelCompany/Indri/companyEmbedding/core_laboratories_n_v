Owen Oil Tools at a Glimpse 



Customer Focused 

Owen Oil Tools manufactures and distributes the industry’s most comprehensive line of advanced perforating systems focused on improving our customer’s return on investment. A perforating system is an energetic device that gets deployed into the well. Upon activation of the energetic device a pathway is created for oil and gas to flow from the formation into the wellbore and up to the surface, eventually making its way into the production stream.  
    


        We began operations in 1983 and became a member of Core Laboratories’ portfolio of oilfield operating divisions and technologies in 1998. We have a rich tradition in the oil patch carried out every day by our 500 talented, worldwide employees who work diligently satisfying customer needs. 
    


        Our products are manufactured in our Godley, Texas; Red Deer, Alberta and Standard, Alberta plants. They are supplied and supported through our vast distribution network with over 20 locations in North America and 10 global offices. In addition, Owen provides some of the best in class Thru-Tubing and Casing Patch products and services for remedial operations.
    


        Growth throughout our 30+ year history has been driven by our passion to understand customer needs and provide energetic solutions uniquely designed for their downhole challenges. We focus on reservoir optimization by adding proprietary technology engineered to increase production and lower costs as well as improve our clients’ wellsite efficiency. As the largest independent provider of advanced perforating systems, our success allows us to manufacture, supply and support customers in more than 60 countries with millions of energetic products and hundreds of thousands of feet of perforating carriers each year.  
    

Performance Driven

        Our leadership position in the perforating industry is significant and important to us. Maintaining and growing this position requires technological performance on many fronts. Our customers, employees, shareholders, and suppliers are all integral to our success. Acknowledging this and supporting a culture of technology innovation and continuous improvement, we have developed key initiatives to help guide us in the years ahead. They are: 
    



            Pursue Zero Accidents and Zero Defects
            Design and Provide Solutions with Differentiated Technology
            Grow Customer Participation through “Value-Added” Relationships
            Improve Manufacturing Throughput and Reduce the Cost to Manufacture




        As we work and progress together, it is our sincere desire to understand your specific needs and determine practical ways to utilize the many technological resources available at Core Laboratories to ensure our mutual success.

Petroleum Services is the world's largest and most technologically
            advanced independent provider of reservoir fluid and petrophysical services to the oil
            and gas industry.  We provide data and services that characterize the porous reservoir
            rock and all three reservoir fluids - gas, oil and water.
        
            The data sets provided by Core Lab's Reservoir Fluids services are used by oil companies
            to characterize the reservoir fluids, assist with reserve calculations and to enable
            maximum oil and gas recovery from the reservoir.
        

            Reservoir core analysis, both of the routine and advanced nature, is conducted on
            the porosity and permeability of the rock to determine the reservoir storage capacity
            and the ability of the fluids to flow through the rock.  These measurements are used to
            determine how much oil and gas are present in a reservoir and the rates at which the oil
            and gas can be produced.
        

            Our proprietary services and technologies are used to correlate the reservoir
            description data to wire line logs and seismic data by determining the different acoustic
            velocities of reservoir rocks containing water, oil and gas. These measurements can also be
            used in conjunction with Core Lab's Reservoir Description services to develop programs to
            produce more reservoir fluids from the reservoir.

        Core Laboratories N.V.: The Bear Case From a Bull
    


newsfeedback@fool.com (Matthew DiLallo)

Jul 10, 2017




























































































Core Laboratories (NYSE: CLB) is unabashedly bullish on its prospects. After a challenging past couple of years, the company expects a reversal of fortunes in the oil market this year, going so far as to predict that a "V-shaped" recovery would start taking hold that would drive its financial results higher as well. Fueling that forecast was Core's belief that the oil supplies were falling at such a rapid rate due to underinvestment that the market would soon become vastly undersupplied. That gap between supply and demand should push prices higher, which would drive a rebound in drilling activities.That said, while Core Labs makes a compelling case, there is one thing that could derail its recovery: an unexpectedly fierce rebound in U.S. shale production. Here's a look at how that might cause Core's recovery to fizzle out. Image source: Getty Images.
Drilling into the dataIn Core's first-quarter report, the company gave its regular update on the oil market. It noted that from July to December of last year that worldwide oil inventories fell by an average of 770,000 barrels per day due to underinvestment in new supplies by oil companies. Furthermore, it pointed out that starting in January, OPEC and cooperating non-members would cut their supplies by more than 1.3 million barrels per day. Add it up and Core anticipated that the market's undersupply could be more than 2 million barrels per day this year. As a result, Core expected that "the continued under-supply of crude oil should lead to extended worldwide inventory declines and a continuing rally in energy prices throughout 2017."However, more recent data from the International Energy Administration (IEA) showed quite the opposite occurring. In its June report, the IEA said that oil stockpiles ballooned by 18.6 million barrels, which pushed them 292 million barrels above the five-year average and higher than they were when OPEC announced its output cut. Fueling the oversupply was the fact that demand growth has been slower than expected at just 900,000 barrels per day, which is below the forecast of 1.3 million barrels per day. Meanwhile, supplies were up 1.25 million barrels per day in May, which was the highest annualized increase since February 2016. That surge in output was due to rising U.S. shale production as well as higher output from OPEC as a result of surging production from Libya and Nigeria, which are exempt from the OPEC output cuts. These factors have the potential to keep an oil market recovery at bay, especially if shale drilling continues to outpace expectations.  Image source: Getty Images.Coming back with a vengeanceShale producers have already unleashed an unexpectedly massive gusher of new oil production this year. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), America's oil production averaged 9.3 million barrels per day at the end of June, up 910,000 barrels a day from the year-ago period. More production growth is on the way according to the EIA's latest short-term forecast that the U.S. oil output will average 10 million barrels a day next year, which in its view could drive global oil inventories higher over the next year.One of the drivers of this growth is the fact that shale drillers are producing more oil for less money. For example, Permian Basin-focused driller Parsley Energy (NYSE: PE) expected to increase output by 70% this year to a range of 62,000-68,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) due to a combination of several acquisitions last year and organic drilling in 2017. However, thanks to better-than-expected well results in the first quarter, Parsley Energy increased its full-year production guidance by roughly 3,000 BOE/d or nearly 5% at the midpoint, without increasing its budget.
Leading shale driller Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN), likewise, delivered expectation-beating first-quarter output. In fact, Devon Energy's oil production exceeded the top end of its guidance range by 5,000 barrels per day thanks to better-than-expected well results. That kept Devon on track to deliver on its plan to boost output 13% to 17% by year-end.Because shale drillers are producing more oil per well, it's putting downward pressure on oil prices. Those lower prices could cause drillers, especially those with weaker balance sheets, to complete fewer wells this year. That situation could cause the industry to hit the brakes on drilling activities, which could impact the "V-shaped" recovery that Core Labs envisions for its financial results.Investor takeawayCore Labs firmly believes that the downturn in the oil industry and its financial performance are in the rearview mirror due to its perception that robust demand growth, when combined with falling supplies, will leave the industry undersupplied this year. While I believe its view is the right one, it isn't a slam dunk because shale drillers are producing more oil than anticipated due to a significant improvement in well productivity. If that trend keeps up, it's possible that Core's recovery could turn into a "W" instead of the "V" that bullish investors like me had hoped.

					Full Description



Core Laboratories N.V., incorporated on July 8, 1994, provides reservoir description, production enhancement and reservoir management services to the oil and gas industry. The Company operates through three segments: Reservoir Description, Production Enhancement and Reservoir Management. The Reservoir Description segment encompasses the characterization of petroleum reservoir rock, fluid and gas samples. It provides analytical and field services to characterize properties of crude oil and petroleum products to the oil and gas industry. The Production Enhancement segment includes products and services relating to reservoir well completions, perforations, stimulations and production. It provides integrated diagnostic services to evaluate the effectiveness of well completions and to develop solutions aimed at increasing the effectiveness of enhanced oil recovery projects. The Reservoir Management segment combines and integrates information from reservoir description and production enhancement services to increase production and recovery of oil and gas from its clients' reservoirs.Reservoir DescriptionThe Reservoir Description segment provides services that characterize the porous reservoir rock, and reservoir fluids, including natural gas, crude oil and water. Services relating to these fluids include determining quality and measuring quantity of the fluids and their derived products. This includes determining the value of crude oil and natural gases by analyzing the individual components of complex hydrocarbons. The Company measures these hydrocarbons at reservoir conditions to determine the changes in their physical properties with changing pressure and temperature. The Company analyzes samples of reservoir rocks for the porosity, which determines reservoir storage capacity, and for the permeability, which defines the ability of the fluids to flow through the rock. These measurements are used to determine how much oil and gas are present in a reservoir and the rates at which the oil and gas can be produced.The Company also uses its services and technologies to correlate the reservoir description data to wireline logs and seismic data by determining various acoustic velocities of reservoir rocks containing water, oil and natural gas. The Company offers Digital Rock Characteristics (DRC) services, which include Dual Energy CT, a non-destructive petro physical evaluation technique to provide early time insight of reservoir lithology and reservoir quality, and Micro CT, which is a resolution pore imaging service that provides early time quantification of both routine and special core analysis property. Its Iron Corehand is a unit designed to handle and move core in the field to eliminate the inherent risk of back injury and dropped core. The Company manufactures a range of ambient and reservoir condition rock and fluid analysis laboratory equipment for its own use. It also sells equipment of this type to universities, government institutes and client company research labs.Production EnhancementThe Company provides diagnostic services and products to help optimize completion and reservoir operations, and field development strategies. The Company provides services that are used by others to develop and optimize hydraulic fracturing and field flood projects, and to evaluate the success of these projects. The Company's data on rock type and strength are critical for determining the proper design of the hydraulic fracturing job. In addition, the Company's testing indicates whether the fluid slurry is compatible with the reservoir rock so that damage does not occur that would restrict production. The Company also provides testing of various propping agents and software to help pick the proppant based on net present value calculations of client investments. The Company's ZERO WASH tracer technology is used to determine that the proppant material is properly placed in the fracture.SPECTRACHEM is another technology offered by the Company for optimizing hydraulic fracture performance. SPECTRACHEM is used to aid operators in determining the efficiency of the fracture fluids used. SPECTRACHEM tracers allow operators to evaluate the quantity of fracture fluid that returns to the wellbore during the clean-up period after a hydraulic fracturing event. The Company also offers SPECTRACHEM Plus service. The Company's complete monitoring system, COMPLETION PROFILER, helps to determine flow rates from reservoir zones after they have been hydraulically fractured. Its FLOWPROFILER service is a hydrocarbon-based tracer technology, which employs a hydrocarbon-soluble tracer and water-soluble tracer introduced into specific and isolated stages through the stimulating proppant stream.The Company conducts dynamic flow tests of the reservoir fluids through the reservoir rock, at actual reservoir pressure and temperature, to simulate the actual flooding of a producing zone. The Company uses technologies, such as its Saturation Monitoring by the Attenuation of X-rays (SMAX), to help design the enhanced recovery project. The Company's PACKSCAN technology is used as a tool to evaluate gravel pack effectiveness in an unconsolidated reservoir. Its perforating systems include High Efficiency Reservoir Optimization (HERO), SUPERHERO and SUPERHERO Plus. It also offers HERO PerFRAC charges.Reservoir ManagementThe Company is involved in various large-scale reservoir management projects. The Company's industry consortium projects provide reservoir information to a range of clients. Its projects examine unconventional reservoirs, particularly in the United States and Canada. It has studies focused on tight sandstone reservoirs around the world and unconventional plays in the Middle East. The Company engineers and manufactures permanent monitoring equipment that is installed in the reservoir for its oil and gas company clients. The Company offers non-electronic ERD Pressure and Temperature sensors.

Earnings Release
Core Lab Reports First Quarter 2017 Results:
Core Laboratories N.V. ("CLB US" AND EURONEXT AMSTERDAM: "CLB NA") ("Core", "Core Lab", or the "Company") today reported first quarter 2017 results as summarized in the discussion below, which highlights certain GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures on a consolidated basis.
HIGHLIGHTS:
-- REVENUE OF $158 MILLION, UP MORE THAN 5% SEQUENTIALLY FROM 4Q 2016
• U.S. PRODUCTION ENHANCEMENT LAND REVENUE UP 32% SEQUENTIALLY; U.S. WELL COMPLETIONS UP 23%
-- GAAP EPS OF $0.40, EX-ITEMS EPS OF $0.42
-- FCF OF $23+ MILLION WAS 132% OF NET INCOME
-- FCF/REVENUE CONVERSION RATE OF 15%
• COMPANY GUIDES CONTINUED GROWTH FOR 2Q REVENUE, OPERATING EARNINGS AND EPS OF $0.48 TO $0.52
Core Laboratories reported first quarter 2017 revenue of $157,800,000, up more than 5% sequentially from its fourth quarter 2016 revenue, with operating income and net income of $23,200,000 and $17,700,000, respectively and earnings per diluted share ("EPS") of $0.40, all in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
Cores continuing efforts to streamline its business have led to a simplification of its reporting segment structure, and the Company will now present its operating results in two reporting segments: Reservoir Description and Production Enhancement.  As part of the streamlining of its business, Core incurred a one-time charge, which if excluded along with the impact of foreign exchange ("ex-items"), would yield an EPS of $0.42.  Operating income, ex-items, was $24,400,000, yielding operating margins of almost 16%. During the quarter, Core generated $23,300,000 of free cash flow ("FCF"), defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures.
The Company continues to benefit from increasing activity in the U.S. as Cores land revenue in its Production Enhancement segment increased 32% on a sequential quarterly basis which outpaced the sequential increases in U.S. well completions and rig count, which were up 23% and 25% respectively. This indicates increasing market penetration by Cores newly introduced HERO?PerFRAC technology and proprietary completions diagnostic services, demonstrating Production Enhancements strength as a technological leader in the North American up-cycle.
As reported in previous quarters, the Board of Supervisory Directors ("Board") of Core Laboratories N.V. has established an internal performance metric of achieving a relative performance return on invested capital ("ROIC") among the service companies listed as Cores peers by Bloomberg Financial ("Comp Group"). Based on Bloombergs calculations for the latest comparable data available, Cores ROIC is the highest of comparably sized companies in its oilfield service Comp Group.
Segment Highlights
Core Laboratories has realigned its operations and will begin reporting results under two segments: Reservoir Description and Production Enhancement. The financial statements that follow show the Companys results for the first quarters of 2017 and 2016 and fourth quarter of 2016 for comparison of sequential quarterly and year-over-year quarterly results.
Reservoir Description
Reservoir Description operations, which focus primarily on producing fields in international and offshore markets and an increasing number of reservoir fluid phase-behavior and crude oil characterization projects, reported first quarter 2017 revenue of $104,900,000, similar to prior quarter levels. Operating income, on a GAAP basis, was $15,900,000 with 15% margins, while, ex-items, it was $17,322,000, yielding operating margins of 17%.
The Company continues to increase the number of major enhanced oil recovery ("EOR") projects for unconventional reservoirs underway in various stages.  Several formations and different basins are under study with multiple clients. Core has determined that the EOR techniques most effective in unconventional reservoirs will differ greatly from EOR methods used in conventional reservoirs worldwide. The injection of miscible gases and the application of gas-adsorption techniques developed in Cores laboratories at in-situ reservoir pressures and temperatures have proved far superior to the pressurized physical movement of hydrocarbons using flood fronts that are typically employed in conventional fields.
Cycling of in-situ light hydrocarbon gases and the adsorption and capture of longer-chained hydrocarbons in unconventional reservoirs are leading to significant improvements in oil-recovery factors in Company laboratory tests. On average, unconventional reservoirs currently yield a recovery factor of approximately 9%. Light hydrocarbon gas injections, cycling, and adsorption efficiencies have yielded recoveries of up to 15% under laboratory-based, reservoir-condition testing parameters. Increased recovery factors applied to unconventional tight-oil reservoirs significantly raise client ROIC, FCF, and the net present value of their producing assets.
Crude oil characterization, distillation, and fractionation studies increased during the first quarter of 2017, as oil company clients continued to investigate ways to maximize yields through the refining process. And the Company continues to invest in technologies to improve yields and product blends for its clients, most recently through direct client access to real-time data from mobile devices.
During the quarter, the Company received sufficient support and industry commitments to initiate the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico II ("GOM II") joint industry project ("JIP"). The study will characterize Lower Tertiary reservoirs in the Alaminos Canyon, Keathley Canyon, and Walker Ridge areas of the deepwater GOM, among other areas.  In the study, the Company will utilize recently developed expert-guided machine learning technology to describe thousands of feet of core that will form the basis of the project. As has been the case for Cores JIPs over the past decade, the Company will reduce massive petrophysical, mineralogical, geochemical, and geomechanical data sets ("Big Data") via data analytics to quantify reservoir quality throughout the study area.
Production Enhancement
Production Enhancement operations, largely focused on unconventional reservoirs, benefited from increased U.S. land activity levels and posted significantly higher first quarter 2017 revenue, operating income, operating margins, and incremental margins compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Production Enhancement posted first quarter 2017 revenue of $52,900,000, up almost 20% sequentially, operating margins that increased 800 basis points to 14%, more than doubling the prior quarter, which created sequential quarterly incremental margins of more than 50%.  With U.S. land-based revenue for this segment up 32% on a sequential quarterly basis, Cores incremental growth outpaced the corresponding increased number of well completions and rig additions during the quarter.  The increase in sequential incremental margins provides evidence of Production Enhancements technological advantage and leverage to the North American up-cycle while the Company continues to maintain strict cost control.
Core Labs clients are using the Companys more technologically advanced products and services to further enhance their completion programs. Key examples are HERO?PerFRAC and FLOWPROFILERTM completion diagnostics. The Companys recently released HERO?PerFRAC perforating system provides consistent hole sizes throughout the perforating cluster, thereby maximizing frac efficiency and increasing Stimulated Reservoir Volume ("SRV"). This system equalizes the perforating friction and allows all perforations to contribute to the fracing operation. Also, tortuosity is reduced, enhancing proppant deployment at lower hydraulic pumping pressures.  The HERO?PerFRAC system is specifically designed to provide 100% contribution of perforating clusters, require minimal hydraulic horsepower to efficiently place fracture treatments, maximize SRV, and increase ultimate recovery from the reservoir.  The HERO?PerFRAC system is proving to be far superior to conventional perforating systems, decades old sand-jet perforating techniques, and sliding sleeves which have limited applications to some tight-oil reservoirs.  Cores HERO?PerFRAC is the Companys best perforating technology introduction for unconventional natural gas and tight oil reservoirs since Cores launch of its industry leading HERO-HR perforating product line.
To further support Cores clients who are increasingly focused on enhancing their stimulation programs, the Company is expanding its industry-wide consortia to evaluate the use of multiple proppants and proppant sizes to improve the effectiveness of hydraulic fracing programs. Cores proppant consortia is composed of more than 40 technologically sophisticated clients, including Anadarko, Apache, Aramco, BHP, BP, Conoco Phillips, Devon, EOG, Newfield Energy, Oxy, Pioneer Natural Resources, Shell and YPF, amongst others. Oilfield service companies in the consortia include Baker Hughes, Halliburton and Schlumberger, amongst others. Core will increase its evaluation of 100-mesh sand and will add 200- and 400-mesh sand micro proppants to its dynamic flow models and conductivity testing. Finer mesh sands are thought to prop secondary and tertiary fracture networks, significantly expanding SRV, and therefore increasing hydrocarbon flow rates and estimated ultimate recovery from tight-oil reservoirs. Cores proppant consortia also have been asked to investigate the effectiveness of higher density proppant loading pumped at higher flow rates via larger wellbore tubulars.
Free Cash Flow and Dividends
During the first quarter of 2017, Cores operations generated $29,700,000 in cash from operating activities and had capital expenditures of $6,400,000, yielding $23,300,000 of FCF, representing 132% of net income and 15% of revenue. Cores FCF has exceeded net income in 11 of the last 15 years.
On 10 January 2017, the Board announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.55 per share of common stock, which was paid on 17 February 2017 to shareholders of record on 20 January 2017.  Dutch withholding tax was deducted from the dividend at a rate of 15%.
On 18 April 2017, the Board announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.55 per share of common stock, payable in the second quarter of 2017. The quarterly cash dividend will be payable 23 May 2017 to shareholders of record on 28 April 2017. Dutch withholding tax will be deducted from the dividend at a rate of 15%.
Return On Invested Capital
As reported in previous quarters, the Companys Board has established an internal performance metric of achieving a relative ROIC performance compared with the oilfield service companies listed as Cores Comp Group by Bloomberg Financial. The Company and its Board believe that ROIC is a leading long-term performance metric used by shareholders to determine the relative investment value of publicly traded companies. Further, the Company and its Board believe that shareholders will benefit if Core consistently performs at high levels of ROIC among its Comp Group.
According to the latest financial information from Bloomberg, Cores ROIC is the highest of any comparably sized oilfield service company in its Comp Group. Comp Group companies listed by Bloomberg include Halliburton, Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, Oceaneering, National Oilwell Varco, and Oil States International, amongst others. A total of 24 of the 26 companies listed in the Comp Group failed to post ROIC that exceeded their weighted average cost of capital ("WACC"). Cores ratio of ROIC to WACC is the highest of any comparably sized company in the Comp Group.
Second Quarter 2017 Revenue and EPS Guidance
As has been the case for past recoveries, Core expects its revenue growth to ultimately outperform the increase in industry activity rates by 200 to 400 basis points.  Core expects to generate incremental operating income margins of up to approximately 60% early in the activity recovery phase, followed by historical incremental operating income margins of approximately 35% to 45% well into the recovery phase.
Cores North America revenue is correlated with completion and stimulation events and large-scale reservoir rock and reservoir fluid characterization studies, rather than with immediate increases in rig count. Wells need to be drilled and subsequently completed, stimulated, and cored -- or have reservoir fluid samples collected -- before Core can realize a revenue event.
Core is benefiting from increased U.S. onshore activity and expects revenue and operating income to increase further in 2017 as international and offshore markets improve with additional major capital project announcements. Core expects its deepwater revenues, which are currently 15% of the total Company revenue, to bottom in the second half of 2017.  Activities relating to new project announcements that should drive Cores revenue higher in consecutive quarters throughout 2017, further expanding incremental operating margins.
As Core projected, the Companys third quarter 2016 results established the bottom of the expected "V-shaped" recovery that the Company expects to continue in 2017. Core believes that the global crude oil market is currently under-supplied. This is indicated by recent International Energy Agency data showing that worldwide crude oil inventory has declined over six of the last seven months.
From July to December 2016, worldwide crude inventories fell by an average of approximately 770,000 BOPD. In addition, considering the January 2017 OPEC cuts of approximately 1,344,000 BOPD, plus cuts from cooperating non-OPEC producers, including Russia, the world market could be under-supplied by more than 2,000,000 BOPD.  The continued under-supply of crude oil should lead to extended worldwide inventory declines and a continuing rally in energy prices throughout 2017.
For the second quarter of 2017, Core projects its business to improve further, primarily from increasing activity levels in the U.S. and stable-to-up international, offshore and deepwater markets, offsetting lower Canadian activities due to spring break-up.  International rig counts increased 3% in the first quarter, a second consecutive quarterly increase after eight consecutive quarters of decline and in the U.S. offshore, new well permits in the GOM increased 13% over year-ago March levels.
Core projects second quarter 2017 revenue of approximately $165,000,000 to $170,000,000 and EPS of $0.48 to $0.52.  Operating income is expected to range between $27,600,000 and $29,900,000 yielding operating margins of approximately 17%, and, Company-wide sequential quarterly incremental margins to increase sequentially to approximately 45%. Second quarter 2017 FCF, once again, is expected to exceed net income and Core anticipates reactivating its share repurchase program during the quarter. Core expects the effective tax rate for the second quarter to be approximately 15%.
Earnings Call Scheduled
The Company has scheduled a conference call to discuss Cores first quarter 2017 earnings announcement. The call will begin at 7:30 a.m. CDT / 2:30 p.m. CEST on Thursday, 20 April 2017. To listen to the call, please go to Cores website at www.corelab.com.

This release includes forward-looking statements regarding the future revenue, profitability, business strategies and developments of the Company made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of Federal securities law. The Companys outlook is subject to various important cautionary factors, including risks and uncertainties related to the oil and natural gas industry, business conditions, international markets, international political climates and other factors as more fully described in the Companys 2016 Form 10-K filed on 10 February 2017 and in other securities filings. These important factors could cause the Companys actual results to differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements.

Management believes that the exclusion of certain income and expenses enables management, our investors and the public to more effectively evaluate the Companys operations period-over-period and to identify operating trends that could otherwise be masked by the excluded items. For this reason, we used certain non-GAAP measures that exclude these items; and we feel that this presentation provides the public a better understanding of the underlying operations current period financial results on a more comparable basis to those reported in prior periods. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, as more fully discussed in Core Labs financial statements and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Core uses the non-GAAP measure of free cash flow to evaluate its cash flows and results of operations. Free cash flow is an important measurement because it represents the cash from operations, in excess of capital expenditures, available to operate the business and fund non-discretionary obligations. Free cash flow is not a measure of operating performance under GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation nor construed as an alternative consideration to operating income, net income, earnings per share, or cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities, each as determined in accordance with GAAP. You should also not consider free cash flow as a measure of liquidity. Moreover, since free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and thus is susceptible to varying interpretations and calculations, free cash flow as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
