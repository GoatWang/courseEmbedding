Education and family[edit]
Abraham was born in East Lansing, Michigan, the son of Juliette Elizabeth (Sear), a member of the Michigan Republican State Central Committee, and Eddie Joseph Abraham.[1] He is a graduate of East Lansing High School. Of Lebanese descent, Abraham is married to Jane Abraham (current co-chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party, and chair of the Susan B. Anthony List) and has three children: a son, Spencer, and twin girls, Betsy and Julie. He holds a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from Harvard University, and is a 1974 Honors College graduate of Michigan State University. In 1978, while at Harvard Law School, Abraham helped found the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy.[2] It became one of the official journals of the Federalist Society, which was founded in 1982.
Political career[edit]
Before his election to the Senate, Abraham was a law professor at Thomas M. Cooley Law School.
Republican Party service[edit]
He was elected chairman of the Michigan Republican Party from 1983 to 1990. He was deputy chief of staff for Vice President Dan Quayle from 1990 to 1991. He later served as co-chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) from 1991 to 1993 and ran for chairman of the Republican National Committee in 1993, coming second to Haley Barbour.
United States Senate[edit]
Abraham was elected to represent Michigan in the United States Senate in 1994, and he served until 2001 when he was defeated for reelection to the Senate in 2000 for a second term by Debbie Stabenow. He was the only Arab American in the chamber. According to the New York Times, State Republicans attributed his loss to "scathing advertisements by a wide range of special interest groups, including advertisements that criticized Mr. Abraham's support for a relaxation of some immigration restrictions".[3] During the campaign the Federation for American Immigration Reform ran ads asking: "Why is Senator Spencer Abraham trying to make it easier for terrorists like Osama bin Laden to export their war of terror to any city street in America?"[4][5][6] The media denounced these commercials as "vengeful".[7] In 1996, when President Clinton endorsed Congresswoman Barbara Jordan's proposed cuts to legal immigration Senator Abraham played a leading role in blocking the proposed cuts.[8] Another factor in his defeat was his vote to convict President Clinton in his 1999 impeachment trial.[9] The following year he received the "Defender of the Melting Pot" award from the National Council of La Raza for his efforts on the immigration issue.[10]

Committee service and legislation[edit]
He served on the Budget, Commerce, Science and Transportation, Judiciary, and Small Business Committees. He also chaired two subcommittees: Manufacturing and Competitiveness, and Immigration. Abraham authored the "H1B Visa in Global and National Commerce Act", establishing a federal framework for on-line contracts and signatures; the "Government Paperwork Elimination Act", and the "Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act", which protects Internet domain names for businesses and persons against copyright and trademark infringements. In 1999, Abraham co-sponsored S.896, a bill to abolish the U.S. Department of Energy, which would have transferred control of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in large part to the Defense Department.[11]
U.S. Energy Secretary[edit]

Abraham was appointed Secretary of Energy by the incoming George W. Bush's administration. On November 15, 2004, Abraham announced that he would resign from this position, effective with the swearing in of his successor Samuel W. Bodman on February 1, 2005.
In 2004, Lebanese Ambassador Farid Abboud awarded Abraham the National Order of the Cedar.[12]
Hoover Institution[edit]
Abraham was a Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the Hoover Institution, an influential think tank based at Stanford University from 2005 through 2007. After leaving office, Abraham opened The Abraham Group, a Washington DC based international strategic consulting firm. In 2006, Spencer Abraham accepted the appointment as Chairman of the Board of Areva Inc., the US subsidiary of the French nuclear energy company.[13]
Thompson for President[edit]
On July 24, 2007, Abraham was announced as an "ambassador to official Washington" in the Fred Thompson presidential campaign.[14]
Later career[edit]
In 2006 Abraham was appointed Non-Executive Chairman of the Board of AREVA Inc., the American arm of the French nuclear company Areva, which is planning to build EPR nuclear power plants in the United States, and is building the mixed oxide fuel (MOX) manufacturing plant at the Savannah River Site to convert legacy weapons-grade plutonium into power station fuel.[15][16]
With William Tucker, Abraham wrote Lights Out!: Ten Myths About (and Real Solutions to) America's Energy Crisis, which was published in July 2010.
Abraham is also the Chairman and CEO of The Abraham Group, a strategic consulting firm providing assistance to clients seeking opportunities in the U.S. and global markets.[16]

Education and family[edit]
Abraham was born in East Lansing, Michigan, the son of Juliette Elizabeth (Sear), a member of the Michigan Republican State Central Committee, and Eddie Joseph Abraham.[1] He is a graduate of East Lansing High School. Of Lebanese descent, Abraham is married to Jane Abraham (current co-chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party, and chair of the Susan B. Anthony List) and has three children: a son, Spencer, and twin girls, Betsy and Julie. He holds a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from Harvard University, and is a 1974 Honors College graduate of Michigan State University. In 1978, while at Harvard Law School, Abraham helped found the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy.[2] It became one of the official journals of the Federalist Society, which was founded in 1982.
Political career[edit]
Before his election to the Senate, Abraham was a law professor at Thomas M. Cooley Law School.
Republican Party service[edit]
He was elected chairman of the Michigan Republican Party from 1983 to 1990. He was deputy chief of staff for Vice President Dan Quayle from 1990 to 1991. He later served as co-chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) from 1991 to 1993 and ran for chairman of the Republican National Committee in 1993, coming second to Haley Barbour.
United States Senate[edit]
Abraham was elected to represent Michigan in the United States Senate in 1994, and he served until 2001 when he was defeated for reelection to the Senate in 2000 for a second term by Debbie Stabenow. He was the only Arab American in the chamber. According to the New York Times, State Republicans attributed his loss to "scathing advertisements by a wide range of special interest groups, including advertisements that criticized Mr. Abraham's support for a relaxation of some immigration restrictions".[3] During the campaign the Federation for American Immigration Reform ran ads asking: "Why is Senator Spencer Abraham trying to make it easier for terrorists like Osama bin Laden to export their war of terror to any city street in America?"[4][5][6] The media denounced these commercials as "vengeful".[7] In 1996, when President Clinton endorsed Congresswoman Barbara Jordan's proposed cuts to legal immigration Senator Abraham played a leading role in blocking the proposed cuts.[8] Another factor in his defeat was his vote to convict President Clinton in his 1999 impeachment trial.[9] The following year he received the "Defender of the Melting Pot" award from the National Council of La Raza for his efforts on the immigration issue.[10]





This section possibly contains original research. Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding inline citations. Statements consisting only of original research should be removed. (October 2008) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Committee service and legislation[edit]
He served on the Budget, Commerce, Science and Transportation, Judiciary, and Small Business Committees. He also chaired two subcommittees: Manufacturing and Competitiveness, and Immigration. Abraham authored the "H1B Visa in Global and National Commerce Act", establishing a federal framework for on-line contracts and signatures; the "Government Paperwork Elimination Act", and the "Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act", which protects Internet domain names for businesses and persons against copyright and trademark infringements. In 1999, Abraham co-sponsored S.896, a bill to abolish the U.S. Department of Energy, which would have transferred control of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in large part to the Defense Department.[11]
U.S. Energy Secretary[edit]

Abraham was appointed Secretary of Energy by the incoming George W. Bush's administration. On November 15, 2004, Abraham announced that he would resign from this position, effective with the swearing in of his successor Samuel W. Bodman on February 1, 2005.
In 2004, Lebanese Ambassador Farid Abboud awarded Abraham the National Order of the Cedar.[12]
Hoover Institution[edit]
Abraham was a Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the Hoover Institution, an influential think tank based at Stanford University from 2005 through 2007. After leaving office, Abraham opened The Abraham Group, a Washington DC based international strategic consulting firm. In 2006, Spencer Abraham accepted the appointment as Chairman of the Board of Areva Inc., the US subsidiary of the French nuclear energy company.[13]
Thompson for President[edit]
On July 24, 2007, Abraham was announced as an "ambassador to official Washington" in the Fred Thompson presidential campaign.[14]
Later career[edit]
In 2006 Abraham was appointed Non-Executive Chairman of the Board of AREVA Inc., the American arm of the French nuclear company Areva, which is planning to build EPR nuclear power plants in the United States, and is building the mixed oxide fuel (MOX) manufacturing plant at the Savannah River Site to convert legacy weapons-grade plutonium into power station fuel.[15][16]
With William Tucker, Abraham wrote Lights Out!: Ten Myths About (and Real Solutions to) America's Energy Crisis, which was published in July 2010.
Abraham is also the Chairman and CEO of The Abraham Group, a strategic consulting firm providing assistance to clients seeking opportunities in the U.S. and global markets.[16]

Education and family[edit]
Abraham was born in East Lansing, Michigan, the son of Juliette Elizabeth (Sear), a member of the Michigan Republican State Central Committee, and Eddie Joseph Abraham.[1] He is a graduate of East Lansing High School. Of Lebanese descent, Abraham is married to Jane Abraham (current co-chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party, and chair of the Susan B. Anthony List) and has three children: a son, Spencer, and twin girls, Betsy and Julie. He holds a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from Harvard University, and is a 1974 Honors College graduate of Michigan State University. In 1978, while at Harvard Law School, Abraham helped found the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy.[2] It became one of the official journals of the Federalist Society, which was founded in 1982.
Political career[edit]
Before his election to the Senate, Abraham was a law professor at Thomas M. Cooley Law School.
Republican Party service[edit]
He was elected chairman of the Michigan Republican Party from 1983 to 1990. He was deputy chief of staff for Vice President Dan Quayle from 1990 to 1991. He later served as co-chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) from 1991 to 1993 and ran for chairman of the Republican National Committee in 1993, coming second to Haley Barbour.
United States Senate[edit]
Abraham was elected to represent Michigan in the United States Senate in 1994, and he served until 2001 when he was defeated for reelection to the Senate in 2000 for a second term by Debbie Stabenow. He was the only Arab American in the chamber. According to the New York Times, State Republicans attributed his loss to "scathing advertisements by a wide range of special interest groups, including advertisements that criticized Mr. Abraham's support for a relaxation of some immigration restrictions".[3] During the campaign the Federation for American Immigration Reform ran ads asking: "Why is Senator Spencer Abraham trying to make it easier for terrorists like Osama bin Laden to export their war of terror to any city street in America?"[4][5][6] The media denounced these commercials as "vengeful".[7] In 1996, when President Clinton endorsed Congresswoman Barbara Jordan's proposed cuts to legal immigration Senator Abraham played a leading role in blocking the proposed cuts.[8] Another factor in his defeat was his vote to convict President Clinton in his 1999 impeachment trial.[9] The following year he received the "Defender of the Melting Pot" award from the National Council of La Raza for his efforts on the immigration issue.[10]





This section possibly contains original research. Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding inline citations. Statements consisting only of original research should be removed. (October 2008) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Committee service and legislation[edit]
He served on the Budget, Commerce, Science and Transportation, Judiciary, and Small Business Committees. He also chaired two subcommittees: Manufacturing and Competitiveness, and Immigration. Abraham authored the "H1B Visa in Global and National Commerce Act", establishing a federal framework for on-line contracts and signatures; the "Government Paperwork Elimination Act", and the "Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act", which protects Internet domain names for businesses and persons against copyright and trademark infringements. In 1999, Abraham co-sponsored S.896, a bill to abolish the U.S. Department of Energy, which would have transferred control of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in large part to the Defense Department.[11]
U.S. Energy Secretary[edit]

Abraham was appointed Secretary of Energy by the incoming George W. Bush's administration. On November 15, 2004, Abraham announced that he would resign from this position, effective with the swearing in of his successor Samuel W. Bodman on February 1, 2005.
In 2004, Lebanese Ambassador Farid Abboud awarded Abraham the National Order of the Cedar.[12]
Hoover Institution[edit]
Abraham was a Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the Hoover Institution, an influential think tank based at Stanford University from 2005 through 2007. After leaving office, Abraham opened The Abraham Group, a Washington DC based international strategic consulting firm. In 2006, Spencer Abraham accepted the appointment as Chairman of the Board of Areva Inc., the US subsidiary of the French nuclear energy company.[13]
Thompson for President[edit]
On July 24, 2007, Abraham was announced as an "ambassador to official Washington" in the Fred Thompson presidential campaign.[14]
Later career[edit]
In 2006 Abraham was appointed Non-Executive Chairman of the Board of AREVA Inc., the American arm of the French nuclear company Areva, which is planning to build EPR nuclear power plants in the United States, and is building the mixed oxide fuel (MOX) manufacturing plant at the Savannah River Site to convert legacy weapons-grade plutonium into power station fuel.[15][16]
With William Tucker, Abraham wrote Lights Out!: Ten Myths About (and Real Solutions to) America's Energy Crisis, which was published in July 2010.
Abraham is also the Chairman and CEO of The Abraham Group, a strategic consulting firm providing assistance to clients seeking opportunities in the U.S. and global markets.[16]

About Abraham Spencer


The following is taken from a webpage from the Vandrfordfamily.com site:
b. 1602 in England [OWT]
d. December 4, 1657 in Martins Hundred, James City, Virginia [Martin]
m.
Issue: [OWT]
Thomas Spencer (spen201), b. 1638
Information:
Before 1638: Abraham came to James City, Virginia from Enland. [Martin]
May 25, 1638: Abraham was granted 150 acres called Greene Swamp, part of Martin's Hundred (north side of the James River, about 7 miles downstream from James Island and southeast of present-day Williamsburg). [Martin]
December 10, 1655: Abraham, planter of martin's Hundred, was assigned 150 acres at Middle Plantation (present-day Williamsburg in York County) by John Diceson. After Abraham died, his son Thomas conveyed the land to John Page. [Martin]
__________
Abraham Spencer's Children and Wife The following webpage from the Wittmeyerfamily.com site identified Abraham's wife as Judith Scrivener (b 1613 in Suffolk, England) and their children as son Thomas Spencer (b 4 Dec 1636 in Jamestown, James, Viriginia; married Anne Woodward born 1662; died 20 Jul 1708 in King William, King William, Virginia) and son John Spencer (born 1638; died 1709 St. Peters, New Kent, Virginia).
__________
Based on the date and place of Thomas Spencer's birth (Abraham Spencer's son), Abraham must have come to Virginia before that in 4 Dec 1636.
__________
His Parents?
There are profiles which list Abraham Spencer's parents as Thomas Spencer, 1st Baronet of Yarnton (1585 - 1622, see the Geni link) and Margaret Brainthwait (1570 - 1635). 
It should be observed, however, that A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Extinct and Dormant Baronetcies of England, Ireland, and Scotland by John Burke and Sir Bernard Burke (1844) does not list that couple as having any child named Abraham, although it does list their other children (page 499).

                              The National Energy Policy Plan directed the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to conduct a study to examine the benefits of
                                 establishing a national electricity transmission grid and to identify transmission bottlenecks and measures to address them.
                                 DOE began by conducting an independent analysis of U.S. electricity markets and identifying transmission system bottlenecks
                                 using DOE's Policy Office Electricity Modeling System (POEMS). DOE's analysis, presented in Section 2, confirms the central
                                 role of the nation's transmission system in lowering costs to consumers through increased trade. More importantly, DOE's analysis
                                 also confirms the results of previous studies, which show that transmission bottlenecks and related transmission system market
                                 practices are adding hundreds of millions of dollars to consumers' electricity bills each year. A more detailed technical
                                 overview of the use of POEMS is provided in Appendix A. DOE led an extensive, open, public input process and heard a wide
                                 range of comments and recommendations that have all been considered. 1 More than 150 participants registered for three public
                                 workshops held in Detroit, MI (September 24, 2001); Atlanta, GA (September 26, 2001); and Phoenix, AZ (September 28, 2001)

					Surnames: Spencer, Dickenson, Sharp






Hi,I believe that I descend from Abraham Spencer of Virginia.  Do you have information on that line?  Current on-line information indicates that he lived from 1735-1761 and married Lucy Dickerson or Dickenson, but I just got a copy of his will from the Albemarle County Courthouse and he had six children by the age of 25 and was wealthy enough to have 400 acres and some slaves.  That seems inconsisent to me! I wonder if this is in fact the older Abraham born in 1700 and perhaps he was married first to Susannah Sharp and second to Lucy Dickenson.  I will be happy to share info with you!

Chairman & CEO Spencer Abraham is Chairman and CEO of The Abraham Group, an  international strategic consulting firm based in Washington, DC.  After being nominated by President-elect George W. Bush, Spencer Abraham was  sworn in as the tenth Secretary of Energy in United States history on January  20, 2001. He began his tenure in the midst of a severe energy crisis that included  the California blackouts, declining domestic energy supplies and insufficient  international energy trade opportunities. In response, he helped President Bush  devise America's first national energy plan in over a decade and oversaw its  implementation. As part of this plan, he led efforts to broaden America's  international energy partnerships, working with China, Japan, Russia, the E.U.,  countries in South America and Africa and certain OPEC nations. Secretary  Abraham has been a close observer of world energy markets, and under his  leadership the Department of Energy conducted a number of short and long-term  studies of world oil, gas, electricity and other markets. Domestically, he  spearheaded the department's high-tech efforts in the areas of hydrogen fuel  cell research and the development and expansion of clean coal technology  programs, and provided a strong voice for the reemergence of safe nuclear  power. According to the Presidential Management Agenda scorecard, the  Department of Energy went from "worst to first" of well-run agencies  under Secretary Abraham's leadership.  When he announced his resignation at the end of President's first term, The Washington Times sang Abraham's  praises, writing that he "inherited a large and unwieldy agency in  post-Cold War drift. He bequeaths [his successor] something much better. Mr.  Abraham led his agency with distinction and high integrity." Faced almost  immediately with the energy and safety issues of the post 9/11 world, Secretary  Abraham distinguished himself by revitalizing and refocusing the Department of  Energy on the new homeland security challenges our country faced. Abraham saw  to the safety of America's nuclear stockpiles while he played a key  international role by dramatically expanding the Department's focus on nuclear  nonproliferation programs, negotiating with Russia and other former Soviet  states. He created new safeguarding plans that the Washington Post called  "great gifts to the nation from Abraham."  Prior to being named Secretary of Energy, Abraham served as an effective and  highly productive U.S. Senator from Michigan for six years, where he was the  author of 22 pieces of legislation signed into law - an unprecedented  accomplishment for a freshman senator. He also chaired two subcommittees:  Manufacturing and Competitiveness and Immigration. Always on the cutting edge,  he became a leading advocate for technological issues and was one of the first  politicians to recognize the importance of establishing a relationship with  Silicon Valley's technological entrepreneurs and business leaders. He authored  three particularly ground-breaking pieces of technology legislation: the  Electronic Signature in Global and National Commerce Act, the Government  Paperwork and Elimination Act, and the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection  Act. All three were landmarks in the governance of cyberspace and the use of  important new technology. A strong supporter of the business community, Abraham  consistently endorsed policies that enhanced America's competitiveness and global  leadership.   Abraham is also Non-Executive Chairman of AREVA, Inc and a member of the Board of Directors of Occidental Petroleum.  In addition, he is a Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the Hoover Institution, and a periodic contributor of op-ed articles to the Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, The Weekly Standard and other publications as well as frequently appears as a guest commentator on Fox News, Fox Business, CNN, CNBC and Bloomberg.  Spencer Abraham and his wife, Jane, are the parents of three children. He holds  a law degree from Harvard University, where he co-founded the Federalist  Society, and is a native of East Lansing, Michigan.
