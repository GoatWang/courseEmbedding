Calvert Expands Responsible Indexes; Launches New Funds




Next Step in the Evolution of Responsible Investing






June 22, 2015 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



BETHESDA, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Calvert Investments, Inc., a global leader in Responsible Investing, 
      announced today a major new initiative that the firm describes as the 
      next step in the evolution of responsible investing. The firm is 
      building upon its global Responsible Investing research expertise and 
      has launched a suite of Responsible Indexes and related lower cost Index 
      Funds that will track them.
    


HIGHLIGHTS



        Three distinct U.S. large cap indexes have been created based on style.

        

            Calvert U.S. Large Cap Growth Responsible Index
          

            Calvert U.S. Large Cap Core Responsible Index
          

            Calvert U.S. Large Cap Value Responsible Index
          



        The existing Calvert Social Index Fund has become the Calvert U.S. 
        Large Cap Core Responsible Index Fund (NASDAQ: CSXAX). Calvert is also 
        launching two additional index funds, the Calvert U.S. Large Cap 
        Growth Responsible Index Fund (NASDAQ: CGJAX) and the Calvert U.S. 
        Large Cap Value Responsible Index Fund (NASDAQ: CFJAX), each based on 
        one of the new indexes. The Funds are all available to the public on 
        Monday, June 22.
      

        Additional Responsible Indexes and Funds providing coverage of other 
        significant portions of the global equity markets are anticipated 
        later this year, including U.S. mid cap, non-U.S. developed markets 
        and emerging markets.
      


      Calvert’s indexes and investment products are evolving to meet both the 
      growing interest in responsible investing and the increasing demand for 
      lower-cost options. Said John Streur, CEO, Calvert Investments, 
      “Investors want to access companies that are global leaders in ESG and 
      that are capable of producing competitive returns. An index strategy 
      provides a truly cost efficient way to do that.
    

      “Calvert Investments has over 30 years of leadership in defining the 
      environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in the investment 
      context. Combine this with its shareholder engagement and there is no 
      better firm to drive positive change for investors. Calvert is committed 
      to meeting the evolving needs of our institutional and private clients 
      with innovative products that improve on the characteristics of 
      Responsible Investing and passive investing.”
    

      The new index suite reflects the continued evolution of Calvert’s 
      research system and the increasing availability of non-financial data. 
      “Calvert’s process analyzes, scores and ranks every company on material 
      ESG risk and opportunity across all 156 GICS sub-sectors,” said Erica 
      Lasdon, Director, Sustainability Research. “This approach focuses on 
      those ESG factors that are most material in each sector or industry. The 
      way we apply proprietary technology allows us to take a leap forward,” 
      she said.
    

      Calvert has partnered with indexing leader S-Network Global Indexes, 
      Inc. (SNGI) to manage the benchmark universes. Calvert Responsible Index 
      Portfolio Manager Laurie Webster, CFA, said, “S-Net specializes in 
      sustainable and impact investing. The firm has developed several 
      important Impact indexes, including the S-Network Global Water Index and 
      the Ardour Global Alternative Energy Indexes – both of which Calvert 
      uses in long-standing investment products.”
    

      Information about the Calvert Responsible Index Series as well as 
      Calvert’s Principles of Responsible Investing can be found on www.Calvert.com.

 Proxy Voting


Calvert actively exercises proxy voting seeking to advance the environmental, social, and governance practices of companies held in our investment portfolios. We take this responsibility very seriously and are transparent about how and what we vote.
Shareholders of a corporation not only have the right to participate in the financial growth and success of their corporation, they also have the right to vote on important matters concerning the company's policies, practices and governance.
Calvert believes that proxy voting is the most direct means by which investors can influence corporate behavior. Calvert casts votes on a company's shareholder resolutions based on its proxy voting guidelines.
Download Proxy Voting Guidelines
We believe all of our clients have a right to know how we are voting company proxies on their behalf; therefore, recent proxy voting decisions for each of the funds we manage are disclosed. Proxy voting guidelines and reporting for other advisory clients will be governed by the terms of the respective advisory agreement.

Calvert Expands Responsible Indexes; Launches New Funds






Business Wire




Jun 22, 2015 9:00 AM EDT













 


















































  The new index suite reflects the continued evolution of Calvert's research system and the increasing availability of non-financial data. "Calvert's process analyzes, scores and ranks every company on material ESG risk and opportunity across all 156 GICS sub-sectors," said Erica Lasdon, Director, Sustainability Research. "This approach focuses on those ESG factors that are most material in each sector or industry. The way we apply proprietary technology allows us to take a leap forward," she said.   Calvert has partnered with indexing leader S-Network Global Indexes, Inc. (SNGI) to manage the benchmark universes. Calvert Responsible Index Portfolio Manager Laurie Webster, CFA, said, "S-Net specializes in sustainable and impact investing. The firm has developed several important Impact indexes, including the S-Network Global Water Index and the Ardour Global Alternative Energy Indexes - both of which Calvert uses in long-standing investment products."  Information about the Calvert Responsible Index Series as well as Calvert's Principles of Responsible Investing can be found on www.Calvert.com.

Calvert Unveils Responsible Index Funds


                                            August 3, 2015
                                                                    •
                                                                    
FA Staff 






Calvert Unveils Responsible Index Funds
	Bethesda, Md.-based Calvert Investments, a broker-dealer and RIA focusing on responsible investing, has launched a suite of responsible indexes and related index funds that will track them.

	“Investors want to access companies that are global leaders in environment, social and governance factors and that are capable of producing competitive returns,” said Calvert CEO John Streur. “An index strategy provides a truly cost-efficient way to do that.”

	The new products are based on Calvert’s responsible investing expertise and include three distinct U.S. large-cap indexes based on style: the Calvert U.S. Large Cap Growth Responsible Index, the Calvert U.S. Large Cap Core Responsible Index and the Calvert U.S. Large Cap Value Responsible Index.

	The existing Calvert Social Index Fund has become the Calvert U.S. Large Cap Core Responsible Index Fund. It and two additional index funds, for growth and value investors, are each based on their respective new indexes.

	Calvert has partnered with indexing leader S-Network Global Indexes Inc. to manage the benchmark universes.


FTSE Russell Launches New Value and Growth Indexes
	Seattle-based FTSE Russell has introduced a new series of eight indexes designed as a more concentrated and targeted measure of growth and value stocks.

	The Russell Pure Style Index Series covers the Russell Top 200, Russell Midcap, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 Pure Growth and Value Indexes.
	The methodology includes only stocks classified as pure growth or pure value and does not include stocks that exhibit both characteristics.

	The stocks are weighted by the Russell style score instead of by market capitalization, complementing the original Russell Growth and Value Indexes.
	Invesco PowerShares, based in Downers Grove, Ill., has already licensed the indexes as the bases for a new set of ETFs.


CUSO Financial Services Releases Secure Profiling Tool
	San Diego-based CUSO Financial Services and Sorrento Pacific Financial announced a new online profiling tool, BuildMyProfile, for use by advisors and their clients.

	The tool allows collection and integration of information into advisory firms’ client and account management systems.

	An advisor can use the tool to send a profile questionnaire to a client via a secure link. The client then fills out and closes the form as requested and content is immediately available to the advisor (and secure) without needing to be e-mailed or faxed back.

	Any information filled into the forms automatically populates the advisor’s client contact record and is made available in the account management system.


Professional Employer Organization Platform Targeted For Hedge Funds
	White Plains, N.Y.-based Assured SKCG is launching a new Professional Employer Organization Platform for the hedge fund industry.

	In partnership with CIGNA Health Plans, Assured SKCG is offering a platform designed to allow small and emerging hedge fund firms to outsource time-consuming human resource, payroll and employee benefit management tasks while addressing the compliance requirements of the complex Affordable Care Act regulations.

	Assured SKCG created the new PEO platform to allow hedge fund firms at every asset level to address ACA compliance requirements while providing their employees with valuable benefit packages and a high-touch level of service.


Franklin Templeton Adds Income-Focused Retirement Funds
	San Mateo, Calif.-based Franklin Templeton Investments announced the launch of the Franklin Retirement Payout Fund series, designed to help defined contribution participants transition from savings to spending in retirement.

	The Franklin Retirement Payout Fund series—with maturity dates ranging from 2017 through 2021—is designed for participants nearing or in retirement and seeking a straightforward payout schedule. These funds and their payout schedules can be matched against a client’s expenses as the client moves from accumulation to withdrawal.

	The Franklin Retirement Payout Fund series seeks income by investing in fixed-income securities, including government and corporate debt, asset-backed securities and municipal bonds. Each fund may invest a portion of its assets in U.S. dollar-denominated foreign securities.


SEI Investments Introduces Work-Flow Program
	Oaks, Pa.-based SEI Investments Company has introduced a comprehensive work-flow program that streamlines client interactions, sales, marketing and practice management.

	SEI ProcessWise contains 48 step-by-step work-flow processes across multiple business functions and can be integrated into a firm’s relationship management system, providing staff members with automatic notifications to complete assigned tasks.

	The program is launching at a time advisors face complex client relationships and when ongoing consolidation makes it more important for firms to create standardized processes.

	SEI ProcessWise includes three months of training designed to ensure that advisors adopt the automated work-flows into their daily routines.
