Incredibly Great Experience With This Mortgage Company. I'd rate it 10 stars if possible.

Last year we went through our Seattle-based mortgage broker when we re-financed our home loan. We were assigned to Impac Mortgage and completed the process. 

Last November, we received an e-mail from Leif Potter from Impac asking us if were were interested in doing a stream-line refinance which would lower our monthly payment. My wife made contact with Mr. Potter and agreed to start the process based on how professional he was on the phone.

By far this was the smoothest real estate loan we have ever done. What has impressed my wife and I more than anything was how professional Leif and his associates have been throughout the entire process. We were constantly kept up to date on time lines, document requests, and recent Federal loan changes. Unlike our previous re-finance process with our broker where we our kept us in the dark for months, and constantly received criptic e-mails regarding the delays, Impac has gone way beyond our expectations. There has not been one element of this loan transaction that has been a surprise, or has not been fully explained. We appreciated timely responses to any questions we had during the process.

My wife and I highly recommend this company if you are considering re-financing or establishing a new mortgage. More so, we highly recommend you contact Mr. Leif Potter. You will be delighted with his customer service and how well he communicates with his clients. He is well versed in the mortgage process and is someone you can trust.







This stupid company f***** up my property taxes. They've been collecting it in impounds but didn't bother to pay it . I find out today because I was doing my income taxes. I see there's a $120 late fee assessed. You think I can get those for her to pay it? I'm not holding my breath . just screwed up my tax refund too by not paying it last year. These people are f****** idiots!!!!!! Try to speak to a supervisor. They tell me no supervisor will take calls. What kind of fuked up place is this!







First, I was transferred four times, each time the representative of Impac was so rude they didn't give me a chance to explain how I needed help, if they had I wouldn't have been transferred so many times. 

After the above fun (not!), I sat on hold for 20 mins. 

I was finally connected to Sheranda who allowed me only to ask one question before she started rattling off a policy that states they cannot change the payment due date. If she had given me time to explain she would have discovered there was much more to my inquiry. 

This company is rude, unprofessional and I pray my loan is sold soon so I don't have to deal with these donkeys.







Relative to the other Alternative Lenders in the California lending market, Jason Vaccariello's team at Impac Mortgage offers the most efficient loan processing at the most competitive pricing & terms. I've brokered Alt-Doc deals to all of their competitors and from experience I can tell you that all other Alternative Lenders are administratively incompetent (bordering on negligent) whereas Jason and his Impac Mortgage team actually funds deals per their guidelines whereas others do not.  The loan process with Alternative Lenders are inherently more complicated and time-consuming than with conventional lenders as they are generally more complex, unique and complicated loan scenarios that conventional lenders have declined, such as stated income, or borrowers with damaged credit. Despite these challenges Impac still comes through and funds deals (even though it's not always easy). My brokerage has funded close to 100 deals with them so far and counting.







Zero Stars. These people are pure shit.

Got a pre-APPROVAL (not pre-qual) letter. Sold my house. Bought a plane ticket to go put an offer down where I wanted to move, then told I DON'T QUALIFY.

Unless you want a complete idiot to FUCK YOUR LIFE UP, avoid these pieces of shit.







If you are thinking of working for this company...DONT!!!!!  The company is unprofessional and lacks integrity especially as it relates to their Quality Control Department.  In specific the management of this department have egos and control issues that completely lacks an ounce of professionalism.  Seriously the VP needs to take a course in human ethics.







This company fuxxxxxcking sucks.  1 star from everyone, how is this company still in business?  They collect my taxes and they pay the county half of it.  I called them, press1, and 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 hold, 15 minutes later enter your loan number or social and wait and wait and wait, after half hour someone picks up, what is you loan number? what is your address? what is this and what is that.  You guys are taking my taxes and not paying them, you are responsible for that now us, OK, cancel my escrow I'll pay my own taxes, email us or fax us.  I emailed them and got auto email back saying we'll get back to you in 10 business days.  10 BUSINESS DAYS?  Fuk this company.







I refinanced my mortgage and the bill is due the 1st and late on the 16th. if they don't have it the 1st the phone is ringing off the DAMN hook. I never thought I would miss BofA but I do. in 22 years of owning homes, I have never ever been late and have an 819 fico score. these Aholes call and call and call with an automated call us back BS. I just blocked their #. FU impac!







I'm updating them to a 3 because they finally fixed my impound account and I haven't had any problems with them since. I still wouldn't recommend them due to the rough start.







My loan was sold to Impac Mortgage.  I am now counting down the days to refinance again (have to wait 6 months) so I can leave this company.  They charge to auto draft (from your checking account) to pay them.  I scheduled my auto draft on the 3rd (they charge from 5 days to 15 days).  They sent me a notice I was scheduled for the 5th (assuming so they could charge me?).  I had to call them once.  There is phone loop they put you through.  You keep pushing some number on the phone to get a rep.  I had to do this at least 25 times before I got a person.  I was starting to think there was no one to pick up the phone.  I would NEVER use this company.  I am waiting to refinance so I can leave this company.







Update: Is it now March and this has not been resolved. I was in touch with someone named Dargis Martinez who has been little to no help. I have since been reimbursed for the amount I overpaid in the first four months but they have yet to reconfigure my monthly mortgage payment. I have left 6 messages for Dargis and no response. If you would like to call her and try to get her to call me back her number is 757-452-5388.







DO NOT GO NEAR IMPAC MORTGAGE!*********** ZERO STARS***********They will ruin your life with the bullshit stories! They'll end up costing you more money and nothing but heart ache at the end!  They order an appraisal on our house in May of 2015  and it was completed. Only to find out that they ordered the wrong one and stated it was our fault. Not sure how that works but at any rate.... On the first appraisal it stated we needed to hang doors and add fire alarms to finish our process. Which we did. A few months go by and they decided they needed another appraisal which was going to be much more extensive and costly.  Really two appraisals? I guestioned them about the second appraisal and raised holly hell with them. Which them they come back and state you need to add stairs on deck and add carpet to the house. Never mentioned in first appraisal to be completed! Mined you yet this is a refinance on a rental for a complete remodel. We own the home outright. Just need a little money for a home facelift. The home appraised for more then what we are asking for in a loan. HMMMMM! So with that being said, we added the stairs and the carpet. The home is almost done on the inside (Very small stuff)  now we just need a little paint on the outside and some fence repairs and it will be ready for a renter. The entire time we have worked on this home hoping for a little money. We were hoping to have this rented out on June 1St. Nope not a chance!  The second appraisal was done and our little investment appraised for much higher then the first appraisal. Our hard work has paid off! Which we thought......So we started our loan process on 04/06/2015 in hope to have the remodel completed and rented out by 6/1/2015. Nope still no loan and not rented out. On 08/17/2015 we were told we were going to sign papers on 08/18/2015 and have our money soon. Well with that being said, on 08/18/2015 @2:30 PM we still had not heard a word from them so I sent an email with no response back and they close at 5PM. Finally at 4:30PM I got a call stating sorry your paperwork has expired and your credit score has changed NO LOAN! So here we sit no money! They nickel and dimed us with two appraisals and a lot of running around to meet a dead line. Which we did everything they asked of us. I mean everything!!! We put our home life on hold. We tried very hard not to spend any money and keep things up and running. It took them four months of a lot of bullshit stories to tell us NO!  At one point I told them that they were just waiting for us to screw up so they could us it against us! They said no we wouldn't do that to anyone!! BULLSHIT! I repeat don't go near this company they should be shut down and I'm surprised they don't have any lawsuits against them!! Maybe they do and no one can post about it?? This review is a NO STARS REVIEW!!! Stay away from IMPAC!







I called them before I saw these reviews.  They made me fill out a lot of stuff online and then called me back, the guy wasn't very nice and eventually told me I did not qualify.  They follow the same guidelines as major lenders from what I heard so the articles in which they are referenced are all false.. stay away!







Impac Mortage is impossible to work with.  They can't "find" payments sent electronically from my bank (Wells Fargo) despite conference calls with the bank people.  They put customers on hold forever and it's impossible to speak with a supervisor. If you fax information (with proof of fax) they say they can't find the fax.  Everything has to be "researched" with a 5-7 business day research period.  Please, if you have a choice, don't use Impac Mortgage.







Impac  Commercial Lending has unethical practices and have the worst customer service. They put hefty penalties for loans that are not revealed in an apparent manner. They give loans without explaining the terms which are of course in fine print. I am surprised that after the financial crisis they continue to work in such a way. Impac definitely need to be scrutinized by federal agencies on their practices and unethical ways of lending! 

We had a commercial loan with them with. At the time we got the loan there was a prepayment penalty. We modified the loan - they charged us the prepayment penalty when modifying the loan. On top of that they added a new prepayment penalty on the modified note. We were desperate for the modification so had to accept their terms! We sold the property and had to pay the prepayment penalty. So now we have paid penalty twice of hefty amount

On top of that, what was most ethical was when we sold the property recently and the escrow company got the payoff demand  , Impac charged us an extra month of interest. They said that we had to let them know 30 days in advance that we are closing the loan with them. That is a complete robbery! I am surprised that these practices are allowed- to charge an extra month of interest if the lender is not notified 30 days in advance that they will be closing the loan! This was over $5000.

They have the worst customer service. 
Their senior management is the worst I have ever seen.  They are rude, lack the proper communication skills and plain out unethical. They refuse to communicate to their customers. If they do they are intimidating techniques for doing business.

Mr. Ashmore who is the president of the company and who has an article in a reputable Forbes  magazine talks to you as if you a piece of garbage!. It is appalling to see a President of the company treating their customer so rudely and unethically. I am sure the way he acts is translated throughout the company.
I do hope that their practices are challenged in doing commercial lending. {Please beware before doing any loans with them.







Absolute disaster, bunch of unprofessional people, don't waist your time. I have tried to refinance my existing loan in good standing with credit score of 790!!!!!they had me pay for an appraisal of my house and that's all they did ....after paying 450$ for an appraisal I  waited and  waited and waited....  For whatever unexplained reason all they could say there some issues ... Oh yeah what issues?  House appraised for 20000$ below what they thought it would and we are talking about $620000 loan for 30 years !!!!! give me a break please!!!!! I have been paying my current loan for 8 years with never being late, I have steady job , perfect credit score. there are issues .... what kind of issues?.......No one knows I suppose, besides the fact that having a property in San Francisco Bay Area you can't risk anything!!! Bottom line don't waist your time with this company they are ridiculously unprofessional and lucking knowledge on current mortgage lending:( horrible experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Incredibly Great Experience With This Mortgage Company. I'd rate it 10 stars if possible.Last year we went through our Seattle-based mortgage broker when we re-financed our home loan. We were assigned to Impac Mortgage and completed the process. Last November, we received an e-mail from Leif Potter from Impac asking us if were were interested in doing a stream-line refinance which would lower our monthly payment. My wife made contact with Mr. Potter and agreed to start the process based on how professional he was on the phone.By far this was the smoothest real estate loan we have ever done. What has impressed my wife and I more than anything was how professional Leif and his associates have been throughout the entire process. We were constantly kept up to date on time lines, document requests, and recent Federal loan changes. Unlike our previous re-finance process with our broker where we our kept us in the dark for months, and constantly received criptic e-mails regarding the delays, Impac has gone way beyond our expectations. There has not been one element of this loan transaction that has been a surprise, or has not been fully explained. We appreciated timely responses to any questions we had during the process.My wife and I highly recommend this company if you are considering re-financing or establishing a new mortgage. More so, we highly recommend you contact Mr. Leif Potter. You will be delighted with his customer service and how well he communicates with his clients. He is well versed in the mortgage process and is someone you can trust.

So here I sit weeks later,  they lost my  check i sent certified mail start my escrow,  I helped them locate it but then they applied it to my mortgage payments rather than escrow even though I wrote escrow on the check and mailed it to the escrow dept. A week ago I notified them of their mistake which they a knowledged with a promise that this morning my escrow account would be set up. Today not only did they not set it up,  they denied it because it dd not meet the deadline,  certified mail says that they received it 2 weeks before the deadline.  Plus they charge me a late fee on the first auto payment they lost. You have been warned!

Refinancing with Impac was fairly easy and I got a great rate. The problem is they were in such a hurry to sign me up that the salesman did not set up a escrow account and when I asked about it he said they don't do that until after they receive the first mortgage payment. (This is my 5th time purchasing or refinancing and I've ALWAYS had my escrow account set up at the time of transaction). It is 4 months later and I am still trying to set up the account only rather than building it into the loan which is the norm they need a check for $5,500--Which I scraped together and sent it certified mail--the only address I was given was a P.O.  Box so that's not making me feel very secure. To top it off they have lost this months payment which my bank shows as processed 2 weeks ago. My bank faxed them the proof and gave me a copy of proof that the fax went through. I just got off the phone with Impac who told me over the  they never received the fax and had me email my statement to them. They now say that they received the email and it will take 5 working days to research it. Meanwhile they will be charging me a late fee in 4 days and if they do not clear up their mess soon I fear it will go on my credit report. We have dealt with Impac over the phone at approx. 20 times in the past few months trying to get them to fix their mistakes. More contact than I have had over the past 33 years with my other lenders combined. If you have taken the time to read all of this I'd hope you'd be wise enough to find a company that is more professional.

My loan was sold to Impac Mortgage.  I am now counting down the days to refinance again (have to wait 6 months) so I can leave this company.  They charge to auto draft (from your checking account) to pay them.  I scheduled my auto draft on the 3rd (they charge from 5 days to 15 days).  They sent me a notice I was scheduled for the 5th (assuming so they could charge me?).  I had to call them once.  There is phone loop they put you through.  You keep pushing some number on the phone to get a rep.  I had to do this at least 25 times before I got a person.  I was starting to think there was no one to pick up the phone.  I would NEVER use this company.  I am waiting to refinance so I can leave this company.

Updated review



Update: Is it now March and this has not been resolved. I was in touch with someone named Dargis Martinez who has been little to no help. I have since been reimbursed for the amount I overpaid in the first four months but they have yet to reconfigure my monthly mortgage payment. I have left 6 messages for Dargis and no response. If you would like to call her and try to get her to call me back her number is 757-452-5388.

I paid off my hazard insurance in October 2014 (their policy when you switch insurance companies in the first year) and was told my loan would need to be readjusted to reflect the lower mortgage. First I was told it would be done in November. Then it wasn't, and I was told no longer than December it would be done. When I called in January to see if it was done, of course they said it hadn't yet. They told me 15 more business days. So, I called 15 business days later. And guess what? Still not done. Someone named Caja said she put in an expedited request and assured me that either that day but no later than the following day it would be resolved. I called 2 days later and guess what? Still not done. I call back again today, wait on hold 17 minutes only to speak with someone for a moment, get placed back on hold and hung up on. I am here, sitting on hold again now with a manager who says it still hasn't been done. I am just tired of being told it will be taken care of and it isn't. And I have been overpaying for 3 months now. How easy do you think it will be for me to get the money I have over payed? I only wish they would sell my loan to someone else. Oh and I have a credit score of over 800 and always make payments on time. I never wish this kind of service on anyone else.

DO NOT GO NEAR IMPAC MORTGAGE!*********** ZERO STARS***********They will ruin your life with the bullshit stories! They'll end up costing you more money and nothing but heart ache at the end!  They order an appraisal on our house in May of 2015  and it was completed. Only to find out that they ordered the wrong one and stated it was our fault. Not sure how that works but at any rate.... On the first appraisal it stated we needed to hang doors and add fire alarms to finish our process. Which we did. A few months go by and they decided they needed another appraisal which was going to be much more extensive and costly.  Really two appraisals? I guestioned them about the second appraisal and raised holly hell with them. Which them they come back and state you need to add stairs on deck and add carpet to the house. Never mentioned in first appraisal to be completed! Mined you yet this is a refinance on a rental for a complete remodel. We own the home outright. Just need a little money for a home facelift. The home appraised for more then what we are asking for in a loan. HMMMMM! So with that being said, we added the stairs and the carpet. The home is almost done on the inside (Very small stuff)  now we just need a little paint on the outside and some fence repairs and it will be ready for a renter. The entire time we have worked on this home hoping for a little money. We were hoping to have this rented out on June 1St. Nope not a chance!  The second appraisal was done and our little investment appraised for much higher then the first appraisal. Our hard work has paid off! Which we thought......So we started our loan process on 04/06/2015 in hope to have the remodel completed and rented out by 6/1/2015. Nope still no loan and not rented out. On 08/17/2015 we were told we were going to sign papers on 08/18/2015 and have our money soon. Well with that being said, on 08/18/2015 @2:30 PM we still had not heard a word from them so I sent an email with no response back and they close at 5PM. Finally at 4:30PM I got a call stating sorry your paperwork has expired and your credit score has changed NO LOAN! So here we sit no money! They nickel and dimed us with two appraisals and a lot of running around to meet a dead line. Which we did everything they asked of us. I mean everything!!! We put our home life on hold. We tried very hard not to spend any money and keep things up and running. It took them four months of a lot of bullshit stories to tell us NO!  At one point I told them that they were just waiting for us to screw up so they could us it against us! They said no we wouldn't do that to anyone!! BULLSHIT! I repeat don't go near this company they should be shut down and I'm surprised they don't have any lawsuits against them!! Maybe they do and no one can post about it?? This review is a NO STARS REVIEW!!! Stay away from IMPAC!

I called them before I saw these reviews.  They made me fill out a lot of stuff online and then called me back, the guy wasn't very nice and eventually told me I did not qualify.  They follow the same guidelines as major lenders from what I heard so the articles in which they are referenced are all false.. stay away!

Impac Mortage is impossible to work with.  They can't "find" payments sent electronically from my bank (Wells Fargo) despite conference calls with the bank people.  They put customers on hold forever and it's impossible to speak with a supervisor. If you fax information (with proof of fax) they say they can't find the fax.  Everything has to be "researched" with a 5-7 business day research period.  Please, if you have a choice, don't use Impac Mortgage.

Impac  Commercial Lending has unethical practices and have the worst customer service. They put hefty penalties for loans that are not revealed in an apparent manner. They give loans without explaining the terms which are of course in fine print. I am surprised that after the financial crisis they continue to work in such a way. Impac definitely need to be scrutinized by federal agencies on their practices and unethical ways of lending! We had a commercial loan with them with. At the time we got the loan there was a prepayment penalty. We modified the loan - they charged us the prepayment penalty when modifying the loan. On top of that they added a new prepayment penalty on the modified note. We were desperate for the modification so had to accept their terms! We sold the property and had to pay the prepayment penalty. So now we have paid penalty twice of hefty amountOn top of that, what was most ethical was when we sold the property recently and the escrow company got the payoff demand  , Impac charged us an extra month of interest. They said that we had to let them know 30 days in advance that we are closing the loan with them. That is a complete robbery! I am surprised that these practices are allowed- to charge an extra month of interest if the lender is not notified 30 days in advance that they will be closing the loan! This was over $5000.They have the worst customer service. Their senior management is the worst I have ever seen.  They are rude, lack the proper communication skills and plain out unethical. They refuse to communicate to their customers. If they do they are intimidating techniques for doing business.Mr. Ashmore who is the president of the company and who has an article in a reputable Forbes  magazine talks to you as if you a piece of garbage!. It is appalling to see a President of the company treating their customer so rudely and unethically. I am sure the way he acts is translated throughout the company.I do hope that their practices are challenged in doing commercial lending. {Please beware before doing any loans with them.

Absolute disaster, bunch of unprofessional people, don't waist your time. I have tried to refinance my existing loan in good standing with credit score of 790!!!!!they had me pay for an appraisal of my house and that's all they did ....after paying 450$ for an appraisal I  waited and  waited and waited....  For whatever unexplained reason all they could say there some issues ... Oh yeah what issues?  House appraised for 20000$ below what they thought it would and we are talking about $620000 loan for 30 years !!!!! give me a break please!!!!! I have been paying my current loan for 8 years with never being late, I have steady job , perfect credit score. there are issues .... what kind of issues?.......No one knows I suppose, besides the fact that having a property in San Francisco Bay Area you can't risk anything!!! Bottom line don't waist your time with this company they are ridiculously unprofessional and lucking knowledge on current mortgage lending:( horrible experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Impac Mortgage Holdings, Inc. Announces Initiative With Macquarie Group Focused On Non-QM Loan Products






Business Wire




Sep 15, 2014 9:25 AM EDT













 




























































  Impac Mortgage Holdings, Inc. (NYSE MKT: IMH), announces the launch of a new initiative with Macquarie Group, a global diversified financial services provider, on a major expansion into the non-qualified mortgage space.  Impac Mortgage recently launched its non-qualified mortgage product offering, the Alternative QM Program (“AltQM”), through its wholesale, correspondent and retail production channels. The AltQM programs are designed to offer brokers and correspondents alternative mortgage products, other than conforming agency products, to their clients. As part of this initiative, Impac will exclusively sell AltQM origination to Macquarie, which will provide funding towards this program.  Impac Mortgage is not new to the non-agency space, having originated $90 billion in non-agency mortgages between 1995-2007, and anticipates building on its proven track record with this product. Macquarie has extensive industry experience and an established track record in credit markets and mortgage finance.  The AltQM programs are designed to provide home financing options for high-quality borrowers just outside of current government-sponsored guidelines. All new Impac-originated loans will be fully documented, supported by significant down payment requirements, and meet all legal standards. The AltQM programs will target the underserved market of borrowers who are finding financing, for purchase or refinance, either non-existent or available with stringent and costly parameters.  To fit the needs of these borrowers, the AltQM Program suite will initially feature four products: The Alt-QM Jumbo, Alt-QM Agency, Alt-QM Income and Alt-QM Investor program. These loans will be held for eventual securitization.  Mr. Joseph Tomkinson, Chairman and CEO of Impac Mortgage Holdings, Inc., commented, “There is a tremendous opportunity in the mortgage market today to provide borrowers with a product that has previously been unavailable to them. Our successful history originating this type of product, combined with our relationship with Macquarie, will allow Impac to make an immediate impact in the non-qualified mortgage space.”

Loan Type:
Home Purchase

Home Price:
?

Home Price (Purchase)
When you get a mortgage to purchase a home, the lender uses the lower of the agreed-upon purchase price or the property's appraised value to determine your maximum loan amount. The loan amount divided by the property home price equals your loan-to-value ratio, or LTV. That ratio is one of the major factors that lenders use to set your mortgage rate. If your LTV exceeds 80 percent, you'll probably be required to pay mortgage insurance, which increases your monthly payment. If the property appraises for less than the agreed-on purchase price, you are not usually required to complete the purchase.

Home Value:
?

Home Value (Refinance)
This is your estimate of the current value of your property. When you refinance, your home is almost always evaluated by a licensed appraiser. The refinance loan amount divided by the property's appraised value equals your loan-to-value ratio (LTV), and that number is one of the major factors that determine your mortgage rate. To get an accurate refinance rate quote, your home value estimate must be reasonably accurate. 





Down Payment:
?

Down Payment
The down payment is the amount you pay upfront when you finance property. Your purchase price minus your down payment equals your mortgage amount. The higher your down payment, the more likely you are to be approved for a home loan. If your down payment is less than 20 percent of the purchase price, you'll probably be required to pay for mortgage insurance, which increases your monthly payment.

Single Family
Town House
Condo

Co-op



Credit Score:
?

Credit Score
Your credit score is a number designed to measure your credit-worthiness. It's based on a formula that combines many factors, including your payment history, amount of credit used and number of accounts. This number is used by lenders to calculate the probability that you'll default on your mortgage. Most lenders won't approve mortgages to applicants with credit scores lower than 620. Your credit score is one of the most important factors that determines your mortgage rate - applicants with higher scores are offered better mortgage rates.

Mortgage Rate Lock Recommendation
July 21, 2017 - Float
Today's Outlook
Just as at this time yesterday, it is looking as if mortgage rates might edge down today or perhaps hold steady. However, that forecast is based on early market trends and those frequently change speed or direction during the day. So a sharper fall or even a rise remain possible. Our prediction could be undermined in coming hours by economic, political, and geopolitical news that might affect the American and global economies, though little is scheduled for coming hours. Still, if we were currently buying a home, we would float our rate now and revisit that decision on Monday morning. Read on to discover why you might prefer to lock.
Average rates for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages were unchanged yesterday, remaining at a low for July. However, they remain noticeably higher than at some times earlier in the year, including toward the end of June. Indeed, if you glance at the chart above, you will see the previously firm downward trend since March sharply reversed in June. Rates could fall further in a sustained way but there is no guarantee of that. What happens next will depend on whether relevant news becomes more or less positive in coming days. Absent other factors, good news tends to push mortgage rates up, while bad news usually pulls them down.
Many experts would urge you to look now, particularly if you need to lock anyway within the next few weeks. Others might suggest you continue to float, providing you have time to ride out the coming near-inevitable ups and downs. They perceive recent rises as having mainly been the results of technical stimuli (to do with government bond markets in Europe) rather than firm evidence of improving health in the underlying U.S. economy. But neither group of experts has a crystal ball and there remains a real possibility of continuing volatility. So, either way, you are taking a chance. Only you can decide on the level of risk with which you are comfortable.

 Mortgage Rates Look Likely to Fall or Hold Steady Today


What Does it Mean to "Lock" Your Mortgage?
"Locking" your mortgage means that you and your lender have agreed on an interest rate and price for your home loan. Once your loan is locked, that's the rate and price you get, regardless of what happens in the financial markets. If rates go up, you're protected but if rates go down, you won't benefit either -- you close your loan at the rate you've locked and you can’t change it. Locks have expiration dates ranging from 30 to 60 days or more, and the longer your lock period, the more it costs. If you don't close your loan on time, you could end up paying a higher interest rate.
When Should You Lock?
You can lock in your loan at any time during the process. Until you lock your interest rate, you are said to be "floating" your mortgage. The only rule is that you have to lock in before you can close on your purchase or refinance.
The decision to lock or float your loan can have a long term impact so it’s important you make the right choice. That’s why we offer a quick rundown of the key factors that drive mortgage rates today and everything you need to know.






Mortgage Types

			The type of mortgage you get will affect the type of mortgage rate you qualify for. See below for the most common types of mortgages and what rates you could be eligible for.

Conventional Mortgage

	A conventional mortgage is one that is not insured by a government agency, such as HUD/FHA. It's typically a fixed-rate 30-year loan and the buyer must put down at least 20 percent of the purchase price of the home to qualify. Conventional mortgages typically come with excellent mortgage rates because of the down payment and stringent credit score requirements.

FHA Mortgage

	FHA mortgages are perfect for buyers with less than 20 percent down, a less-than-ideal credit score or first-time home buyers. Since these loans are backed and insured by the federal government, lenders are able to offer low, competitive rates to buyers. You can view current, up-to-date rates from our top-rated FHA lenders to see what type of rate you'd be eligible for.

VA Mortgage

	VA mortgages are reserved for veterans, active-duty personnel, Reservist/National Guard members, and their eligible surviving spouses. VA loans are incredibly attractive to those that qualify because of their no down payment requirement, no mortgage insurance premiums, low closing costs and low, negotiable interest rates.

Mortgage Process

			LendingTree makes getting a mortgage easy! Below are the steps to take to make your mortgage process as seamless as possible:


Determine how much house you can afford
View your credit score and improve it, if need be
Figure out which type of loan is right for you
Determine your down payment amount
Shop different lenders on LendingTree to guarantee you get the best rate possible

How Much House Can I Afford?

			Use our Home Affordability Calculator to see how much house you can afford. Simply plug in your gross annual income, down payment amount, monthly debts and credit score. Our calculator will give you a range of conservative home prices up to aggressive ones.




Mortgage Rates by State




            Mortgage rates can vary a lot between lenders on any given day. So, if you only get one mortgage quote, you won't have any idea if there's a better deal out there. That's why the best way to get a mortgage rate it to request quotes from multiple lenders and compare interest rates, loan terms and closing costs. It puts you on in charge and keeps the banks competing to get you the best rate possible. Remember, even .1 percent can amount to thousands of dollars over the course of a loan. Make sure you shop around!

There’s a mortgage product to meet almost any need
From first-time buyer programs to reverse mortgages to home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), today’s lenders offer products that allow borrowers to:

Buy property with a low (or no) down payment
Build a house
Exchange home equity for cash
Purchase rental housing
Refinance to a better interest rate
Supplement monthly income
Renovate their residences











 



Types of mortgage programs
Consumers should discuss their options with mortgage lenders to come up with the program that best meets their needs. Home mortgages can be classified in several ways:

Fixed rate or adjustable rate
Conforming or jumbo loan amount
Government or conventional
Purchase or refinance
Prime or sub-prime
Traditional (forward) or reverse
Construction or permanent
First or second mortgage
















What to do before applying for a mortgage loan?
Once they have selected a program, borrowers should compare mortgage rates and terms. That’s easy to do online with sites like LendingTree.com. When comparing mortgage programs, consumers should get the same information from each lender. This includes interest rate, duration of interest rate (Does it adjust? When? By how much?), loan term (15 year, 30 year, etc.), lender fees and 3rd party charges, APR, features like interest-only payments or prepayment penalties, and mortgage insurance or funding fees.
It’s important when shopping for a mortgage to get all home loan quotes at approximately the same time. Mortgage interest rates change constantly, because they are affected by the prices of bonds and mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which are bought and sold like stocks. Global economic news, Treasury auctions and decisions by the Federal Reserve can cause mortgage rates to move up and down very suddenly. Just as stock prices change all day long, so can mortgage rates. This means a quote from Lender A on Monday can’t reliably be compared to one from Lender B on Wednesday. LendingTree allows consumers to easily compare real-time quotes from competing mortgage lenders, helping them make informed choices and save money.

Incredibly Great Experience With This Mortgage Company. I'd rate it 10 stars if possible.

Last year we went through our Seattle-based mortgage broker when we re-financed our home loan. We were assigned to Impac Mortgage and completed the process. 

Last November, we received an e-mail from Leif Potter from Impac asking us if were were interested in doing a stream-line refinance which would lower our monthly payment. My wife made contact with Mr. Potter and agreed to start the process based on how professional he was on the phone.

By far this was the smoothest real estate loan we have ever done. What has impressed my wife and I more than anything was how professional Leif and his associates have been throughout the entire process. We were constantly kept up to date on time lines, document requests, and recent Federal loan changes. Unlike our previous re-finance process with our broker where we our kept us in the dark for months, and constantly received criptic e-mails regarding the delays, Impac has gone way beyond our expectations. There has not been one element of this loan transaction that has been a surprise, or has not been fully explained. We appreciated timely responses to any questions we had during the process.

My wife and I highly recommend this company if you are considering re-financing or establishing a new mortgage. More so, we highly recommend you contact Mr. Leif Potter. You will be delighted with his customer service and how well he communicates with his clients. He is well versed in the mortgage process and is someone you can trust.







This stupid company f***** up my property taxes. They've been collecting it in impounds but didn't bother to pay it . I find out today because I was doing my income taxes. I see there's a $120 late fee assessed. You think I can get those for her to pay it? I'm not holding my breath . just screwed up my tax refund too by not paying it last year. These people are f****** idiots!!!!!! Try to speak to a supervisor. They tell me no supervisor will take calls. What kind of fuked up place is this!







First, I was transferred four times, each time the representative of Impac was so rude they didn't give me a chance to explain how I needed help, if they had I wouldn't have been transferred so many times. 

After the above fun (not!), I sat on hold for 20 mins. 

I was finally connected to Sheranda who allowed me only to ask one question before she started rattling off a policy that states they cannot change the payment due date. If she had given me time to explain she would have discovered there was much more to my inquiry. 

This company is rude, unprofessional and I pray my loan is sold soon so I don't have to deal with these donkeys.







Relative to the other Alternative Lenders in the California lending market, Jason Vaccariello's team at Impac Mortgage offers the most efficient loan processing at the most competitive pricing & terms. I've brokered Alt-Doc deals to all of their competitors and from experience I can tell you that all other Alternative Lenders are administratively incompetent (bordering on negligent) whereas Jason and his Impac Mortgage team actually funds deals per their guidelines whereas others do not.  The loan process with Alternative Lenders are inherently more complicated and time-consuming than with conventional lenders as they are generally more complex, unique and complicated loan scenarios that conventional lenders have declined, such as stated income, or borrowers with damaged credit. Despite these challenges Impac still comes through and funds deals (even though it's not always easy). My brokerage has funded close to 100 deals with them so far and counting.







Zero Stars. These people are pure shit.

Got a pre-APPROVAL (not pre-qual) letter. Sold my house. Bought a plane ticket to go put an offer down where I wanted to move, then told I DON'T QUALIFY.

Unless you want a complete idiot to FUCK YOUR LIFE UP, avoid these pieces of shit.







If you are thinking of working for this company...DONT!!!!!  The company is unprofessional and lacks integrity especially as it relates to their Quality Control Department.  In specific the management of this department have egos and control issues that completely lacks an ounce of professionalism.  Seriously the VP needs to take a course in human ethics.







This company fuxxxxxcking sucks.  1 star from everyone, how is this company still in business?  They collect my taxes and they pay the county half of it.  I called them, press1, and 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 hold, 15 minutes later enter your loan number or social and wait and wait and wait, after half hour someone picks up, what is you loan number? what is your address? what is this and what is that.  You guys are taking my taxes and not paying them, you are responsible for that now us, OK, cancel my escrow I'll pay my own taxes, email us or fax us.  I emailed them and got auto email back saying we'll get back to you in 10 business days.  10 BUSINESS DAYS?  Fuk this company.







I refinanced my mortgage and the bill is due the 1st and late on the 16th. if they don't have it the 1st the phone is ringing off the DAMN hook. I never thought I would miss BofA but I do. in 22 years of owning homes, I have never ever been late and have an 819 fico score. these Aholes call and call and call with an automated call us back BS. I just blocked their #. FU impac!







I'm updating them to a 3 because they finally fixed my impound account and I haven't had any problems with them since. I still wouldn't recommend them due to the rough start.







My loan was sold to Impac Mortgage.  I am now counting down the days to refinance again (have to wait 6 months) so I can leave this company.  They charge to auto draft (from your checking account) to pay them.  I scheduled my auto draft on the 3rd (they charge from 5 days to 15 days).  They sent me a notice I was scheduled for the 5th (assuming so they could charge me?).  I had to call them once.  There is phone loop they put you through.  You keep pushing some number on the phone to get a rep.  I had to do this at least 25 times before I got a person.  I was starting to think there was no one to pick up the phone.  I would NEVER use this company.  I am waiting to refinance so I can leave this company.







Update: Is it now March and this has not been resolved. I was in touch with someone named Dargis Martinez who has been little to no help. I have since been reimbursed for the amount I overpaid in the first four months but they have yet to reconfigure my monthly mortgage payment. I have left 6 messages for Dargis and no response. If you would like to call her and try to get her to call me back her number is 757-452-5388.







DO NOT GO NEAR IMPAC MORTGAGE!*********** ZERO STARS***********They will ruin your life with the bullshit stories! They'll end up costing you more money and nothing but heart ache at the end!  They order an appraisal on our house in May of 2015  and it was completed. Only to find out that they ordered the wrong one and stated it was our fault. Not sure how that works but at any rate.... On the first appraisal it stated we needed to hang doors and add fire alarms to finish our process. Which we did. A few months go by and they decided they needed another appraisal which was going to be much more extensive and costly.  Really two appraisals? I guestioned them about the second appraisal and raised holly hell with them. Which them they come back and state you need to add stairs on deck and add carpet to the house. Never mentioned in first appraisal to be completed! Mined you yet this is a refinance on a rental for a complete remodel. We own the home outright. Just need a little money for a home facelift. The home appraised for more then what we are asking for in a loan. HMMMMM! So with that being said, we added the stairs and the carpet. The home is almost done on the inside (Very small stuff)  now we just need a little paint on the outside and some fence repairs and it will be ready for a renter. The entire time we have worked on this home hoping for a little money. We were hoping to have this rented out on June 1St. Nope not a chance!  The second appraisal was done and our little investment appraised for much higher then the first appraisal. Our hard work has paid off! Which we thought......So we started our loan process on 04/06/2015 in hope to have the remodel completed and rented out by 6/1/2015. Nope still no loan and not rented out. On 08/17/2015 we were told we were going to sign papers on 08/18/2015 and have our money soon. Well with that being said, on 08/18/2015 @2:30 PM we still had not heard a word from them so I sent an email with no response back and they close at 5PM. Finally at 4:30PM I got a call stating sorry your paperwork has expired and your credit score has changed NO LOAN! So here we sit no money! They nickel and dimed us with two appraisals and a lot of running around to meet a dead line. Which we did everything they asked of us. I mean everything!!! We put our home life on hold. We tried very hard not to spend any money and keep things up and running. It took them four months of a lot of bullshit stories to tell us NO!  At one point I told them that they were just waiting for us to screw up so they could us it against us! They said no we wouldn't do that to anyone!! BULLSHIT! I repeat don't go near this company they should be shut down and I'm surprised they don't have any lawsuits against them!! Maybe they do and no one can post about it?? This review is a NO STARS REVIEW!!! Stay away from IMPAC!







I called them before I saw these reviews.  They made me fill out a lot of stuff online and then called me back, the guy wasn't very nice and eventually told me I did not qualify.  They follow the same guidelines as major lenders from what I heard so the articles in which they are referenced are all false.. stay away!







Impac Mortage is impossible to work with.  They can't "find" payments sent electronically from my bank (Wells Fargo) despite conference calls with the bank people.  They put customers on hold forever and it's impossible to speak with a supervisor. If you fax information (with proof of fax) they say they can't find the fax.  Everything has to be "researched" with a 5-7 business day research period.  Please, if you have a choice, don't use Impac Mortgage.







Impac  Commercial Lending has unethical practices and have the worst customer service. They put hefty penalties for loans that are not revealed in an apparent manner. They give loans without explaining the terms which are of course in fine print. I am surprised that after the financial crisis they continue to work in such a way. Impac definitely need to be scrutinized by federal agencies on their practices and unethical ways of lending! 

We had a commercial loan with them with. At the time we got the loan there was a prepayment penalty. We modified the loan - they charged us the prepayment penalty when modifying the loan. On top of that they added a new prepayment penalty on the modified note. We were desperate for the modification so had to accept their terms! We sold the property and had to pay the prepayment penalty. So now we have paid penalty twice of hefty amount

On top of that, what was most ethical was when we sold the property recently and the escrow company got the payoff demand  , Impac charged us an extra month of interest. They said that we had to let them know 30 days in advance that we are closing the loan with them. That is a complete robbery! I am surprised that these practices are allowed- to charge an extra month of interest if the lender is not notified 30 days in advance that they will be closing the loan! This was over $5000.

They have the worst customer service. 
Their senior management is the worst I have ever seen.  They are rude, lack the proper communication skills and plain out unethical. They refuse to communicate to their customers. If they do they are intimidating techniques for doing business.

Mr. Ashmore who is the president of the company and who has an article in a reputable Forbes  magazine talks to you as if you a piece of garbage!. It is appalling to see a President of the company treating their customer so rudely and unethically. I am sure the way he acts is translated throughout the company.
I do hope that their practices are challenged in doing commercial lending. {Please beware before doing any loans with them.







Absolute disaster, bunch of unprofessional people, don't waist your time. I have tried to refinance my existing loan in good standing with credit score of 790!!!!!they had me pay for an appraisal of my house and that's all they did ....after paying 450$ for an appraisal I  waited and  waited and waited....  For whatever unexplained reason all they could say there some issues ... Oh yeah what issues?  House appraised for 20000$ below what they thought it would and we are talking about $620000 loan for 30 years !!!!! give me a break please!!!!! I have been paying my current loan for 8 years with never being late, I have steady job , perfect credit score. there are issues .... what kind of issues?.......No one knows I suppose, besides the fact that having a property in San Francisco Bay Area you can't risk anything!!! Bottom line don't waist your time with this company they are ridiculously unprofessional and lucking knowledge on current mortgage lending:( horrible experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Incredibly Great Experience With This Mortgage Company. I'd rate it 10 stars if possible.Last year we went through our Seattle-based mortgage broker when we re-financed our home loan. We were assigned to Impac Mortgage and completed the process. Last November, we received an e-mail from Leif Potter from Impac asking us if were were interested in doing a stream-line refinance which would lower our monthly payment. My wife made contact with Mr. Potter and agreed to start the process based on how professional he was on the phone.By far this was the smoothest real estate loan we have ever done. What has impressed my wife and I more than anything was how professional Leif and his associates have been throughout the entire process. We were constantly kept up to date on time lines, document requests, and recent Federal loan changes. Unlike our previous re-finance process with our broker where we our kept us in the dark for months, and constantly received criptic e-mails regarding the delays, Impac has gone way beyond our expectations. There has not been one element of this loan transaction that has been a surprise, or has not been fully explained. We appreciated timely responses to any questions we had during the process.My wife and I highly recommend this company if you are considering re-financing or establishing a new mortgage. More so, we highly recommend you contact Mr. Leif Potter. You will be delighted with his customer service and how well he communicates with his clients. He is well versed in the mortgage process and is someone you can trust.

This stupid company f***** up my property taxes. They've been collecting it in impounds but didn't bother to pay it . I find out today because I was doing my income taxes. I see there's a $120 late fee assessed. You think I can get those for her to pay it? I'm not holding my breath . just screwed up my tax refund too by not paying it last year. These people are f****** idiots!!!!!! Try to speak to a supervisor. They tell me no supervisor will take calls. What kind of fuked up place is this!

First, I was transferred four times, each time the representative of Impac was so rude they didn't give me a chance to explain how I needed help, if they had I wouldn't have been transferred so many times. After the above fun (not!), I sat on hold for 20 mins. I was finally connected to Sheranda who allowed me only to ask one question before she started rattling off a policy that states they cannot change the payment due date. If she had given me time to explain she would have discovered there was much more to my inquiry. This company is rude, unprofessional and I pray my loan is sold soon so I don't have to deal with these donkeys.

Relative to the other Alternative Lenders in the California lending market, Jason Vaccariello's team at Impac Mortgage offers the most efficient loan processing at the most competitive pricing & terms. I've brokered Alt-Doc deals to all of their competitors and from experience I can tell you that all other Alternative Lenders are administratively incompetent (bordering on negligent) whereas Jason and his Impac Mortgage team actually funds deals per their guidelines whereas others do not.  The loan process with Alternative Lenders are inherently more complicated and time-consuming than with conventional lenders as they are generally more complex, unique and complicated loan scenarios that conventional lenders have declined, such as stated income, or borrowers with damaged credit. Despite these challenges Impac still comes through and funds deals (even though it's not always easy). My brokerage has funded close to 100 deals with them so far and counting.

If you are thinking of working for this company...DONT!!!!!  The company is unprofessional and lacks integrity especially as it relates to their Quality Control Department.  In specific the management of this department have egos and control issues that completely lacks an ounce of professionalism.  Seriously the VP needs to take a course in human ethics.

This company fuxxxxxcking sucks.  1 star from everyone, how is this company still in business?  They collect my taxes and they pay the county half of it.  I called them, press1, and 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 hold, 15 minutes later enter your loan number or social and wait and wait and wait, after half hour someone picks up, what is you loan number? what is your address? what is this and what is that.  You guys are taking my taxes and not paying them, you are responsible for that now us, OK, cancel my escrow I'll pay my own taxes, email us or fax us.  I emailed them and got auto email back saying we'll get back to you in 10 business days.  10 BUSINESS DAYS?  Fuk this company.

I'm updating them to a 3 because they finally fixed my impound account and I haven't had any problems with them since. I still wouldn't recommend them due to the rough start.

So here I sit weeks later,  they lost my  check i sent certified mail start my escrow,  I helped them locate it but then they applied it to my mortgage payments rather than escrow even though I wrote escrow on the check and mailed it to the escrow dept. A week ago I notified them of their mistake which they a knowledged with a promise that this morning my escrow account would be set up. Today not only did they not set it up,  they denied it because it dd not meet the deadline,  certified mail says that they received it 2 weeks before the deadline.  Plus they charge me a late fee on the first auto payment they lost. You have been warned!

Refinancing with Impac was fairly easy and I got a great rate. The problem is they were in such a hurry to sign me up that the salesman did not set up a escrow account and when I asked about it he said they don't do that until after they receive the first mortgage payment. (This is my 5th time purchasing or refinancing and I've ALWAYS had my escrow account set up at the time of transaction). It is 4 months later and I am still trying to set up the account only rather than building it into the loan which is the norm they need a check for $5,500--Which I scraped together and sent it certified mail--the only address I was given was a P.O.  Box so that's not making me feel very secure. To top it off they have lost this months payment which my bank shows as processed 2 weeks ago. My bank faxed them the proof and gave me a copy of proof that the fax went through. I just got off the phone with Impac who told me over the  they never received the fax and had me email my statement to them. They now say that they received the email and it will take 5 working days to research it. Meanwhile they will be charging me a late fee in 4 days and if they do not clear up their mess soon I fear it will go on my credit report. We have dealt with Impac over the phone at approx. 20 times in the past few months trying to get them to fix their mistakes. More contact than I have had over the past 33 years with my other lenders combined. If you have taken the time to read all of this I'd hope you'd be wise enough to find a company that is more professional.

My loan was sold to Impac Mortgage.  I am now counting down the days to refinance again (have to wait 6 months) so I can leave this company.  They charge to auto draft (from your checking account) to pay them.  I scheduled my auto draft on the 3rd (they charge from 5 days to 15 days).  They sent me a notice I was scheduled for the 5th (assuming so they could charge me?).  I had to call them once.  There is phone loop they put you through.  You keep pushing some number on the phone to get a rep.  I had to do this at least 25 times before I got a person.  I was starting to think there was no one to pick up the phone.  I would NEVER use this company.  I am waiting to refinance so I can leave this company.

Updated review



Update: Is it now March and this has not been resolved. I was in touch with someone named Dargis Martinez who has been little to no help. I have since been reimbursed for the amount I overpaid in the first four months but they have yet to reconfigure my monthly mortgage payment. I have left 6 messages for Dargis and no response. If you would like to call her and try to get her to call me back her number is 757-452-5388.

I paid off my hazard insurance in October 2014 (their policy when you switch insurance companies in the first year) and was told my loan would need to be readjusted to reflect the lower mortgage. First I was told it would be done in November. Then it wasn't, and I was told no longer than December it would be done. When I called in January to see if it was done, of course they said it hadn't yet. They told me 15 more business days. So, I called 15 business days later. And guess what? Still not done. Someone named Caja said she put in an expedited request and assured me that either that day but no later than the following day it would be resolved. I called 2 days later and guess what? Still not done. I call back again today, wait on hold 17 minutes only to speak with someone for a moment, get placed back on hold and hung up on. I am here, sitting on hold again now with a manager who says it still hasn't been done. I am just tired of being told it will be taken care of and it isn't. And I have been overpaying for 3 months now. How easy do you think it will be for me to get the money I have over payed? I only wish they would sell my loan to someone else. Oh and I have a credit score of over 800 and always make payments on time. I never wish this kind of service on anyone else.

DO NOT GO NEAR IMPAC MORTGAGE!*********** ZERO STARS***********They will ruin your life with the bullshit stories! They'll end up costing you more money and nothing but heart ache at the end!  They order an appraisal on our house in May of 2015  and it was completed. Only to find out that they ordered the wrong one and stated it was our fault. Not sure how that works but at any rate.... On the first appraisal it stated we needed to hang doors and add fire alarms to finish our process. Which we did. A few months go by and they decided they needed another appraisal which was going to be much more extensive and costly.  Really two appraisals? I guestioned them about the second appraisal and raised holly hell with them. Which them they come back and state you need to add stairs on deck and add carpet to the house. Never mentioned in first appraisal to be completed! Mined you yet this is a refinance on a rental for a complete remodel. We own the home outright. Just need a little money for a home facelift. The home appraised for more then what we are asking for in a loan. HMMMMM! So with that being said, we added the stairs and the carpet. The home is almost done on the inside (Very small stuff)  now we just need a little paint on the outside and some fence repairs and it will be ready for a renter. The entire time we have worked on this home hoping for a little money. We were hoping to have this rented out on June 1St. Nope not a chance!  The second appraisal was done and our little investment appraised for much higher then the first appraisal. Our hard work has paid off! Which we thought......So we started our loan process on 04/06/2015 in hope to have the remodel completed and rented out by 6/1/2015. Nope still no loan and not rented out. On 08/17/2015 we were told we were going to sign papers on 08/18/2015 and have our money soon. Well with that being said, on 08/18/2015 @2:30 PM we still had not heard a word from them so I sent an email with no response back and they close at 5PM. Finally at 4:30PM I got a call stating sorry your paperwork has expired and your credit score has changed NO LOAN! So here we sit no money! They nickel and dimed us with two appraisals and a lot of running around to meet a dead line. Which we did everything they asked of us. I mean everything!!! We put our home life on hold. We tried very hard not to spend any money and keep things up and running. It took them four months of a lot of bullshit stories to tell us NO!  At one point I told them that they were just waiting for us to screw up so they could us it against us! They said no we wouldn't do that to anyone!! BULLSHIT! I repeat don't go near this company they should be shut down and I'm surprised they don't have any lawsuits against them!! Maybe they do and no one can post about it?? This review is a NO STARS REVIEW!!! Stay away from IMPAC!

I called them before I saw these reviews.  They made me fill out a lot of stuff online and then called me back, the guy wasn't very nice and eventually told me I did not qualify.  They follow the same guidelines as major lenders from what I heard so the articles in which they are referenced are all false.. stay away!

Impac Mortage is impossible to work with.  They can't "find" payments sent electronically from my bank (Wells Fargo) despite conference calls with the bank people.  They put customers on hold forever and it's impossible to speak with a supervisor. If you fax information (with proof of fax) they say they can't find the fax.  Everything has to be "researched" with a 5-7 business day research period.  Please, if you have a choice, don't use Impac Mortgage.

Impac  Commercial Lending has unethical practices and have the worst customer service. They put hefty penalties for loans that are not revealed in an apparent manner. They give loans without explaining the terms which are of course in fine print. I am surprised that after the financial crisis they continue to work in such a way. Impac definitely need to be scrutinized by federal agencies on their practices and unethical ways of lending! We had a commercial loan with them with. At the time we got the loan there was a prepayment penalty. We modified the loan - they charged us the prepayment penalty when modifying the loan. On top of that they added a new prepayment penalty on the modified note. We were desperate for the modification so had to accept their terms! We sold the property and had to pay the prepayment penalty. So now we have paid penalty twice of hefty amountOn top of that, what was most ethical was when we sold the property recently and the escrow company got the payoff demand  , Impac charged us an extra month of interest. They said that we had to let them know 30 days in advance that we are closing the loan with them. That is a complete robbery! I am surprised that these practices are allowed- to charge an extra month of interest if the lender is not notified 30 days in advance that they will be closing the loan! This was over $5000.They have the worst customer service. Their senior management is the worst I have ever seen.  They are rude, lack the proper communication skills and plain out unethical. They refuse to communicate to their customers. If they do they are intimidating techniques for doing business.Mr. Ashmore who is the president of the company and who has an article in a reputable Forbes  magazine talks to you as if you a piece of garbage!. It is appalling to see a President of the company treating their customer so rudely and unethically. I am sure the way he acts is translated throughout the company.I do hope that their practices are challenged in doing commercial lending. {Please beware before doing any loans with them.

Absolute disaster, bunch of unprofessional people, don't waist your time. I have tried to refinance my existing loan in good standing with credit score of 790!!!!!they had me pay for an appraisal of my house and that's all they did ....after paying 450$ for an appraisal I  waited and  waited and waited....  For whatever unexplained reason all they could say there some issues ... Oh yeah what issues?  House appraised for 20000$ below what they thought it would and we are talking about $620000 loan for 30 years !!!!! give me a break please!!!!! I have been paying my current loan for 8 years with never being late, I have steady job , perfect credit score. there are issues .... what kind of issues?.......No one knows I suppose, besides the fact that having a property in San Francisco Bay Area you can't risk anything!!! Bottom line don't waist your time with this company they are ridiculously unprofessional and lucking knowledge on current mortgage lending:( horrible experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Incredibly Great Experience With This Mortgage Company. I'd rate it 10 stars if possible.

Last year we went through our Seattle-based mortgage broker when we re-financed our home loan. We were assigned to Impac Mortgage and completed the process. 

Last November, we received an e-mail from Leif Potter from Impac asking us if were were interested in doing a stream-line refinance which would lower our monthly payment. My wife made contact with Mr. Potter and agreed to start the process based on how professional he was on the phone.

By far this was the smoothest real estate loan we have ever done. What has impressed my wife and I more than anything was how professional Leif and his associates have been throughout the entire process. We were constantly kept up to date on time lines, document requests, and recent Federal loan changes. Unlike our previous re-finance process with our broker where we our kept us in the dark for months, and constantly received criptic e-mails regarding the delays, Impac has gone way beyond our expectations. There has not been one element of this loan transaction that has been a surprise, or has not been fully explained. We appreciated timely responses to any questions we had during the process.

My wife and I highly recommend this company if you are considering re-financing or establishing a new mortgage. More so, we highly recommend you contact Mr. Leif Potter. You will be delighted with his customer service and how well he communicates with his clients. He is well versed in the mortgage process and is someone you can trust.







This stupid company f***** up my property taxes. They've been collecting it in impounds but didn't bother to pay it . I find out today because I was doing my income taxes. I see there's a $120 late fee assessed. You think I can get those for her to pay it? I'm not holding my breath . just screwed up my tax refund too by not paying it last year. These people are f****** idiots!!!!!! Try to speak to a supervisor. They tell me no supervisor will take calls. What kind of fuked up place is this!







First, I was transferred four times, each time the representative of Impac was so rude they didn't give me a chance to explain how I needed help, if they had I wouldn't have been transferred so many times. 

After the above fun (not!), I sat on hold for 20 mins. 

I was finally connected to Sheranda who allowed me only to ask one question before she started rattling off a policy that states they cannot change the payment due date. If she had given me time to explain she would have discovered there was much more to my inquiry. 

This company is rude, unprofessional and I pray my loan is sold soon so I don't have to deal with these donkeys.







Relative to the other Alternative Lenders in the California lending market, Jason Vaccariello's team at Impac Mortgage offers the most efficient loan processing at the most competitive pricing & terms. I've brokered Alt-Doc deals to all of their competitors and from experience I can tell you that all other Alternative Lenders are administratively incompetent (bordering on negligent) whereas Jason and his Impac Mortgage team actually funds deals per their guidelines whereas others do not.  The loan process with Alternative Lenders are inherently more complicated and time-consuming than with conventional lenders as they are generally more complex, unique and complicated loan scenarios that conventional lenders have declined, such as stated income, or borrowers with damaged credit. Despite these challenges Impac still comes through and funds deals (even though it's not always easy). My brokerage has funded close to 100 deals with them so far and counting.







Zero Stars. These people are pure shit.

Got a pre-APPROVAL (not pre-qual) letter. Sold my house. Bought a plane ticket to go put an offer down where I wanted to move, then told I DON'T QUALIFY.

Unless you want a complete idiot to FUCK YOUR LIFE UP, avoid these pieces of shit.







If you are thinking of working for this company...DONT!!!!!  The company is unprofessional and lacks integrity especially as it relates to their Quality Control Department.  In specific the management of this department have egos and control issues that completely lacks an ounce of professionalism.  Seriously the VP needs to take a course in human ethics.







This company fuxxxxxcking sucks.  1 star from everyone, how is this company still in business?  They collect my taxes and they pay the county half of it.  I called them, press1, and 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 hold, 15 minutes later enter your loan number or social and wait and wait and wait, after half hour someone picks up, what is you loan number? what is your address? what is this and what is that.  You guys are taking my taxes and not paying them, you are responsible for that now us, OK, cancel my escrow I'll pay my own taxes, email us or fax us.  I emailed them and got auto email back saying we'll get back to you in 10 business days.  10 BUSINESS DAYS?  Fuk this company.







I refinanced my mortgage and the bill is due the 1st and late on the 16th. if they don't have it the 1st the phone is ringing off the DAMN hook. I never thought I would miss BofA but I do. in 22 years of owning homes, I have never ever been late and have an 819 fico score. these Aholes call and call and call with an automated call us back BS. I just blocked their #. FU impac!







I'm updating them to a 3 because they finally fixed my impound account and I haven't had any problems with them since. I still wouldn't recommend them due to the rough start.







My loan was sold to Impac Mortgage.  I am now counting down the days to refinance again (have to wait 6 months) so I can leave this company.  They charge to auto draft (from your checking account) to pay them.  I scheduled my auto draft on the 3rd (they charge from 5 days to 15 days).  They sent me a notice I was scheduled for the 5th (assuming so they could charge me?).  I had to call them once.  There is phone loop they put you through.  You keep pushing some number on the phone to get a rep.  I had to do this at least 25 times before I got a person.  I was starting to think there was no one to pick up the phone.  I would NEVER use this company.  I am waiting to refinance so I can leave this company.







Update: Is it now March and this has not been resolved. I was in touch with someone named Dargis Martinez who has been little to no help. I have since been reimbursed for the amount I overpaid in the first four months but they have yet to reconfigure my monthly mortgage payment. I have left 6 messages for Dargis and no response. If you would like to call her and try to get her to call me back her number is 757-452-5388.







DO NOT GO NEAR IMPAC MORTGAGE!*********** ZERO STARS***********They will ruin your life with the bullshit stories! They'll end up costing you more money and nothing but heart ache at the end!  They order an appraisal on our house in May of 2015  and it was completed. Only to find out that they ordered the wrong one and stated it was our fault. Not sure how that works but at any rate.... On the first appraisal it stated we needed to hang doors and add fire alarms to finish our process. Which we did. A few months go by and they decided they needed another appraisal which was going to be much more extensive and costly.  Really two appraisals? I guestioned them about the second appraisal and raised holly hell with them. Which them they come back and state you need to add stairs on deck and add carpet to the house. Never mentioned in first appraisal to be completed! Mined you yet this is a refinance on a rental for a complete remodel. We own the home outright. Just need a little money for a home facelift. The home appraised for more then what we are asking for in a loan. HMMMMM! So with that being said, we added the stairs and the carpet. The home is almost done on the inside (Very small stuff)  now we just need a little paint on the outside and some fence repairs and it will be ready for a renter. The entire time we have worked on this home hoping for a little money. We were hoping to have this rented out on June 1St. Nope not a chance!  The second appraisal was done and our little investment appraised for much higher then the first appraisal. Our hard work has paid off! Which we thought......So we started our loan process on 04/06/2015 in hope to have the remodel completed and rented out by 6/1/2015. Nope still no loan and not rented out. On 08/17/2015 we were told we were going to sign papers on 08/18/2015 and have our money soon. Well with that being said, on 08/18/2015 @2:30 PM we still had not heard a word from them so I sent an email with no response back and they close at 5PM. Finally at 4:30PM I got a call stating sorry your paperwork has expired and your credit score has changed NO LOAN! So here we sit no money! They nickel and dimed us with two appraisals and a lot of running around to meet a dead line. Which we did everything they asked of us. I mean everything!!! We put our home life on hold. We tried very hard not to spend any money and keep things up and running. It took them four months of a lot of bullshit stories to tell us NO!  At one point I told them that they were just waiting for us to screw up so they could us it against us! They said no we wouldn't do that to anyone!! BULLSHIT! I repeat don't go near this company they should be shut down and I'm surprised they don't have any lawsuits against them!! Maybe they do and no one can post about it?? This review is a NO STARS REVIEW!!! Stay away from IMPAC!







I called them before I saw these reviews.  They made me fill out a lot of stuff online and then called me back, the guy wasn't very nice and eventually told me I did not qualify.  They follow the same guidelines as major lenders from what I heard so the articles in which they are referenced are all false.. stay away!







Impac Mortage is impossible to work with.  They can't "find" payments sent electronically from my bank (Wells Fargo) despite conference calls with the bank people.  They put customers on hold forever and it's impossible to speak with a supervisor. If you fax information (with proof of fax) they say they can't find the fax.  Everything has to be "researched" with a 5-7 business day research period.  Please, if you have a choice, don't use Impac Mortgage.







Impac  Commercial Lending has unethical practices and have the worst customer service. They put hefty penalties for loans that are not revealed in an apparent manner. They give loans without explaining the terms which are of course in fine print. I am surprised that after the financial crisis they continue to work in such a way. Impac definitely need to be scrutinized by federal agencies on their practices and unethical ways of lending! 

We had a commercial loan with them with. At the time we got the loan there was a prepayment penalty. We modified the loan - they charged us the prepayment penalty when modifying the loan. On top of that they added a new prepayment penalty on the modified note. We were desperate for the modification so had to accept their terms! We sold the property and had to pay the prepayment penalty. So now we have paid penalty twice of hefty amount

On top of that, what was most ethical was when we sold the property recently and the escrow company got the payoff demand  , Impac charged us an extra month of interest. They said that we had to let them know 30 days in advance that we are closing the loan with them. That is a complete robbery! I am surprised that these practices are allowed- to charge an extra month of interest if the lender is not notified 30 days in advance that they will be closing the loan! This was over $5000.

They have the worst customer service. 
Their senior management is the worst I have ever seen.  They are rude, lack the proper communication skills and plain out unethical. They refuse to communicate to their customers. If they do they are intimidating techniques for doing business.

Mr. Ashmore who is the president of the company and who has an article in a reputable Forbes  magazine talks to you as if you a piece of garbage!. It is appalling to see a President of the company treating their customer so rudely and unethically. I am sure the way he acts is translated throughout the company.
I do hope that their practices are challenged in doing commercial lending. {Please beware before doing any loans with them.







Absolute disaster, bunch of unprofessional people, don't waist your time. I have tried to refinance my existing loan in good standing with credit score of 790!!!!!they had me pay for an appraisal of my house and that's all they did ....after paying 450$ for an appraisal I  waited and  waited and waited....  For whatever unexplained reason all they could say there some issues ... Oh yeah what issues?  House appraised for 20000$ below what they thought it would and we are talking about $620000 loan for 30 years !!!!! give me a break please!!!!! I have been paying my current loan for 8 years with never being late, I have steady job , perfect credit score. there are issues .... what kind of issues?.......No one knows I suppose, besides the fact that having a property in San Francisco Bay Area you can't risk anything!!! Bottom line don't waist your time with this company they are ridiculously unprofessional and lucking knowledge on current mortgage lending:( horrible experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Incredibly Great Experience With This Mortgage Company. I'd rate it 10 stars if possible.Last year we went through our Seattle-based mortgage broker when we re-financed our home loan. We were assigned to Impac Mortgage and completed the process. Last November, we received an e-mail from Leif Potter from Impac asking us if were were interested in doing a stream-line refinance which would lower our monthly payment. My wife made contact with Mr. Potter and agreed to start the process based on how professional he was on the phone.By far this was the smoothest real estate loan we have ever done. What has impressed my wife and I more than anything was how professional Leif and his associates have been throughout the entire process. We were constantly kept up to date on time lines, document requests, and recent Federal loan changes. Unlike our previous re-finance process with our broker where we our kept us in the dark for months, and constantly received criptic e-mails regarding the delays, Impac has gone way beyond our expectations. There has not been one element of this loan transaction that has been a surprise, or has not been fully explained. We appreciated timely responses to any questions we had during the process.My wife and I highly recommend this company if you are considering re-financing or establishing a new mortgage. More so, we highly recommend you contact Mr. Leif Potter. You will be delighted with his customer service and how well he communicates with his clients. He is well versed in the mortgage process and is someone you can trust.

This stupid company f***** up my property taxes. They've been collecting it in impounds but didn't bother to pay it . I find out today because I was doing my income taxes. I see there's a $120 late fee assessed. You think I can get those for her to pay it? I'm not holding my breath . just screwed up my tax refund too by not paying it last year. These people are f****** idiots!!!!!! Try to speak to a supervisor. They tell me no supervisor will take calls. What kind of fuked up place is this!

First, I was transferred four times, each time the representative of Impac was so rude they didn't give me a chance to explain how I needed help, if they had I wouldn't have been transferred so many times. After the above fun (not!), I sat on hold for 20 mins. I was finally connected to Sheranda who allowed me only to ask one question before she started rattling off a policy that states they cannot change the payment due date. If she had given me time to explain she would have discovered there was much more to my inquiry. This company is rude, unprofessional and I pray my loan is sold soon so I don't have to deal with these donkeys.

Relative to the other Alternative Lenders in the California lending market, Jason Vaccariello's team at Impac Mortgage offers the most efficient loan processing at the most competitive pricing & terms. I've brokered Alt-Doc deals to all of their competitors and from experience I can tell you that all other Alternative Lenders are administratively incompetent (bordering on negligent) whereas Jason and his Impac Mortgage team actually funds deals per their guidelines whereas others do not.  The loan process with Alternative Lenders are inherently more complicated and time-consuming than with conventional lenders as they are generally more complex, unique and complicated loan scenarios that conventional lenders have declined, such as stated income, or borrowers with damaged credit. Despite these challenges Impac still comes through and funds deals (even though it's not always easy). My brokerage has funded close to 100 deals with them so far and counting.

If you are thinking of working for this company...DONT!!!!!  The company is unprofessional and lacks integrity especially as it relates to their Quality Control Department.  In specific the management of this department have egos and control issues that completely lacks an ounce of professionalism.  Seriously the VP needs to take a course in human ethics.

So here I sit weeks later,  they lost my  check i sent certified mail start my escrow,  I helped them locate it but then they applied it to my mortgage payments rather than escrow even though I wrote escrow on the check and mailed it to the escrow dept. A week ago I notified them of their mistake which they a knowledged with a promise that this morning my escrow account would be set up. Today not only did they not set it up,  they denied it because it dd not meet the deadline,  certified mail says that they received it 2 weeks before the deadline.  Plus they charge me a late fee on the first auto payment they lost. You have been warned!

Refinancing with Impac was fairly easy and I got a great rate. The problem is they were in such a hurry to sign me up that the salesman did not set up a escrow account and when I asked about it he said they don't do that until after they receive the first mortgage payment. (This is my 5th time purchasing or refinancing and I've ALWAYS had my escrow account set up at the time of transaction). It is 4 months later and I am still trying to set up the account only rather than building it into the loan which is the norm they need a check for $5,500--Which I scraped together and sent it certified mail--the only address I was given was a P.O.  Box so that's not making me feel very secure. To top it off they have lost this months payment which my bank shows as processed 2 weeks ago. My bank faxed them the proof and gave me a copy of proof that the fax went through. I just got off the phone with Impac who told me over the  they never received the fax and had me email my statement to them. They now say that they received the email and it will take 5 working days to research it. Meanwhile they will be charging me a late fee in 4 days and if they do not clear up their mess soon I fear it will go on my credit report. We have dealt with Impac over the phone at approx. 20 times in the past few months trying to get them to fix their mistakes. More contact than I have had over the past 33 years with my other lenders combined. If you have taken the time to read all of this I'd hope you'd be wise enough to find a company that is more professional.

My loan was sold to Impac Mortgage.  I am now counting down the days to refinance again (have to wait 6 months) so I can leave this company.  They charge to auto draft (from your checking account) to pay them.  I scheduled my auto draft on the 3rd (they charge from 5 days to 15 days).  They sent me a notice I was scheduled for the 5th (assuming so they could charge me?).  I had to call them once.  There is phone loop they put you through.  You keep pushing some number on the phone to get a rep.  I had to do this at least 25 times before I got a person.  I was starting to think there was no one to pick up the phone.  I would NEVER use this company.  I am waiting to refinance so I can leave this company.

Updated review



Update: Is it now March and this has not been resolved. I was in touch with someone named Dargis Martinez who has been little to no help. I have since been reimbursed for the amount I overpaid in the first four months but they have yet to reconfigure my monthly mortgage payment. I have left 6 messages for Dargis and no response. If you would like to call her and try to get her to call me back her number is 757-452-5388.

I paid off my hazard insurance in October 2014 (their policy when you switch insurance companies in the first year) and was told my loan would need to be readjusted to reflect the lower mortgage. First I was told it would be done in November. Then it wasn't, and I was told no longer than December it would be done. When I called in January to see if it was done, of course they said it hadn't yet. They told me 15 more business days. So, I called 15 business days later. And guess what? Still not done. Someone named Caja said she put in an expedited request and assured me that either that day but no later than the following day it would be resolved. I called 2 days later and guess what? Still not done. I call back again today, wait on hold 17 minutes only to speak with someone for a moment, get placed back on hold and hung up on. I am here, sitting on hold again now with a manager who says it still hasn't been done. I am just tired of being told it will be taken care of and it isn't. And I have been overpaying for 3 months now. How easy do you think it will be for me to get the money I have over payed? I only wish they would sell my loan to someone else. Oh and I have a credit score of over 800 and always make payments on time. I never wish this kind of service on anyone else.

DO NOT GO NEAR IMPAC MORTGAGE!*********** ZERO STARS***********They will ruin your life with the bullshit stories! They'll end up costing you more money and nothing but heart ache at the end!  They order an appraisal on our house in May of 2015  and it was completed. Only to find out that they ordered the wrong one and stated it was our fault. Not sure how that works but at any rate.... On the first appraisal it stated we needed to hang doors and add fire alarms to finish our process. Which we did. A few months go by and they decided they needed another appraisal which was going to be much more extensive and costly.  Really two appraisals? I guestioned them about the second appraisal and raised holly hell with them. Which them they come back and state you need to add stairs on deck and add carpet to the house. Never mentioned in first appraisal to be completed! Mined you yet this is a refinance on a rental for a complete remodel. We own the home outright. Just need a little money for a home facelift. The home appraised for more then what we are asking for in a loan. HMMMMM! So with that being said, we added the stairs and the carpet. The home is almost done on the inside (Very small stuff)  now we just need a little paint on the outside and some fence repairs and it will be ready for a renter. The entire time we have worked on this home hoping for a little money. We were hoping to have this rented out on June 1St. Nope not a chance!  The second appraisal was done and our little investment appraised for much higher then the first appraisal. Our hard work has paid off! Which we thought......So we started our loan process on 04/06/2015 in hope to have the remodel completed and rented out by 6/1/2015. Nope still no loan and not rented out. On 08/17/2015 we were told we were going to sign papers on 08/18/2015 and have our money soon. Well with that being said, on 08/18/2015 @2:30 PM we still had not heard a word from them so I sent an email with no response back and they close at 5PM. Finally at 4:30PM I got a call stating sorry your paperwork has expired and your credit score has changed NO LOAN! So here we sit no money! They nickel and dimed us with two appraisals and a lot of running around to meet a dead line. Which we did everything they asked of us. I mean everything!!! We put our home life on hold. We tried very hard not to spend any money and keep things up and running. It took them four months of a lot of bullshit stories to tell us NO!  At one point I told them that they were just waiting for us to screw up so they could us it against us! They said no we wouldn't do that to anyone!! BULLSHIT! I repeat don't go near this company they should be shut down and I'm surprised they don't have any lawsuits against them!! Maybe they do and no one can post about it?? This review is a NO STARS REVIEW!!! Stay away from IMPAC!

I called them before I saw these reviews.  They made me fill out a lot of stuff online and then called me back, the guy wasn't very nice and eventually told me I did not qualify.  They follow the same guidelines as major lenders from what I heard so the articles in which they are referenced are all false.. stay away!

Impac Mortage is impossible to work with.  They can't "find" payments sent electronically from my bank (Wells Fargo) despite conference calls with the bank people.  They put customers on hold forever and it's impossible to speak with a supervisor. If you fax information (with proof of fax) they say they can't find the fax.  Everything has to be "researched" with a 5-7 business day research period.  Please, if you have a choice, don't use Impac Mortgage.

Impac  Commercial Lending has unethical practices and have the worst customer service. They put hefty penalties for loans that are not revealed in an apparent manner. They give loans without explaining the terms which are of course in fine print. I am surprised that after the financial crisis they continue to work in such a way. Impac definitely need to be scrutinized by federal agencies on their practices and unethical ways of lending! We had a commercial loan with them with. At the time we got the loan there was a prepayment penalty. We modified the loan - they charged us the prepayment penalty when modifying the loan. On top of that they added a new prepayment penalty on the modified note. We were desperate for the modification so had to accept their terms! We sold the property and had to pay the prepayment penalty. So now we have paid penalty twice of hefty amountOn top of that, what was most ethical was when we sold the property recently and the escrow company got the payoff demand  , Impac charged us an extra month of interest. They said that we had to let them know 30 days in advance that we are closing the loan with them. That is a complete robbery! I am surprised that these practices are allowed- to charge an extra month of interest if the lender is not notified 30 days in advance that they will be closing the loan! This was over $5000.They have the worst customer service. Their senior management is the worst I have ever seen.  They are rude, lack the proper communication skills and plain out unethical. They refuse to communicate to their customers. If they do they are intimidating techniques for doing business.Mr. Ashmore who is the president of the company and who has an article in a reputable Forbes  magazine talks to you as if you a piece of garbage!. It is appalling to see a President of the company treating their customer so rudely and unethically. I am sure the way he acts is translated throughout the company.I do hope that their practices are challenged in doing commercial lending. {Please beware before doing any loans with them.

Absolute disaster, bunch of unprofessional people, don't waist your time. I have tried to refinance my existing loan in good standing with credit score of 790!!!!!they had me pay for an appraisal of my house and that's all they did ....after paying 450$ for an appraisal I  waited and  waited and waited....  For whatever unexplained reason all they could say there some issues ... Oh yeah what issues?  House appraised for 20000$ below what they thought it would and we are talking about $620000 loan for 30 years !!!!! give me a break please!!!!! I have been paying my current loan for 8 years with never being late, I have steady job , perfect credit score. there are issues .... what kind of issues?.......No one knows I suppose, besides the fact that having a property in San Francisco Bay Area you can't risk anything!!! Bottom line don't waist your time with this company they are ridiculously unprofessional and lucking knowledge on current mortgage lending:( horrible experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Relative to the other Alternative Lenders in the California lending market, Jason Vaccariello's team at Impac Mortgage offers the most efficient loan processing at the most competitive pricing & terms. I've brokered Alt-Doc deals to all of their competitors and from experience I can tell you that all other Alternative Lenders are administratively incompetent (bordering on negligent) whereas Jason and his Impac Mortgage team actually funds deals per their guidelines whereas others do not.  The loan process with Alternative Lenders are inherently more complicated and time-consuming than with conventional lenders as they are generally more complex, unique and complicated loan scenarios that conventional lenders have declined, such as stated income, or borrowers with damaged credit. Despite these challenges Impac still comes through and funds deals (even though it's not always easy). My brokerage has funded close to 100 deals with them so far and counting.







Incredibly Great Experience With This Mortgage Company. I'd rate it 10 stars if possible.

Last year we went through our Seattle-based mortgage broker when we re-financed our home loan. We were assigned to Impac Mortgage and completed the process. 

Last November, we received an e-mail from Leif Potter from Impac asking us if were were interested in doing a stream-line refinance which would lower our monthly payment. My wife made contact with Mr. Potter and agreed to start the process based on how professional he was on the phone.

By far this was the smoothest real estate loan we have ever done. What has impressed my wife and I more than anything was how professional Leif and his associates have been throughout the entire process. We were constantly kept up to date on time lines, document requests, and recent Federal loan changes. Unlike our previous re-finance process with our broker where we our kept us in the dark for months, and constantly received criptic e-mails regarding the delays, Impac has gone way beyond our expectations. There has not been one element of this loan transaction that has been a surprise, or has not been fully explained. We appreciated timely responses to any questions we had during the process.

My wife and I highly recommend this company if you are considering re-financing or establishing a new mortgage. More so, we highly recommend you contact Mr. Leif Potter. You will be delighted with his customer service and how well he communicates with his clients. He is well versed in the mortgage process and is someone you can trust.







I'm updating them to a 3 because they finally fixed my impound account and I haven't had any problems with them since. I still wouldn't recommend them due to the rough start.







My loan was sold to Impac Mortgage.  I am now counting down the days to refinance again (have to wait 6 months) so I can leave this company.  They charge to auto draft (from your checking account) to pay them.  I scheduled my auto draft on the 3rd (they charge from 5 days to 15 days).  They sent me a notice I was scheduled for the 5th (assuming so they could charge me?).  I had to call them once.  There is phone loop they put you through.  You keep pushing some number on the phone to get a rep.  I had to do this at least 25 times before I got a person.  I was starting to think there was no one to pick up the phone.  I would NEVER use this company.  I am waiting to refinance so I can leave this company.







This stupid company f***** up my property taxes. They've been collecting it in impounds but didn't bother to pay it . I find out today because I was doing my income taxes. I see there's a $120 late fee assessed. You think I can get those for her to pay it? I'm not holding my breath . just screwed up my tax refund too by not paying it last year. These people are f****** idiots!!!!!! Try to speak to a supervisor. They tell me no supervisor will take calls. What kind of fuked up place is this!







This company fuxxxxxcking sucks.  1 star from everyone, how is this company still in business?  They collect my taxes and they pay the county half of it.  I called them, press1, and 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 hold, 15 minutes later enter your loan number or social and wait and wait and wait, after half hour someone picks up, what is you loan number? what is your address? what is this and what is that.  You guys are taking my taxes and not paying them, you are responsible for that now us, OK, cancel my escrow I'll pay my own taxes, email us or fax us.  I emailed them and got auto email back saying we'll get back to you in 10 business days.  10 BUSINESS DAYS?  Fuk this company.







First, I was transferred four times, each time the representative of Impac was so rude they didn't give me a chance to explain how I needed help, if they had I wouldn't have been transferred so many times. 

After the above fun (not!), I sat on hold for 20 mins. 

I was finally connected to Sheranda who allowed me only to ask one question before she started rattling off a policy that states they cannot change the payment due date. If she had given me time to explain she would have discovered there was much more to my inquiry. 

This company is rude, unprofessional and I pray my loan is sold soon so I don't have to deal with these donkeys.







If you are thinking of working for this company...DONT!!!!!  The company is unprofessional and lacks integrity especially as it relates to their Quality Control Department.  In specific the management of this department have egos and control issues that completely lacks an ounce of professionalism.  Seriously the VP needs to take a course in human ethics.







DO NOT GO NEAR IMPAC MORTGAGE!*********** ZERO STARS***********They will ruin your life with the bullshit stories! They'll end up costing you more money and nothing but heart ache at the end!  They order an appraisal on our house in May of 2015  and it was completed. Only to find out that they ordered the wrong one and stated it was our fault. Not sure how that works but at any rate.... On the first appraisal it stated we needed to hang doors and add fire alarms to finish our process. Which we did. A few months go by and they decided they needed another appraisal which was going to be much more extensive and costly.  Really two appraisals? I guestioned them about the second appraisal and raised holly hell with them. Which them they come back and state you need to add stairs on deck and add carpet to the house. Never mentioned in first appraisal to be completed! Mined you yet this is a refinance on a rental for a complete remodel. We own the home outright. Just need a little money for a home facelift. The home appraised for more then what we are asking for in a loan. HMMMMM! So with that being said, we added the stairs and the carpet. The home is almost done on the inside (Very small stuff)  now we just need a little paint on the outside and some fence repairs and it will be ready for a renter. The entire time we have worked on this home hoping for a little money. We were hoping to have this rented out on June 1St. Nope not a chance!  The second appraisal was done and our little investment appraised for much higher then the first appraisal. Our hard work has paid off! Which we thought......So we started our loan process on 04/06/2015 in hope to have the remodel completed and rented out by 6/1/2015. Nope still no loan and not rented out. On 08/17/2015 we were told we were going to sign papers on 08/18/2015 and have our money soon. Well with that being said, on 08/18/2015 @2:30 PM we still had not heard a word from them so I sent an email with no response back and they close at 5PM. Finally at 4:30PM I got a call stating sorry your paperwork has expired and your credit score has changed NO LOAN! So here we sit no money! They nickel and dimed us with two appraisals and a lot of running around to meet a dead line. Which we did everything they asked of us. I mean everything!!! We put our home life on hold. We tried very hard not to spend any money and keep things up and running. It took them four months of a lot of bullshit stories to tell us NO!  At one point I told them that they were just waiting for us to screw up so they could us it against us! They said no we wouldn't do that to anyone!! BULLSHIT! I repeat don't go near this company they should be shut down and I'm surprised they don't have any lawsuits against them!! Maybe they do and no one can post about it?? This review is a NO STARS REVIEW!!! Stay away from IMPAC!







I refinanced my mortgage and the bill is due the 1st and late on the 16th. if they don't have it the 1st the phone is ringing off the DAMN hook. I never thought I would miss BofA but I do. in 22 years of owning homes, I have never ever been late and have an 819 fico score. these Aholes call and call and call with an automated call us back BS. I just blocked their #. FU impac!







Impac Mortage is impossible to work with.  They can't "find" payments sent electronically from my bank (Wells Fargo) despite conference calls with the bank people.  They put customers on hold forever and it's impossible to speak with a supervisor. If you fax information (with proof of fax) they say they can't find the fax.  Everything has to be "researched" with a 5-7 business day research period.  Please, if you have a choice, don't use Impac Mortgage.







I called them before I saw these reviews.  They made me fill out a lot of stuff online and then called me back, the guy wasn't very nice and eventually told me I did not qualify.  They follow the same guidelines as major lenders from what I heard so the articles in which they are referenced are all false.. stay away!







Zero Stars. These people are pure shit.

Got a pre-APPROVAL (not pre-qual) letter. Sold my house. Bought a plane ticket to go put an offer down where I wanted to move, then told I DON'T QUALIFY.

Unless you want a complete idiot to FUCK YOUR LIFE UP, avoid these pieces of shit.







Update: Is it now March and this has not been resolved. I was in touch with someone named Dargis Martinez who has been little to no help. I have since been reimbursed for the amount I overpaid in the first four months but they have yet to reconfigure my monthly mortgage payment. I have left 6 messages for Dargis and no response. If you would like to call her and try to get her to call me back her number is 757-452-5388.







Impac  Commercial Lending has unethical practices and have the worst customer service. They put hefty penalties for loans that are not revealed in an apparent manner. They give loans without explaining the terms which are of course in fine print. I am surprised that after the financial crisis they continue to work in such a way. Impac definitely need to be scrutinized by federal agencies on their practices and unethical ways of lending! 

We had a commercial loan with them with. At the time we got the loan there was a prepayment penalty. We modified the loan - they charged us the prepayment penalty when modifying the loan. On top of that they added a new prepayment penalty on the modified note. We were desperate for the modification so had to accept their terms! We sold the property and had to pay the prepayment penalty. So now we have paid penalty twice of hefty amount

On top of that, what was most ethical was when we sold the property recently and the escrow company got the payoff demand  , Impac charged us an extra month of interest. They said that we had to let them know 30 days in advance that we are closing the loan with them. That is a complete robbery! I am surprised that these practices are allowed- to charge an extra month of interest if the lender is not notified 30 days in advance that they will be closing the loan! This was over $5000.

They have the worst customer service. 
Their senior management is the worst I have ever seen.  They are rude, lack the proper communication skills and plain out unethical. They refuse to communicate to their customers. If they do they are intimidating techniques for doing business.

Mr. Ashmore who is the president of the company and who has an article in a reputable Forbes  magazine talks to you as if you a piece of garbage!. It is appalling to see a President of the company treating their customer so rudely and unethically. I am sure the way he acts is translated throughout the company.
I do hope that their practices are challenged in doing commercial lending. {Please beware before doing any loans with them.







Absolute disaster, bunch of unprofessional people, don't waist your time. I have tried to refinance my existing loan in good standing with credit score of 790!!!!!they had me pay for an appraisal of my house and that's all they did ....after paying 450$ for an appraisal I  waited and  waited and waited....  For whatever unexplained reason all they could say there some issues ... Oh yeah what issues?  House appraised for 20000$ below what they thought it would and we are talking about $620000 loan for 30 years !!!!! give me a break please!!!!! I have been paying my current loan for 8 years with never being late, I have steady job , perfect credit score. there are issues .... what kind of issues?.......No one knows I suppose, besides the fact that having a property in San Francisco Bay Area you can't risk anything!!! Bottom line don't waist your time with this company they are ridiculously unprofessional and lucking knowledge on current mortgage lending:( horrible experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So here I sit weeks later,  they lost my  check i sent certified mail start my escrow,  I helped them locate it but then they applied it to my mortgage payments rather than escrow even though I wrote escrow on the check and mailed it to the escrow dept. A week ago I notified them of their mistake which they a knowledged with a promise that this morning my escrow account would be set up. Today not only did they not set it up,  they denied it because it dd not meet the deadline,  certified mail says that they received it 2 weeks before the deadline.  Plus they charge me a late fee on the first auto payment they lost. You have been warned!

Refinancing with Impac was fairly easy and I got a great rate. The problem is they were in such a hurry to sign me up that the salesman did not set up a escrow account and when I asked about it he said they don't do that until after they receive the first mortgage payment. (This is my 5th time purchasing or refinancing and I've ALWAYS had my escrow account set up at the time of transaction). It is 4 months later and I am still trying to set up the account only rather than building it into the loan which is the norm they need a check for $5,500--Which I scraped together and sent it certified mail--the only address I was given was a P.O.  Box so that's not making me feel very secure. To top it off they have lost this months payment which my bank shows as processed 2 weeks ago. My bank faxed them the proof and gave me a copy of proof that the fax went through. I just got off the phone with Impac who told me over the  they never received the fax and had me email my statement to them. They now say that they received the email and it will take 5 working days to research it. Meanwhile they will be charging me a late fee in 4 days and if they do not clear up their mess soon I fear it will go on my credit report. We have dealt with Impac over the phone at approx. 20 times in the past few months trying to get them to fix their mistakes. More contact than I have had over the past 33 years with my other lenders combined. If you have taken the time to read all of this I'd hope you'd be wise enough to find a company that is more professional.

First, I was transferred four times, each time the representative of Impac was so rude they didn't give me a chance to explain how I needed help, if they had I wouldn't have been transferred so many times. After the above fun (not!), I sat on hold for 20 mins. I was finally connected to Sheranda who allowed me only to ask one question before she started rattling off a policy that states they cannot change the payment due date. If she had given me time to explain she would have discovered there was much more to my inquiry. This company is rude, unprofessional and I pray my loan is sold soon so I don't have to deal with these donkeys.

If you are thinking of working for this company...DONT!!!!!  The company is unprofessional and lacks integrity especially as it relates to their Quality Control Department.  In specific the management of this department have egos and control issues that completely lacks an ounce of professionalism.  Seriously the VP needs to take a course in human ethics.

DO NOT GO NEAR IMPAC MORTGAGE!*********** ZERO STARS***********They will ruin your life with the bullshit stories! They'll end up costing you more money and nothing but heart ache at the end!  They order an appraisal on our house in May of 2015  and it was completed. Only to find out that they ordered the wrong one and stated it was our fault. Not sure how that works but at any rate.... On the first appraisal it stated we needed to hang doors and add fire alarms to finish our process. Which we did. A few months go by and they decided they needed another appraisal which was going to be much more extensive and costly.  Really two appraisals? I guestioned them about the second appraisal and raised holly hell with them. Which them they come back and state you need to add stairs on deck and add carpet to the house. Never mentioned in first appraisal to be completed! Mined you yet this is a refinance on a rental for a complete remodel. We own the home outright. Just need a little money for a home facelift. The home appraised for more then what we are asking for in a loan. HMMMMM! So with that being said, we added the stairs and the carpet. The home is almost done on the inside (Very small stuff)  now we just need a little paint on the outside and some fence repairs and it will be ready for a renter. The entire time we have worked on this home hoping for a little money. We were hoping to have this rented out on June 1St. Nope not a chance!  The second appraisal was done and our little investment appraised for much higher then the first appraisal. Our hard work has paid off! Which we thought......So we started our loan process on 04/06/2015 in hope to have the remodel completed and rented out by 6/1/2015. Nope still no loan and not rented out. On 08/17/2015 we were told we were going to sign papers on 08/18/2015 and have our money soon. Well with that being said, on 08/18/2015 @2:30 PM we still had not heard a word from them so I sent an email with no response back and they close at 5PM. Finally at 4:30PM I got a call stating sorry your paperwork has expired and your credit score has changed NO LOAN! So here we sit no money! They nickel and dimed us with two appraisals and a lot of running around to meet a dead line. Which we did everything they asked of us. I mean everything!!! We put our home life on hold. We tried very hard not to spend any money and keep things up and running. It took them four months of a lot of bullshit stories to tell us NO!  At one point I told them that they were just waiting for us to screw up so they could us it against us! They said no we wouldn't do that to anyone!! BULLSHIT! I repeat don't go near this company they should be shut down and I'm surprised they don't have any lawsuits against them!! Maybe they do and no one can post about it?? This review is a NO STARS REVIEW!!! Stay away from IMPAC!

Impac Mortage is impossible to work with.  They can't "find" payments sent electronically from my bank (Wells Fargo) despite conference calls with the bank people.  They put customers on hold forever and it's impossible to speak with a supervisor. If you fax information (with proof of fax) they say they can't find the fax.  Everything has to be "researched" with a 5-7 business day research period.  Please, if you have a choice, don't use Impac Mortgage.

I called them before I saw these reviews.  They made me fill out a lot of stuff online and then called me back, the guy wasn't very nice and eventually told me I did not qualify.  They follow the same guidelines as major lenders from what I heard so the articles in which they are referenced are all false.. stay away!

Updated review



Update: Is it now March and this has not been resolved. I was in touch with someone named Dargis Martinez who has been little to no help. I have since been reimbursed for the amount I overpaid in the first four months but they have yet to reconfigure my monthly mortgage payment. I have left 6 messages for Dargis and no response. If you would like to call her and try to get her to call me back her number is 757-452-5388.

I paid off my hazard insurance in October 2014 (their policy when you switch insurance companies in the first year) and was told my loan would need to be readjusted to reflect the lower mortgage. First I was told it would be done in November. Then it wasn't, and I was told no longer than December it would be done. When I called in January to see if it was done, of course they said it hadn't yet. They told me 15 more business days. So, I called 15 business days later. And guess what? Still not done. Someone named Caja said she put in an expedited request and assured me that either that day but no later than the following day it would be resolved. I called 2 days later and guess what? Still not done. I call back again today, wait on hold 17 minutes only to speak with someone for a moment, get placed back on hold and hung up on. I am here, sitting on hold again now with a manager who says it still hasn't been done. I am just tired of being told it will be taken care of and it isn't. And I have been overpaying for 3 months now. How easy do you think it will be for me to get the money I have over payed? I only wish they would sell my loan to someone else. Oh and I have a credit score of over 800 and always make payments on time. I never wish this kind of service on anyone else.

Impac  Commercial Lending has unethical practices and have the worst customer service. They put hefty penalties for loans that are not revealed in an apparent manner. They give loans without explaining the terms which are of course in fine print. I am surprised that after the financial crisis they continue to work in such a way. Impac definitely need to be scrutinized by federal agencies on their practices and unethical ways of lending! We had a commercial loan with them with. At the time we got the loan there was a prepayment penalty. We modified the loan - they charged us the prepayment penalty when modifying the loan. On top of that they added a new prepayment penalty on the modified note. We were desperate for the modification so had to accept their terms! We sold the property and had to pay the prepayment penalty. So now we have paid penalty twice of hefty amountOn top of that, what was most ethical was when we sold the property recently and the escrow company got the payoff demand  , Impac charged us an extra month of interest. They said that we had to let them know 30 days in advance that we are closing the loan with them. That is a complete robbery! I am surprised that these practices are allowed- to charge an extra month of interest if the lender is not notified 30 days in advance that they will be closing the loan! This was over $5000.They have the worst customer service. Their senior management is the worst I have ever seen.  They are rude, lack the proper communication skills and plain out unethical. They refuse to communicate to their customers. If they do they are intimidating techniques for doing business.Mr. Ashmore who is the president of the company and who has an article in a reputable Forbes  magazine talks to you as if you a piece of garbage!. It is appalling to see a President of the company treating their customer so rudely and unethically. I am sure the way he acts is translated throughout the company.I do hope that their practices are challenged in doing commercial lending. {Please beware before doing any loans with them.

Absolute disaster, bunch of unprofessional people, don't waist your time. I have tried to refinance my existing loan in good standing with credit score of 790!!!!!they had me pay for an appraisal of my house and that's all they did ....after paying 450$ for an appraisal I  waited and  waited and waited....  For whatever unexplained reason all they could say there some issues ... Oh yeah what issues?  House appraised for 20000$ below what they thought it would and we are talking about $620000 loan for 30 years !!!!! give me a break please!!!!! I have been paying my current loan for 8 years with never being late, I have steady job , perfect credit score. there are issues .... what kind of issues?.......No one knows I suppose, besides the fact that having a property in San Francisco Bay Area you can't risk anything!!! Bottom line don't waist your time with this company they are ridiculously unprofessional and lucking knowledge on current mortgage lending:( horrible experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This stupid company f***** up my property taxes. They've been collecting it in impounds but didn't bother to pay it . I find out today because I was doing my income taxes. I see there's a $120 late fee assessed. You think I can get those for her to pay it? I'm not holding my breath . just screwed up my tax refund too by not paying it last year. These people are f****** idiots!!!!!! Try to speak to a supervisor. They tell me no supervisor will take calls. What kind of fuked up place is this!







This company fuxxxxxcking sucks.  1 star from everyone, how is this company still in business?  They collect my taxes and they pay the county half of it.  I called them, press1, and 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 hold, 15 minutes later enter your loan number or social and wait and wait and wait, after half hour someone picks up, what is you loan number? what is your address? what is this and what is that.  You guys are taking my taxes and not paying them, you are responsible for that now us, OK, cancel my escrow I'll pay my own taxes, email us or fax us.  I emailed them and got auto email back saying we'll get back to you in 10 business days.  10 BUSINESS DAYS?  Fuk this company.







First, I was transferred four times, each time the representative of Impac was so rude they didn't give me a chance to explain how I needed help, if they had I wouldn't have been transferred so many times. 

After the above fun (not!), I sat on hold for 20 mins. 

I was finally connected to Sheranda who allowed me only to ask one question before she started rattling off a policy that states they cannot change the payment due date. If she had given me time to explain she would have discovered there was much more to my inquiry. 

This company is rude, unprofessional and I pray my loan is sold soon so I don't have to deal with these donkeys.







If you are thinking of working for this company...DONT!!!!!  The company is unprofessional and lacks integrity especially as it relates to their Quality Control Department.  In specific the management of this department have egos and control issues that completely lacks an ounce of professionalism.  Seriously the VP needs to take a course in human ethics.







DO NOT GO NEAR IMPAC MORTGAGE!*********** ZERO STARS***********They will ruin your life with the bullshit stories! They'll end up costing you more money and nothing but heart ache at the end!  They order an appraisal on our house in May of 2015  and it was completed. Only to find out that they ordered the wrong one and stated it was our fault. Not sure how that works but at any rate.... On the first appraisal it stated we needed to hang doors and add fire alarms to finish our process. Which we did. A few months go by and they decided they needed another appraisal which was going to be much more extensive and costly.  Really two appraisals? I guestioned them about the second appraisal and raised holly hell with them. Which them they come back and state you need to add stairs on deck and add carpet to the house. Never mentioned in first appraisal to be completed! Mined you yet this is a refinance on a rental for a complete remodel. We own the home outright. Just need a little money for a home facelift. The home appraised for more then what we are asking for in a loan. HMMMMM! So with that being said, we added the stairs and the carpet. The home is almost done on the inside (Very small stuff)  now we just need a little paint on the outside and some fence repairs and it will be ready for a renter. The entire time we have worked on this home hoping for a little money. We were hoping to have this rented out on June 1St. Nope not a chance!  The second appraisal was done and our little investment appraised for much higher then the first appraisal. Our hard work has paid off! Which we thought......So we started our loan process on 04/06/2015 in hope to have the remodel completed and rented out by 6/1/2015. Nope still no loan and not rented out. On 08/17/2015 we were told we were going to sign papers on 08/18/2015 and have our money soon. Well with that being said, on 08/18/2015 @2:30 PM we still had not heard a word from them so I sent an email with no response back and they close at 5PM. Finally at 4:30PM I got a call stating sorry your paperwork has expired and your credit score has changed NO LOAN! So here we sit no money! They nickel and dimed us with two appraisals and a lot of running around to meet a dead line. Which we did everything they asked of us. I mean everything!!! We put our home life on hold. We tried very hard not to spend any money and keep things up and running. It took them four months of a lot of bullshit stories to tell us NO!  At one point I told them that they were just waiting for us to screw up so they could us it against us! They said no we wouldn't do that to anyone!! BULLSHIT! I repeat don't go near this company they should be shut down and I'm surprised they don't have any lawsuits against them!! Maybe they do and no one can post about it?? This review is a NO STARS REVIEW!!! Stay away from IMPAC!







I refinanced my mortgage and the bill is due the 1st and late on the 16th. if they don't have it the 1st the phone is ringing off the DAMN hook. I never thought I would miss BofA but I do. in 22 years of owning homes, I have never ever been late and have an 819 fico score. these Aholes call and call and call with an automated call us back BS. I just blocked their #. FU impac!







Impac Mortage is impossible to work with.  They can't "find" payments sent electronically from my bank (Wells Fargo) despite conference calls with the bank people.  They put customers on hold forever and it's impossible to speak with a supervisor. If you fax information (with proof of fax) they say they can't find the fax.  Everything has to be "researched" with a 5-7 business day research period.  Please, if you have a choice, don't use Impac Mortgage.







I called them before I saw these reviews.  They made me fill out a lot of stuff online and then called me back, the guy wasn't very nice and eventually told me I did not qualify.  They follow the same guidelines as major lenders from what I heard so the articles in which they are referenced are all false.. stay away!







Zero Stars. These people are pure shit.

Got a pre-APPROVAL (not pre-qual) letter. Sold my house. Bought a plane ticket to go put an offer down where I wanted to move, then told I DON'T QUALIFY.

Unless you want a complete idiot to FUCK YOUR LIFE UP, avoid these pieces of shit.







Update: Is it now March and this has not been resolved. I was in touch with someone named Dargis Martinez who has been little to no help. I have since been reimbursed for the amount I overpaid in the first four months but they have yet to reconfigure my monthly mortgage payment. I have left 6 messages for Dargis and no response. If you would like to call her and try to get her to call me back her number is 757-452-5388.







Impac  Commercial Lending has unethical practices and have the worst customer service. They put hefty penalties for loans that are not revealed in an apparent manner. They give loans without explaining the terms which are of course in fine print. I am surprised that after the financial crisis they continue to work in such a way. Impac definitely need to be scrutinized by federal agencies on their practices and unethical ways of lending! 

We had a commercial loan with them with. At the time we got the loan there was a prepayment penalty. We modified the loan - they charged us the prepayment penalty when modifying the loan. On top of that they added a new prepayment penalty on the modified note. We were desperate for the modification so had to accept their terms! We sold the property and had to pay the prepayment penalty. So now we have paid penalty twice of hefty amount

On top of that, what was most ethical was when we sold the property recently and the escrow company got the payoff demand  , Impac charged us an extra month of interest. They said that we had to let them know 30 days in advance that we are closing the loan with them. That is a complete robbery! I am surprised that these practices are allowed- to charge an extra month of interest if the lender is not notified 30 days in advance that they will be closing the loan! This was over $5000.

They have the worst customer service. 
Their senior management is the worst I have ever seen.  They are rude, lack the proper communication skills and plain out unethical. They refuse to communicate to their customers. If they do they are intimidating techniques for doing business.

Mr. Ashmore who is the president of the company and who has an article in a reputable Forbes  magazine talks to you as if you a piece of garbage!. It is appalling to see a President of the company treating their customer so rudely and unethically. I am sure the way he acts is translated throughout the company.
I do hope that their practices are challenged in doing commercial lending. {Please beware before doing any loans with them.







Absolute disaster, bunch of unprofessional people, don't waist your time. I have tried to refinance my existing loan in good standing with credit score of 790!!!!!they had me pay for an appraisal of my house and that's all they did ....after paying 450$ for an appraisal I  waited and  waited and waited....  For whatever unexplained reason all they could say there some issues ... Oh yeah what issues?  House appraised for 20000$ below what they thought it would and we are talking about $620000 loan for 30 years !!!!! give me a break please!!!!! I have been paying my current loan for 8 years with never being late, I have steady job , perfect credit score. there are issues .... what kind of issues?.......No one knows I suppose, besides the fact that having a property in San Francisco Bay Area you can't risk anything!!! Bottom line don't waist your time with this company they are ridiculously unprofessional and lucking knowledge on current mortgage lending:( horrible experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!







My loan was sold to Impac Mortgage.  I am now counting down the days to refinance again (have to wait 6 months) so I can leave this company.  They charge to auto draft (from your checking account) to pay them.  I scheduled my auto draft on the 3rd (they charge from 5 days to 15 days).  They sent me a notice I was scheduled for the 5th (assuming so they could charge me?).  I had to call them once.  There is phone loop they put you through.  You keep pushing some number on the phone to get a rep.  I had to do this at least 25 times before I got a person.  I was starting to think there was no one to pick up the phone.  I would NEVER use this company.  I am waiting to refinance so I can leave this company.







I'm updating them to a 3 because they finally fixed my impound account and I haven't had any problems with them since. I still wouldn't recommend them due to the rough start.







Relative to the other Alternative Lenders in the California lending market, Jason Vaccariello's team at Impac Mortgage offers the most efficient loan processing at the most competitive pricing & terms. I've brokered Alt-Doc deals to all of their competitors and from experience I can tell you that all other Alternative Lenders are administratively incompetent (bordering on negligent) whereas Jason and his Impac Mortgage team actually funds deals per their guidelines whereas others do not.  The loan process with Alternative Lenders are inherently more complicated and time-consuming than with conventional lenders as they are generally more complex, unique and complicated loan scenarios that conventional lenders have declined, such as stated income, or borrowers with damaged credit. Despite these challenges Impac still comes through and funds deals (even though it's not always easy). My brokerage has funded close to 100 deals with them so far and counting.







Incredibly Great Experience With This Mortgage Company. I'd rate it 10 stars if possible.

Last year we went through our Seattle-based mortgage broker when we re-financed our home loan. We were assigned to Impac Mortgage and completed the process. 

Last November, we received an e-mail from Leif Potter from Impac asking us if were were interested in doing a stream-line refinance which would lower our monthly payment. My wife made contact with Mr. Potter and agreed to start the process based on how professional he was on the phone.

By far this was the smoothest real estate loan we have ever done. What has impressed my wife and I more than anything was how professional Leif and his associates have been throughout the entire process. We were constantly kept up to date on time lines, document requests, and recent Federal loan changes. Unlike our previous re-finance process with our broker where we our kept us in the dark for months, and constantly received criptic e-mails regarding the delays, Impac has gone way beyond our expectations. There has not been one element of this loan transaction that has been a surprise, or has not been fully explained. We appreciated timely responses to any questions we had during the process.

My wife and I highly recommend this company if you are considering re-financing or establishing a new mortgage. More so, we highly recommend you contact Mr. Leif Potter. You will be delighted with his customer service and how well he communicates with his clients. He is well versed in the mortgage process and is someone you can trust.

DO NOT GO NEAR IMPAC MORTGAGE!*********** ZERO STARS***********They will ruin your life with the bullshit stories! They'll end up costing you more money and nothing but heart ache at the end!  They order an appraisal on our house in May of 2015  and it was completed. Only to find out that they ordered the wrong one and stated it was our fault. Not sure how that works but at any rate.... On the first appraisal it stated we needed to hang doors and add fire alarms to finish our process. Which we did. A few months go by and they decided they needed another appraisal which was going to be much more extensive and costly.  Really two appraisals? I guestioned them about the second appraisal and raised holly hell with them. Which them they come back and state you need to add stairs on deck and add carpet to the house. Never mentioned in first appraisal to be completed! Mined you yet this is a refinance on a rental for a complete remodel. We own the home outright. Just need a little money for a home facelift. The home appraised for more then what we are asking for in a loan. HMMMMM! So with that being said, we added the stairs and the carpet. The home is almost done on the inside (Very small stuff)  now we just need a little paint on the outside and some fence repairs and it will be ready for a renter. The entire time we have worked on this home hoping for a little money. We were hoping to have this rented out on June 1St. Nope not a chance!  The second appraisal was done and our little investment appraised for much higher then the first appraisal. Our hard work has paid off! Which we thought......So we started our loan process on 04/06/2015 in hope to have the remodel completed and rented out by 6/1/2015. Nope still no loan and not rented out. On 08/17/2015 we were told we were going to sign papers on 08/18/2015 and have our money soon. Well with that being said, on 08/18/2015 @2:30 PM we still had not heard a word from them so I sent an email with no response back and they close at 5PM. Finally at 4:30PM I got a call stating sorry your paperwork has expired and your credit score has changed NO LOAN! So here we sit no money! They nickel and dimed us with two appraisals and a lot of running around to meet a dead line. Which we did everything they asked of us. I mean everything!!! We put our home life on hold. We tried very hard not to spend any money and keep things up and running. It took them four months of a lot of bullshit stories to tell us NO!  At one point I told them that they were just waiting for us to screw up so they could us it against us! They said no we wouldn't do that to anyone!! BULLSHIT! I repeat don't go near this company they should be shut down and I'm surprised they don't have any lawsuits against them!! Maybe they do and no one can post about it?? This review is a NO STARS REVIEW!!! Stay away from IMPAC!

Impac Mortage is impossible to work with.  They can't "find" payments sent electronically from my bank (Wells Fargo) despite conference calls with the bank people.  They put customers on hold forever and it's impossible to speak with a supervisor. If you fax information (with proof of fax) they say they can't find the fax.  Everything has to be "researched" with a 5-7 business day research period.  Please, if you have a choice, don't use Impac Mortgage.

I called them before I saw these reviews.  They made me fill out a lot of stuff online and then called me back, the guy wasn't very nice and eventually told me I did not qualify.  They follow the same guidelines as major lenders from what I heard so the articles in which they are referenced are all false.. stay away!

Updated review



Update: Is it now March and this has not been resolved. I was in touch with someone named Dargis Martinez who has been little to no help. I have since been reimbursed for the amount I overpaid in the first four months but they have yet to reconfigure my monthly mortgage payment. I have left 6 messages for Dargis and no response. If you would like to call her and try to get her to call me back her number is 757-452-5388.

I paid off my hazard insurance in October 2014 (their policy when you switch insurance companies in the first year) and was told my loan would need to be readjusted to reflect the lower mortgage. First I was told it would be done in November. Then it wasn't, and I was told no longer than December it would be done. When I called in January to see if it was done, of course they said it hadn't yet. They told me 15 more business days. So, I called 15 business days later. And guess what? Still not done. Someone named Caja said she put in an expedited request and assured me that either that day but no later than the following day it would be resolved. I called 2 days later and guess what? Still not done. I call back again today, wait on hold 17 minutes only to speak with someone for a moment, get placed back on hold and hung up on. I am here, sitting on hold again now with a manager who says it still hasn't been done. I am just tired of being told it will be taken care of and it isn't. And I have been overpaying for 3 months now. How easy do you think it will be for me to get the money I have over payed? I only wish they would sell my loan to someone else. Oh and I have a credit score of over 800 and always make payments on time. I never wish this kind of service on anyone else.

Impac  Commercial Lending has unethical practices and have the worst customer service. They put hefty penalties for loans that are not revealed in an apparent manner. They give loans without explaining the terms which are of course in fine print. I am surprised that after the financial crisis they continue to work in such a way. Impac definitely need to be scrutinized by federal agencies on their practices and unethical ways of lending! We had a commercial loan with them with. At the time we got the loan there was a prepayment penalty. We modified the loan - they charged us the prepayment penalty when modifying the loan. On top of that they added a new prepayment penalty on the modified note. We were desperate for the modification so had to accept their terms! We sold the property and had to pay the prepayment penalty. So now we have paid penalty twice of hefty amountOn top of that, what was most ethical was when we sold the property recently and the escrow company got the payoff demand  , Impac charged us an extra month of interest. They said that we had to let them know 30 days in advance that we are closing the loan with them. That is a complete robbery! I am surprised that these practices are allowed- to charge an extra month of interest if the lender is not notified 30 days in advance that they will be closing the loan! This was over $5000.They have the worst customer service. Their senior management is the worst I have ever seen.  They are rude, lack the proper communication skills and plain out unethical. They refuse to communicate to their customers. If they do they are intimidating techniques for doing business.Mr. Ashmore who is the president of the company and who has an article in a reputable Forbes  magazine talks to you as if you a piece of garbage!. It is appalling to see a President of the company treating their customer so rudely and unethically. I am sure the way he acts is translated throughout the company.I do hope that their practices are challenged in doing commercial lending. {Please beware before doing any loans with them.

Absolute disaster, bunch of unprofessional people, don't waist your time. I have tried to refinance my existing loan in good standing with credit score of 790!!!!!they had me pay for an appraisal of my house and that's all they did ....after paying 450$ for an appraisal I  waited and  waited and waited....  For whatever unexplained reason all they could say there some issues ... Oh yeah what issues?  House appraised for 20000$ below what they thought it would and we are talking about $620000 loan for 30 years !!!!! give me a break please!!!!! I have been paying my current loan for 8 years with never being late, I have steady job , perfect credit score. there are issues .... what kind of issues?.......No one knows I suppose, besides the fact that having a property in San Francisco Bay Area you can't risk anything!!! Bottom line don't waist your time with this company they are ridiculously unprofessional and lucking knowledge on current mortgage lending:( horrible experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

My loan was sold to Impac Mortgage.  I am now counting down the days to refinance again (have to wait 6 months) so I can leave this company.  They charge to auto draft (from your checking account) to pay them.  I scheduled my auto draft on the 3rd (they charge from 5 days to 15 days).  They sent me a notice I was scheduled for the 5th (assuming so they could charge me?).  I had to call them once.  There is phone loop they put you through.  You keep pushing some number on the phone to get a rep.  I had to do this at least 25 times before I got a person.  I was starting to think there was no one to pick up the phone.  I would NEVER use this company.  I am waiting to refinance so I can leave this company.

So here I sit weeks later,  they lost my  check i sent certified mail start my escrow,  I helped them locate it but then they applied it to my mortgage payments rather than escrow even though I wrote escrow on the check and mailed it to the escrow dept. A week ago I notified them of their mistake which they a knowledged with a promise that this morning my escrow account would be set up. Today not only did they not set it up,  they denied it because it dd not meet the deadline,  certified mail says that they received it 2 weeks before the deadline.  Plus they charge me a late fee on the first auto payment they lost. You have been warned!

Refinancing with Impac was fairly easy and I got a great rate. The problem is they were in such a hurry to sign me up that the salesman did not set up a escrow account and when I asked about it he said they don't do that until after they receive the first mortgage payment. (This is my 5th time purchasing or refinancing and I've ALWAYS had my escrow account set up at the time of transaction). It is 4 months later and I am still trying to set up the account only rather than building it into the loan which is the norm they need a check for $5,500--Which I scraped together and sent it certified mail--the only address I was given was a P.O.  Box so that's not making me feel very secure. To top it off they have lost this months payment which my bank shows as processed 2 weeks ago. My bank faxed them the proof and gave me a copy of proof that the fax went through. I just got off the phone with Impac who told me over the  they never received the fax and had me email my statement to them. They now say that they received the email and it will take 5 working days to research it. Meanwhile they will be charging me a late fee in 4 days and if they do not clear up their mess soon I fear it will go on my credit report. We have dealt with Impac over the phone at approx. 20 times in the past few months trying to get them to fix their mistakes. More contact than I have had over the past 33 years with my other lenders combined. If you have taken the time to read all of this I'd hope you'd be wise enough to find a company that is more professional.

Relative to the other Alternative Lenders in the California lending market, Jason Vaccariello's team at Impac Mortgage offers the most efficient loan processing at the most competitive pricing & terms. I've brokered Alt-Doc deals to all of their competitors and from experience I can tell you that all other Alternative Lenders are administratively incompetent (bordering on negligent) whereas Jason and his Impac Mortgage team actually funds deals per their guidelines whereas others do not.  The loan process with Alternative Lenders are inherently more complicated and time-consuming than with conventional lenders as they are generally more complex, unique and complicated loan scenarios that conventional lenders have declined, such as stated income, or borrowers with damaged credit. Despite these challenges Impac still comes through and funds deals (even though it's not always easy). My brokerage has funded close to 100 deals with them so far and counting.

Incredibly Great Experience With This Mortgage Company. I'd rate it 10 stars if possible.Last year we went through our Seattle-based mortgage broker when we re-financed our home loan. We were assigned to Impac Mortgage and completed the process. Last November, we received an e-mail from Leif Potter from Impac asking us if were were interested in doing a stream-line refinance which would lower our monthly payment. My wife made contact with Mr. Potter and agreed to start the process based on how professional he was on the phone.By far this was the smoothest real estate loan we have ever done. What has impressed my wife and I more than anything was how professional Leif and his associates have been throughout the entire process. We were constantly kept up to date on time lines, document requests, and recent Federal loan changes. Unlike our previous re-finance process with our broker where we our kept us in the dark for months, and constantly received criptic e-mails regarding the delays, Impac has gone way beyond our expectations. There has not been one element of this loan transaction that has been a surprise, or has not been fully explained. We appreciated timely responses to any questions we had during the process.My wife and I highly recommend this company if you are considering re-financing or establishing a new mortgage. More so, we highly recommend you contact Mr. Leif Potter. You will be delighted with his customer service and how well he communicates with his clients. He is well versed in the mortgage process and is someone you can trust.

This stupid company f***** up my property taxes. They've been collecting it in impounds but didn't bother to pay it . I find out today because I was doing my income taxes. I see there's a $120 late fee assessed. You think I can get those for her to pay it? I'm not holding my breath . just screwed up my tax refund too by not paying it last year. These people are f****** idiots!!!!!! Try to speak to a supervisor. They tell me no supervisor will take calls. What kind of fuked up place is this!







Incredibly Great Experience With This Mortgage Company. I'd rate it 10 stars if possible.

Last year we went through our Seattle-based mortgage broker when we re-financed our home loan. We were assigned to Impac Mortgage and completed the process. 

Last November, we received an e-mail from Leif Potter from Impac asking us if were were interested in doing a stream-line refinance which would lower our monthly payment. My wife made contact with Mr. Potter and agreed to start the process based on how professional he was on the phone.

By far this was the smoothest real estate loan we have ever done. What has impressed my wife and I more than anything was how professional Leif and his associates have been throughout the entire process. We were constantly kept up to date on time lines, document requests, and recent Federal loan changes. Unlike our previous re-finance process with our broker where we our kept us in the dark for months, and constantly received criptic e-mails regarding the delays, Impac has gone way beyond our expectations. There has not been one element of this loan transaction that has been a surprise, or has not been fully explained. We appreciated timely responses to any questions we had during the process.

My wife and I highly recommend this company if you are considering re-financing or establishing a new mortgage. More so, we highly recommend you contact Mr. Leif Potter. You will be delighted with his customer service and how well he communicates with his clients. He is well versed in the mortgage process and is someone you can trust.

First, I was transferred four times, each time the representative of Impac was so rude they didn't give me a chance to explain how I needed help, if they had I wouldn't have been transferred so many times. 

After the above fun (not!), I sat on hold for 20 mins. 

I was finally connected to Sheranda who allowed me only to ask one question before she started rattling off a policy that states they cannot change the payment due date. If she had given me time to explain she would have discovered there was much more to my inquiry. 

This company is rude, unprofessional and I pray my loan is sold soon so I don't have to deal with these donkeys.







Relative to the other Alternative Lenders in the California lending market, Jason Vaccariello's team at Impac Mortgage offers the most efficient loan processing at the most competitive pricing & terms. I've brokered Alt-Doc deals to all of their competitors and from experience I can tell you that all other Alternative Lenders are administratively incompetent (bordering on negligent) whereas Jason and his Impac Mortgage team actually funds deals per their guidelines whereas others do not.  The loan process with Alternative Lenders are inherently more complicated and time-consuming than with conventional lenders as they are generally more complex, unique and complicated loan scenarios that conventional lenders have declined, such as stated income, or borrowers with damaged credit. Despite these challenges Impac still comes through and funds deals (even though it's not always easy). My brokerage has funded close to 100 deals with them so far and counting.







Zero Stars. These people are pure shit.

Got a pre-APPROVAL (not pre-qual) letter. Sold my house. Bought a plane ticket to go put an offer down where I wanted to move, then told I DON'T QUALIFY.

Unless you want a complete idiot to FUCK YOUR LIFE UP, avoid these pieces of shit.







If you are thinking of working for this company...DONT!!!!!  The company is unprofessional and lacks integrity especially as it relates to their Quality Control Department.  In specific the management of this department have egos and control issues that completely lacks an ounce of professionalism.  Seriously the VP needs to take a course in human ethics.







This company fuxxxxxcking sucks.  1 star from everyone, how is this company still in business?  They collect my taxes and they pay the county half of it.  I called them, press1, and 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 hold, 15 minutes later enter your loan number or social and wait and wait and wait, after half hour someone picks up, what is you loan number? what is your address? what is this and what is that.  You guys are taking my taxes and not paying them, you are responsible for that now us, OK, cancel my escrow I'll pay my own taxes, email us or fax us.  I emailed them and got auto email back saying we'll get back to you in 10 business days.  10 BUSINESS DAYS?  Fuk this company.







I refinanced my mortgage and the bill is due the 1st and late on the 16th. if they don't have it the 1st the phone is ringing off the DAMN hook. I never thought I would miss BofA but I do. in 22 years of owning homes, I have never ever been late and have an 819 fico score. these Aholes call and call and call with an automated call us back BS. I just blocked their #. FU impac!







I'm updating them to a 3 because they finally fixed my impound account and I haven't had any problems with them since. I still wouldn't recommend them due to the rough start.







My loan was sold to Impac Mortgage.  I am now counting down the days to refinance again (have to wait 6 months) so I can leave this company.  They charge to auto draft (from your checking account) to pay them.  I scheduled my auto draft on the 3rd (they charge from 5 days to 15 days).  They sent me a notice I was scheduled for the 5th (assuming so they could charge me?).  I had to call them once.  There is phone loop they put you through.  You keep pushing some number on the phone to get a rep.  I had to do this at least 25 times before I got a person.  I was starting to think there was no one to pick up the phone.  I would NEVER use this company.  I am waiting to refinance so I can leave this company.







Update: Is it now March and this has not been resolved. I was in touch with someone named Dargis Martinez who has been little to no help. I have since been reimbursed for the amount I overpaid in the first four months but they have yet to reconfigure my monthly mortgage payment. I have left 6 messages for Dargis and no response. If you would like to call her and try to get her to call me back her number is 757-452-5388.







I called them before I saw these reviews.  They made me fill out a lot of stuff online and then called me back, the guy wasn't very nice and eventually told me I did not qualify.  They follow the same guidelines as major lenders from what I heard so the articles in which they are referenced are all false.. stay away!







DO NOT GO NEAR IMPAC MORTGAGE!*********** ZERO STARS***********They will ruin your life with the bullshit stories! They'll end up costing you more money and nothing but heart ache at the end!  They order an appraisal on our house in May of 2015  and it was completed. Only to find out that they ordered the wrong one and stated it was our fault. Not sure how that works but at any rate.... On the first appraisal it stated we needed to hang doors and add fire alarms to finish our process. Which we did. A few months go by and they decided they needed another appraisal which was going to be much more extensive and costly.  Really two appraisals? I guestioned them about the second appraisal and raised holly hell with them. Which them they come back and state you need to add stairs on deck and add carpet to the house. Never mentioned in first appraisal to be completed! Mined you yet this is a refinance on a rental for a complete remodel. We own the home outright. Just need a little money for a home facelift. The home appraised for more then what we are asking for in a loan. HMMMMM! So with that being said, we added the stairs and the carpet. The home is almost done on the inside (Very small stuff)  now we just need a little paint on the outside and some fence repairs and it will be ready for a renter. The entire time we have worked on this home hoping for a little money. We were hoping to have this rented out on June 1St. Nope not a chance!  The second appraisal was done and our little investment appraised for much higher then the first appraisal. Our hard work has paid off! Which we thought......So we started our loan process on 04/06/2015 in hope to have the remodel completed and rented out by 6/1/2015. Nope still no loan and not rented out. On 08/17/2015 we were told we were going to sign papers on 08/18/2015 and have our money soon. Well with that being said, on 08/18/2015 @2:30 PM we still had not heard a word from them so I sent an email with no response back and they close at 5PM. Finally at 4:30PM I got a call stating sorry your paperwork has expired and your credit score has changed NO LOAN! So here we sit no money! They nickel and dimed us with two appraisals and a lot of running around to meet a dead line. Which we did everything they asked of us. I mean everything!!! We put our home life on hold. We tried very hard not to spend any money and keep things up and running. It took them four months of a lot of bullshit stories to tell us NO!  At one point I told them that they were just waiting for us to screw up so they could us it against us! They said no we wouldn't do that to anyone!! BULLSHIT! I repeat don't go near this company they should be shut down and I'm surprised they don't have any lawsuits against them!! Maybe they do and no one can post about it?? This review is a NO STARS REVIEW!!! Stay away from IMPAC!







Impac Mortage is impossible to work with.  They can't "find" payments sent electronically from my bank (Wells Fargo) despite conference calls with the bank people.  They put customers on hold forever and it's impossible to speak with a supervisor. If you fax information (with proof of fax) they say they can't find the fax.  Everything has to be "researched" with a 5-7 business day research period.  Please, if you have a choice, don't use Impac Mortgage.







Impac  Commercial Lending has unethical practices and have the worst customer service. They put hefty penalties for loans that are not revealed in an apparent manner. They give loans without explaining the terms which are of course in fine print. I am surprised that after the financial crisis they continue to work in such a way. Impac definitely need to be scrutinized by federal agencies on their practices and unethical ways of lending! 

We had a commercial loan with them with. At the time we got the loan there was a prepayment penalty. We modified the loan - they charged us the prepayment penalty when modifying the loan. On top of that they added a new prepayment penalty on the modified note. We were desperate for the modification so had to accept their terms! We sold the property and had to pay the prepayment penalty. So now we have paid penalty twice of hefty amount

On top of that, what was most ethical was when we sold the property recently and the escrow company got the payoff demand  , Impac charged us an extra month of interest. They said that we had to let them know 30 days in advance that we are closing the loan with them. That is a complete robbery! I am surprised that these practices are allowed- to charge an extra month of interest if the lender is not notified 30 days in advance that they will be closing the loan! This was over $5000.

They have the worst customer service. 
Their senior management is the worst I have ever seen.  They are rude, lack the proper communication skills and plain out unethical. They refuse to communicate to their customers. If they do they are intimidating techniques for doing business.

Mr. Ashmore who is the president of the company and who has an article in a reputable Forbes  magazine talks to you as if you a piece of garbage!. It is appalling to see a President of the company treating their customer so rudely and unethically. I am sure the way he acts is translated throughout the company.
I do hope that their practices are challenged in doing commercial lending. {Please beware before doing any loans with them.







Absolute disaster, bunch of unprofessional people, don't waist your time. I have tried to refinance my existing loan in good standing with credit score of 790!!!!!they had me pay for an appraisal of my house and that's all they did ....after paying 450$ for an appraisal I  waited and  waited and waited....  For whatever unexplained reason all they could say there some issues ... Oh yeah what issues?  House appraised for 20000$ below what they thought it would and we are talking about $620000 loan for 30 years !!!!! give me a break please!!!!! I have been paying my current loan for 8 years with never being late, I have steady job , perfect credit score. there are issues .... what kind of issues?.......No one knows I suppose, besides the fact that having a property in San Francisco Bay Area you can't risk anything!!! Bottom line don't waist your time with this company they are ridiculously unprofessional and lucking knowledge on current mortgage lending:( horrible experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This stupid company f***** up my property taxes. They've been collecting it in impounds but didn't bother to pay it . I find out today because I was doing my income taxes. I see there's a $120 late fee assessed. You think I can get those for her to pay it? I'm not holding my breath . just screwed up my tax refund too by not paying it last year. These people are f****** idiots!!!!!! Try to speak to a supervisor. They tell me no supervisor will take calls. What kind of fuked up place is this!

Incredibly Great Experience With This Mortgage Company. I'd rate it 10 stars if possible.Last year we went through our Seattle-based mortgage broker when we re-financed our home loan. We were assigned to Impac Mortgage and completed the process. Last November, we received an e-mail from Leif Potter from Impac asking us if were were interested in doing a stream-line refinance which would lower our monthly payment. My wife made contact with Mr. Potter and agreed to start the process based on how professional he was on the phone.By far this was the smoothest real estate loan we have ever done. What has impressed my wife and I more than anything was how professional Leif and his associates have been throughout the entire process. We were constantly kept up to date on time lines, document requests, and recent Federal loan changes. Unlike our previous re-finance process with our broker where we our kept us in the dark for months, and constantly received criptic e-mails regarding the delays, Impac has gone way beyond our expectations. There has not been one element of this loan transaction that has been a surprise, or has not been fully explained. We appreciated timely responses to any questions we had during the process.My wife and I highly recommend this company if you are considering re-financing or establishing a new mortgage. More so, we highly recommend you contact Mr. Leif Potter. You will be delighted with his customer service and how well he communicates with his clients. He is well versed in the mortgage process and is someone you can trust.

First, I was transferred four times, each time the representative of Impac was so rude they didn't give me a chance to explain how I needed help, if they had I wouldn't have been transferred so many times. After the above fun (not!), I sat on hold for 20 mins. I was finally connected to Sheranda who allowed me only to ask one question before she started rattling off a policy that states they cannot change the payment due date. If she had given me time to explain she would have discovered there was much more to my inquiry. This company is rude, unprofessional and I pray my loan is sold soon so I don't have to deal with these donkeys.

Relative to the other Alternative Lenders in the California lending market, Jason Vaccariello's team at Impac Mortgage offers the most efficient loan processing at the most competitive pricing & terms. I've brokered Alt-Doc deals to all of their competitors and from experience I can tell you that all other Alternative Lenders are administratively incompetent (bordering on negligent) whereas Jason and his Impac Mortgage team actually funds deals per their guidelines whereas others do not.  The loan process with Alternative Lenders are inherently more complicated and time-consuming than with conventional lenders as they are generally more complex, unique and complicated loan scenarios that conventional lenders have declined, such as stated income, or borrowers with damaged credit. Despite these challenges Impac still comes through and funds deals (even though it's not always easy). My brokerage has funded close to 100 deals with them so far and counting.

If you are thinking of working for this company...DONT!!!!!  The company is unprofessional and lacks integrity especially as it relates to their Quality Control Department.  In specific the management of this department have egos and control issues that completely lacks an ounce of professionalism.  Seriously the VP needs to take a course in human ethics.

This company fuxxxxxcking sucks.  1 star from everyone, how is this company still in business?  They collect my taxes and they pay the county half of it.  I called them, press1, and 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 hold, 15 minutes later enter your loan number or social and wait and wait and wait, after half hour someone picks up, what is you loan number? what is your address? what is this and what is that.  You guys are taking my taxes and not paying them, you are responsible for that now us, OK, cancel my escrow I'll pay my own taxes, email us or fax us.  I emailed them and got auto email back saying we'll get back to you in 10 business days.  10 BUSINESS DAYS?  Fuk this company.

I'm updating them to a 3 because they finally fixed my impound account and I haven't had any problems with them since. I still wouldn't recommend them due to the rough start.

So here I sit weeks later,  they lost my  check i sent certified mail start my escrow,  I helped them locate it but then they applied it to my mortgage payments rather than escrow even though I wrote escrow on the check and mailed it to the escrow dept. A week ago I notified them of their mistake which they a knowledged with a promise that this morning my escrow account would be set up. Today not only did they not set it up,  they denied it because it dd not meet the deadline,  certified mail says that they received it 2 weeks before the deadline.  Plus they charge me a late fee on the first auto payment they lost. You have been warned!

Refinancing with Impac was fairly easy and I got a great rate. The problem is they were in such a hurry to sign me up that the salesman did not set up a escrow account and when I asked about it he said they don't do that until after they receive the first mortgage payment. (This is my 5th time purchasing or refinancing and I've ALWAYS had my escrow account set up at the time of transaction). It is 4 months later and I am still trying to set up the account only rather than building it into the loan which is the norm they need a check for $5,500--Which I scraped together and sent it certified mail--the only address I was given was a P.O.  Box so that's not making me feel very secure. To top it off they have lost this months payment which my bank shows as processed 2 weeks ago. My bank faxed them the proof and gave me a copy of proof that the fax went through. I just got off the phone with Impac who told me over the  they never received the fax and had me email my statement to them. They now say that they received the email and it will take 5 working days to research it. Meanwhile they will be charging me a late fee in 4 days and if they do not clear up their mess soon I fear it will go on my credit report. We have dealt with Impac over the phone at approx. 20 times in the past few months trying to get them to fix their mistakes. More contact than I have had over the past 33 years with my other lenders combined. If you have taken the time to read all of this I'd hope you'd be wise enough to find a company that is more professional.

My loan was sold to Impac Mortgage.  I am now counting down the days to refinance again (have to wait 6 months) so I can leave this company.  They charge to auto draft (from your checking account) to pay them.  I scheduled my auto draft on the 3rd (they charge from 5 days to 15 days).  They sent me a notice I was scheduled for the 5th (assuming so they could charge me?).  I had to call them once.  There is phone loop they put you through.  You keep pushing some number on the phone to get a rep.  I had to do this at least 25 times before I got a person.  I was starting to think there was no one to pick up the phone.  I would NEVER use this company.  I am waiting to refinance so I can leave this company.

Updated review



Update: Is it now March and this has not been resolved. I was in touch with someone named Dargis Martinez who has been little to no help. I have since been reimbursed for the amount I overpaid in the first four months but they have yet to reconfigure my monthly mortgage payment. I have left 6 messages for Dargis and no response. If you would like to call her and try to get her to call me back her number is 757-452-5388.

I paid off my hazard insurance in October 2014 (their policy when you switch insurance companies in the first year) and was told my loan would need to be readjusted to reflect the lower mortgage. First I was told it would be done in November. Then it wasn't, and I was told no longer than December it would be done. When I called in January to see if it was done, of course they said it hadn't yet. They told me 15 more business days. So, I called 15 business days later. And guess what? Still not done. Someone named Caja said she put in an expedited request and assured me that either that day but no later than the following day it would be resolved. I called 2 days later and guess what? Still not done. I call back again today, wait on hold 17 minutes only to speak with someone for a moment, get placed back on hold and hung up on. I am here, sitting on hold again now with a manager who says it still hasn't been done. I am just tired of being told it will be taken care of and it isn't. And I have been overpaying for 3 months now. How easy do you think it will be for me to get the money I have over payed? I only wish they would sell my loan to someone else. Oh and I have a credit score of over 800 and always make payments on time. I never wish this kind of service on anyone else.

I called them before I saw these reviews.  They made me fill out a lot of stuff online and then called me back, the guy wasn't very nice and eventually told me I did not qualify.  They follow the same guidelines as major lenders from what I heard so the articles in which they are referenced are all false.. stay away!

DO NOT GO NEAR IMPAC MORTGAGE!*********** ZERO STARS***********They will ruin your life with the bullshit stories! They'll end up costing you more money and nothing but heart ache at the end!  They order an appraisal on our house in May of 2015  and it was completed. Only to find out that they ordered the wrong one and stated it was our fault. Not sure how that works but at any rate.... On the first appraisal it stated we needed to hang doors and add fire alarms to finish our process. Which we did. A few months go by and they decided they needed another appraisal which was going to be much more extensive and costly.  Really two appraisals? I guestioned them about the second appraisal and raised holly hell with them. Which them they come back and state you need to add stairs on deck and add carpet to the house. Never mentioned in first appraisal to be completed! Mined you yet this is a refinance on a rental for a complete remodel. We own the home outright. Just need a little money for a home facelift. The home appraised for more then what we are asking for in a loan. HMMMMM! So with that being said, we added the stairs and the carpet. The home is almost done on the inside (Very small stuff)  now we just need a little paint on the outside and some fence repairs and it will be ready for a renter. The entire time we have worked on this home hoping for a little money. We were hoping to have this rented out on June 1St. Nope not a chance!  The second appraisal was done and our little investment appraised for much higher then the first appraisal. Our hard work has paid off! Which we thought......So we started our loan process on 04/06/2015 in hope to have the remodel completed and rented out by 6/1/2015. Nope still no loan and not rented out. On 08/17/2015 we were told we were going to sign papers on 08/18/2015 and have our money soon. Well with that being said, on 08/18/2015 @2:30 PM we still had not heard a word from them so I sent an email with no response back and they close at 5PM. Finally at 4:30PM I got a call stating sorry your paperwork has expired and your credit score has changed NO LOAN! So here we sit no money! They nickel and dimed us with two appraisals and a lot of running around to meet a dead line. Which we did everything they asked of us. I mean everything!!! We put our home life on hold. We tried very hard not to spend any money and keep things up and running. It took them four months of a lot of bullshit stories to tell us NO!  At one point I told them that they were just waiting for us to screw up so they could us it against us! They said no we wouldn't do that to anyone!! BULLSHIT! I repeat don't go near this company they should be shut down and I'm surprised they don't have any lawsuits against them!! Maybe they do and no one can post about it?? This review is a NO STARS REVIEW!!! Stay away from IMPAC!

Impac Mortage is impossible to work with.  They can't "find" payments sent electronically from my bank (Wells Fargo) despite conference calls with the bank people.  They put customers on hold forever and it's impossible to speak with a supervisor. If you fax information (with proof of fax) they say they can't find the fax.  Everything has to be "researched" with a 5-7 business day research period.  Please, if you have a choice, don't use Impac Mortgage.

Impac  Commercial Lending has unethical practices and have the worst customer service. They put hefty penalties for loans that are not revealed in an apparent manner. They give loans without explaining the terms which are of course in fine print. I am surprised that after the financial crisis they continue to work in such a way. Impac definitely need to be scrutinized by federal agencies on their practices and unethical ways of lending! We had a commercial loan with them with. At the time we got the loan there was a prepayment penalty. We modified the loan - they charged us the prepayment penalty when modifying the loan. On top of that they added a new prepayment penalty on the modified note. We were desperate for the modification so had to accept their terms! We sold the property and had to pay the prepayment penalty. So now we have paid penalty twice of hefty amountOn top of that, what was most ethical was when we sold the property recently and the escrow company got the payoff demand  , Impac charged us an extra month of interest. They said that we had to let them know 30 days in advance that we are closing the loan with them. That is a complete robbery! I am surprised that these practices are allowed- to charge an extra month of interest if the lender is not notified 30 days in advance that they will be closing the loan! This was over $5000.They have the worst customer service. Their senior management is the worst I have ever seen.  They are rude, lack the proper communication skills and plain out unethical. They refuse to communicate to their customers. If they do they are intimidating techniques for doing business.Mr. Ashmore who is the president of the company and who has an article in a reputable Forbes  magazine talks to you as if you a piece of garbage!. It is appalling to see a President of the company treating their customer so rudely and unethically. I am sure the way he acts is translated throughout the company.I do hope that their practices are challenged in doing commercial lending. {Please beware before doing any loans with them.

Absolute disaster, bunch of unprofessional people, don't waist your time. I have tried to refinance my existing loan in good standing with credit score of 790!!!!!they had me pay for an appraisal of my house and that's all they did ....after paying 450$ for an appraisal I  waited and  waited and waited....  For whatever unexplained reason all they could say there some issues ... Oh yeah what issues?  House appraised for 20000$ below what they thought it would and we are talking about $620000 loan for 30 years !!!!! give me a break please!!!!! I have been paying my current loan for 8 years with never being late, I have steady job , perfect credit score. there are issues .... what kind of issues?.......No one knows I suppose, besides the fact that having a property in San Francisco Bay Area you can't risk anything!!! Bottom line don't waist your time with this company they are ridiculously unprofessional and lucking knowledge on current mortgage lending:( horrible experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Relative to the other Alternative Lenders in the California lending market, Jason Vaccariello's team at Impac Mortgage offers the most efficient loan processing at the most competitive pricing & terms. I've brokered Alt-Doc deals to all of their competitors and from experience I can tell you that all other Alternative Lenders are administratively incompetent (bordering on negligent) whereas Jason and his Impac Mortgage team actually funds deals per their guidelines whereas others do not.  The loan process with Alternative Lenders are inherently more complicated and time-consuming than with conventional lenders as they are generally more complex, unique and complicated loan scenarios that conventional lenders have declined, such as stated income, or borrowers with damaged credit. Despite these challenges Impac still comes through and funds deals (even though it's not always easy). My brokerage has funded close to 100 deals with them so far and counting.







Incredibly Great Experience With This Mortgage Company. I'd rate it 10 stars if possible.

Last year we went through our Seattle-based mortgage broker when we re-financed our home loan. We were assigned to Impac Mortgage and completed the process. 

Last November, we received an e-mail from Leif Potter from Impac asking us if were were interested in doing a stream-line refinance which would lower our monthly payment. My wife made contact with Mr. Potter and agreed to start the process based on how professional he was on the phone.

By far this was the smoothest real estate loan we have ever done. What has impressed my wife and I more than anything was how professional Leif and his associates have been throughout the entire process. We were constantly kept up to date on time lines, document requests, and recent Federal loan changes. Unlike our previous re-finance process with our broker where we our kept us in the dark for months, and constantly received criptic e-mails regarding the delays, Impac has gone way beyond our expectations. There has not been one element of this loan transaction that has been a surprise, or has not been fully explained. We appreciated timely responses to any questions we had during the process.

My wife and I highly recommend this company if you are considering re-financing or establishing a new mortgage. More so, we highly recommend you contact Mr. Leif Potter. You will be delighted with his customer service and how well he communicates with his clients. He is well versed in the mortgage process and is someone you can trust.







This stupid company f***** up my property taxes. They've been collecting it in impounds but didn't bother to pay it . I find out today because I was doing my income taxes. I see there's a $120 late fee assessed. You think I can get those for her to pay it? I'm not holding my breath . just screwed up my tax refund too by not paying it last year. These people are f****** idiots!!!!!! Try to speak to a supervisor. They tell me no supervisor will take calls. What kind of fuked up place is this!







First, I was transferred four times, each time the representative of Impac was so rude they didn't give me a chance to explain how I needed help, if they had I wouldn't have been transferred so many times. 

After the above fun (not!), I sat on hold for 20 mins. 

I was finally connected to Sheranda who allowed me only to ask one question before she started rattling off a policy that states they cannot change the payment due date. If she had given me time to explain she would have discovered there was much more to my inquiry. 

This company is rude, unprofessional and I pray my loan is sold soon so I don't have to deal with these donkeys.

Zero Stars. These people are pure shit.

Got a pre-APPROVAL (not pre-qual) letter. Sold my house. Bought a plane ticket to go put an offer down where I wanted to move, then told I DON'T QUALIFY.

Unless you want a complete idiot to FUCK YOUR LIFE UP, avoid these pieces of shit.







If you are thinking of working for this company...DONT!!!!!  The company is unprofessional and lacks integrity especially as it relates to their Quality Control Department.  In specific the management of this department have egos and control issues that completely lacks an ounce of professionalism.  Seriously the VP needs to take a course in human ethics.







This company fuxxxxxcking sucks.  1 star from everyone, how is this company still in business?  They collect my taxes and they pay the county half of it.  I called them, press1, and 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 hold, 15 minutes later enter your loan number or social and wait and wait and wait, after half hour someone picks up, what is you loan number? what is your address? what is this and what is that.  You guys are taking my taxes and not paying them, you are responsible for that now us, OK, cancel my escrow I'll pay my own taxes, email us or fax us.  I emailed them and got auto email back saying we'll get back to you in 10 business days.  10 BUSINESS DAYS?  Fuk this company.







I refinanced my mortgage and the bill is due the 1st and late on the 16th. if they don't have it the 1st the phone is ringing off the DAMN hook. I never thought I would miss BofA but I do. in 22 years of owning homes, I have never ever been late and have an 819 fico score. these Aholes call and call and call with an automated call us back BS. I just blocked their #. FU impac!







I'm updating them to a 3 because they finally fixed my impound account and I haven't had any problems with them since. I still wouldn't recommend them due to the rough start.







My loan was sold to Impac Mortgage.  I am now counting down the days to refinance again (have to wait 6 months) so I can leave this company.  They charge to auto draft (from your checking account) to pay them.  I scheduled my auto draft on the 3rd (they charge from 5 days to 15 days).  They sent me a notice I was scheduled for the 5th (assuming so they could charge me?).  I had to call them once.  There is phone loop they put you through.  You keep pushing some number on the phone to get a rep.  I had to do this at least 25 times before I got a person.  I was starting to think there was no one to pick up the phone.  I would NEVER use this company.  I am waiting to refinance so I can leave this company.







Update: Is it now March and this has not been resolved. I was in touch with someone named Dargis Martinez who has been little to no help. I have since been reimbursed for the amount I overpaid in the first four months but they have yet to reconfigure my monthly mortgage payment. I have left 6 messages for Dargis and no response. If you would like to call her and try to get her to call me back her number is 757-452-5388.







DO NOT GO NEAR IMPAC MORTGAGE!*********** ZERO STARS***********They will ruin your life with the bullshit stories! They'll end up costing you more money and nothing but heart ache at the end!  They order an appraisal on our house in May of 2015  and it was completed. Only to find out that they ordered the wrong one and stated it was our fault. Not sure how that works but at any rate.... On the first appraisal it stated we needed to hang doors and add fire alarms to finish our process. Which we did. A few months go by and they decided they needed another appraisal which was going to be much more extensive and costly.  Really two appraisals? I guestioned them about the second appraisal and raised holly hell with them. Which them they come back and state you need to add stairs on deck and add carpet to the house. Never mentioned in first appraisal to be completed! Mined you yet this is a refinance on a rental for a complete remodel. We own the home outright. Just need a little money for a home facelift. The home appraised for more then what we are asking for in a loan. HMMMMM! So with that being said, we added the stairs and the carpet. The home is almost done on the inside (Very small stuff)  now we just need a little paint on the outside and some fence repairs and it will be ready for a renter. The entire time we have worked on this home hoping for a little money. We were hoping to have this rented out on June 1St. Nope not a chance!  The second appraisal was done and our little investment appraised for much higher then the first appraisal. Our hard work has paid off! Which we thought......So we started our loan process on 04/06/2015 in hope to have the remodel completed and rented out by 6/1/2015. Nope still no loan and not rented out. On 08/17/2015 we were told we were going to sign papers on 08/18/2015 and have our money soon. Well with that being said, on 08/18/2015 @2:30 PM we still had not heard a word from them so I sent an email with no response back and they close at 5PM. Finally at 4:30PM I got a call stating sorry your paperwork has expired and your credit score has changed NO LOAN! So here we sit no money! They nickel and dimed us with two appraisals and a lot of running around to meet a dead line. Which we did everything they asked of us. I mean everything!!! We put our home life on hold. We tried very hard not to spend any money and keep things up and running. It took them four months of a lot of bullshit stories to tell us NO!  At one point I told them that they were just waiting for us to screw up so they could us it against us! They said no we wouldn't do that to anyone!! BULLSHIT! I repeat don't go near this company they should be shut down and I'm surprised they don't have any lawsuits against them!! Maybe they do and no one can post about it?? This review is a NO STARS REVIEW!!! Stay away from IMPAC!







I called them before I saw these reviews.  They made me fill out a lot of stuff online and then called me back, the guy wasn't very nice and eventually told me I did not qualify.  They follow the same guidelines as major lenders from what I heard so the articles in which they are referenced are all false.. stay away!







Impac Mortage is impossible to work with.  They can't "find" payments sent electronically from my bank (Wells Fargo) despite conference calls with the bank people.  They put customers on hold forever and it's impossible to speak with a supervisor. If you fax information (with proof of fax) they say they can't find the fax.  Everything has to be "researched" with a 5-7 business day research period.  Please, if you have a choice, don't use Impac Mortgage.







Impac  Commercial Lending has unethical practices and have the worst customer service. They put hefty penalties for loans that are not revealed in an apparent manner. They give loans without explaining the terms which are of course in fine print. I am surprised that after the financial crisis they continue to work in such a way. Impac definitely need to be scrutinized by federal agencies on their practices and unethical ways of lending! 

We had a commercial loan with them with. At the time we got the loan there was a prepayment penalty. We modified the loan - they charged us the prepayment penalty when modifying the loan. On top of that they added a new prepayment penalty on the modified note. We were desperate for the modification so had to accept their terms! We sold the property and had to pay the prepayment penalty. So now we have paid penalty twice of hefty amount

On top of that, what was most ethical was when we sold the property recently and the escrow company got the payoff demand  , Impac charged us an extra month of interest. They said that we had to let them know 30 days in advance that we are closing the loan with them. That is a complete robbery! I am surprised that these practices are allowed- to charge an extra month of interest if the lender is not notified 30 days in advance that they will be closing the loan! This was over $5000.

They have the worst customer service. 
Their senior management is the worst I have ever seen.  They are rude, lack the proper communication skills and plain out unethical. They refuse to communicate to their customers. If they do they are intimidating techniques for doing business.

Mr. Ashmore who is the president of the company and who has an article in a reputable Forbes  magazine talks to you as if you a piece of garbage!. It is appalling to see a President of the company treating their customer so rudely and unethically. I am sure the way he acts is translated throughout the company.
I do hope that their practices are challenged in doing commercial lending. {Please beware before doing any loans with them.







Absolute disaster, bunch of unprofessional people, don't waist your time. I have tried to refinance my existing loan in good standing with credit score of 790!!!!!they had me pay for an appraisal of my house and that's all they did ....after paying 450$ for an appraisal I  waited and  waited and waited....  For whatever unexplained reason all they could say there some issues ... Oh yeah what issues?  House appraised for 20000$ below what they thought it would and we are talking about $620000 loan for 30 years !!!!! give me a break please!!!!! I have been paying my current loan for 8 years with never being late, I have steady job , perfect credit score. there are issues .... what kind of issues?.......No one knows I suppose, besides the fact that having a property in San Francisco Bay Area you can't risk anything!!! Bottom line don't waist your time with this company they are ridiculously unprofessional and lucking knowledge on current mortgage lending:( horrible experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Relative to the other Alternative Lenders in the California lending market, Jason Vaccariello's team at Impac Mortgage offers the most efficient loan processing at the most competitive pricing & terms. I've brokered Alt-Doc deals to all of their competitors and from experience I can tell you that all other Alternative Lenders are administratively incompetent (bordering on negligent) whereas Jason and his Impac Mortgage team actually funds deals per their guidelines whereas others do not.  The loan process with Alternative Lenders are inherently more complicated and time-consuming than with conventional lenders as they are generally more complex, unique and complicated loan scenarios that conventional lenders have declined, such as stated income, or borrowers with damaged credit. Despite these challenges Impac still comes through and funds deals (even though it's not always easy). My brokerage has funded close to 100 deals with them so far and counting.

Incredibly Great Experience With This Mortgage Company. I'd rate it 10 stars if possible.Last year we went through our Seattle-based mortgage broker when we re-financed our home loan. We were assigned to Impac Mortgage and completed the process. Last November, we received an e-mail from Leif Potter from Impac asking us if were were interested in doing a stream-line refinance which would lower our monthly payment. My wife made contact with Mr. Potter and agreed to start the process based on how professional he was on the phone.By far this was the smoothest real estate loan we have ever done. What has impressed my wife and I more than anything was how professional Leif and his associates have been throughout the entire process. We were constantly kept up to date on time lines, document requests, and recent Federal loan changes. Unlike our previous re-finance process with our broker where we our kept us in the dark for months, and constantly received criptic e-mails regarding the delays, Impac has gone way beyond our expectations. There has not been one element of this loan transaction that has been a surprise, or has not been fully explained. We appreciated timely responses to any questions we had during the process.My wife and I highly recommend this company if you are considering re-financing or establishing a new mortgage. More so, we highly recommend you contact Mr. Leif Potter. You will be delighted with his customer service and how well he communicates with his clients. He is well versed in the mortgage process and is someone you can trust.

I see there's a $120 late fee assessed. You think I can get those for her to pay it? I'm not holding my breath . just screwed up my tax refund too by not paying it last year. These people are f****** idiots!!!!!! Try to speak to a supervisor. They tell me no supervisor will take calls. What kind of fuked up place is this!

First, I was transferred four times, each time the representative of Impac was so rude they didn't give me a chance to explain how I needed help, if they had I wouldn't have been transferred so many times. After the above fun (not!), I sat on hold for 20 mins. I was finally connected to Sheranda who allowed me only to ask one question before she started rattling off a policy that states they cannot change the payment due date. If she had given me time to explain she would have discovered there was much more to my inquiry. This company is rude, unprofessional and I pray my loan is sold soon so I don't have to deal with these donkeys.

If you are thinking of working for this company...DONT!!!!!  The company is unprofessional and lacks integrity especially as it relates to their Quality Control Department.  In specific the management of this department have egos and control issues that completely lacks an ounce of professionalism.  Seriously the VP needs to take a course in human ethics.

So here I sit weeks later,  they lost my  check i sent certified mail start my escrow,  I helped them locate it but then they applied it to my mortgage payments rather than escrow even though I wrote escrow on the check and mailed it to the escrow dept. A week ago I notified them of their mistake which they a knowledged with a promise that this morning my escrow account would be set up. Today not only did they not set it up,  they denied it because it dd not meet the deadline,  certified mail says that they received it 2 weeks before the deadline.  Plus they charge me a late fee on the first auto payment they lost. You have been warned!

Refinancing with Impac was fairly easy and I got a great rate. The problem is they were in such a hurry to sign me up that the salesman did not set up a escrow account and when I asked about it he said they don't do that until after they receive the first mortgage payment. (This is my 5th time purchasing or refinancing and I've ALWAYS had my escrow account set up at the time of transaction). It is 4 months later and I am still trying to set up the account only rather than building it into the loan which is the norm they need a check for $5,500--Which I scraped together and sent it certified mail--the only address I was given was a P.O.  Box so that's not making me feel very secure. To top it off they have lost this months payment which my bank shows as processed 2 weeks ago. My bank faxed them the proof and gave me a copy of proof that the fax went through. I just got off the phone with Impac who told me over the  they never received the fax and had me email my statement to them. They now say that they received the email and it will take 5 working days to research it. Meanwhile they will be charging me a late fee in 4 days and if they do not clear up their mess soon I fear it will go on my credit report. We have dealt with Impac over the phone at approx. 20 times in the past few months trying to get them to fix their mistakes. More contact than I have had over the past 33 years with my other lenders combined. If you have taken the time to read all of this I'd hope you'd be wise enough to find a company that is more professional.

My loan was sold to Impac Mortgage.  I am now counting down the days to refinance again (have to wait 6 months) so I can leave this company.  They charge to auto draft (from your checking account) to pay them.  I scheduled my auto draft on the 3rd (they charge from 5 days to 15 days).  They sent me a notice I was scheduled for the 5th (assuming so they could charge me?).  I had to call them once.  There is phone loop they put you through.  You keep pushing some number on the phone to get a rep.  I had to do this at least 25 times before I got a person.  I was starting to think there was no one to pick up the phone.  I would NEVER use this company.  I am waiting to refinance so I can leave this company.

Update: Is it now March and this has not been resolved. I was in touch with someone named Dargis Martinez who has been little to no help. I have since been reimbursed for the amount I overpaid in the first four months but they have yet to reconfigure my monthly mortgage payment. I have left 6 messages for Dargis and no response. If you would like to call her and try to get her to call me back her number is 757-452-5388.

I paid off my hazard insurance in October 2014 (their policy when you switch insurance companies in the first year) and was told my loan would need to be readjusted to reflect the lower mortgage. First I was told it would be done in November. Then it wasn't, and I was told no longer than December it would be done. When I called in January to see if it was done, of course they said it hadn't yet. They told me 15 more business days. So, I called 15 business days later. And guess what? Still not done. Someone named Caja said she put in an expedited request and assured me that either that day but no later than the following day it would be resolved. I called 2 days later and guess what? Still not done. I call back again today, wait on hold 17 minutes only to speak with someone for a moment, get placed back on hold and hung up on. I am here, sitting on hold again now with a manager who says it still hasn't been done. I am just tired of being told it will be taken care of and it isn't. And I have been overpaying for 3 months now. How easy do you think it will be for me to get the money I have over payed? I only wish they would sell my loan to someone else. Oh and I have a credit score of over 800 and always make payments on time. I never wish this kind of service on anyone else.

DO NOT GO NEAR IMPAC MORTGAGE!*********** ZERO STARS***********They will ruin your life with the bullshit stories! They'll end up costing you more money and nothing but heart ache at the end!  They order an appraisal on our house in May of 2015  and it was completed. Only to find out that they ordered the wrong one and stated it was our fault. Not sure how that works but at any rate.... On the first appraisal it stated we needed to hang doors and add fire alarms to finish our process. Which we did. A few months go by and they decided they needed another appraisal which was going to be much more extensive and costly.  Really two appraisals? I guestioned them about the second appraisal and raised holly hell with them. Which them they come back and state you need to add stairs on deck and add carpet to the house. Never mentioned in first appraisal to be completed! Mined you yet this is a refinance on a rental for a complete remodel. We own the home outright. Just need a little money for a home facelift. The home appraised for more then what we are asking for in a loan. HMMMMM! So with that being said, we added the stairs and the carpet. The home is almost done on the inside (Very small stuff)  now we just need a little paint on the outside and some fence repairs and it will be ready for a renter. The entire time we have worked on this home hoping for a little money. We were hoping to have this rented out on June 1St. Nope not a chance!  The second appraisal was done and our little investment appraised for much higher then the first appraisal. Our hard work has paid off! Which we thought......So we started our loan process on 04/06/2015 in hope to have the remodel completed and rented out by 6/1/2015. Nope still no loan and not rented out. On 08/17/2015 we were told we were going to sign papers on 08/18/2015 and have our money soon. Well with that being said, on 08/18/2015 @2:30 PM we still had not heard a word from them so I sent an email with no response back and they close at 5PM. Finally at 4:30PM I got a call stating sorry your paperwork has expired and your credit score has changed NO LOAN! So here we sit no money! They nickel and dimed us with two appraisals and a lot of running around to meet a dead line. Which we did everything they asked of us. I mean everything!!! We put our home life on hold. We tried very hard not to spend any money and keep things up and running. It took them four months of a lot of bullshit stories to tell us NO!  At one point I told them that they were just waiting for us to screw up so they could us it against us! They said no we wouldn't do that to anyone!! BULLSHIT! I repeat don't go near this company they should be shut down and I'm surprised they don't have any lawsuits against them!! Maybe they do and no one can post about it?? This review is a NO STARS REVIEW!!! Stay away from IMPAC!

I called them before I saw these reviews.  They made me fill out a lot of stuff online and then called me back, the guy wasn't very nice and eventually told me I did not qualify.  They follow the same guidelines as major lenders from what I heard so the articles in which they are referenced are all false.. stay away!

Impac Mortage is impossible to work with.  They can't "find" payments sent electronically from my bank (Wells Fargo) despite conference calls with the bank people.  They put customers on hold forever and it's impossible to speak with a supervisor. If you fax information (with proof of fax) they say they can't find the fax.  Everything has to be "researched" with a 5-7 business day research period.  Please, if you have a choice, don't use Impac Mortgage.

Impac  Commercial Lending has unethical practices and have the worst customer service. They put hefty penalties for loans that are not revealed in an apparent manner. They give loans without explaining the terms which are of course in fine print. I am surprised that after the financial crisis they continue to work in such a way. Impac definitely need to be scrutinized by federal agencies on their practices and unethical ways of lending! We had a commercial loan with them with. At the time we got the loan there was a prepayment penalty. We modified the loan - they charged us the prepayment penalty when modifying the loan. On top of that they added a new prepayment penalty on the modified note. We were desperate for the modification so had to accept their terms! We sold the property and had to pay the prepayment penalty. So now we have paid penalty twice of hefty amountOn top of that, what was most ethical was when we sold the property recently and the escrow company got the payoff demand  , Impac charged us an extra month of interest. They said that we had to let them know 30 days in advance that we are closing the loan with them. That is a complete robbery! I am surprised that these practices are allowed- to charge an extra month of interest if the lender is not notified 30 days in advance that they will be closing the loan! This was over $5000.They have the worst customer service. Their senior management is the worst I have ever seen.  They are rude, lack the proper communication skills and plain out unethical. They refuse to communicate to their customers. If they do they are intimidating techniques for doing business.Mr. Ashmore who is the president of the company and who has an article in a reputable Forbes  magazine talks to you as if you a piece of garbage!. It is appalling to see a President of the company treating their customer so rudely and unethically. I am sure the way he acts is translated throughout the company.I do hope that their practices are challenged in doing commercial lending. {Please beware before doing any loans with them.

Absolute disaster, bunch of unprofessional people, don't waist your time. I have tried to refinance my existing loan in good standing with credit score of 790!!!!!they had me pay for an appraisal of my house and that's all they did ....after paying 450$ for an appraisal I  waited and  waited and waited....  For whatever unexplained reason all they could say there some issues ... Oh yeah what issues?  House appraised for 20000$ below what they thought it would and we are talking about $620000 loan for 30 years !!!!! give me a break please!!!!! I have been paying my current loan for 8 years with never being late, I have steady job , perfect credit score. there are issues .... what kind of issues?.......No one knows I suppose, besides the fact that having a property in San Francisco Bay Area you can't risk anything!!! Bottom line don't waist your time with this company they are ridiculously unprofessional and lucking knowledge on current mortgage lending:( horrible experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm updating them to a 3 because they finally fixed my impound account and I haven't had any problems with them since. I still wouldn't recommend them due to the rough start.







Incredibly Great Experience With This Mortgage Company. I'd rate it 10 stars if possible.

Last year we went through our Seattle-based mortgage broker when we re-financed our home loan. We were assigned to Impac Mortgage and completed the process. 

Last November, we received an e-mail from Leif Potter from Impac asking us if were were interested in doing a stream-line refinance which would lower our monthly payment. My wife made contact with Mr. Potter and agreed to start the process based on how professional he was on the phone.

By far this was the smoothest real estate loan we have ever done. What has impressed my wife and I more than anything was how professional Leif and his associates have been throughout the entire process. We were constantly kept up to date on time lines, document requests, and recent Federal loan changes. Unlike our previous re-finance process with our broker where we our kept us in the dark for months, and constantly received criptic e-mails regarding the delays, Impac has gone way beyond our expectations. There has not been one element of this loan transaction that has been a surprise, or has not been fully explained. We appreciated timely responses to any questions we had during the process.

My wife and I highly recommend this company if you are considering re-financing or establishing a new mortgage. More so, we highly recommend you contact Mr. Leif Potter. You will be delighted with his customer service and how well he communicates with his clients. He is well versed in the mortgage process and is someone you can trust.







This stupid company f***** up my property taxes. They've been collecting it in impounds but didn't bother to pay it . I find out today because I was doing my income taxes. I see there's a $120 late fee assessed. You think I can get those for her to pay it? I'm not holding my breath . just screwed up my tax refund too by not paying it last year. These people are f****** idiots!!!!!! Try to speak to a supervisor. They tell me no supervisor will take calls. What kind of fuked up place is this!







First, I was transferred four times, each time the representative of Impac was so rude they didn't give me a chance to explain how I needed help, if they had I wouldn't have been transferred so many times. 

After the above fun (not!), I sat on hold for 20 mins. 

I was finally connected to Sheranda who allowed me only to ask one question before she started rattling off a policy that states they cannot change the payment due date. If she had given me time to explain she would have discovered there was much more to my inquiry. 

This company is rude, unprofessional and I pray my loan is sold soon so I don't have to deal with these donkeys.







Relative to the other Alternative Lenders in the California lending market, Jason Vaccariello's team at Impac Mortgage offers the most efficient loan processing at the most competitive pricing & terms. I've brokered Alt-Doc deals to all of their competitors and from experience I can tell you that all other Alternative Lenders are administratively incompetent (bordering on negligent) whereas Jason and his Impac Mortgage team actually funds deals per their guidelines whereas others do not.  The loan process with Alternative Lenders are inherently more complicated and time-consuming than with conventional lenders as they are generally more complex, unique and complicated loan scenarios that conventional lenders have declined, such as stated income, or borrowers with damaged credit. Despite these challenges Impac still comes through and funds deals (even though it's not always easy). My brokerage has funded close to 100 deals with them so far and counting.







Zero Stars. These people are pure shit.

Got a pre-APPROVAL (not pre-qual) letter. Sold my house. Bought a plane ticket to go put an offer down where I wanted to move, then told I DON'T QUALIFY.

Unless you want a complete idiot to FUCK YOUR LIFE UP, avoid these pieces of shit.







If you are thinking of working for this company...DONT!!!!!  The company is unprofessional and lacks integrity especially as it relates to their Quality Control Department.  In specific the management of this department have egos and control issues that completely lacks an ounce of professionalism.  Seriously the VP needs to take a course in human ethics.







This company fuxxxxxcking sucks.  1 star from everyone, how is this company still in business?  They collect my taxes and they pay the county half of it.  I called them, press1, and 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 hold, 15 minutes later enter your loan number or social and wait and wait and wait, after half hour someone picks up, what is you loan number? what is your address? what is this and what is that.  You guys are taking my taxes and not paying them, you are responsible for that now us, OK, cancel my escrow I'll pay my own taxes, email us or fax us.  I emailed them and got auto email back saying we'll get back to you in 10 business days.  10 BUSINESS DAYS?  Fuk this company.







I refinanced my mortgage and the bill is due the 1st and late on the 16th. if they don't have it the 1st the phone is ringing off the DAMN hook. I never thought I would miss BofA but I do. in 22 years of owning homes, I have never ever been late and have an 819 fico score. these Aholes call and call and call with an automated call us back BS. I just blocked their #. FU impac!







I'm updating them to a 3 because they finally fixed my impound account and I haven't had any problems with them since. I still wouldn't recommend them due to the rough start.







My loan was sold to Impac Mortgage.  I am now counting down the days to refinance again (have to wait 6 months) so I can leave this company.  They charge to auto draft (from your checking account) to pay them.  I scheduled my auto draft on the 3rd (they charge from 5 days to 15 days).  They sent me a notice I was scheduled for the 5th (assuming so they could charge me?).  I had to call them once.  There is phone loop they put you through.  You keep pushing some number on the phone to get a rep.  I had to do this at least 25 times before I got a person.  I was starting to think there was no one to pick up the phone.  I would NEVER use this company.  I am waiting to refinance so I can leave this company.







Update: Is it now March and this has not been resolved. I was in touch with someone named Dargis Martinez who has been little to no help. I have since been reimbursed for the amount I overpaid in the first four months but they have yet to reconfigure my monthly mortgage payment. I have left 6 messages for Dargis and no response. If you would like to call her and try to get her to call me back her number is 757-452-5388.







DO NOT GO NEAR IMPAC MORTGAGE!*********** ZERO STARS***********They will ruin your life with the bullshit stories! They'll end up costing you more money and nothing but heart ache at the end!  They order an appraisal on our house in May of 2015  and it was completed. Only to find out that they ordered the wrong one and stated it was our fault. Not sure how that works but at any rate.... On the first appraisal it stated we needed to hang doors and add fire alarms to finish our process. Which we did. A few months go by and they decided they needed another appraisal which was going to be much more extensive and costly.  Really two appraisals? I guestioned them about the second appraisal and raised holly hell with them. Which them they come back and state you need to add stairs on deck and add carpet to the house. Never mentioned in first appraisal to be completed! Mined you yet this is a refinance on a rental for a complete remodel. We own the home outright. Just need a little money for a home facelift. The home appraised for more then what we are asking for in a loan. HMMMMM! So with that being said, we added the stairs and the carpet. The home is almost done on the inside (Very small stuff)  now we just need a little paint on the outside and some fence repairs and it will be ready for a renter. The entire time we have worked on this home hoping for a little money. We were hoping to have this rented out on June 1St. Nope not a chance!  The second appraisal was done and our little investment appraised for much higher then the first appraisal. Our hard work has paid off! Which we thought......So we started our loan process on 04/06/2015 in hope to have the remodel completed and rented out by 6/1/2015. Nope still no loan and not rented out. On 08/17/2015 we were told we were going to sign papers on 08/18/2015 and have our money soon. Well with that being said, on 08/18/2015 @2:30 PM we still had not heard a word from them so I sent an email with no response back and they close at 5PM. Finally at 4:30PM I got a call stating sorry your paperwork has expired and your credit score has changed NO LOAN! So here we sit no money! They nickel and dimed us with two appraisals and a lot of running around to meet a dead line. Which we did everything they asked of us. I mean everything!!! We put our home life on hold. We tried very hard not to spend any money and keep things up and running. It took them four months of a lot of bullshit stories to tell us NO!  At one point I told them that they were just waiting for us to screw up so they could us it against us! They said no we wouldn't do that to anyone!! BULLSHIT! I repeat don't go near this company they should be shut down and I'm surprised they don't have any lawsuits against them!! Maybe they do and no one can post about it?? This review is a NO STARS REVIEW!!! Stay away from IMPAC!







I called them before I saw these reviews.  They made me fill out a lot of stuff online and then called me back, the guy wasn't very nice and eventually told me I did not qualify.  They follow the same guidelines as major lenders from what I heard so the articles in which they are referenced are all false.. stay away!







Impac Mortage is impossible to work with.  They can't "find" payments sent electronically from my bank (Wells Fargo) despite conference calls with the bank people.  They put customers on hold forever and it's impossible to speak with a supervisor. If you fax information (with proof of fax) they say they can't find the fax.  Everything has to be "researched" with a 5-7 business day research period.  Please, if you have a choice, don't use Impac Mortgage.







Impac  Commercial Lending has unethical practices and have the worst customer service. They put hefty penalties for loans that are not revealed in an apparent manner. They give loans without explaining the terms which are of course in fine print. I am surprised that after the financial crisis they continue to work in such a way. Impac definitely need to be scrutinized by federal agencies on their practices and unethical ways of lending! 

We had a commercial loan with them with. At the time we got the loan there was a prepayment penalty. We modified the loan - they charged us the prepayment penalty when modifying the loan. On top of that they added a new prepayment penalty on the modified note. We were desperate for the modification so had to accept their terms! We sold the property and had to pay the prepayment penalty. So now we have paid penalty twice of hefty amount

On top of that, what was most ethical was when we sold the property recently and the escrow company got the payoff demand  , Impac charged us an extra month of interest. They said that we had to let them know 30 days in advance that we are closing the loan with them. That is a complete robbery! I am surprised that these practices are allowed- to charge an extra month of interest if the lender is not notified 30 days in advance that they will be closing the loan! This was over $5000.

They have the worst customer service. 
Their senior management is the worst I have ever seen.  They are rude, lack the proper communication skills and plain out unethical. They refuse to communicate to their customers. If they do they are intimidating techniques for doing business.

Mr. Ashmore who is the president of the company and who has an article in a reputable Forbes  magazine talks to you as if you a piece of garbage!. It is appalling to see a President of the company treating their customer so rudely and unethically. I am sure the way he acts is translated throughout the company.
I do hope that their practices are challenged in doing commercial lending. {Please beware before doing any loans with them.







Absolute disaster, bunch of unprofessional people, don't waist your time. I have tried to refinance my existing loan in good standing with credit score of 790!!!!!they had me pay for an appraisal of my house and that's all they did ....after paying 450$ for an appraisal I  waited and  waited and waited....  For whatever unexplained reason all they could say there some issues ... Oh yeah what issues?  House appraised for 20000$ below what they thought it would and we are talking about $620000 loan for 30 years !!!!! give me a break please!!!!! I have been paying my current loan for 8 years with never being late, I have steady job , perfect credit score. there are issues .... what kind of issues?.......No one knows I suppose, besides the fact that having a property in San Francisco Bay Area you can't risk anything!!! Bottom line don't waist your time with this company they are ridiculously unprofessional and lucking knowledge on current mortgage lending:( horrible experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So here I sit weeks later,  they lost my  check i sent certified mail start my escrow,  I helped them locate it but then they applied it to my mortgage payments rather than escrow even though I wrote escrow on the check and mailed it to the escrow dept. A week ago I notified them of their mistake which they a knowledged with a promise that this morning my escrow account would be set up. Today not only did they not set it up,  they denied it because it dd not meet the deadline,  certified mail says that they received it 2 weeks before the deadline.  Plus they charge me a late fee on the first auto payment they lost. You have been warned!

Refinancing with Impac was fairly easy and I got a great rate. The problem is they were in such a hurry to sign me up that the salesman did not set up a escrow account and when I asked about it he said they don't do that until after they receive the first mortgage payment. (This is my 5th time purchasing or refinancing and I've ALWAYS had my escrow account set up at the time of transaction). It is 4 months later and I am still trying to set up the account only rather than building it into the loan which is the norm they need a check for $5,500--Which I scraped together and sent it certified mail--the only address I was given was a P.O.  Box so that's not making me feel very secure. To top it off they have lost this months payment which my bank shows as processed 2 weeks ago. My bank faxed them the proof and gave me a copy of proof that the fax went through. I just got off the phone with Impac who told me over the  they never received the fax and had me email my statement to them. They now say that they received the email and it will take 5 working days to research it. Meanwhile they will be charging me a late fee in 4 days and if they do not clear up their mess soon I fear it will go on my credit report. We have dealt with Impac over the phone at approx. 20 times in the past few months trying to get them to fix their mistakes. More contact than I have had over the past 33 years with my other lenders combined. If you have taken the time to read all of this I'd hope you'd be wise enough to find a company that is more professional.

Zero Stars. These people are pure shit.Got a pre-APPROVAL (not pre-qual) letter. Sold my house. Bought a plane ticket to go put an offer down where I wanted to move, then told I DON'T QUALIFY.Unless you want a complete idiot to FUCK YOUR LIFE UP, avoid these pieces of shit.

If you are thinking of working for this company...DONT!!!!!  The company is unprofessional and lacks integrity especially as it relates to their Quality Control Department.  In specific the management of this department have egos and control issues that completely lacks an ounce of professionalism.  Seriously the VP needs to take a course in human ethics.

This company fuxxxxxcking sucks.  1 star from everyone, how is this company still in business?  They collect my taxes and they pay the county half of it.  I called them, press1, and 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 hold, 15 minutes later enter your loan number or social and wait and wait and wait, after half hour someone picks up, what is you loan number? what is your address? what is this and what is that.  You guys are taking my taxes and not paying them, you are responsible for that now us, OK, cancel my escrow I'll pay my own taxes, email us or fax us.  I emailed them and got auto email back saying we'll get back to you in 10 business days.  10 BUSINESS DAYS?  Fuk this company.

My loan was sold to Impac Mortgage.  I am now counting down the days to refinance again (have to wait 6 months) so I can leave this company.  They charge to auto draft (from your checking account) to pay them.  I scheduled my auto draft on the 3rd (they charge from 5 days to 15 days).  They sent me a notice I was scheduled for the 5th (assuming so they could charge me?).  I had to call them once.  There is phone loop they put you through.  You keep pushing some number on the phone to get a rep.  I had to do this at least 25 times before I got a person.  I was starting to think there was no one to pick up the phone.  I would NEVER use this company.  I am waiting to refinance so I can leave this company.

Updated review



Update: Is it now March and this has not been resolved. I was in touch with someone named Dargis Martinez who has been little to no help. I have since been reimbursed for the amount I overpaid in the first four months but they have yet to reconfigure my monthly mortgage payment. I have left 6 messages for Dargis and no response. If you would like to call her and try to get her to call me back her number is 757-452-5388.

I paid off my hazard insurance in October 2014 (their policy when you switch insurance companies in the first year) and was told my loan would need to be readjusted to reflect the lower mortgage. First I was told it would be done in November. Then it wasn't, and I was told no longer than December it would be done. When I called in January to see if it was done, of course they said it hadn't yet. They told me 15 more business days. So, I called 15 business days later. And guess what? Still not done. Someone named Caja said she put in an expedited request and assured me that either that day but no later than the following day it would be resolved. I called 2 days later and guess what? Still not done. I call back again today, wait on hold 17 minutes only to speak with someone for a moment, get placed back on hold and hung up on. I am here, sitting on hold again now with a manager who says it still hasn't been done. I am just tired of being told it will be taken care of and it isn't. And I have been overpaying for 3 months now. How easy do you think it will be for me to get the money I have over payed? I only wish they would sell my loan to someone else. Oh and I have a credit score of over 800 and always make payments on time. I never wish this kind of service on anyone else.

DO NOT GO NEAR IMPAC MORTGAGE!*********** ZERO STARS***********They will ruin your life with the bullshit stories! They'll end up costing you more money and nothing but heart ache at the end!  They order an appraisal on our house in May of 2015  and it was completed. Only to find out that they ordered the wrong one and stated it was our fault. Not sure how that works but at any rate.... On the first appraisal it stated we needed to hang doors and add fire alarms to finish our process. Which we did. A few months go by and they decided they needed another appraisal which was going to be much more extensive and costly.  Really two appraisals? I guestioned them about the second appraisal and raised holly hell with them. Which them they come back and state you need to add stairs on deck and add carpet to the house. Never mentioned in first appraisal to be completed! Mined you yet this is a refinance on a rental for a complete remodel. We own the home outright. Just need a little money for a home facelift. The home appraised for more then what we are asking for in a loan. HMMMMM! So with that being said, we added the stairs and the carpet. The home is almost done on the inside (Very small stuff)  now we just need a little paint on the outside and some fence repairs and it will be ready for a renter. The entire time we have worked on this home hoping for a little money. We were hoping to have this rented out on June 1St. Nope not a chance!  The second appraisal was done and our little investment appraised for much higher then the first appraisal. Our hard work has paid off! Which we thought......So we started our loan process on 04/06/2015 in hope to have the remodel completed and rented out by 6/1/2015. Nope still no loan and not rented out. On 08/17/2015 we were told we were going to sign papers on 08/18/2015 and have our money soon. Well with that being said, on 08/18/2015 @2:30 PM we still had not heard a word from them so I sent an email with no response back and they close at 5PM. Finally at 4:30PM I got a call stating sorry your paperwork has expired and your credit score has changed NO LOAN! So here we sit no money! They nickel and dimed us with two appraisals and a lot of running around to meet a dead line. Which we did everything they asked of us. I mean everything!!! We put our home life on hold. We tried very hard not to spend any money and keep things up and running. It took them four months of a lot of bullshit stories to tell us NO!  At one point I told them that they were just waiting for us to screw up so they could us it against us! They said no we wouldn't do that to anyone!! BULLSHIT! I repeat don't go near this company they should be shut down and I'm surprised they don't have any lawsuits against them!! Maybe they do and no one can post about it?? This review is a NO STARS REVIEW!!! Stay away from IMPAC!

I called them before I saw these reviews.  They made me fill out a lot of stuff online and then called me back, the guy wasn't very nice and eventually told me I did not qualify.  They follow the same guidelines as major lenders from what I heard so the articles in which they are referenced are all false.. stay away!

Impac Mortage is impossible to work with.  They can't "find" payments sent electronically from my bank (Wells Fargo) despite conference calls with the bank people.  They put customers on hold forever and it's impossible to speak with a supervisor. If you fax information (with proof of fax) they say they can't find the fax.  Everything has to be "researched" with a 5-7 business day research period.  Please, if you have a choice, don't use Impac Mortgage.

Impac  Commercial Lending has unethical practices and have the worst customer service. They put hefty penalties for loans that are not revealed in an apparent manner. They give loans without explaining the terms which are of course in fine print. I am surprised that after the financial crisis they continue to work in such a way. Impac definitely need to be scrutinized by federal agencies on their practices and unethical ways of lending! We had a commercial loan with them with. At the time we got the loan there was a prepayment penalty. We modified the loan - they charged us the prepayment penalty when modifying the loan. On top of that they added a new prepayment penalty on the modified note. We were desperate for the modification so had to accept their terms! We sold the property and had to pay the prepayment penalty. So now we have paid penalty twice of hefty amountOn top of that, what was most ethical was when we sold the property recently and the escrow company got the payoff demand  , Impac charged us an extra month of interest. They said that we had to let them know 30 days in advance that we are closing the loan with them. That is a complete robbery! I am surprised that these practices are allowed- to charge an extra month of interest if the lender is not notified 30 days in advance that they will be closing the loan! This was over $5000.They have the worst customer service. Their senior management is the worst I have ever seen.  They are rude, lack the proper communication skills and plain out unethical. They refuse to communicate to their customers. If they do they are intimidating techniques for doing business.Mr. Ashmore who is the president of the company and who has an article in a reputable Forbes  magazine talks to you as if you a piece of garbage!. It is appalling to see a President of the company treating their customer so rudely and unethically. I am sure the way he acts is translated throughout the company.I do hope that their practices are challenged in doing commercial lending. {Please beware before doing any loans with them.

Absolute disaster, bunch of unprofessional people, don't waist your time. I have tried to refinance my existing loan in good standing with credit score of 790!!!!!they had me pay for an appraisal of my house and that's all they did ....after paying 450$ for an appraisal I  waited and  waited and waited....  For whatever unexplained reason all they could say there some issues ... Oh yeah what issues?  House appraised for 20000$ below what they thought it would and we are talking about $620000 loan for 30 years !!!!! give me a break please!!!!! I have been paying my current loan for 8 years with never being late, I have steady job , perfect credit score. there are issues .... what kind of issues?.......No one knows I suppose, besides the fact that having a property in San Francisco Bay Area you can't risk anything!!! Bottom line don't waist your time with this company they are ridiculously unprofessional and lucking knowledge on current mortgage lending:( horrible experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Incredibly Great Experience With This Mortgage Company. I'd rate it 10 stars if possible.

Last year we went through our Seattle-based mortgage broker when we re-financed our home loan. We were assigned to Impac Mortgage and completed the process. 

Last November, we received an e-mail from Leif Potter from Impac asking us if were were interested in doing a stream-line refinance which would lower our monthly payment. My wife made contact with Mr. Potter and agreed to start the process based on how professional he was on the phone.

By far this was the smoothest real estate loan we have ever done. What has impressed my wife and I more than anything was how professional Leif and his associates have been throughout the entire process. We were constantly kept up to date on time lines, document requests, and recent Federal loan changes. Unlike our previous re-finance process with our broker where we our kept us in the dark for months, and constantly received criptic e-mails regarding the delays, Impac has gone way beyond our expectations. There has not been one element of this loan transaction that has been a surprise, or has not been fully explained. We appreciated timely responses to any questions we had during the process.

My wife and I highly recommend this company if you are considering re-financing or establishing a new mortgage. More so, we highly recommend you contact Mr. Leif Potter. You will be delighted with his customer service and how well he communicates with his clients. He is well versed in the mortgage process and is someone you can trust.







This stupid company f***** up my property taxes. They've been collecting it in impounds but didn't bother to pay it . I find out today because I was doing my income taxes. I see there's a $120 late fee assessed. You think I can get those for her to pay it? I'm not holding my breath . just screwed up my tax refund too by not paying it last year. These people are f****** idiots!!!!!! Try to speak to a supervisor. They tell me no supervisor will take calls. What kind of fuked up place is this!







First, I was transferred four times, each time the representative of Impac was so rude they didn't give me a chance to explain how I needed help, if they had I wouldn't have been transferred so many times. 

After the above fun (not!), I sat on hold for 20 mins. 

I was finally connected to Sheranda who allowed me only to ask one question before she started rattling off a policy that states they cannot change the payment due date. If she had given me time to explain she would have discovered there was much more to my inquiry. 

This company is rude, unprofessional and I pray my loan is sold soon so I don't have to deal with these donkeys.







Relative to the other Alternative Lenders in the California lending market, Jason Vaccariello's team at Impac Mortgage offers the most efficient loan processing at the most competitive pricing & terms. I've brokered Alt-Doc deals to all of their competitors and from experience I can tell you that all other Alternative Lenders are administratively incompetent (bordering on negligent) whereas Jason and his Impac Mortgage team actually funds deals per their guidelines whereas others do not.  The loan process with Alternative Lenders are inherently more complicated and time-consuming than with conventional lenders as they are generally more complex, unique and complicated loan scenarios that conventional lenders have declined, such as stated income, or borrowers with damaged credit. Despite these challenges Impac still comes through and funds deals (even though it's not always easy). My brokerage has funded close to 100 deals with them so far and counting.







Zero Stars. These people are pure shit.

Got a pre-APPROVAL (not pre-qual) letter. Sold my house. Bought a plane ticket to go put an offer down where I wanted to move, then told I DON'T QUALIFY.

Unless you want a complete idiot to FUCK YOUR LIFE UP, avoid these pieces of shit.







If you are thinking of working for this company...DONT!!!!!  The company is unprofessional and lacks integrity especially as it relates to their Quality Control Department.  In specific the management of this department have egos and control issues that completely lacks an ounce of professionalism.  Seriously the VP needs to take a course in human ethics.







This company fuxxxxxcking sucks.  1 star from everyone, how is this company still in business?  They collect my taxes and they pay the county half of it.  I called them, press1, and 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 hold, 15 minutes later enter your loan number or social and wait and wait and wait, after half hour someone picks up, what is you loan number? what is your address? what is this and what is that.  You guys are taking my taxes and not paying them, you are responsible for that now us, OK, cancel my escrow I'll pay my own taxes, email us or fax us.  I emailed them and got auto email back saying we'll get back to you in 10 business days.  10 BUSINESS DAYS?  Fuk this company.







I refinanced my mortgage and the bill is due the 1st and late on the 16th. if they don't have it the 1st the phone is ringing off the DAMN hook. I never thought I would miss BofA but I do. in 22 years of owning homes, I have never ever been late and have an 819 fico score. these Aholes call and call and call with an automated call us back BS. I just blocked their #. FU impac!







I'm updating them to a 3 because they finally fixed my impound account and I haven't had any problems with them since. I still wouldn't recommend them due to the rough start.







My loan was sold to Impac Mortgage.  I am now counting down the days to refinance again (have to wait 6 months) so I can leave this company.  They charge to auto draft (from your checking account) to pay them.  I scheduled my auto draft on the 3rd (they charge from 5 days to 15 days).  They sent me a notice I was scheduled for the 5th (assuming so they could charge me?).  I had to call them once.  There is phone loop they put you through.  You keep pushing some number on the phone to get a rep.  I had to do this at least 25 times before I got a person.  I was starting to think there was no one to pick up the phone.  I would NEVER use this company.  I am waiting to refinance so I can leave this company.







Update: Is it now March and this has not been resolved. I was in touch with someone named Dargis Martinez who has been little to no help. I have since been reimbursed for the amount I overpaid in the first four months but they have yet to reconfigure my monthly mortgage payment. I have left 6 messages for Dargis and no response. If you would like to call her and try to get her to call me back her number is 757-452-5388.







DO NOT GO NEAR IMPAC MORTGAGE!*********** ZERO STARS***********They will ruin your life with the bullshit stories! They'll end up costing you more money and nothing but heart ache at the end!  They order an appraisal on our house in May of 2015  and it was completed. Only to find out that they ordered the wrong one and stated it was our fault. Not sure how that works but at any rate.... On the first appraisal it stated we needed to hang doors and add fire alarms to finish our process. Which we did. A few months go by and they decided they needed another appraisal which was going to be much more extensive and costly.  Really two appraisals? I guestioned them about the second appraisal and raised holly hell with them. Which them they come back and state you need to add stairs on deck and add carpet to the house. Never mentioned in first appraisal to be completed! Mined you yet this is a refinance on a rental for a complete remodel. We own the home outright. Just need a little money for a home facelift. The home appraised for more then what we are asking for in a loan. HMMMMM! So with that being said, we added the stairs and the carpet. The home is almost done on the inside (Very small stuff)  now we just need a little paint on the outside and some fence repairs and it will be ready for a renter. The entire time we have worked on this home hoping for a little money. We were hoping to have this rented out on June 1St. Nope not a chance!  The second appraisal was done and our little investment appraised for much higher then the first appraisal. Our hard work has paid off! Which we thought......So we started our loan process on 04/06/2015 in hope to have the remodel completed and rented out by 6/1/2015. Nope still no loan and not rented out. On 08/17/2015 we were told we were going to sign papers on 08/18/2015 and have our money soon. Well with that being said, on 08/18/2015 @2:30 PM we still had not heard a word from them so I sent an email with no response back and they close at 5PM. Finally at 4:30PM I got a call stating sorry your paperwork has expired and your credit score has changed NO LOAN! So here we sit no money! They nickel and dimed us with two appraisals and a lot of running around to meet a dead line. Which we did everything they asked of us. I mean everything!!! We put our home life on hold. We tried very hard not to spend any money and keep things up and running. It took them four months of a lot of bullshit stories to tell us NO!  At one point I told them that they were just waiting for us to screw up so they could us it against us! They said no we wouldn't do that to anyone!! BULLSHIT! I repeat don't go near this company they should be shut down and I'm surprised they don't have any lawsuits against them!! Maybe they do and no one can post about it?? This review is a NO STARS REVIEW!!! Stay away from IMPAC!







I called them before I saw these reviews.  They made me fill out a lot of stuff online and then called me back, the guy wasn't very nice and eventually told me I did not qualify.  They follow the same guidelines as major lenders from what I heard so the articles in which they are referenced are all false.. stay away!







Impac Mortage is impossible to work with.  They can't "find" payments sent electronically from my bank (Wells Fargo) despite conference calls with the bank people.  They put customers on hold forever and it's impossible to speak with a supervisor. If you fax information (with proof of fax) they say they can't find the fax.  Everything has to be "researched" with a 5-7 business day research period.  Please, if you have a choice, don't use Impac Mortgage.







Impac  Commercial Lending has unethical practices and have the worst customer service. They put hefty penalties for loans that are not revealed in an apparent manner. They give loans without explaining the terms which are of course in fine print. I am surprised that after the financial crisis they continue to work in such a way. Impac definitely need to be scrutinized by federal agencies on their practices and unethical ways of lending! 

We had a commercial loan with them with. At the time we got the loan there was a prepayment penalty. We modified the loan - they charged us the prepayment penalty when modifying the loan. On top of that they added a new prepayment penalty on the modified note. We were desperate for the modification so had to accept their terms! We sold the property and had to pay the prepayment penalty. So now we have paid penalty twice of hefty amount

On top of that, what was most ethical was when we sold the property recently and the escrow company got the payoff demand  , Impac charged us an extra month of interest. They said that we had to let them know 30 days in advance that we are closing the loan with them. That is a complete robbery! I am surprised that these practices are allowed- to charge an extra month of interest if the lender is not notified 30 days in advance that they will be closing the loan! This was over $5000.

They have the worst customer service. 
Their senior management is the worst I have ever seen.  They are rude, lack the proper communication skills and plain out unethical. They refuse to communicate to their customers. If they do they are intimidating techniques for doing business.

Mr. Ashmore who is the president of the company and who has an article in a reputable Forbes  magazine talks to you as if you a piece of garbage!. It is appalling to see a President of the company treating their customer so rudely and unethically. I am sure the way he acts is translated throughout the company.
I do hope that their practices are challenged in doing commercial lending. {Please beware before doing any loans with them.







Absolute disaster, bunch of unprofessional people, don't waist your time. I have tried to refinance my existing loan in good standing with credit score of 790!!!!!they had me pay for an appraisal of my house and that's all they did ....after paying 450$ for an appraisal I  waited and  waited and waited....  For whatever unexplained reason all they could say there some issues ... Oh yeah what issues?  House appraised for 20000$ below what they thought it would and we are talking about $620000 loan for 30 years !!!!! give me a break please!!!!! I have been paying my current loan for 8 years with never being late, I have steady job , perfect credit score. there are issues .... what kind of issues?.......No one knows I suppose, besides the fact that having a property in San Francisco Bay Area you can't risk anything!!! Bottom line don't waist your time with this company they are ridiculously unprofessional and lucking knowledge on current mortgage lending:( horrible experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

First, I was transferred four times, each time the representative of Impac was so rude they didn't give me a chance to explain how I needed help, if they had I wouldn't have been transferred so many times. After the above fun (not!), I sat on hold for 20 mins. I was finally connected to Sheranda who allowed me only to ask one question before she started rattling off a policy that states they cannot change the payment due date. If she had given me time to explain she would have discovered there was much more to my inquiry. This company is rude, unprofessional and I pray my loan is sold soon so I don't have to deal with these donkeys.

Relative to the other Alternative Lenders in the California lending market, Jason Vaccariello's team at Impac Mortgage offers the most efficient loan processing at the most competitive pricing & terms. I've brokered Alt-Doc deals to all of their competitors and from experience I can tell you that all other Alternative Lenders are administratively incompetent (bordering on negligent) whereas Jason and his Impac Mortgage team actually funds deals per their guidelines whereas others do not.  The loan process with Alternative Lenders are inherently more complicated and time-consuming than with conventional lenders as they are generally more complex, unique and complicated loan scenarios that conventional lenders have declined, such as stated income, or borrowers with damaged credit. Despite these challenges Impac still comes through and funds deals (even though it's not always easy). My brokerage has funded close to 100 deals with them so far and counting.

If you are thinking of working for this company...DONT!!!!!  The company is unprofessional and lacks integrity especially as it relates to their Quality Control Department.  In specific the management of this department have egos and control issues that completely lacks an ounce of professionalism.  Seriously the VP needs to take a course in human ethics.

This company fuxxxxxcking sucks.  1 star from everyone, how is this company still in business?  They collect my taxes and they pay the county half of it.  I called them, press1, and 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 hold, 15 minutes later enter your loan number or social and wait and wait and wait, after half hour someone picks up, what is you loan number? what is your address? what is this and what is that.  You guys are taking my taxes and not paying them, you are responsible for that now us, OK, cancel my escrow I'll pay my own taxes, email us or fax us.  I emailed them and got auto email back saying we'll get back to you in 10 business days.  10 BUSINESS DAYS?  Fuk this company.

I'm updating them to a 3 because they finally fixed my impound account and I haven't had any problems with them since. I still wouldn't recommend them due to the rough start.

So here I sit weeks later,  they lost my  check i sent certified mail start my escrow,  I helped them locate it but then they applied it to my mortgage payments rather than escrow even though I wrote escrow on the check and mailed it to the escrow dept. A week ago I notified them of their mistake which they a knowledged with a promise that this morning my escrow account would be set up. Today not only did they not set it up,  they denied it because it dd not meet the deadline,  certified mail says that they received it 2 weeks before the deadline.  Plus they charge me a late fee on the first auto payment they lost. You have been warned!

Refinancing with Impac was fairly easy and I got a great rate. The problem is they were in such a hurry to sign me up that the salesman did not set up a escrow account and when I asked about it he said they don't do that until after they receive the first mortgage payment. (This is my 5th time purchasing or refinancing and I've ALWAYS had my escrow account set up at the time of transaction). It is 4 months later and I am still trying to set up the account only rather than building it into the loan which is the norm they need a check for $5,500--Which I scraped together and sent it certified mail--the only address I was given was a P.O.  Box so that's not making me feel very secure. To top it off they have lost this months payment which my bank shows as processed 2 weeks ago. My bank faxed them the proof and gave me a copy of proof that the fax went through. I just got off the phone with Impac who told me over the  they never received the fax and had me email my statement to them. They now say that they received the email and it will take 5 working days to research it. Meanwhile they will be charging me a late fee in 4 days and if they do not clear up their mess soon I fear it will go on my credit report. We have dealt with Impac over the phone at approx. 20 times in the past few months trying to get them to fix their mistakes. More contact than I have had over the past 33 years with my other lenders combined. If you have taken the time to read all of this I'd hope you'd be wise enough to find a company that is more professional.

My loan was sold to Impac Mortgage.  I am now counting down the days to refinance again (have to wait 6 months) so I can leave this company.  They charge to auto draft (from your checking account) to pay them.  I scheduled my auto draft on the 3rd (they charge from 5 days to 15 days).  They sent me a notice I was scheduled for the 5th (assuming so they could charge me?).  I had to call them once.  There is phone loop they put you through.  You keep pushing some number on the phone to get a rep.  I had to do this at least 25 times before I got a person.  I was starting to think there was no one to pick up the phone.  I would NEVER use this company.  I am waiting to refinance so I can leave this company.

Updated review



Update: Is it now March and this has not been resolved. I was in touch with someone named Dargis Martinez who has been little to no help. I have since been reimbursed for the amount I overpaid in the first four months but they have yet to reconfigure my monthly mortgage payment. I have left 6 messages for Dargis and no response. If you would like to call her and try to get her to call me back her number is 757-452-5388.

I paid off my hazard insurance in October 2014 (their policy when you switch insurance companies in the first year) and was told my loan would need to be readjusted to reflect the lower mortgage. First I was told it would be done in November. Then it wasn't, and I was told no longer than December it would be done. When I called in January to see if it was done, of course they said it hadn't yet. They told me 15 more business days. So, I called 15 business days later. And guess what? Still not done. Someone named Caja said she put in an expedited request and assured me that either that day but no later than the following day it would be resolved. I called 2 days later and guess what? Still not done. I call back again today, wait on hold 17 minutes only to speak with someone for a moment, get placed back on hold and hung up on. I am here, sitting on hold again now with a manager who says it still hasn't been done. I am just tired of being told it will be taken care of and it isn't. And I have been overpaying for 3 months now. How easy do you think it will be for me to get the money I have over payed? I only wish they would sell my loan to someone else. Oh and I have a credit score of over 800 and always make payments on time. I never wish this kind of service on anyone else.

DO NOT GO NEAR IMPAC MORTGAGE!*********** ZERO STARS***********They will ruin your life with the bullshit stories! They'll end up costing you more money and nothing but heart ache at the end!  They order an appraisal on our house in May of 2015  and it was completed. Only to find out that they ordered the wrong one and stated it was our fault. Not sure how that works but at any rate.... On the first appraisal it stated we needed to hang doors and add fire alarms to finish our process. Which we did. A few months go by and they decided they needed another appraisal which was going to be much more extensive and costly.  Really two appraisals? I guestioned them about the second appraisal and raised holly hell with them. Which them they come back and state you need to add stairs on deck and add carpet to the house. Never mentioned in first appraisal to be completed! Mined you yet this is a refinance on a rental for a complete remodel. We own the home outright. Just need a little money for a home facelift. The home appraised for more then what we are asking for in a loan. HMMMMM! So with that being said, we added the stairs and the carpet. The home is almost done on the inside (Very small stuff)  now we just need a little paint on the outside and some fence repairs and it will be ready for a renter. The entire time we have worked on this home hoping for a little money. We were hoping to have this rented out on June 1St. Nope not a chance!  The second appraisal was done and our little investment appraised for much higher then the first appraisal. Our hard work has paid off! Which we thought......So we started our loan process on 04/06/2015 in hope to have the remodel completed and rented out by 6/1/2015. Nope still no loan and not rented out. On 08/17/2015 we were told we were going to sign papers on 08/18/2015 and have our money soon. Well with that being said, on 08/18/2015 @2:30 PM we still had not heard a word from them so I sent an email with no response back and they close at 5PM. Finally at 4:30PM I got a call stating sorry your paperwork has expired and your credit score has changed NO LOAN! So here we sit no money! They nickel and dimed us with two appraisals and a lot of running around to meet a dead line. Which we did everything they asked of us. I mean everything!!! We put our home life on hold. We tried very hard not to spend any money and keep things up and running. It took them four months of a lot of bullshit stories to tell us NO!  At one point I told them that they were just waiting for us to screw up so they could us it against us! They said no we wouldn't do that to anyone!! BULLSHIT! I repeat don't go near this company they should be shut down and I'm surprised they don't have any lawsuits against them!! Maybe they do and no one can post about it?? This review is a NO STARS REVIEW!!! Stay away from IMPAC!

Impac Mortage is impossible to work with.  They can't "find" payments sent electronically from my bank (Wells Fargo) despite conference calls with the bank people.  They put customers on hold forever and it's impossible to speak with a supervisor. If you fax information (with proof of fax) they say they can't find the fax.  Everything has to be "researched" with a 5-7 business day research period.  Please, if you have a choice, don't use Impac Mortgage.

Impac  Commercial Lending has unethical practices and have the worst customer service. They put hefty penalties for loans that are not revealed in an apparent manner. They give loans without explaining the terms which are of course in fine print. I am surprised that after the financial crisis they continue to work in such a way. Impac definitely need to be scrutinized by federal agencies on their practices and unethical ways of lending! We had a commercial loan with them with. At the time we got the loan there was a prepayment penalty. We modified the loan - they charged us the prepayment penalty when modifying the loan. On top of that they added a new prepayment penalty on the modified note. We were desperate for the modification so had to accept their terms! We sold the property and had to pay the prepayment penalty. So now we have paid penalty twice of hefty amountOn top of that, what was most ethical was when we sold the property recently and the escrow company got the payoff demand  , Impac charged us an extra month of interest. They said that we had to let them know 30 days in advance that we are closing the loan with them. That is a complete robbery! I am surprised that these practices are allowed- to charge an extra month of interest if the lender is not notified 30 days in advance that they will be closing the loan! This was over $5000.They have the worst customer service. Their senior management is the worst I have ever seen.  They are rude, lack the proper communication skills and plain out unethical. They refuse to communicate to their customers. If they do they are intimidating techniques for doing business.Mr. Ashmore who is the president of the company and who has an article in a reputable Forbes  magazine talks to you as if you a piece of garbage!. It is appalling to see a President of the company treating their customer so rudely and unethically. I am sure the way he acts is translated throughout the company.I do hope that their practices are challenged in doing commercial lending. {Please beware before doing any loans with them.

Absolute disaster, bunch of unprofessional people, don't waist your time. I have tried to refinance my existing loan in good standing with credit score of 790!!!!!they had me pay for an appraisal of my house and that's all they did ....after paying 450$ for an appraisal I  waited and  waited and waited....  For whatever unexplained reason all they could say there some issues ... Oh yeah what issues?  House appraised for 20000$ below what they thought it would and we are talking about $620000 loan for 30 years !!!!! give me a break please!!!!! I have been paying my current loan for 8 years with never being late, I have steady job , perfect credit score. there are issues .... what kind of issues?.......No one knows I suppose, besides the fact that having a property in San Francisco Bay Area you can't risk anything!!! Bottom line don't waist your time with this company they are ridiculously unprofessional and lucking knowledge on current mortgage lending:( horrible experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Incredibly Great Experience With This Mortgage Company. I'd rate it 10 stars if possible.

Last year we went through our Seattle-based mortgage broker when we re-financed our home loan. We were assigned to Impac Mortgage and completed the process. 

Last November, we received an e-mail from Leif Potter from Impac asking us if were were interested in doing a stream-line refinance which would lower our monthly payment. My wife made contact with Mr. Potter and agreed to start the process based on how professional he was on the phone.

By far this was the smoothest real estate loan we have ever done. What has impressed my wife and I more than anything was how professional Leif and his associates have been throughout the entire process. We were constantly kept up to date on time lines, document requests, and recent Federal loan changes. Unlike our previous re-finance process with our broker where we our kept us in the dark for months, and constantly received criptic e-mails regarding the delays, Impac has gone way beyond our expectations. There has not been one element of this loan transaction that has been a surprise, or has not been fully explained. We appreciated timely responses to any questions we had during the process.

My wife and I highly recommend this company if you are considering re-financing or establishing a new mortgage. More so, we highly recommend you contact Mr. Leif Potter. You will be delighted with his customer service and how well he communicates with his clients. He is well versed in the mortgage process and is someone you can trust.







This stupid company f***** up my property taxes. They've been collecting it in impounds but didn't bother to pay it . I find out today because I was doing my income taxes. I see there's a $120 late fee assessed. You think I can get those for her to pay it? I'm not holding my breath . just screwed up my tax refund too by not paying it last year. These people are f****** idiots!!!!!! Try to speak to a supervisor. They tell me no supervisor will take calls. What kind of fuked up place is this!







First, I was transferred four times, each time the representative of Impac was so rude they didn't give me a chance to explain how I needed help, if they had I wouldn't have been transferred so many times. 

After the above fun (not!), I sat on hold for 20 mins. 

I was finally connected to Sheranda who allowed me only to ask one question before she started rattling off a policy that states they cannot change the payment due date. If she had given me time to explain she would have discovered there was much more to my inquiry. 

This company is rude, unprofessional and I pray my loan is sold soon so I don't have to deal with these donkeys.







Relative to the other Alternative Lenders in the California lending market, Jason Vaccariello's team at Impac Mortgage offers the most efficient loan processing at the most competitive pricing & terms. I've brokered Alt-Doc deals to all of their competitors and from experience I can tell you that all other Alternative Lenders are administratively incompetent (bordering on negligent) whereas Jason and his Impac Mortgage team actually funds deals per their guidelines whereas others do not.  The loan process with Alternative Lenders are inherently more complicated and time-consuming than with conventional lenders as they are generally more complex, unique and complicated loan scenarios that conventional lenders have declined, such as stated income, or borrowers with damaged credit. Despite these challenges Impac still comes through and funds deals (even though it's not always easy). My brokerage has funded close to 100 deals with them so far and counting.







Zero Stars. These people are pure shit.

Got a pre-APPROVAL (not pre-qual) letter. Sold my house. Bought a plane ticket to go put an offer down where I wanted to move, then told I DON'T QUALIFY.

Unless you want a complete idiot to FUCK YOUR LIFE UP, avoid these pieces of shit.







If you are thinking of working for this company...DONT!!!!!  The company is unprofessional and lacks integrity especially as it relates to their Quality Control Department.  In specific the management of this department have egos and control issues that completely lacks an ounce of professionalism.  Seriously the VP needs to take a course in human ethics.







This company fuxxxxxcking sucks.  1 star from everyone, how is this company still in business?  They collect my taxes and they pay the county half of it.  I called them, press1, and 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 hold, 15 minutes later enter your loan number or social and wait and wait and wait, after half hour someone picks up, what is you loan number? what is your address? what is this and what is that.  You guys are taking my taxes and not paying them, you are responsible for that now us, OK, cancel my escrow I'll pay my own taxes, email us or fax us.  I emailed them and got auto email back saying we'll get back to you in 10 business days.  10 BUSINESS DAYS?  Fuk this company.







I refinanced my mortgage and the bill is due the 1st and late on the 16th. if they don't have it the 1st the phone is ringing off the DAMN hook. I never thought I would miss BofA but I do. in 22 years of owning homes, I have never ever been late and have an 819 fico score. these Aholes call and call and call with an automated call us back BS. I just blocked their #. FU impac!







I'm updating them to a 3 because they finally fixed my impound account and I haven't had any problems with them since. I still wouldn't recommend them due to the rough start.







My loan was sold to Impac Mortgage.  I am now counting down the days to refinance again (have to wait 6 months) so I can leave this company.  They charge to auto draft (from your checking account) to pay them.  I scheduled my auto draft on the 3rd (they charge from 5 days to 15 days).  They sent me a notice I was scheduled for the 5th (assuming so they could charge me?).  I had to call them once.  There is phone loop they put you through.  You keep pushing some number on the phone to get a rep.  I had to do this at least 25 times before I got a person.  I was starting to think there was no one to pick up the phone.  I would NEVER use this company.  I am waiting to refinance so I can leave this company.







Update: Is it now March and this has not been resolved. I was in touch with someone named Dargis Martinez who has been little to no help. I have since been reimbursed for the amount I overpaid in the first four months but they have yet to reconfigure my monthly mortgage payment. I have left 6 messages for Dargis and no response. If you would like to call her and try to get her to call me back her number is 757-452-5388.







DO NOT GO NEAR IMPAC MORTGAGE!*********** ZERO STARS***********They will ruin your life with the bullshit stories! They'll end up costing you more money and nothing but heart ache at the end!  They order an appraisal on our house in May of 2015  and it was completed. Only to find out that they ordered the wrong one and stated it was our fault. Not sure how that works but at any rate.... On the first appraisal it stated we needed to hang doors and add fire alarms to finish our process. Which we did. A few months go by and they decided they needed another appraisal which was going to be much more extensive and costly.  Really two appraisals? I guestioned them about the second appraisal and raised holly hell with them. Which them they come back and state you need to add stairs on deck and add carpet to the house. Never mentioned in first appraisal to be completed! Mined you yet this is a refinance on a rental for a complete remodel. We own the home outright. Just need a little money for a home facelift. The home appraised for more then what we are asking for in a loan. HMMMMM! So with that being said, we added the stairs and the carpet. The home is almost done on the inside (Very small stuff)  now we just need a little paint on the outside and some fence repairs and it will be ready for a renter. The entire time we have worked on this home hoping for a little money. We were hoping to have this rented out on June 1St. Nope not a chance!  The second appraisal was done and our little investment appraised for much higher then the first appraisal. Our hard work has paid off! Which we thought......So we started our loan process on 04/06/2015 in hope to have the remodel completed and rented out by 6/1/2015. Nope still no loan and not rented out. On 08/17/2015 we were told we were going to sign papers on 08/18/2015 and have our money soon. Well with that being said, on 08/18/2015 @2:30 PM we still had not heard a word from them so I sent an email with no response back and they close at 5PM. Finally at 4:30PM I got a call stating sorry your paperwork has expired and your credit score has changed NO LOAN! So here we sit no money! They nickel and dimed us with two appraisals and a lot of running around to meet a dead line. Which we did everything they asked of us. I mean everything!!! We put our home life on hold. We tried very hard not to spend any money and keep things up and running. It took them four months of a lot of bullshit stories to tell us NO!  At one point I told them that they were just waiting for us to screw up so they could us it against us! They said no we wouldn't do that to anyone!! BULLSHIT! I repeat don't go near this company they should be shut down and I'm surprised they don't have any lawsuits against them!! Maybe they do and no one can post about it?? This review is a NO STARS REVIEW!!! Stay away from IMPAC!







I called them before I saw these reviews.  They made me fill out a lot of stuff online and then called me back, the guy wasn't very nice and eventually told me I did not qualify.  They follow the same guidelines as major lenders from what I heard so the articles in which they are referenced are all false.. stay away!







Impac Mortage is impossible to work with.  They can't "find" payments sent electronically from my bank (Wells Fargo) despite conference calls with the bank people.  They put customers on hold forever and it's impossible to speak with a supervisor. If you fax information (with proof of fax) they say they can't find the fax.  Everything has to be "researched" with a 5-7 business day research period.  Please, if you have a choice, don't use Impac Mortgage.







Impac  Commercial Lending has unethical practices and have the worst customer service. They put hefty penalties for loans that are not revealed in an apparent manner. They give loans without explaining the terms which are of course in fine print. I am surprised that after the financial crisis they continue to work in such a way. Impac definitely need to be scrutinized by federal agencies on their practices and unethical ways of lending! 

We had a commercial loan with them with. At the time we got the loan there was a prepayment penalty. We modified the loan - they charged us the prepayment penalty when modifying the loan. On top of that they added a new prepayment penalty on the modified note. We were desperate for the modification so had to accept their terms! We sold the property and had to pay the prepayment penalty. So now we have paid penalty twice of hefty amount

On top of that, what was most ethical was when we sold the property recently and the escrow company got the payoff demand  , Impac charged us an extra month of interest. They said that we had to let them know 30 days in advance that we are closing the loan with them. That is a complete robbery! I am surprised that these practices are allowed- to charge an extra month of interest if the lender is not notified 30 days in advance that they will be closing the loan! This was over $5000.

They have the worst customer service. 
Their senior management is the worst I have ever seen.  They are rude, lack the proper communication skills and plain out unethical. They refuse to communicate to their customers. If they do they are intimidating techniques for doing business.

Mr. Ashmore who is the president of the company and who has an article in a reputable Forbes  magazine talks to you as if you a piece of garbage!. It is appalling to see a President of the company treating their customer so rudely and unethically. I am sure the way he acts is translated throughout the company.
I do hope that their practices are challenged in doing commercial lending. {Please beware before doing any loans with them.







Absolute disaster, bunch of unprofessional people, don't waist your time. I have tried to refinance my existing loan in good standing with credit score of 790!!!!!they had me pay for an appraisal of my house and that's all they did ....after paying 450$ for an appraisal I  waited and  waited and waited....  For whatever unexplained reason all they could say there some issues ... Oh yeah what issues?  House appraised for 20000$ below what they thought it would and we are talking about $620000 loan for 30 years !!!!! give me a break please!!!!! I have been paying my current loan for 8 years with never being late, I have steady job , perfect credit score. there are issues .... what kind of issues?.......No one knows I suppose, besides the fact that having a property in San Francisco Bay Area you can't risk anything!!! Bottom line don't waist your time with this company they are ridiculously unprofessional and lucking knowledge on current mortgage lending:( horrible experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Incredibly Great Experience With This Mortgage Company. I'd rate it 10 stars if possible.Last year we went through our Seattle-based mortgage broker when we re-financed our home loan. We were assigned to Impac Mortgage and completed the process. Last November, we received an e-mail from Leif Potter from Impac asking us if were were interested in doing a stream-line refinance which would lower our monthly payment. My wife made contact with Mr. Potter and agreed to start the process based on how professional he was on the phone.By far this was the smoothest real estate loan we have ever done. What has impressed my wife and I more than anything was how professional Leif and his associates have been throughout the entire process. We were constantly kept up to date on time lines, document requests, and recent Federal loan changes. Unlike our previous re-finance process with our broker where we our kept us in the dark for months, and constantly received criptic e-mails regarding the delays, Impac has gone way beyond our expectations. There has not been one element of this loan transaction that has been a surprise, or has not been fully explained. We appreciated timely responses to any questions we had during the process.My wife and I highly recommend this company if you are considering re-financing or establishing a new mortgage. More so, we highly recommend you contact Mr. Leif Potter. You will be delighted with his customer service and how well he communicates with his clients. He is well versed in the mortgage process and is someone you can trust.

This stupid company f***** up my property taxes. They've been collecting it in impounds but didn't bother to pay it . I find out today because I was doing my income taxes. I see there's a $120 late fee assessed. You think I can get those for her to pay it? I'm not holding my breath . just screwed up my tax refund too by not paying it last year. These people are f****** idiots!!!!!! Try to speak to a supervisor. They tell me no supervisor will take calls. What kind of fuked up place is this!

First, I was transferred four times, each time the representative of Impac was so rude they didn't give me a chance to explain how I needed help, if they had I wouldn't have been transferred so many times. After the above fun (not!), I sat on hold for 20 mins. I was finally connected to Sheranda who allowed me only to ask one question before she started rattling off a policy that states they cannot change the payment due date. If she had given me time to explain she would have discovered there was much more to my inquiry. This company is rude, unprofessional and I pray my loan is sold soon so I don't have to deal with these donkeys.

Relative to the other Alternative Lenders in the California lending market, Jason Vaccariello's team at Impac Mortgage offers the most efficient loan processing at the most competitive pricing & terms. I've brokered Alt-Doc deals to all of their competitors and from experience I can tell you that all other Alternative Lenders are administratively incompetent (bordering on negligent) whereas Jason and his Impac Mortgage team actually funds deals per their guidelines whereas others do not.  The loan process with Alternative Lenders are inherently more complicated and time-consuming than with conventional lenders as they are generally more complex, unique and complicated loan scenarios that conventional lenders have declined, such as stated income, or borrowers with damaged credit. Despite these challenges Impac still comes through and funds deals (even though it's not always easy). My brokerage has funded close to 100 deals with them so far and counting.

If you are thinking of working for this company...DONT!!!!!  The company is unprofessional and lacks integrity especially as it relates to their Quality Control Department.  In specific the management of this department have egos and control issues that completely lacks an ounce of professionalism.  Seriously the VP needs to take a course in human ethics.

This company fuxxxxxcking sucks.  1 star from everyone, how is this company still in business?  They collect my taxes and they pay the county half of it.  I called them, press1, and 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 hold, 15 minutes later enter your loan number or social and wait and wait and wait, after half hour someone picks up, what is you loan number? what is your address? what is this and what is that.  You guys are taking my taxes and not paying them, you are responsible for that now us, OK, cancel my escrow I'll pay my own taxes, email us or fax us.  I emailed them and got auto email back saying we'll get back to you in 10 business days.  10 BUSINESS DAYS?  Fuk this company.

I'm updating them to a 3 because they finally fixed my impound account and I haven't had any problems with them since. I still wouldn't recommend them due to the rough start.

So here I sit weeks later,  they lost my  check i sent certified mail start my escrow,  I helped them locate it but then they applied it to my mortgage payments rather than escrow even though I wrote escrow on the check and mailed it to the escrow dept. A week ago I notified them of their mistake which they a knowledged with a promise that this morning my escrow account would be set up. Today not only did they not set it up,  they denied it because it dd not meet the deadline,  certified mail says that they received it 2 weeks before the deadline.  Plus they charge me a late fee on the first auto payment they lost. You have been warned!

Refinancing with Impac was fairly easy and I got a great rate. The problem is they were in such a hurry to sign me up that the salesman did not set up a escrow account and when I asked about it he said they don't do that until after they receive the first mortgage payment. (This is my 5th time purchasing or refinancing and I've ALWAYS had my escrow account set up at the time of transaction). It is 4 months later and I am still trying to set up the account only rather than building it into the loan which is the norm they need a check for $5,500--Which I scraped together and sent it certified mail--the only address I was given was a P.O.  Box so that's not making me feel very secure. To top it off they have lost this months payment which my bank shows as processed 2 weeks ago. My bank faxed them the proof and gave me a copy of proof that the fax went through. I just got off the phone with Impac who told me over the  they never received the fax and had me email my statement to them. They now say that they received the email and it will take 5 working days to research it. Meanwhile they will be charging me a late fee in 4 days and if they do not clear up their mess soon I fear it will go on my credit report. We have dealt with Impac over the phone at approx. 20 times in the past few months trying to get them to fix their mistakes. More contact than I have had over the past 33 years with my other lenders combined. If you have taken the time to read all of this I'd hope you'd be wise enough to find a company that is more professional.

My loan was sold to Impac Mortgage.  I am now counting down the days to refinance again (have to wait 6 months) so I can leave this company.  They charge to auto draft (from your checking account) to pay them.  I scheduled my auto draft on the 3rd (they charge from 5 days to 15 days).  They sent me a notice I was scheduled for the 5th (assuming so they could charge me?).  I had to call them once.  There is phone loop they put you through.  You keep pushing some number on the phone to get a rep.  I had to do this at least 25 times before I got a person.  I was starting to think there was no one to pick up the phone.  I would NEVER use this company.  I am waiting to refinance so I can leave this company.

Updated review



Update: Is it now March and this has not been resolved. I was in touch with someone named Dargis Martinez who has been little to no help. I have since been reimbursed for the amount I overpaid in the first four months but they have yet to reconfigure my monthly mortgage payment. I have left 6 messages for Dargis and no response. If you would like to call her and try to get her to call me back her number is 757-452-5388.

I paid off my hazard insurance in October 2014 (their policy when you switch insurance companies in the first year) and was told my loan would need to be readjusted to reflect the lower mortgage. First I was told it would be done in November. Then it wasn't, and I was told no longer than December it would be done. When I called in January to see if it was done, of course they said it hadn't yet. They told me 15 more business days. So, I called 15 business days later. And guess what? Still not done. Someone named Caja said she put in an expedited request and assured me that either that day but no later than the following day it would be resolved. I called 2 days later and guess what? Still not done. I call back again today, wait on hold 17 minutes only to speak with someone for a moment, get placed back on hold and hung up on. I am here, sitting on hold again now with a manager who says it still hasn't been done. I am just tired of being told it will be taken care of and it isn't. And I have been overpaying for 3 months now. How easy do you think it will be for me to get the money I have over payed? I only wish they would sell my loan to someone else. Oh and I have a credit score of over 800 and always make payments on time. I never wish this kind of service on anyone else.

DO NOT GO NEAR IMPAC MORTGAGE!*********** ZERO STARS***********They will ruin your life with the bullshit stories! They'll end up costing you more money and nothing but heart ache at the end!  They order an appraisal on our house in May of 2015  and it was completed. Only to find out that they ordered the wrong one and stated it was our fault. Not sure how that works but at any rate.... On the first appraisal it stated we needed to hang doors and add fire alarms to finish our process. Which we did. A few months go by and they decided they needed another appraisal which was going to be much more extensive and costly.  Really two appraisals? I guestioned them about the second appraisal and raised holly hell with them. Which them they come back and state you need to add stairs on deck and add carpet to the house. Never mentioned in first appraisal to be completed! Mined you yet this is a refinance on a rental for a complete remodel. We own the home outright. Just need a little money for a home facelift. The home appraised for more then what we are asking for in a loan. HMMMMM! So with that being said, we added the stairs and the carpet. The home is almost done on the inside (Very small stuff)  now we just need a little paint on the outside and some fence repairs and it will be ready for a renter. The entire time we have worked on this home hoping for a little money. We were hoping to have this rented out on June 1St. Nope not a chance!  The second appraisal was done and our little investment appraised for much higher then the first appraisal. Our hard work has paid off! Which we thought......So we started our loan process on 04/06/2015 in hope to have the remodel completed and rented out by 6/1/2015. Nope still no loan and not rented out. On 08/17/2015 we were told we were going to sign papers on 08/18/2015 and have our money soon. Well with that being said, on 08/18/2015 @2:30 PM we still had not heard a word from them so I sent an email with no response back and they close at 5PM. Finally at 4:30PM I got a call stating sorry your paperwork has expired and your credit score has changed NO LOAN! So here we sit no money! They nickel and dimed us with two appraisals and a lot of running around to meet a dead line. Which we did everything they asked of us. I mean everything!!! We put our home life on hold. We tried very hard not to spend any money and keep things up and running. It took them four months of a lot of bullshit stories to tell us NO!  At one point I told them that they were just waiting for us to screw up so they could us it against us! They said no we wouldn't do that to anyone!! BULLSHIT! I repeat don't go near this company they should be shut down and I'm surprised they don't have any lawsuits against them!! Maybe they do and no one can post about it?? This review is a NO STARS REVIEW!!! Stay away from IMPAC!

I called them before I saw these reviews.  They made me fill out a lot of stuff online and then called me back, the guy wasn't very nice and eventually told me I did not qualify.  They follow the same guidelines as major lenders from what I heard so the articles in which they are referenced are all false.. stay away!

Impac Mortage is impossible to work with.  They can't "find" payments sent electronically from my bank (Wells Fargo) despite conference calls with the bank people.  They put customers on hold forever and it's impossible to speak with a supervisor. If you fax information (with proof of fax) they say they can't find the fax.  Everything has to be "researched" with a 5-7 business day research period.  Please, if you have a choice, don't use Impac Mortgage.

Impac  Commercial Lending has unethical practices and have the worst customer service. They put hefty penalties for loans that are not revealed in an apparent manner. They give loans without explaining the terms which are of course in fine print. I am surprised that after the financial crisis they continue to work in such a way. Impac definitely need to be scrutinized by federal agencies on their practices and unethical ways of lending! We had a commercial loan with them with. At the time we got the loan there was a prepayment penalty. We modified the loan - they charged us the prepayment penalty when modifying the loan. On top of that they added a new prepayment penalty on the modified note. We were desperate for the modification so had to accept their terms! We sold the property and had to pay the prepayment penalty. So now we have paid penalty twice of hefty amountOn top of that, what was most ethical was when we sold the property recently and the escrow company got the payoff demand  , Impac charged us an extra month of interest. They said that we had to let them know 30 days in advance that we are closing the loan with them. That is a complete robbery! I am surprised that these practices are allowed- to charge an extra month of interest if the lender is not notified 30 days in advance that they will be closing the loan! This was over $5000.They have the worst customer service. Their senior management is the worst I have ever seen.  They are rude, lack the proper communication skills and plain out unethical. They refuse to communicate to their customers. If they do they are intimidating techniques for doing business.Mr. Ashmore who is the president of the company and who has an article in a reputable Forbes  magazine talks to you as if you a piece of garbage!. It is appalling to see a President of the company treating their customer so rudely and unethically. I am sure the way he acts is translated throughout the company.I do hope that their practices are challenged in doing commercial lending. {Please beware before doing any loans with them.

Absolute disaster, bunch of unprofessional people, don't waist your time. I have tried to refinance my existing loan in good standing with credit score of 790!!!!!they had me pay for an appraisal of my house and that's all they did ....after paying 450$ for an appraisal I  waited and  waited and waited....  For whatever unexplained reason all they could say there some issues ... Oh yeah what issues?  House appraised for 20000$ below what they thought it would and we are talking about $620000 loan for 30 years !!!!! give me a break please!!!!! I have been paying my current loan for 8 years with never being late, I have steady job , perfect credit score. there are issues .... what kind of issues?.......No one knows I suppose, besides the fact that having a property in San Francisco Bay Area you can't risk anything!!! Bottom line don't waist your time with this company they are ridiculously unprofessional and lucking knowledge on current mortgage lending:( horrible experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
