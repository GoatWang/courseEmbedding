*The $30 Household Annual Fee or the IRA Custodial Fee (for IRA only households) can be waived with one of the following for all WellsTrade accounts in your household as of June 30 each year: 1) electronic delivery only enrollment for statements, trade confirmations, other documents and shareholder communications (excluding tax documents/1099s), 2) linkage to the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program 3) household balances of $250,000 or more, 4) households with solely SEP IRA, or 5) Wells Fargo Private Bank account.

Households with an IRA and any other account type that is not exempt from annual fee will be subject to the $30 Household Annual Fee. IRA Custodial Fee will be waived for households paying a household annual fee. If an IRA Custodial Fee is due, clients will receive a remittance notice in August 2017 with several payment options. If a payment option is not selected, the fee will be automatically deducted from the IRA in September 2017. If there is more than one non-exempt IRA in the household, the fee will be equally divided amongst the non-exempt IRAs.
The grouping of accounts into a household is based on account eligibility and family relationship such as children, parents, domestic partners, and others. Certain accounts cannot be included in a household. Please call us at 1-800-TRADERS for more information and to determine whether all eligible accounts have been included in your household.

What Is a Reserve Study?
Receive a free reserve study proposal today.
A reserve study is an in-depth evaluation of a property's physical components and an analysis of its reserve funds. Based on a thorough on-site inspection, a  custom reserve study details anticipated replacements or repairs to common-area  elements and recommends annual reserve funding to cover capital expenditures  for the next 30 years.
Our custom reserve studies give community association managers, board members and  property owners assurance that future major property expenses are identified  early and that a funding plan is in place to pay for those expenses.
A well-prepared reserve study can avert special assessments and supports  a harmonious community.
Our reserve studies now come with ForeSite – a new software solution that lets you take your reserve study to the next level.
Guidance  You Can Trust
The  most accurate reserve studies are conducted by an engineer who knows building  construction. In addition to a degree, top-tier reserve-study professionals  typically hold an industry accreditation based on experience and advanced  education. Look for such accreditations as Reserve Specialist (RS),  earned through the Community Associations Institute, or Professional Reserve  Analyst (PRA), awarded by the Association of Professional Reserve Analysts.
When  you work with Reserve Advisors, you can be confident a degreed engineer will  conduct your on-site inspection and develop your custom reserve study. All our  advisors have also earned their RS or PRA designation or are working toward  it.
Additionally,  your study will be reviewed by other senior engineers as part of our quality  review process. We insist on this extra step to ensure accuracy for you,  something many other providers don't or can't do.

Reserve Study Definitions
A reserve study contains a number of industry-related terms and  phrases. To help you better understand  the reserve study process and reports, we've provided definitions for the most  commonly used terms. 
Cash Flow Method - A  method of developing a reserve funding plan where contributions to the reserve  fund are designed to offset the variable annual expenditures from the reserve  fund. Different reserve funding plans  are tested against the anticipated schedule of reserve expenses until the  desired funding goal is achieved.
Component -  The individual line items in the reserve study developed or updated in the physical  analysis. These elements form the building blocks for the reserve study. Components typically are: 1) association responsibility 2) with limited useful life expectancies 3) predictable remaining useful life  expectancies 4) above a minimum  threshold cost 5) as required by local  codes.
Component Assessment and Valuation - The task of estimating useful life, remaining useful life,  and repair or replacement costs for the reserve components. This task is accomplished either with or  without on-site visual observations, based on the level of service selected by  the client.
Component Inventory -  The task of selecting and quantifying reserve components. This task can be  accomplished through on-site visual observations, review of association design  and organizational documents, review of established association precedents and  discussion with appropriate association representative(s) of the association or  cooperative.
Component Method - A  method of developing a reserve funding plan where the total contribution is  based on the sum of contributions for individual components. See "cash flow method. "
Condition Assessment -  The task of evaluating the current condition of the component based on observed  or reported characteristics.
Current Replacement Cost -  See "replacement cost. "
Deficit - An actual (or  projected) reserve balance less than the fully funded balance. The opposite  would be a surplus.
Effective Age -  The difference between useful life and remaining useful life. Not always  equivalent to chronological age, since some components age irregularly. Used  primarily in computations.
Field Inspection - A  site visit which includes a visual inspection of all components. In cases where plans of the property are  unavailable, it would also include the quantity survey.
Financial Analysis -  The portion of a reserve study where current status of the reserves (measured  as cash or percent funded) and a recommended reserve contribution rate (reserve  funding plan) are derived and the projected reserve income and expense over  time is presented. The financial analysis is one of the two parts of a reserve study.
Fully Funded - 100%  funded. When the actual (or projected) reserve  balance is equal to the fully funded balance.
Fully Funded Balance (FBB) - Total accrued depreciation. An indicator against which actual  (or projected) reserve balance can be compared. The reserve balance that is in  direct proportion to the fraction of life "used up" of the current repair or replacement  cost. This number is calculated for each component and summed together for an  association total. Two formulae can be utilized, depending on the provider's  sensitivity to interest and inflation effects. Note: both yield identical results when interest  and inflation are equivalent. 
						FFB  = Current Cost X Effective Age / Useful Life 
						or 
						FFB  = (Current Cost X Effective Age / Useful Life) + [(Current Cost X Effective Age  /Useful Life) / (1 + Interest Rate) ^ Remaining Life] - [(Current Cost X  Effective Age /Useful Life) / (1 + Inflation Rate) ^ Remaining Life]
Fund Status -  The status of the reserve fund as compared to an established benchmark such as  percent funding. 
Funding Goals -  Independent of methodology utilized, the following represent the basic  categories of funding plan goals:
Baseline Funding - Establishing a reserve funding goal of keeping the reserve  cash balance above zero.
Full Funding - Setting a reserve funding goal of attaining and  maintaining reserves at or near 100% funded.
Statutory Funding - Establishing a reserve funding goal of setting aside the  specific minimum amount of reserves required by local statues.
Threshold Funding - Establishing a reserve funding goal of keeping the reserve  balance above a specified dollar or percent funded amount. Depending on the  threshold, this may be more or less conservative than "fully funding. "
Funding Plan - An  association's plan to provide income to a reserve fund to offset anticipated  expenditures from that fund.
Funding Principles:

Sufficient Funds When Required
Stable Contribution Rate over the Years
Evenly Distributed Contributions over the Years
Fiscally Responsible

Life and Valuation Estimates - The task of estimating useful life, remaining useful life,  and repair or replacement costs for the reserve components.
Percent Funded -  The ratio, at a particular point of time (typically the beginning of the fiscal  year), of the actual (or projected) reserve balance to the fully funded balance,  expressed as a percentage. 
Physical Analysis -  The portion of the reserve study where the component inventory, condition assessment,  and life and valuation estimate tasks are performed. This represents one of the  two parts of the reserve study.
Remaining Useful Life (RUL) - Also referred to as "remaining life" (RL). The estimated  time, in years, that a reserve component can be expected to continue to serve  its intended function. Projects anticipated to occur in the initial year have  "zero" remaining useful life.
Replacement Cost -  The cost of replacing, repairing, or restoring a reserve component to its  original functional condition. The current replacement cost would be the cost  to replace, repair, or restore the component during that particular year.
Reserve Balance -  Actual or projected funds as of a particular point in time that the association  has identified for use to defray the future repair or replacement of those  major components which the association is obligated to maintain. Also known as reserves,  reserve accounts, cash reserves. Based upon information provided and not  audited.
Reserve Study Provider - An  individual that prepares reserve studies
Reserve Study - A  budget planning tool which identifies the current status of the reserve fund  and a stable and equitable funding plan to offset the anticipated future major  common area expenditures. The reserve study consists of two parts: the physical  analysis and the financial analysis. 
Responsible Charge - A  reserve specialist in responsible charge of a reserve study shall render  regular and effective supervision to those individuals performing services  which directly and materially affect the quality and competence rendered by the  reserve specialist. A reserve specialist shall maintain such records as are  reasonably necessary to establish that the reserve specialist exercised regular  and effective supervision of a reserve study of which he was in responsible  charge. A reserve specialist engaged in any of the following acts or practices  shall be deemed not to have rendered the regular and effective supervision  required herein:

The regular and continuous  absence from principal office premises from which professional services are  rendered; expect for performance of field work or presence in a field office  maintained exclusively for a specific project;
The failure to personally  inspect or review the work of subordinates where necessary and appropriate;
The rendering of a limited,  cursory or perfunctory review of plans or projects in lieu of an appropriate  detailed review;
The failure to personally be  available on a reasonable basis or with adequate advance notice for  consultation and inspection where circumstances require personal availability.

Special Assessment - An  assessment levied on the members of an association in addition to regular  assessments. Special assessments are often regulated by governing documents or  local statutes.
Surplus - An actual (or  projected) reserve balance greater than the fully funded balance. See "deficit. "
Useful Life (UL) - Total useful life or depreciable life. The  estimated time, in years, that a reserve component can be expected to serve its  intended function if properly constructed in its present application or installation.

What is a Defect?
Defects are conditions which reduce the value (cause economic harm or loss to the owner) of a home, condominium, or common area.   IRMA (International Risk Management Institute) provides a general definition of construction defect. Each insurance underwriter and State, however, may have its own definition.  A Reserve Advisors Defect Survey identifies several types of defects which include construction defects.

Reserve Advisors Celebrates 25th Anniversary with Feeding America Initiative
Milwaukee Office Conducts 4 Volunteer Days
Milwaukee (November 28, 2016) – To celebrate its 25th anniversary, Reserve Advisors, Inc. is implementing a year-long giveback program for Feeding America. From August 2016 to July 2017, employees from Reserve Advisors will donate their time to Feeding America food banks in Milwaukee, Tampa, Minneapolis and Washington, D.C. Altogether, the company plans to conduct 16 Feeding America volunteer days, providing nearly 1,000 hours of employee manpower to the non-profit organization.
"We felt our company anniversary presented a special opportunity to help others out," says co-founder John Poehlmann. "You don't often think about hunger in the United States but it's a real problem. Ted and I, along with our employees, will roll up our sleeves to support Feeding America throughout the year."
The Feeding America campaign kicked off in August when a group of employees from Reserve Advisors' Minneapolis office spent the afternoon at the Second Harvest Heartland food bank, a member organization of Feeding America, sorting food and packing and stacking boxes to help provide 9,500 meals.
Milwaukee Support
					On November 3, employees from Reserve Advisors' headquarters in Milwaukee, along with company co-founders John Poehlmann and Ted Salgado, conducted a volunteer day at Feeding America Eastern Wisconsin. As part of the food bank's preparations to provide Thanksgiving meals to thousands of area residents, the Reserve Advisors group pitched in to move 18,200 pounds of turkey and 3,500 pounds of potatoes. The Milwaukee office is scheduled to return to Feeding America on December 8, 2016 and two more times in 2017.
Feeding America serves all 50 states through a network of 200 member food banks and 60,000 food pantries and meal programs. Every year, the organization relies on more than 2 million volunteers to feed 48 million Americans — including 15 million children and more than 5 million older adults — who struggle with hunger. 
Reserve Advisors was founded in 1991 by John Poehlmann and Ted Salgado in Milwaukee, Wis. The company quickly distinguished itself by delivering professional reserve studies prepared by engineers. With a continual focus on integrity, customer service, professionalism, accountability and technical quality, Reserve Advisors grew from a single office to the eight regional locations it has today.
 

 
Reserve Advisors Expands in Arlington, Virginia
(May 6, 2015) We are excited to announce that we have expanded our current office space to better fulfill our clients' needs.   Our local staff of engineers have served hundreds of community associations from the Chesapeake Region, down to Virginia Beach and throughout the Washington Metropolitan area.
For more information, contact our Regional Director of Client Services, Michelle Baldry at (844) 701-9884 or mbaldry@reserveadvisors.com

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% threeyear rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.CM Advisors Fixed Income Fund was rated against the following numbers of U.S.-domiciled Small-Term funds over the following time periods: 445 funds in the last three years, 357 funds in the last five years, and 252 funds in the last ten years.  With respect to these Short-Term bond funds, CM Advisors Fixed Income Fund received a Morningstar Rating of five stars, four stars, and five stars for the three-, five- and ten-year periods, respectively. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

*The $30 Household Annual Fee or the IRA Custodial Fee (for IRA only households) can be waived with one of the following for all WellsTrade accounts in your household as of June 30 each year: 1) electronic delivery only enrollment for statements, trade confirmations, other documents and shareholder communications (excluding tax documents/1099s), 2) linkage to the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program 3) household balances of $250,000 or more, 4) households with solely SEP IRA, or 5) Wells Fargo Private Bank account.

Households comprised only of IRA accounts will be subject to a $30 IRA Custodial Fee. Households with an IRA and any other account type that is not exempt from annual fee will be subject to the $30 Household Annual Fee. IRA Custodial Fee will be waived for households paying a household annual fee. If an IRA Custodial Fee is due, clients will receive a remittance notice in August 2017 with several payment options. If a payment option is not selected, the fee will be automatically deducted from the IRA in September 2017. If there is more than one non-exempt IRA in the household, the fee will be equally divided amongst the non-exempt IRAs.
The grouping of accounts into a household is based on account eligibility and family relationship such as children, parents, domestic partners, and others. Certain accounts cannot be included in a household. Please call us at 1-800-TRADERS for more information and to determine whether all eligible accounts have been included in your household.

What Is a Reserve Study?
Receive a free reserve study proposal today.
A reserve study is an in-depth evaluation of a property's physical components and an analysis of its reserve funds. Based on a thorough on-site inspection, a  custom reserve study details anticipated replacements or repairs to common-area  elements and recommends annual reserve funding to cover capital expenditures  for the next 30 years.
Our custom reserve studies give community association managers, board members and  property owners assurance that future major property expenses are identified  early and that a funding plan is in place to pay for those expenses.
A well-prepared reserve study can avert special assessments and supports  a harmonious community.
Our reserve studies now come with ForeSite – a new software solution that lets you take your reserve study to the next level.
Guidance  You Can Trust
The  most accurate reserve studies are conducted by an engineer who knows building  construction. In addition to a degree, top-tier reserve-study professionals  typically hold an industry accreditation based on experience and advanced  education. Look for such accreditations as Reserve Specialist (RS),  earned through the Community Associations Institute, or Professional Reserve  Analyst (PRA), awarded by the Association of Professional Reserve Analysts.
When  you work with Reserve Advisors, you can be confident a degreed engineer will  conduct your on-site inspection and develop your custom reserve study. All our  advisors have also earned their RS or PRA designation or are working toward  it.
Additionally,  your study will be reviewed by other senior engineers as part of our quality  review process. We insist on this extra step to ensure accuracy for you,  something many other providers don't or can't do.

Reserve Study Definitions
A reserve study contains a number of industry-related terms and  phrases. To help you better understand  the reserve study process and reports, we've provided definitions for the most  commonly used terms. 
Cash Flow Method - A  method of developing a reserve funding plan where contributions to the reserve  fund are designed to offset the variable annual expenditures from the reserve  fund. Different reserve funding plans  are tested against the anticipated schedule of reserve expenses until the  desired funding goal is achieved.
Component -  The individual line items in the reserve study developed or updated in the physical  analysis. These elements form the building blocks for the reserve study. Components typically are: 1) association responsibility 2) with limited useful life expectancies 3) predictable remaining useful life  expectancies 4) above a minimum  threshold cost 5) as required by local  codes.
Component Assessment and Valuation - The task of estimating useful life, remaining useful life,  and repair or replacement costs for the reserve components. This task is accomplished either with or  without on-site visual observations, based on the level of service selected by  the client.
Component Inventory -  The task of selecting and quantifying reserve components. This task can be  accomplished through on-site visual observations, review of association design  and organizational documents, review of established association precedents and  discussion with appropriate association representative(s) of the association or  cooperative.
Component Method - A  method of developing a reserve funding plan where the total contribution is  based on the sum of contributions for individual components. See "cash flow method. "
Condition Assessment -  The task of evaluating the current condition of the component based on observed  or reported characteristics.
Current Replacement Cost -  See "replacement cost. "
Deficit - An actual (or  projected) reserve balance less than the fully funded balance. The opposite  would be a surplus.
Effective Age -  The difference between useful life and remaining useful life. Not always  equivalent to chronological age, since some components age irregularly. Used  primarily in computations.
Field Inspection - A  site visit which includes a visual inspection of all components. In cases where plans of the property are  unavailable, it would also include the quantity survey.
Financial Analysis -  The portion of a reserve study where current status of the reserves (measured  as cash or percent funded) and a recommended reserve contribution rate (reserve  funding plan) are derived and the projected reserve income and expense over  time is presented. The financial analysis is one of the two parts of a reserve study.
Fully Funded - 100%  funded. When the actual (or projected) reserve  balance is equal to the fully funded balance.
Fully Funded Balance (FBB) - Total accrued depreciation. An indicator against which actual  (or projected) reserve balance can be compared. The reserve balance that is in  direct proportion to the fraction of life "used up" of the current repair or replacement  cost. This number is calculated for each component and summed together for an  association total. Two formulae can be utilized, depending on the provider's  sensitivity to interest and inflation effects. Note: both yield identical results when interest  and inflation are equivalent. 
						FFB  = Current Cost X Effective Age / Useful Life 
						or 
						FFB  = (Current Cost X Effective Age / Useful Life) + [(Current Cost X Effective Age  /Useful Life) / (1 + Interest Rate) ^ Remaining Life] - [(Current Cost X  Effective Age /Useful Life) / (1 + Inflation Rate) ^ Remaining Life]
Fund Status -  The status of the reserve fund as compared to an established benchmark such as  percent funding. 
Funding Goals -  Independent of methodology utilized, the following represent the basic  categories of funding plan goals:
Baseline Funding - Establishing a reserve funding goal of keeping the reserve  cash balance above zero.
Full Funding - Setting a reserve funding goal of attaining and  maintaining reserves at or near 100% funded.
Statutory Funding - Establishing a reserve funding goal of setting aside the  specific minimum amount of reserves required by local statues.
Threshold Funding - Establishing a reserve funding goal of keeping the reserve  balance above a specified dollar or percent funded amount. Depending on the  threshold, this may be more or less conservative than "fully funding. "
Funding Plan - An  association's plan to provide income to a reserve fund to offset anticipated  expenditures from that fund.
Funding Principles:

Sufficient Funds When Required
Stable Contribution Rate over the Years
Evenly Distributed Contributions over the Years
Fiscally Responsible

Life and Valuation Estimates - The task of estimating useful life, remaining useful life,  and repair or replacement costs for the reserve components.
Percent Funded -  The ratio, at a particular point of time (typically the beginning of the fiscal  year), of the actual (or projected) reserve balance to the fully funded balance,  expressed as a percentage. 
Physical Analysis -  The portion of the reserve study where the component inventory, condition assessment,  and life and valuation estimate tasks are performed. This represents one of the  two parts of the reserve study.
Remaining Useful Life (RUL) - Also referred to as "remaining life" (RL). The estimated  time, in years, that a reserve component can be expected to continue to serve  its intended function. Projects anticipated to occur in the initial year have  "zero" remaining useful life.
Replacement Cost -  The cost of replacing, repairing, or restoring a reserve component to its  original functional condition. The current replacement cost would be the cost  to replace, repair, or restore the component during that particular year.
Reserve Balance -  Actual or projected funds as of a particular point in time that the association  has identified for use to defray the future repair or replacement of those  major components which the association is obligated to maintain. Also known as reserves,  reserve accounts, cash reserves. Based upon information provided and not  audited.
Reserve Study Provider - An  individual that prepares reserve studies
Reserve Study - A  budget planning tool which identifies the current status of the reserve fund  and a stable and equitable funding plan to offset the anticipated future major  common area expenditures. The reserve study consists of two parts: the physical  analysis and the financial analysis. 
Responsible Charge - A  reserve specialist in responsible charge of a reserve study shall render  regular and effective supervision to those individuals performing services  which directly and materially affect the quality and competence rendered by the  reserve specialist. A reserve specialist shall maintain such records as are  reasonably necessary to establish that the reserve specialist exercised regular  and effective supervision of a reserve study of which he was in responsible  charge. A reserve specialist engaged in any of the following acts or practices  shall be deemed not to have rendered the regular and effective supervision  required herein:

The regular and continuous  absence from principal office premises from which professional services are  rendered; expect for performance of field work or presence in a field office  maintained exclusively for a specific project;
The failure to personally  inspect or review the work of subordinates where necessary and appropriate;
The rendering of a limited,  cursory or perfunctory review of plans or projects in lieu of an appropriate  detailed review;
The failure to personally be  available on a reasonable basis or with adequate advance notice for  consultation and inspection where circumstances require personal availability.

Special Assessment - An  assessment levied on the members of an association in addition to regular  assessments. Special assessments are often regulated by governing documents or  local statutes.
Surplus - An actual (or  projected) reserve balance greater than the fully funded balance. See "deficit. "
Useful Life (UL) - Total useful life or depreciable life. The  estimated time, in years, that a reserve component can be expected to serve its  intended function if properly constructed in its present application or installation.

What is a Defect?
Defects are conditions which reduce the value (cause economic harm or loss to the owner) of a home, condominium, or common area.   IRMA (International Risk Management Institute) provides a general definition of construction defect. Each insurance underwriter and State, however, may have its own definition.  A Reserve Advisors Defect Survey identifies several types of defects which include construction defects.

Reserve Advisors Celebrates 25th Anniversary with Feeding America Initiative
Milwaukee Office Conducts 4 Volunteer Days
Milwaukee (November 28, 2016) – To celebrate its 25th anniversary, Reserve Advisors, Inc. is implementing a year-long giveback program for Feeding America. From August 2016 to July 2017, employees from Reserve Advisors will donate their time to Feeding America food banks in Milwaukee, Tampa, Minneapolis and Washington, D.C. Altogether, the company plans to conduct 16 Feeding America volunteer days, providing nearly 1,000 hours of employee manpower to the non-profit organization.
"We felt our company anniversary presented a special opportunity to help others out," says co-founder John Poehlmann. "You don't often think about hunger in the United States but it's a real problem. Ted and I, along with our employees, will roll up our sleeves to support Feeding America throughout the year."
The Feeding America campaign kicked off in August when a group of employees from Reserve Advisors' Minneapolis office spent the afternoon at the Second Harvest Heartland food bank, a member organization of Feeding America, sorting food and packing and stacking boxes to help provide 9,500 meals.
Milwaukee Support
					On November 3, employees from Reserve Advisors' headquarters in Milwaukee, along with company co-founders John Poehlmann and Ted Salgado, conducted a volunteer day at Feeding America Eastern Wisconsin. As part of the food bank's preparations to provide Thanksgiving meals to thousands of area residents, the Reserve Advisors group pitched in to move 18,200 pounds of turkey and 3,500 pounds of potatoes. The Milwaukee office is scheduled to return to Feeding America on December 8, 2016 and two more times in 2017.
Feeding America serves all 50 states through a network of 200 member food banks and 60,000 food pantries and meal programs. Every year, the organization relies on more than 2 million volunteers to feed 48 million Americans — including 15 million children and more than 5 million older adults — who struggle with hunger. 
Reserve Advisors was founded in 1991 by John Poehlmann and Ted Salgado in Milwaukee, Wis. The company quickly distinguished itself by delivering professional reserve studies prepared by engineers. With a continual focus on integrity, customer service, professionalism, accountability and technical quality, Reserve Advisors grew from a single office to the eight regional locations it has today.
 

 
Reserve Advisors Expands in Arlington, Virginia
(May 6, 2015) We are excited to announce that we have expanded our current office space to better fulfill our clients' needs.   Our local staff of engineers have served hundreds of community associations from the Chesapeake Region, down to Virginia Beach and throughout the Washington Metropolitan area.
For more information, contact our Regional Director of Client Services, Michelle Baldry at (844) 701-9884 or mbaldry@reserveadvisors.com

BEST FIXED-INCOME FUNDS
Fixed income is a type of investing or budgeting style for which real return rates or periodic income is received at regular intervals at reasonably predictable levels. Fixed-income budgeters and investors are often one and the same - typically retired individuals who rely on their investments to provide a regular, stable income stream.  Individuals who live on set amounts of periodically paid income face the risk that inflation will erode their spending power. Fixed-income investors receive set, regular payments that face the same inflation risk.           Income funds are named appropriately: their purpose is to provide current income on a steady basis. When referring to mutual funds, the terms "fixed-income," "bond," and "income" are synonymous. These terms denote funds that invest primarily in government and corporate debt. While fund holdings may appreciate in value, the primary objective of these funds is to provide a steady cash flow to investors. As such, the audience for these funds consists of conservative investors and retirees.        Bond funds are likely to pay higher returns than certificates of deposit and money market investments, but bond funds aren't without risk. Because there are many different types of bonds, bond funds can vary dramatically depending on where they invest.Individual bonds may be the best known type of fixed income security, but the category also includes bond funds, ETFs, CDs, and money market funds.Fixed Income ETFsFixed income exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are baskets of fixed income investments that trade as a single unit throughout the day.    Money Market FundsA money market fund is a type of fixed income mutual fund that invests in debt securities that are characterized by their short maturities and minimal credit risk.For money market funds, income can be either taxable or tax exempt, depending on the types of securities in which the fund invests. These may include short-term U.S. Treasury securities, federal agency notes, Eurodollar deposits, repurchase agreements, certificates of deposit, corporate commercial paper; or obligations of states, cities, or other types of municipal agencies. Bond FundsBond funds are professionally managed portfolios that invest in individual fixed income securities.Reasons to consider bond funds Potential for capital preservation, depending on the fundIncome generationDiversification for a potential hedge against stock market volatilityLiquidityFunds are guided by a stated objective, generally focusing on a particular sector, such as corporate or Treasury bonds; a broad category, such as investment grade or high yield securities; or a specific time horizon, such as short-, intermediate-, or long-term bonds. Individual BondsA bond is an interest-bearing security that obligates the issuer to pay the bondholder a specified sum of money, usually at specific intervals (known as a coupon), and to repay the principal amount of the loan at maturity. Zero-coupon bonds pay both the imputed interest and the principal at maturity. Here are the top fixed investment picks you should consider:Baird Short-Term Bond FundThe fund has returned 1.50 percent over the past year, 1.48 percent over the past three years, 2.04 percent over the past five years, and 3.17 percent over the past decade. It is a low risk investment with low fees.·Metropolitan West Intermediate Bond FundThe fund has returned 1.59 percent over the past year, 1.63 percent over the past three years, 3.55 percent over the past five years, and 5.43 percent over the past decade. It is a low risk investment with low fees.Vanguard Limited-Term Tax-ExemptVanguard Fund gives you a low-risk muni option. The fund has a duration of 2.5 years and charges just 0.20%. Average credit quality is double-A. But the fund yields only 0.9% (that’s a tax-equivalent 1.6% for a taxpayer in the highest bracket. Fidelity Intermediate Municipal IncomeIf you’re investing in a taxable account, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a better fund than Fidelity Intermediate Municipal Income (FLTMX). Munis, which pay interest that is generally free of federal income tax, typically offer a bit less volatility than taxable bonds with similar characteristics. The fund’s average duration is 5 years, and its average credit quality is a relatively safe single-A.Non-Public Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)These are not the traditional REITs that trade on an exchange. Public REITs are too volatile. Private REITs typically perform steadily and are currently providing mid to high single-digit dividends. Again, do your homework. Some are great, while others are atrocious or too new.Variable annuities with guaranteed income optionsVariable annuities are not necessarily great investments because they tend to act just like expensive mutual funds. The real value comes from the potential income benefit. Most variable annuities currently offer a 5 or 6 percent guaranteed income for the life of the owner. The beauty of that income is that if the market drives the account up, income can increase, but if the market drives the account down, the income remains constant. In retirement, that is very important.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
