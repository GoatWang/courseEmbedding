A Lesson in Fiduciary Responsibility and Share Classes
There are few larger responsibilities than that of someone else’s money. As a qualified retirement plan sponsor, one is considered a plan fiduciary, and thus, their responsibility falls into the category of “someone else’s money.”Read More

Business Consulting & Ownership Transition | BCI Group


























Employees
Employers



















Consulting
BCI Group's approach to consulting is built on collaboration and our own commitment to excellence. Our diverse team can help your company plan across many areas, from employee benefits and retirement planning, to ownership transition, strategic direction and executive compensation.
BCI Group is here to make you more successful. We understand the challenges you face and it is our job to help you make the best informed decisions to achieve your business goals. We’re proud to say that many of our client relationships span decades, as we continue to deliver practical, proven solutions tailored to our clients' needs. 






Ownership Transition
When you are ready to transition your company to new leadership or ownership, BCI is here to make sure your company is in good hands, continues your original vision and maximizes wealth while reducing tax burdens.
For many people, transitions are a milestone in a career, and they can be unfamiliar territory. It’s important to carefully consider ideas about exit strategies, incentive stock options, stock purchasing plans, shareholder partners and managed buyouts, and not to wait until the last minute.
At BCI Group, we look at ownership transition as a strategic process, broken into segments. We seek to make the process manageable for the current and future owners by orchestrating graceful transitions that are prudent, affordable and supportive of your company’s overall health. 

 Learn how BCI helped Bob's Red Mill with ownership transition Read story








Executive Compensation
What keeps your executives motivated and loyal? Tailored executive compensation plans and offering a wide array of performance incentives are certainly good ideas. However, plans are constantly shifting due to increased scrutiny, government intervention and regulatory pressures. Our process moves in unison with these shifts and we will assist you to align your shareholder, business and financing objectives with your management objectives.
Our expertise includes:

Analyzing industry salary and benefits
Setting compensation strategy and objectives
Documenting plans and disclosure requirements
Creating accountability and performance measures
Designing short and long-term incentive plans—both cash and equity-based
Aligning compensation, bonuses and incentives with shareholder objectives
Implementing tools to help executives succeed
Developing sales plans and compensation incentives
