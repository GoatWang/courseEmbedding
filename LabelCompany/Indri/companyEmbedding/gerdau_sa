History[edit]




Residence and company Estate Society João Gerdau, 1885


Gerdau was founded by Johannes Heinrich Kaspar Gerdau, known as João Gerdau, a German migrant who left the port of Hamburg for Rio Grande do Sul, in Brazil, in 1869 in search of new business opportunities. He arrived at the port of Rio Grande, Rio Grande do Sul and, at only 20 years of age, established himself in Colônia de Santo Ângelo (now the town of Agudo), where he invested in trade, transport and the subdivision of land. He moved to the town of Cachoeira do Sul in 1884, where he founded an important General Store. Always seeking new opportunities, João Gerdau moved again, this time to Porto Alegre, with his wife Alvine Gerdau and his three children, Hugo, Walter and Bertha. There he went into industry, buying the Pontas de Paris Nail Factory in 1901 marking the entry into steel industry.
Curt Johannpeter's entry into the Gerdau family marked the beginning of a new direction for the company. Born in Germany in 1899, Curt Johannpeter made his career in finance. In 1922 he began to work for the German Transatlantic Bank, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank. In 1930 he became the branch inspector for Portugal, Spain and Latin America, and in the same year was introduced to the young Helda Gerdau during a trip to Brazil. They married and had four sons: Germano, Klaus, Jorge and Frederico. In 1946, Johannpeter took the wheel of the Gerdau company and oversaw a critical phase in its expansion.
Today[edit]
Gerdau's core business is to transform steel scrap and iron ore into steel products.
Gerdau is a leading producer of long steel in the Americas and one of the largest suppliers of special steel in the world. It is the largest recycler in Latin America and around the world it transforms, each year, millions of metric tons of scrap into steel, reinforcing its commitment to sustainable development in the regions where it operates. With more than 140,000 shareholders, the Company is listed on the stock exchanges of São Paulo, New York and Madrid.
Its operations are based on the integrated regional market mill concept by which raw materials are bought from nearby suppliers and products are primarily sold in the same region. This brand of by-product synergy led to the acquisition of Chaparral Steel in 2007, a company which has been noted for creating interchange between head management and workers and deliberately employs a maximum of 1000 people (the size of a village).[2] Gerdau operates through three different processes:

Mini mills
Integrated mills
Direct reduced iron plant

Products and services[edit]
Gerdau produces long carbon steel, long special steel, flat steel and forged and cast parts. These products are used in different sectors, such as industry, metallurgy, farming and livestock, civil construction, automotive industries, petrochemicals, railway and naval sectors, in addition to orthodontic, medical and food areas. Gerdau is also the main supplier of specialty steel for the international automotive network.
Internationalization of the Gerdau Group[edit]
Long before its possibilities of expansion on the Brazilian market were exhausted, Gerdau had established strategies for external expansion, starting at the end of the 1970s. Their fundamental objectives were to conquer the U.S. market. Based on limited international experience managing a mini mill plant in Uruguay for almost a decade, the group first aimed at the North American market for long steel, starting with Canada. Later, after a decade of experience in conditions that were radically different than those existing in Uruguay (the location of its first foreign venture), Gerdau entered the U.S. market. Entry into North America was complemented by other ventures in all of Latin America, from Chile and Argentina to Mexico and the Caribbean. The North American experience, like the Brazilian, demonstrated the strategic necessity to enter new markets such as Europe (with special steels) and Asia (with long steel and final structures of special steel)[3]
Business operations[edit]
Gerdau is spread globally across 14 countries with its integrated and semi-integrated steel mills. Apart from steel mills, Gerdau also has downstream processing facilities.
Offices: Gerdau has its major offices at Porto Alegre, São Paulo, Tampa, Whitby, Polanco, Lima, Caracas, Bogota, Jackson and Bangalore.
Brazil Business Division: Gerdau has two Brazil business divisions divided as Mining Americas and Steel Brazil
Special Steel Business Division: Gerdau produces specialty steel especially for the automotive industry through its special steel divisions, Special Steel North America, Special Steel Brazil, Special Steel Europe and Special Steel India.
Latin America Business Division: Gerdau produces most of the long and flat products at Latin America North, Colombia, Mexico, Sizuca (Venezuela), Latin America South, Argentina, Chile, Peru and Uruguay

Gerdau is a leading producer of long steel in the Americas and one of the largest suppliers of special steel in the world. It is the largest recycler in Latin America and around the world it transforms, each year, millions of metric tons of scrap into steel, reinforcing its commitment to sustainable development in the regions where it operates. With more than 140,000 shareholders, the Company is listed on the stock exchanges of São Paulo, New York and Madrid.
Its operations are based on the integrated regional market mill concept by which raw materials are bought from nearby suppliers and products are primarily sold in the same region. This brand of by-product synergy led to the acquisition of Chaparral Steel in 2007, a company which has been noted for creating interchange between head management and workers and deliberately employs a maximum of 1000 people (the size of a village).[2] Gerdau operates through three different processes:

Mini mills
Integrated mills
Direct reduced iron plant

Products and services[edit]
Gerdau produces long carbon steel, long special steel, flat steel and forged and cast parts. These products are used in different sectors, such as industry, metallurgy, farming and livestock, civil construction, automotive industries, petrochemicals, railway and naval sectors, in addition to orthodontic, medical and food areas. Gerdau is also the main supplier of specialty steel for the international automotive network.
Internationalization of the Gerdau Group[edit]
Long before its possibilities of expansion on the Brazilian market were exhausted, Gerdau had established strategies for external expansion, starting at the end of the 1970s. Their fundamental objectives were to conquer the U.S. market. Based on limited international experience managing a mini mill plant in Uruguay for almost a decade, the group first aimed at the North American market for long steel, starting with Canada. Later, after a decade of experience in conditions that were radically different than those existing in Uruguay (the location of its first foreign venture), Gerdau entered the U.S. market. Entry into North America was complemented by other ventures in all of Latin America, from Chile and Argentina to Mexico and the Caribbean. The North American experience, like the Brazilian, demonstrated the strategic necessity to enter new markets such as Europe (with special steels) and Asia (with long steel and final structures of special steel)[3]
Business operations[edit]
Gerdau is spread globally across 14 countries with its integrated and semi-integrated steel mills. Apart from steel mills, Gerdau also has downstream processing facilities.
Offices: Gerdau has its major offices at Porto Alegre, São Paulo, Tampa, Whitby, Polanco, Lima, Caracas, Bogota, Jackson and Bangalore.
Brazil Business Division: Gerdau has two Brazil business divisions divided as Mining Americas and Steel Brazil
Special Steel Business Division: Gerdau produces specialty steel especially for the automotive industry through its special steel divisions, Special Steel North America, Special Steel Brazil, Special Steel Europe and Special Steel India.
Latin America Business Division: Gerdau produces most of the long and flat products at Latin America North, Colombia, Mexico, Sizuca (Venezuela), Latin America South, Argentina, Chile, Peru and Uruguay

History[edit]




Residence and company Estate Society João Gerdau, 1885


Gerdau was founded by Johannes Heinrich Kaspar Gerdau, known as João Gerdau, a German migrant who left the port of Hamburg for Rio Grande do Sul, in Brazil, in 1869 in search of new business opportunities. He arrived at the port of Rio Grande, Rio Grande do Sul and, at only 20 years of age, established himself in Colônia de Santo Ângelo (now the town of Agudo), where he invested in trade, transport and the subdivision of land. He moved to the town of Cachoeira do Sul in 1884, where he founded an important General Store. Always seeking new opportunities, João Gerdau moved again, this time to Porto Alegre, with his wife Alvine Gerdau and his three children, Hugo, Walter and Bertha. There he went into industry, buying the Pontas de Paris Nail Factory in 1901 marking the entry into steel industry.
Curt Johannpeter's entry into the Gerdau family marked the beginning of a new direction for the company. Born in Germany in 1899, Curt Johannpeter made his career in finance. In 1922 he began to work for the German Transatlantic Bank, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank. In 1930 he became the branch inspector for Portugal, Spain and Latin America, and in the same year was introduced to the young Helda Gerdau during a trip to Brazil. They married and had four sons: Germano, Klaus, Jorge and Frederico. In 1946, Johannpeter took the wheel of the Gerdau company and oversaw a critical phase in its expansion.

They married and had four sons: Germano, Klaus, Jorge and Frederico. In 1946, Johannpeter took the wheel of the Gerdau company and oversaw a critical phase in its expansion.
Today[edit]
Gerdau's core business is to transform steel scrap and iron ore into steel products.
Gerdau is a leading producer of long steel in the Americas and one of the largest suppliers of special steel in the world. It is the largest recycler in Latin America and around the world it transforms, each year, millions of metric tons of scrap into steel, reinforcing its commitment to sustainable development in the regions where it operates. With more than 140,000 shareholders, the Company is listed on the stock exchanges of São Paulo, New York and Madrid.
Its operations are based on the integrated regional market mill concept by which raw materials are bought from nearby suppliers and products are primarily sold in the same region. This brand of by-product synergy led to the acquisition of Chaparral Steel in 2007, a company which has been noted for creating interchange between head management and workers and deliberately employs a maximum of 1000 people (the size of a village).[2] Gerdau operates through three different processes:

Mini mills
Integrated mills
Direct reduced iron plant

Products and services[edit]
Gerdau produces long carbon steel, long special steel, flat steel and forged and cast parts. These products are used in different sectors, such as industry, metallurgy, farming and livestock, civil construction, automotive industries, petrochemicals, railway and naval sectors, in addition to orthodontic, medical and food areas. Gerdau is also the main supplier of specialty steel for the international automotive network.
Internationalization of the Gerdau Group[edit]
Long before its possibilities of expansion on the Brazilian market were exhausted, Gerdau had established strategies for external expansion, starting at the end of the 1970s. Their fundamental objectives were to conquer the U.S. market. Based on limited international experience managing a mini mill plant in Uruguay for almost a decade, the group first aimed at the North American market for long steel, starting with Canada. Later, after a decade of experience in conditions that were radically different than those existing in Uruguay (the location of its first foreign venture), Gerdau entered the U.S. market. Entry into North America was complemented by other ventures in all of Latin America, from Chile and Argentina to Mexico and the Caribbean. The North American experience, like the Brazilian, demonstrated the strategic necessity to enter new markets such as Europe (with special steels) and Asia (with long steel and final structures of special steel)[3]
Business operations[edit]
Gerdau is spread globally across 14 countries with its integrated and semi-integrated steel mills. Apart from steel mills, Gerdau also has downstream processing facilities.
Offices: Gerdau has its major offices at Porto Alegre, São Paulo, Tampa, Whitby, Polanco, Lima, Caracas, Bogota, Jackson and Bangalore.
Brazil Business Division: Gerdau has two Brazil business divisions divided as Mining Americas and Steel Brazil
Special Steel Business Division: Gerdau produces specialty steel especially for the automotive industry through its special steel divisions, Special Steel North America, Special Steel Brazil, Special Steel Europe and Special Steel India.
Latin America Business Division: Gerdau produces most of the long and flat products at Latin America North, Colombia, Mexico, Sizuca (Venezuela), Latin America South, Argentina, Chile, Peru and Uruguay
Assets[edit]

58 steel mills
21 downstream operations
94 fabricated reinforcing steel facilities
4 flat steel service centers
80 retail facilities
32 scrap collection and processing facilities
4 iron ore extraction areas
2 solid pig iron production units
2 private port terminals
1 Reinforcing Steel Placing Company

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Gerdau also produces special steel products, normally with a certain degree of customization for the manufacture of tools and machinery, chains, locks and springs, mainly for the automotive and mechanical industries.Gerdau operates steel mills that produce steel by direct iron-ore reduction (DRI) in blast furnaces and in electric arc furnaces (EAF). As of December 31, 2016, in Brazil, it operated three integrated steel mills, including its Ouro Branco mill, located in the state of Minas Gerais. As of December 31, 2016, Gerdau had a total of 42 steel producing facilities globally, including joint venture and associate companies. As of December 31, 2016, Gerdau's total consolidated installed annual capacity, excluding investments in jointly controlled entities and associate companies, was approximately 25.5 million tons of crude steel and 22.0 million tons of rolled steel products. As of December 31, 2016, Gerdau operated 17 steel production units in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Through its subsidiaries and affiliates, Gerdau also engages in other activities related to the production and sale of steel products, including reforestation; electric power generation projects; coking coal, iron ore and pig iron production, as well as fab shops and downstream operations.The Company sells its products to a diversified list of customers for use in the construction, manufacturing and agricultural industries. Shipments by the Company's Brazilian operations include both domestic and export sales. Most of the shipments by the Company's business operations in North and Latin America (except Brazil) are focused on their respective local markets. The Company supplies its customers a range of products, including steel products and iron ore semi-finished products (billets, blooms and slabs), common long rolled products, drawn products, special steel products, flat products and iron ore. Billets are bars from square sections of long steel that serve as inputs for the production of wire rod, rebars and merchant bars. Blooms are used to manufacture products, such as springs, forged parts, heavy structural shapes and seamless tubes. Slabs are used in the steel industry for the rolling of a range of flat rolled products, and mainly used to produce hot and cold rolled coils, heavy slabs and profiles.The Company's main long rolled products include rebars, merchant bars and profiles, which are used mainly by the construction and manufacturing industries. Drawn products include barbed and barbless fence wire, galvanized wire, fences, concrete reinforcing wire mesh, nails and clamps. The Company produces special steel used in automotive components, machinery, road and agricultural parts, mining equipment, tools, rail components and maritime mooring at its Pindamonhangaba, Mogi das Cruzes and Charqueadas units in Brazil, at Basauri, Azkoitia and Vitoria units in Spain, at the Fort Smith, Jackson and Monroe units in the United States and in Tadipatri, India. The Company's Ouro Branco mill produces slabs, which are rolled into flat products, such as hot- and cold-rolled steel coils, heavy plates and structural profiles. Gerdau also produces hot-rolled coils, which are sold in the domestic and export markets.As of December 31, 2016, Gerdau operated three mines producing iron ore, all located in the Brazilian state of Minas Gereais (Varzea do Lopes, Miguel Burnier and Gongo Soco). The mines produce sinter feed (featuring low content of contaminants and good metallurgical properties, enabling its use as a base material); pellet feed/concentrated (enabling its use as a chemical balancer in the synthetizing process, while being also adequate for pelletizing); hematite fines (small scale production, used as input in Gerdau's furnaces), and Granulated (used for own consumption at the Ouro Branco Mill).Brazil Business OperationThe Company's production sells in Brazil was distributed through Gerdau's distribution channel, with stores throughout Brazil and downstream facilities, serving a number of customers. Its another distribution channel is the independent's network, formed by points of sales to which Gerdau sells its products. Sales through its distribution network and to final industrial and construction consumers are made by Gerdau employees and authorized sales representatives working on commission.North America Business OperationAs of December 31, 2016, the North America Operation had annual production capacity of 10.9 million tons of crude steel and nine million tons of finished steel products. As of December 31, 2016, it had a vertically integrated network of 17 steel units for the operation of a mini-mill (including joint ventures and associate companies), scrap recycling facilities (including joint ventures and associate companies), downstream operations (including three joint ventures) and fabshops.

History[edit]




Residence and company Estate Society João Gerdau, 1885


Gerdau was founded by Johannes Heinrich Kaspar Gerdau, known as João Gerdau, a German migrant who left the port of Hamburg for Rio Grande do Sul, in Brazil, in 1869 in search of new business opportunities. He arrived at the port of Rio Grande, Rio Grande do Sul and, at only 20 years of age, established himself in Colônia de Santo Ângelo (now the town of Agudo), where he invested in trade, transport and the subdivision of land. He moved to the town of Cachoeira do Sul in 1884, where he founded an important General Store. Always seeking new opportunities, João Gerdau moved again, this time to Porto Alegre, with his wife Alvine Gerdau and his three children, Hugo, Walter and Bertha. There he went into industry, buying the Pontas de Paris Nail Factory in 1901 marking the entry into steel industry.
Curt Johannpeter's entry into the Gerdau family marked the beginning of a new direction for the company. Born in Germany in 1899, Curt Johannpeter made his career in finance. In 1922 he began to work for the German Transatlantic Bank, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank. In 1930 he became the branch inspector for Portugal, Spain and Latin America, and in the same year was introduced to the young Helda Gerdau during a trip to Brazil. They married and had four sons: Germano, Klaus, Jorge and Frederico. In 1946, Johannpeter took the wheel of the Gerdau company and oversaw a critical phase in its expansion.
Today[edit]
Gerdau's core business is to transform steel scrap and iron ore into steel products.
Gerdau is a leading producer of long steel in the Americas and one of the largest suppliers of special steel in the world. It is the largest recycler in Latin America and around the world it transforms, each year, millions of metric tons of scrap into steel, reinforcing its commitment to sustainable development in the regions where it operates. With more than 140,000 shareholders, the Company is listed on the stock exchanges of São Paulo, New York and Madrid.
Its operations are based on the integrated regional market mill concept by which raw materials are bought from nearby suppliers and products are primarily sold in the same region. This brand of by-product synergy led to the acquisition of Chaparral Steel in 2007, a company which has been noted for creating interchange between head management and workers and deliberately employs a maximum of 1000 people (the size of a village).[2] Gerdau operates through three different processes:

Mini mills
Integrated mills
Direct reduced iron plant

Products and services[edit]
Gerdau produces long carbon steel, long special steel, flat steel and forged and cast parts. These products are used in different sectors, such as industry, metallurgy, farming and livestock, civil construction, automotive industries, petrochemicals, railway and naval sectors, in addition to orthodontic, medical and food areas. Gerdau is also the main supplier of specialty steel for the international automotive network.
Internationalization of the Gerdau Group[edit]
Long before its possibilities of expansion on the Brazilian market were exhausted, Gerdau had established strategies for external expansion, starting at the end of the 1970s. Their fundamental objectives were to conquer the U.S. market. Based on limited international experience managing a mini mill plant in Uruguay for almost a decade, the group first aimed at the North American market for long steel, starting with Canada. Later, after a decade of experience in conditions that were radically different than those existing in Uruguay (the location of its first foreign venture), Gerdau entered the U.S. market. Entry into North America was complemented by other ventures in all of Latin America, from Chile and Argentina to Mexico and the Caribbean. The North American experience, like the Brazilian, demonstrated the strategic necessity to enter new markets such as Europe (with special steels) and Asia (with long steel and final structures of special steel)[3]
Business operations[edit]
Gerdau is spread globally across 14 countries with its integrated and semi-integrated steel mills. Apart from steel mills, Gerdau also has downstream processing facilities.
Offices: Gerdau has its major offices at Porto Alegre, São Paulo, Tampa, Whitby, Polanco, Lima, Caracas, Bogota, Jackson and Bangalore.
Brazil Business Division: Gerdau has two Brazil business divisions divided as Mining Americas and Steel Brazil
Special Steel Business Division: Gerdau produces specialty steel especially for the automotive industry through its special steel divisions, Special Steel North America, Special Steel Brazil, Special Steel Europe and Special Steel India.
Latin America Business Division: Gerdau produces most of the long and flat products at Latin America North, Colombia, Mexico, Sizuca (Venezuela), Latin America South, Argentina, Chile, Peru and Uruguay

Long before its possibilities of expansion on the Brazilian market were exhausted, Gerdau had established strategies for external expansion, starting at the end of the 1970s. Their fundamental objectives were to conquer the U.S. market. Based on limited international experience managing a mini mill plant in Uruguay for almost a decade, the group first aimed at the North American market for long steel, starting with Canada. Later, after a decade of experience in conditions that were radically different than those existing in Uruguay (the location of its first foreign venture), Gerdau entered the U.S. market. Entry into North America was complemented by other ventures in all of Latin America, from Chile and Argentina to Mexico and the Caribbean. The North American experience, like the Brazilian, demonstrated the strategic necessity to enter new markets such as Europe (with special steels) and Asia (with long steel and final structures of special steel)[3]
Business operations[edit]
Gerdau is spread globally across 14 countries with its integrated and semi-integrated steel mills. Apart from steel mills, Gerdau also has downstream processing facilities.
Offices: Gerdau has its major offices at Porto Alegre, São Paulo, Tampa, Whitby, Polanco, Lima, Caracas, Bogota, Jackson and Bangalore.
Brazil Business Division: Gerdau has two Brazil business divisions divided as Mining Americas and Steel Brazil
Special Steel Business Division: Gerdau produces specialty steel especially for the automotive industry through its special steel divisions, Special Steel North America, Special Steel Brazil, Special Steel Europe and Special Steel India.
Latin America Business Division: Gerdau produces most of the long and flat products at Latin America North, Colombia, Mexico, Sizuca (Venezuela), Latin America South, Argentina, Chile, Peru and Uruguay

History[edit]




Residence and company Estate Society João Gerdau, 1885


Gerdau was founded by Johannes Heinrich Kaspar Gerdau, known as João Gerdau, a German migrant who left the port of Hamburg for Rio Grande do Sul, in Brazil, in 1869 in search of new business opportunities. He arrived at the port of Rio Grande, Rio Grande do Sul and, at only 20 years of age, established himself in Colônia de Santo Ângelo (now the town of Agudo), where he invested in trade, transport and the subdivision of land. He moved to the town of Cachoeira do Sul in 1884, where he founded an important General Store. Always seeking new opportunities, João Gerdau moved again, this time to Porto Alegre, with his wife Alvine Gerdau and his three children, Hugo, Walter and Bertha. There he went into industry, buying the Pontas de Paris Nail Factory in 1901 marking the entry into steel industry.
Curt Johannpeter's entry into the Gerdau family marked the beginning of a new direction for the company. Born in Germany in 1899, Curt Johannpeter made his career in finance. In 1922 he began to work for the German Transatlantic Bank, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank. In 1930 he became the branch inspector for Portugal, Spain and Latin America, and in the same year was introduced to the young Helda Gerdau during a trip to Brazil. They married and had four sons: Germano, Klaus, Jorge and Frederico. In 1946, Johannpeter took the wheel of the Gerdau company and oversaw a critical phase in its expansion.
Today[edit]
Gerdau's core business is to transform steel scrap and iron ore into steel products.
Gerdau is a leading producer of long steel in the Americas and one of the largest suppliers of special steel in the world. It is the largest recycler in Latin America and around the world it transforms, each year, millions of metric tons of scrap into steel, reinforcing its commitment to sustainable development in the regions where it operates. With more than 140,000 shareholders, the Company is listed on the stock exchanges of São Paulo, New York and Madrid.
Its operations are based on the integrated regional market mill concept by which raw materials are bought from nearby suppliers and products are primarily sold in the same region. This brand of by-product synergy led to the acquisition of Chaparral Steel in 2007, a company which has been noted for creating interchange between head management and workers and deliberately employs a maximum of 1000 people (the size of a village).[2] Gerdau operates through three different processes:

Mini mills
Integrated mills
Direct reduced iron plant

Products and services[edit]
Gerdau produces long carbon steel, long special steel, flat steel and forged and cast parts. These products are used in different sectors, such as industry, metallurgy, farming and livestock, civil construction, automotive industries, petrochemicals, railway and naval sectors, in addition to orthodontic, medical and food areas. Gerdau is also the main supplier of specialty steel for the international automotive network.
Internationalization of the Gerdau Group[edit]
Long before its possibilities of expansion on the Brazilian market were exhausted, Gerdau had established strategies for external expansion, starting at the end of the 1970s. Their fundamental objectives were to conquer the U.S. market.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
