Terms & Conditions












TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PURCHASE

1. PURCHASE ORDERS:  Any purchase order, confirmation form or other document submitted by Purchaser and all 
sales to Purchaser shall be subject to and governed solely by the standard sale terms and conditions set out 
herein and are subject to acceptance by Wells-Gardner Electronics Corporation ("Seller") at its office in 
McCook, Illinois.  All provisions, conditions and terms contained in such purchase order, confirmation form 
or other document which are in addition to or not consistent with these standard sale terms and conditions 
are null and void and not binding on Seller. No modification or supplement to these standard sale terms and 
conditions shall be binding on Seller.  Seller's shipment of goods shall not be deemed acceptance of 
Purchaser's terms and conditions.  Any such modification or supplement shall not operate as a rejection of the standard sale terms and conditions but shall be deemed a material alteration, and these standard sale terms and conditions shall be deemed accepted by Purchaser without said modification or supplement.  If these standard sale terms and conditions have been issued by Seller in response to a prior offer by Purchaser and any of the terms in the standard sale terms and conditions add to, vary from or conflict with any term of Purchaser's offer, then the issuance of these standard sale terms and conditions shall constitute an acceptance of Purchaser's offer subject to the express condition that Purchaser assents to all of the additional, different and conflicting terms contained herein and acknowledges that these standard sale terms and conditions constitute the entire agreement between Seller and Purchaser with respect to all goods sold by Seller.  Purchase orders and change purchase orders shall contain the following information:  (i) identity of product by model number; (ii) quantity ordered; (iii) specific shipment dates which must be within the terms of these standard sale terms and conditions; and (iv) shipping instructions.  Seller will not be bound by purchase orders issued to its sales representative(s) as the vendor.  Purchaser agrees to be bound pursuant to any electronically submitted purchase order or other request for products submitted to Seller which shows that it has originated at Purchaser's business facility or by any of Purchaser's employees or other authorized agents.  Seller may allocate on an equitable basis quantities of the products to be supplied to Purchaser if, in the opinion of Seller, its supplies will not be sufficient to meet the requirements of all its customers.  Seller shall have no liability to Purchaser if Seller, for any reason, does not accept and fill any order submitted by Purchaser to Seller.


2. TERMS OF SALE:  All shipments are made F.O.B. Seller's manufacturing location, freight collect, unless 
otherwise specified.


3. TERMS OF PAYMENT: Except as otherwise set forth on a Seller invoice, terms of payment are net thirty 
(30) days from the date of shipment or date of invoice, whichever is later.  Seller reserves the right 
to charge interest at one and one-half percent (1 1/2%) per month from invoice date after thirty (30) days.
Also, Seller reserves the right to demand payment C.O.D. or prior to shipment if Purchaser fails to pay for 
any goods previously delivered when due or if, in Seller's judgment, Purchaser's financial condition warrants 
payment C.O.D. or prior to shipment.  Purchaser shall have no right of offset and is prohibited from taking 
the benefit of any discounts or rebates by deduction from invoice.  Claims against Seller for a particular 
invoice must be brought forth within six (6) months of invoice date, otherwise they are void and the invoice 
is due in full.


4. TAXES: The prices for products do not include any amount for federal, state, or local excise, sales, use, 
service, occupation, gross income, property, or similar taxes.  If any such taxes are determined to be applicable
to this transaction or Seller is required to pay or bear the burden thereof, Purchaser shall pay to Seller the
full amount of any such taxes and any interest or penalty thereon no later than thirty (30) days after the 
receipt of an invoice therefor.  In order for any shipment to be exempted from an applicable tax, a properly 
executed tax exemption certificate must be on file with Seller.

5. CHANGE ORDERS: Any modification to any existing order that changes a product's configuration, quantity, 
shipment location, or shipment date will be considered a "change order."  Change orders are accepted up to 
ten (10) business days before a scheduled shipment date unless otherwise specified.  Purchaser will be 
responsible for costs incurred by Seller when a change order is requested.  Change orders involving part 
number or quantity changes will be assigned new shipment dates consistent with Seller's current projected 
delivery schedule and product availability.  Requests for expedited shipment dates may incur additional charges, 
for which Purchaser shall be solely responsible.



6. SCHEDULING: In the event that Purchaser, for any reason other than a default on the part of Seller, has 
not instructed Seller to ship all of the products specified in the purchase order within one (1) year from 
the date of issuance of such purchase order, Seller will calculate the difference between the price payable 
by Purchaser for the quantity of equipment actually shipped within (1) year from the date of issuance of such
purchase order and the price provisionally invoiced based on the amount of the products  which Purchaser 
originally estimated purchasing (as evidenced by the quantity of the products specified in the purchase order),
and Seller will charge and invoice Purchaser accordingly for the products already shipped.  Payment of invoices 
for such charges shall be made in accordance with paragraph 3 above.


7. RESCHEDULES: Products scheduled for shipment within thirty (30) days of the current date are not subject 
to rescheduling.  Seller reserves the right to charge an inventory carrying cost fee of two percent (2%) per 
month on the invoice price for any order which is delayed more than sixty (60) days from the scheduled ship 
date.


8. PATENTS: Seller shall defend any suit or proceeding brought against Purchaser insofar as such a suit is 
based on a claim that any of Seller's products furnished under these standard sale terms and conditions 
constitutes an infringement of any patent of the United States, if Purchaser promptly notifies Seller in 
writing of the charge of infringement or threat of suit, if there be such and if Purchaser gives Seller 
authority, information and assistance for the defense.  Seller shall have no liability in connection with 
any charge of infringement unless:  (a) the product was used in the same form, state, condition, manner and 
purpose for which it was sold to Purchaser by Seller; and (b) such alleged infringement does not arise in 
whole or in part from any modification of the product or from any other use or omission.


9. TRADEMARKS: Seller authorizes and grants to Purchaser the non-exclusive, revocable right to use the brand 
names, trademarks and other indicia of manufacturing origin and quality of the products to advertise and promote
the sale of the products so long as Purchaser is entitled to sell the products.  Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that it shall have no right, title or interest in or to any of the trademarks, other than as a purchaser
and reseller of the products, and that all use of the trademarks inures to the benefit of Seller.  Purchaser shall
make no contrary representations and shall not in any way contest Seller's rights to the trademarks.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall have no right to use or incorporate any of the trademarks in any 
domain names, and shall convey to Seller any domain names which it owns or controls and which incorporates any
of the trademarks.  


10. GOVERNING LAW: These standard sale terms and conditions shall be in all respect, governed by and construed
and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois (excluding the International Convention for 
the Sale of Goods), including all matters of construction, validity and performance and no modifications hereof
shall be effective unless they are agreed upon in writing by Seller.  Any action to enforce or interpret the 
terms of these standard sale terms and conditions shall be instituted and maintained in either the Circuit Court
of Cook County, Illinois, or in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.  
Purchaser hereby consents to the jurisdiction of such court and waives any objections to such jurisdiction. 
In any action or proceeding arising out of these standard sale terms and conditions, the party prevailing in 
such action shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.


11. RELEASES: Production releases can be initiated within ninety to one hundred twenty (90-120) days after 
receipt of order, or sooner depending on availability of materials and other production scheduling.


12. FORCE MAJEURE: Seller shall not be liable for delays in shipment or default in delivery for any cause 
beyond Seller's reasonable control, including, but not limited to, the following:  (a) fires, floods or other 
casualties; (b) wars, riots, terrorist attacks, civil commotion, embargo's governmental regulations or martial 
law; (c) Seller' inability to obtain necessary materials from its usual sources of supply; (d) existing or future
strikes or other labor troubles affecting production or shipment, whether involving employees of Seller or 
employees of others, regardless of responsibility or fault on the part of the employer; or (e) other 
contingencies of manufacture or shipment.  In the event of any delay in Seller's performance due in whole or 
in part to any cause beyond Seller's reasonable control, Seller shall have such additional time for performance
as may be reasonably necessary under the circumstance.  Acceptance by Purchaser of any goods shall constitute a 
waiver by Purchaser of any claim for damages on account of any delay in delivery of such goods.


13. DELIVERY: Delivery of goods by Seller to the carrier shall be deemed delivery to Purchaser and thereupon
title to such goods and risk of loss or damage and all liability shall be Purchaser's.  Seller assumes no 
responsibility for delays, breakage or damage after having made delivery in good order to the carrier.  Any 
claim by Purchaser against Seller for shortage or damage occurring prior to such delivery must be made in 
writing within five (5) days after receipt of shipment and accompanied by original transportation bill signed 
by the carrier noting that carrier received goods from Seller in the condition claimed.


14. RETURNS: No shipments shall be accepted for return unless prior written authorization has been granted by AG&E. Any shipments received without an authorized RMA will be returned to the sender. Authorization for return does not constitute acceptance by AG&E of any responsibility for material returned beyond review thereof. Material accepted back by AG&E for re-inspection, rework, or other processing, is with AG&E only on consignment, and such acceptance back shall not be construed as a return for credit. If AG&E accepts a product for return credit, AG&E reserves the right to charge a restocking fee of at least fifteen percent (15%) of the invoiced amount. Sales of custom products are final.


15. ERRORS: Stenographic and clerical errors made by Seller in bids, estimates and quotations are subject to 
correction.


16. MODEL CHANGES: Seller reserves the right to discontinue products from time to time.  The acceptance of 
Purchaser's purchase order in no way obligates Seller to continue to furnish any particular model after 
completion of the accepted purchase orders. 


17. TERMINATION AND CANCELLATIONS: Purchaser may terminate any purchase order in whole or in part upon thirty
(30) days notice in writing to Seller.  Seller shall thereupon, as directed, cease work and transfer to 
Purchaser title to all completed and partially completed products and to any raw materials or supplies acquired 
by Seller especially for the purpose of performing such purchase order,  and Purchaser shall pay Seller promptly
as follows:  (1) the contract price for all products which have been completed prior to termination; (2) the cost
to Seller of the material or work in process as shown on the books of Seller in accordance with the accounting 
practice consistently maintained by Seller; (3) the cost F.O.B. Seller's plant of materials and supplies acquired 
especially for the purpose of performing such purchase order; (4) reasonable cancellation charges, if any, on
account of Seller commitments made under such purchase order; and (5) a cancellation charge of thirty percent 
(30%) of the total amount due from Purchaser to Seller under any outstanding purchase order.


18. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY: In no event shall Seller be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, punitive
consequential damages, including, but not limited to, lost profits or dimunition of goodwill, to Purchaser or
any third party caused by use or sale any items of equipment, defective or otherwise, and whether defect is
warranted against or not and whether based on contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise, and whether or not
Seller was advised of the possibility of such damages.  In no event shall Seller's liability exceed the price 
paid for the goods giving rise to such liability.  In no event may actions for breach against Seller be commenced 
more than one (1) year after cause of action occurs.


19. INDEMNITY: Purchaser shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its successors, assigns, affiliates, 
agents and contractors, and the officers, directors and employees of each of them, from and against any damage,
loss, claim, judgment or other liability or expense (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees) 
which may in any way arise out of any act or omission in connection with these standard sale terms and conditions
and, except the extent caused by Seller, the purchase, resale or use of the products by Purchaser or its 
successors, assigns, affiliates, agents and contractors, or the officers, directors or employees of any of them. 
Seller reserves the right, without being required to do so, and without waiver of any indemnity hereunder, to 
defend any claim, action or lawsuit coming within the scope of this indemnity provision.


20. WAIVER: Waiver by Seller of any breach of these standard sale terms and conditions shall be construed as a 
waiver of any other breach, and failure to exercise any right arising from any default hereunder shall not be 
deemed a waiver of such right which may be exercised at any subsequent time.

Zacks Rank:



 




Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

AG&E Holdings: Transformative Acquisition Could Be Interesting At Lower Prices - AG&E Holdings, Inc. (NYSEMKT:WGA) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»AG&E Holdings: Transformative Acquisition Could Be Interesting At Lower PricesMay. 2.16 | About: AG&E Holdings, (WGA) Thinley Wangchuk Long only, nano-cap, Deep Value, arbitrageWangchuk Capital, LLC.SummaryShareholder-oriented management: Prior to closing of the transaction, AGE intends to make a $.05-$.11 cash distribution to its existing shareholders.$11mm in net operating losses.Acquisition will bring incentivized management, cost synergies and cross-selling opportunities.AG&E Holdings (WGA, herein referred to as "AG&E") will be acquiring Advanced Gamings Associates (herein referred to as "AGA") in the 3rd quarter of 2016. At closing AGA will receive new shares in AGE equal to about 31% of outstanding shares of AGE's common stock. At closing, AGA will also receive a 5 year 5% note for $1mm in principal. Prior to closing of the transaction, AGE intents to make a $.05-$.11 cash distribution to its existing shareholders. In addition, if certain new product revenue targets are satisfied in 2 years, AGA will get new shares in AGE such that AGA's shares will be 45% of outstanding shares and if certain service revenue targets are met, the initial note with a $1mm principal will increase by an additional $1mm. AG&E has divested most of its business and is currently only in the business of the distribution of service of electronic components which consists of gaming supplies and components. AGA is in the business of providing turnkey solutions to gaming industry, specifically, installing and maintaining slot machines. Mr. Tomasello, AGA's CEO, will serve as interim CEO and receive a base salary of $385K, a bonus of 2% of the Company's EBITDA upon the Company exceeding $600k in EBITDA for the first 12 calendar months after closing and other standard benefits. Shareholders are not given much information on AGA. According to WGA)+to+Acquire+Advanced+Gaming+Associates/11497586.html" rel="nofollow">this press release shareholders were told AGA generated $6.7mm in revenue last year. It is unclear what assets AGA will bring over in the merger, however, given that AGA's business does not seem capital intensive, it seems this amount should be low. There is also some uncertainty of the earnings power of AGA.
 Below is my estimate of the post merger balance sheet (9/30/16) and post merger economic ownership. My estimates are based on the 12/31/15 balance sheet after which I took into account what I think the balance sheet will look like in 9/30/16, specifically making assumptions on the merger expense, burn rate, special dividend and AGA's net asset. 

  

 At today's market cap of $4.1mm, investors are paying 1.24x book value. Note, my calculation does not include $11mm of Net Operating Losses that are off balance sheet. The 2017 income statement was created using the margins for FY 2015 for continuing operations. Sales is estimated at $17mm. Since AG&E shareholders will have a 69% ownership interest, net income attributed towards this group is $172.5k, giving a P/E of 23.8. 

 Overall, the transaction seems to make sense. Both companies have worked together in the past, new management is incentivized on multiple fronts and some cost synergies will emerge (public company expense allocated across a larger company). There also may be an opportunity for cross selling by the new company's sales force as Mr. Spier mentioned when AGE entered into a sub-distribution agreement with AGA in 2015 "...We also expect to market and sell AGA's other products, including its design, installation and maintenance services for casinos." WGA looks interesting, however, at $.35/share, investors should wait for lower prices.
