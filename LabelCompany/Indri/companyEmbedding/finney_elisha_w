Mettler-Toledo Appoints Elisha Finney to Board of Directors

  Mettler-Toledo International Inc. MTD  recently announced changes at its management level with the appointment of Elisha Finney to its Board of Directors and Audit Committee, effective November 1, 2017. Reportedly, Francis A. Contino, the Chair of the Audit Committee will be retiring in May 2018 and will be succeeded by Elisha Finney. In her illustrious career, Finney has served in responsible positions at a number of reputable organizations. She joined Varian Medical Systems Inc. in 1988 and held various ranks before becoming the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Varian. Also, Finney is a member of the board of directors of ICU Medical, Inc., iRobot Corporation, and NanoString Technologies, Inc. Management believes that her experience in finance, governance and leadership among other qualities, will be instrumental in helping the company achieve long-term goals.  Recent Results & Looking Ahead  Mettler-Toledo delivered strong first-quarter 2017 results, wherein adjusted earnings of $3.34 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.4%. Also, revenues were up 10.2% on a year-over-year basis, driven by strengths across all the segments and contribution from the Troemner acquisition. The company issued decent second-quarter 2017 guidance. For the upcoming quarter, Mettler-Toledo expects local currency sales to grow approximately 8- 9%. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) are expected to grow 20-21% to $3.85-$3.90. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS is pegged at $3.88.   Mettler-Toledo International, Inc. Price and     Consensus        Mettler-Toledo International, Inc. Price and   Consensus    |      Mettler-Toledo International, Inc. Quote   To Conclude  Mettler-Toledo is a worldwide analytical instruments provider. We remain optimistic about Mettler-Toledo's leading market position, focus on product development and cost reduction, sales and marketing efforts and operational excellence programs. The company's various growth initiatives - Field Turbo investments, marketing initiatives, Spinnaker sales and new product launches - will continue to deliver positive results. The company has had an impressive run on the bourse in the last one year. It has gained roughly 56.7%, higher than the Zacks categorized Instruments - Scientific  industry's growth 32.2%.     Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider  Currently, Mettler-Toledo has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Alibaba Group Holding Limited BABA  , PetMed Express, Inc. PETS  and Autobytel Inc. ABTL  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here   . Alibaba Group Holding Limited delivered a positive earnings surprise of 20.53%, on average, in the trailing four quarters. PetMed Express delivered a positive earnings surprise of 9.32%, on average, in the trailing four quarters. Autobytel Inc. delivered a positive earnings surprise of 41.98%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.  Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric   Cars?       Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research. It's not the one you think.

PALO ALTO, Calif., Oct. 26, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Varian Medical Systems (NYSE:    VAR) today announced that Elisha W. Finney has informed the company of her intention to retire as executive vice president and chief financial officer.  Finney, 55, will remain in her current role until a successor is named, which Varian expects will occur during the fiscal year 2017.  The company has initiated a search to identify a replacement.  Finney will assist with an orderly transition and continue to manage the planned spin-off of Varian's Imaging Components business.  








"For our company and for our investors, Elisha has been an intelligent, trusted and energetic leader that all of us count on to help deliver winning results," said Dow R. Wilson, president and CEO of Varian.  "With her help and guidance, we have achieved a sustained, decades-long record of growth in revenues and profitability.  Her passion and competitiveness have been driving forces for the entire company.  She leaves a great track record to build upon.   We have been very fortunate to have Elisha on our management team."
"I am fortunate and proud to have spent virtually my entire career at a company that has the mission of saving lives," said Finney. "After nearly 29 years at Varian and nearly 18 years as CFO, I am excited about spending more time with my family and about the prospect of serving on boards of other companies.  We have grown tremendously since the last Varian spin in 1999 and the planned spin-off of the Imaging Components business presents a natural time to transition.  It has been a privilege to be part of a dedicated, passionate team whose talent and professionalism have made Varian a global power in the fight against cancer."
As CFO, Finney is responsible for all aspects of financial operations for Varian, including financial controls, treasury, risk management, investor relations, tax, internal audit and information technology.  She manages a team of some 400 employees around the globe.  During her time as CFO, Varian has increased its revenues more than five-fold, boosted its EBIT margin from 11 percent to 19 percent of sales and enjoyed an appreciation in its split adjusted stock price from about $4 to a recent closing high of $100 per share.
About Varian Medical SystemsVarian Medical Systems, Inc., of Palo Alto, California, focuses energy on saving lives by equipping the world with advanced technology for fighting cancer and for X-ray imaging.  The company is the world's leading manufacturer of medical devices and software for treating cancer and other medical conditions with radiotherapy, radiosurgery, proton therapy and brachytherapy.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.
