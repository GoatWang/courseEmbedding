Ceres Tactical Currency L.P. 
Notes to Financial Statements 
(Unaudited)   


1.
Organization:  Ceres Tactical Currency L.P. (the
Partnership) is a Delaware limited partnership organized in 1999 to engage primarily in the speculative trading of futures contracts, options on futures and forward contracts, and forward contracts on physical commodities and other
commodity interests, including, but not limited to, foreign currencies, financial instruments, metals, energy, and agricultural products (collectively, Futures Interests) (refer to Note 4, Financial Instruments through the
Partnerships Investment in Affiliated Master Fund). The Futures Interests that are indirectly traded by the Partnership through its investment in Cambridge Master Fund L.P. (the Master Fund) are volatile and involve a high
degree of market risk. The General Partner (as defined below) may also determine to invest up to all of the Partnerships assets in United States (U.S.) Treasury bills and/or money market mutual funds, including money market mutual
funds managed by Morgan Stanley or its affiliates. The Partnership is one of the Morgan Stanley Spectrum series of funds, comprised of the Partnership, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Technical L.P., Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Select
L.P. and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Strategic L.P.  Ceres Managed Futures LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company, acts as the general partner (Ceres or the General Partner) and commodity pool operator of the Partnership. As of January 1, 2017, Ceres became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley Domestic Holdings, Inc.
(MSD Holdings). MSD Holdings is ultimately owned by Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley is a publicly held company whose shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Morgan Stanley is engaged in various financial services and other
businesses. Prior to January 1, 2017, the General Partner was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Holdings LLC. All trading decisions for the Partnership are made by The Cambridge Strategy (Asset Management) Limited
(Cambridge or Trading Advisor).  During the reporting periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016,
the Partnerships and the Master Funds commodity broker was Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (MS&Co.), a registered futures commission merchant. The Partnership/Master Fund also deposits a portion of their cash in a non-trading account at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.  On November 1, 2012, the
Partnership allocated a portion of its assets to Cambridge for trading through investment in the Master Fund, a limited partnership organized under the partnership laws of the State of Delaware. The Master Fund was formed to permit accounts managed
now and in the future by Cambridge using Cambridge Asian Markets Alpha Programme and, from October 1, 2013, Cambridge Emerging Markets Alpha Programme, to invest together in one trading vehicle. The General Partner is also the general partner
of the Master Fund. Individual and pooled accounts currently managed by Cambridge, including the Partnership, are permitted to be limited partners of the Master Fund. The General Partner and Cambridge believe that trading through this
master/feeder structure should provide efficiency and economy in the trading process. Expenses to investors as a result of the investment in the Master Fund are approximately the same as they would be if the Partnership traded directly
and redemption rights are not affected.  The General Partner is not aware of any material changes to the trading program
discussed above during the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2017.  As of March 31, 2017 and December 31,
2016, the Partnership owned approximately 18.7% and 16.3% of the Master Fund, respectively. It is the Partnerships intention to continue to invest in the Master Fund. The performance of the Partnership is directly affected by the performance
of the Master Fund.  In July 2015, the General Partner delegated certain administrative functions to SS&C
Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation, currently doing business as SS&C GlobeOp (the Administrator). Pursuant to a master services agreement, the Administrator furnishes certain administrative, accounting, regulatory reporting,
tax and other services as agreed from time to time. In addition, the Administrator maintains certain books and records of the Partnership. The General Partner pays or reimburses the Partnership, from the General Partner fee it receives from the
Partnership, the ordinary administrative expenses of the Partnership. This includes the expenses related to the engagement of the Administrator. Therefore, the engagement of the Administrator did not impact the Partnerships break-even point.

Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: 
The accompanying financial statements and accompanying notes are unaudited but, in the opinion of the General Partner, include
all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the Partnerships financial condition at March 31, 2017 and the results of its operations and changes in partners capital for the
three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. These financial statements present the results of interim periods and do not include all of the disclosures normally provided in annual financial statements. These financial statements should be read
together with the financial statements and notes included in the Partnerships Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Form 10-K) filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) for the year ended December 31, 2016. The December 31, 2016 information has been derived from the audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016.
 Due to the nature of commodity trading, the results of operations for the interim periods presented should not be
considered indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year.  Use of Estimates. The preparation
of financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires the General Partner to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements and accompanying notes. As a result, actual results could differ from these estimates, and those
differences could be material.  Profit Allocation. The General Partner and each limited partner of the Partnership
share in the profits and losses of the Partnership in proportion to the amount of partnership interest owned by each except that no limited partner is liable for obligations of the Partnership in excess of its capital contributions and profits, if
any, net of distributions, redemptions and losses, if any.  Statement of Cash Flows. The Partnership has not
provided a Statement of Cash Flows, as permitted by Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 230, Statement of Cash Flows. The Statements of Changes in Partners Capital is included herein, and as of and for the
periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Partnership carried no debt and substantially all the Partnerships investments were carried at fair value and classified as Level 1 and Level 2 measurements. 
Partnerships Investment. The Partnership carries its investment in the Master Fund at fair value based on the
Master Funds net asset value as calculated by the Master Fund. The valuation of the Master Funds investments including the classification within the fair value hierarchy of the investments held by the Master Fund are described in
Note 6, Fair Value Measurements. The Master Fund does not isolate the portion of the results of operations arising from the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from fluctuations due to changes in market prices
of investments held. Such fluctuations are included in total trading results in the Master Funds Statements of Income and Expenses. 
Master Funds Investments. All Futures Interests of the Master Fund, including derivative financial instruments
and derivative commodity instruments, are held for trading purposes. The Futures Interests are recorded on trade date and open contracts are recorded at fair value (as described in Note 6, Fair Value Measurements) at the measurement
date. Investments in Futures Interests denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at the measurement date. Gains or losses are realized when contracts are liquidated. Unrealized gains or
losses on open contracts are included as a component of equity in trading account in the Master Funds Statements of Financial Condition. Net realized gains or losses and net change in unrealized gains or losses are included in the Master
Funds Statements of Income and Expenses.  The Master Fund does not isolate the portion of the results of operations
arising from the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from fluctuations due to changes in market prices of investments held. Such fluctuations are included in total trading results in the Partnerships Statements of Income
and Expenses.  Master Funds Cash. The Master Funds cash includes cash denominated in foreign currencies
of $(18) (cost of $25) and $(7) (cost of $36) as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.

Income Taxes. Income taxes have not been listed as each partner is
individually liable for the taxes, if any, on its share of the Partnerships income and expenses. The Partnership follows the guidance of ASC 740, Income Taxes, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement
attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Partnerships tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are
more-likely-than-not of being sustained when challenged or when examined by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions determined not to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or liability in the Partnerships Statements of Financial Condition for the current year. If a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory
threshold to avoid the incurring of penalties, an expense for the amount of the statutory penalty and interest, if applicable, shall be recognized in the Statements of Income and Expenses in the period in which the position is claimed or expected to
be claimed. The General Partner has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions that would require recognition in the financial statements. The Partnership files U.S. federal and various state and local tax returns. No income tax
returns are currently under examination. The 2013 through 2016 tax years remain subject to examination by U.S. federal and most state tax authorities. 
Investment Company Status. Effective January 1, 2014, the Partnership adopted Accounting Standards Update 2013-08, Financial Services  Investment Companies (Topic 946): Amendments to the Scope, Measurement and Disclosure Requirements and based on the General Partners assessment, the
Partnership has been deemed to be an investment company since inception. Accordingly, the Partnership follows the investment company accounting and reporting guidance of Topic 946 and reflects its investments at fair value with unrealized gains
and losses resulting from changes in fair value reflected in the Statements of Income and Expenses.  Net Income (Loss)
per Unit. Net income (loss) per Unit of limited partnership interest (Unit(s)) is calculated in accordance with ASC 946, Financial Services  Investment Companies. See Note 3, Financial
Highlights.  There have been no material changes with respect to the Partnerships critical accounting policies
as reported in the Partnerships Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Financial Instruments through the Partnerships Investment in the Master Fund: 
The Master Fund, and indirectly the Partnership, trades Futures Interests. Futures and forwards represent contracts for
delayed delivery of an instrument at a specified date and price. Futures Interests are open commitments until the settlement date, at which time they are realized. They are valued at fair value, generally on a daily basis, and the unrealized gains
and losses on open contracts (the difference between contract trade price and market price) are reported in the Statements of Financial Condition as net unrealized gain or loss on open contracts. The resulting net change in unrealized gains and
losses is reflected in Net change in unrealized gains (losses) on open contracts allocated from the Master Fund from one period to the next in the Statements of Income and Expenses. The Master Funds contracts are accounted for on a
trade-date basis. Gains or losses are realized when contracts are liquidated and are determined using the first-in, first-out method. Risk arises from changes in the
value of these contracts and the potential inability of counterparties to perform under the terms of the contracts. There are numerous factors which may significantly influence the fair value of these contracts, including interest rate volatility.
 The fair value of an exchange-traded contract is based on the settlement price quoted by the exchange on the day with
respect to which fair value is being determined. If an exchange-traded contract could not have been liquidated on such day due to the operation of daily limits or other rules of the exchange, the settlement price will be equal to the settlement
price on the first subsequent day on which the contract could be liquidated. 
  12 


Ceres Tactical Currency L.P. 
Notes to Financial Statements 
(Unaudited)   
The U.S. Treasury bills and Futures Interests traded by the Partnership,
indirectly through its investment in the Master Fund, involve varying degrees of related market risk. Market risk is often dependent upon changes in the level or volatility of interest rates, exchange rates, and prices of financial instruments and
commodities, factors that result in frequent changes in the fair value of the Partnerships open positions, and consequently in its earnings, whether realized or unrealized, and cash flow. Gains and losses on open positions of exchange-traded
futures, exchange-traded forward, and exchange-traded futures-styled option contracts are settled daily through variation margin. Gains and losses on non-exchange traded forward currency contracts are settled
upon termination of the contract. Gains and losses on non-exchange traded forward currency option contracts are settled on an agreed-upon settlement date. 
In the ordinary course of business, the Partnership, indirectly through its investment in the Master Fund, enters into
contracts and agreements that contain various representations and warranties and which provide general indemnifications. The Partnerships and Master Funds maximum exposure under these arrangements cannot be determined, as this could
include future claims that have not yet been made against the Partnership and the Master Fund. The Partnership and Master Fund consider the risk of any future obligation relating to these indemnifications to be remote. 
 


5.
Trading Activities:  The Partnerships objective, through its
investment in the Master Fund, is to profit from speculative trading in Futures Interests. Therefore, the Trading Advisor for the Master Fund will take speculative positions in Futures Interests where it feels the best profit opportunities exist for
its trading strategies. As such, the average number of contracts outstanding in absolute quantities (the total of the open long and open short positions) has been presented as a part of the volume disclosure, as position direction is not an
indicative factor in such volume disclosures. With regard to foreign currency forward trades, each notional quantity amount has been converted to an equivalent contract based upon an industry convention. 
All of the Futures Interests owned by the Master Fund are held for trading purposes. The monthly average notional values of
currency forward contracts traded by the Master Fund during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were $2,967,861,818 and $3,447,457,698, respectively.

In the event of default by the Master Fund, MS&Co., the Master Funds commodity futures broker and the sole counterparty to the Master Funds non-exchange traded
contracts, as applicable, has the right to offset the Master Funds obligation with the Master Funds cash and/or U.S. Treasury bills held by MS&Co., thereby minimizing MS&Co.s risk of loss. There is no collateral posted by
MS&Co. and as such, in the event of default by MS&Co., the Master Fund is exposed to the amount shown in the Master Funds Statements of Financial Condition. In the case of exchange-traded
contracts, the Master Funds exposure to counterparty risk may be reduced since the exchanges clearinghouse interposes its credit between buyer and seller and the clearinghouses guarantee fund may be available in the event of a
default.

Fair Value Measurements:  The Master Funds Fair Value
Measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The fair
value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to fair values derived from unobservable inputs (Level 3). The level in the fair
value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls shall be determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. 
The fair value of exchange-traded futures, options and forward contracts is determined by the various futures exchanges, and
reflects the settlement price for each contract as of the close of business on the last business day of the reporting period. The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is extrapolated on a forward basis from the spot prices quoted as of
approximately 3:00 P.M. (E.T.) on the last business day of the reporting period from various exchanges. The fair value of non-exchange-traded foreign currency option contracts is calculated by
applying an industry standard model application for options valuation of foreign currency options, using as input the spot prices, interest rates, and option implied volatilities quoted as of approximately 3:00 P.M. (E.T.) on the last
business day of the reporting period. U.S. Treasury bills are valued at the last available bid price received from independent pricing services as of the close of the last business day of the reporting period. 
The Master Fund considers prices for exchange-traded commodity futures, forward, swap and option contracts to be based on
unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1). The values of U.S. Treasury bills, non-exchange-traded forwards, swaps and certain option contracts for which market
quotations are not readily available are priced by broker-dealers or pricing services that derive fair values for those assets and liabilities from observable inputs (Level 2). As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 and for the
periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Master Fund did not hold any derivative instruments that were priced at fair value using unobservable inputs through the application of the General Partners assumptions and internal valuation
pricing models (Level 3). Transfers between levels are recognized at the end of the reporting period. During the reporting periods, there were no transfers of assets or liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2.

Subsequent Events:  The General Partner evaluates events that occur
after the balance sheet date but before and up until financial statements are issued. The General Partner has assessed the subsequent events through the date the financial statements were issued and has determined that there were no subsequent
events requiring adjustment to or disclosure in the financial statements. 
  17 


Item 2.     Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
The Partnership does not have, nor does it expect to have, any capital assets. The Partnership does not engage in sales of
goods or services. Its only assets are its investment in the Master Fund, interest receivable and cash. The Master Fund does not engage in sales of goods or services. The Master Funds only assets are its cash at bank, expense reimbursement and
equity in trading account, consisting of cash at MS&Co., cash margin, subscription receivable, expense reimbursements, net unrealized appreciation on open forward contracts, and investment in U.S. Treasury bills at fair value, if applicable.
Because of the low margin deposits normally required in commodity futures trading, relatively small price movements may result in substantial losses to the Partnership/Master Fund. While substantial losses could lead to a material decrease in
liquidity, no such illiquidity occurred in the first quarter of 2017.  The Master Funds investment in Futures
Interests may, from time to time, be illiquid. Most U.S. futures exchanges limit fluctuations in prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily price fluctuation limits or daily limits. Trades may not be
executed at prices beyond the daily limit. If the price for a particular futures or option contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in that futures or option contract can neither be taken nor liquidated
unless traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit. Futures prices have occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading. These market conditions could prevent the Master Fund from promptly
liquidating its futures or option contracts and result in restrictions on redemptions.  There is no limitation on daily
price movements in trading forward contracts on foreign currencies. The markets for some world currencies have low trading volume and are illiquid, which may prevent the Master Fund from trading in potentially profitable markets or prevent the
Master Fund from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions in such markets, subjecting it to substantial losses. Either of these market conditions could result in restrictions on redemptions. For the periods covered by this report, illiquidity has
not materially affected the Partnerships assets.  Other than the risks inherent in commodity futures, forward,
options, swaps and other derivatives trading and U.S. treasury bills and money market mutual fund securities, the Partnership knows of no trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties at the present time that are reasonably likely to result
in the Partnerships liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way.  The Partnerships capital consists
of the capital contributions, as increased or decreased by income (loss) from its investment in the Master Fund, expenses, interest income, redemptions of Units and distributions of profits, if any. 
For the three months ended March 31, 2017, Partnership capital decreased 0.2% from $9,094,995 to $9,075,434. This
decrease was attributable to redemptions of 81,475.844 Limited Partners Units totaling $755,467, coupled with a net income of $735,906 Future redemptions can impact the amount of funds available for investment in the Master Fund in subsequent
periods.  The Master Funds capital consists of the capital contributions of the partners as increased or decreased
by realized and/or unrealized gains or losses on trading, expenses, interest income, subscriptions, redemptions and distributions of profits, if any. 
Other than as discussed above, there are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, that would affect, nor any
expected material changes to, the Partnerships capital resource arrangements at the present time. 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 
The Partnership does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, nor does it have
contractual obligations or commercial commitments to make future payments, that would affect its liquidity or capital resources. 
  18 


Critical Accounting Policies 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the General Partner to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period. The General Partner
believes that the estimates and assumptions utilized in preparing the financial statements are reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Partnerships significant accounting policies are described in detail in Note 2,
Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the financial statements.  The
Partnership records all investments at fair value in their financial statements, with changes in fair value reported as a component of net realized gains (losses) and net change in unrealized trading gains (losses) in the Statements of Income and
Expenses.  Results of Operations 
General. Cambridge employs a series of systematic proprietary decision tools to identify trading opportunities in the
global currency markets. The process combines three types of trading strategies: a systematic technical strategy, a systematic fundamental strategy and a Market Information Strategy. These trading tools are utilized in a set of systematic strategies
which are combined into investment portfolios and are designed to perform across diverse market environments. The Systematic Fundamental Strategy is used in the Asian currency section of the Cambridge portfolios and reflects a predetermined set of
positions designed to reflect market views on the relative attractiveness of Asian currencies versus the US dollar. Assets are allocated to the Systematic Fundamental Strategy based on a proprietary measure of volatility in the global
currency markets (in highly volatile markets the allocation is reduced and when volatility is low the allocation is increased). The Market Information Strategy leverages the experience and global network of the portfolio managers to understand and
exploit the behavior of other market participants and to participate in hedging and investment flows. Cambridge believes that long run success is achieved through successful mitigation of downside returns with risk controlled at the portfolio,
strategy and individual trade levels.  The following presents a summary of the Partnerships operations for the three
months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, and a general discussion of its trading activities during each period. It is important to note, however, that the Trading Advisor trades in various markets at different times and that prior activity in a
particular market does not mean that such market will be actively traded by the Trading Advisor or will be profitable in the future. Consequently, the results of operations of the Partnership are difficult to discuss other than in the context of the
Trading Advisors trading activities on behalf of the Partnership during the period in question. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. 
The Partnerships results of operations set forth in the financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which
require the use of certain accounting policies that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements, including the following: the contracts the Partnership trades indirectly are accounted for on a trade-date basis and marked to market on a
daily basis. The difference between their original contract value and market value is recorded in the Statements of Income and Expenses as Net change in unrealized gains (losses) on open contracts allocated from the Master Fund on open
contracts, and recorded as Net realized gains (losses) on closed contracts allocated from the Master Fund, when open positions are closed out. The sum of these amounts constitutes the Partnerships trading results. The market value
of a futures contract is the settlement price on the exchange on which that futures contract is traded on a particular day. The value of a foreign currency forward contract is based on the spot rate as of approximately 3:00 P.M. (E.T.), the close of
the business day. Interest income, as well as management fees, incentive fees, General Partner fees and ongoing placement agent fees of the Partnership are recorded on an accrual basis. 
  19 


The General Partner believes that, based on the nature of the operations of the
Partnership, no assumptions relating to the application of critical accounting policies other than those presently used could reasonably affect reported amounts. 
During the Partnerships first quarter of 2017, the Partnerships net asset value per Unit increased 8.4% from $8.84
to $9.58 as compared to an increase of 4.3% during the first quarter of 2016. The Partnership through its investment in the Master Fund experienced a net trading gain before fees and expenses in the first quarter of 2017 of $842,119. Gains were
primarily attributable to the Master Funds trading in currencies. The Partnership, through its investment in the Master Fund, experienced a net trading gain before fees and expenses in the first quarter 2016 of $833,750. Gains were primarily
attributable to the Master Funds trading in currencies.  The most significant gains were experienced during March
from long positions in the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar as the relative value of the Indian rupee advanced after Prime Minister Narendra Modis resounding victory in state elections boosted expectations for a continuation of his reform
agenda. The Indian currency was boosted further amid speculation the Reserve Bank of India will not lower interest rates. Elsewhere, gains were experienced throughout the first quarter from long positions in the New Zealand dollar versus the U.S.
dollar as the relative value of the U.S. dollar moved lower amid increased uncertainty of future U.S. fiscal policy and warnings on the negative effect protectionist policies could have on the U.S. economy. Additional gains during the quarter were
recorded from positions in the Taiwan dollar and Russian ruble. A portion of the Partnerships gains for the quarter was offset by losses from positions in the Turkish lira, Japanese yen, and Mexican peso. 
  20 




Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  All
or substantially all of the Partnerships assets are subject to risk of trading loss through its investment in the Master Fund. The Partnership and the Master Fund are speculative commodity pools. The market sensitive instruments held by the
Master Fund are acquired for speculative trading purposes, and all or substantially all of the Partnerships assets are subject to the risk of trading loss through its investment in the Master Fund. Unlike an operating company, the risk of
market sensitive instruments is integral, not incidental, to the Partnerships and the Master Funds main line of business. 
The limited partners will not be liable for losses exceeding the current net asset value of their investment. 
Market movements result in frequent changes in the fair value of the Master Funds open positions and, consequently, in
its earnings and cash balances. The Master Funds market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors, including the level and volatility of interest rates, exchange rates, equity price levels, the market value of financial instruments and
contracts, the diversification effects of the Master Funds open contracts and the liquidity of the markets in which its trade. 
The Master Fund rapidly acquires and liquidates both long and short positions in a wide range of different markets.
Consequently, it is not possible to predict how a particular future market scenario will affect performance, and the Master Funds past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. 
Quantifying the Partnerships and the Master Funds Trading Value at Risk 
The following quantitative disclosures regarding the Partnerships and the Master Funds market risk exposures
contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor from civil liability provided for such statements by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (set forth in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the Securities Act), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)). All quantitative disclosures in this section are deemed to be forward-looking statements for
purposes of the safe harbor, except for statements of historical fact.  The Partnership and the Master Fund account for
open positions on the basis of fair value accounting principles. Any loss in the market value of the Partnerships and the Master Funds open positions are directly reflected in the Partnerships and the Master Funds earnings
and cash flow.  The Partnerships and the Master Funds risk exposure in the market sectors traded by the
Trading Advisor is estimated below in terms of Value at Risk. Please note that the Value at Risk model is used to numerically quantify market risk for historic reporting purposes only and is not utilized by either Ceres or the Trading Advisor in
their daily risk management activities.  Value at Risk is a measure of the maximum amount which the Master
Fund could reasonably be expected to lose in a given market sector. However, the inherent uncertainty of the Master Funds speculative trading and the recurrence in the markets traded by the Master Fund of market movements far exceeding
expectations could result in actual trading or non-trading losses far beyond the indicated Value at Risk or the Master Funds experience to date (i.e., risk of ruin). In light of the foregoing
as well as the risks and uncertainties intrinsic to all future projections, the inclusion of the quantification in this section should not be considered to constitute any assurance or representation that the Master Funds losses in any market
sector will be limited to Value at Risk or by the Master Funds attempts to manage its market risk.  Exchange margin
requirements have been used by the Master Fund as the measure of its Value at Risk. Margin requirements are set by exchanges to equal or exceed the maximum losses reasonably expected to be incurred in the fair value of any given contract in 95%-99% of any one-day interval. The margin levels are established by dealers and exchanges using historical price studies as well as an assessment of current market
volatility (including the implied volatility of the options on a given futures contract) and economic fundamentals to provide a probabilistic estimate of the maximum expected near-term one-day price
fluctuation. 
  21 


Value at Risk tables represent a probabilistic assessment of the risk of loss in
market risk sensitive instruments. The following tables indicate the trading Value at Risk associated with the Master Funds open positions by market category as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and the highest, lowest and

Item 4.
Controls and Procedures.  The Partnerships disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Partnership on the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods expected in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Partnership in the
reports it files is accumulated and communicated to management, including the President and Chief Financial Officer (the CFO) of the General Partner, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure and appropriate SEC
filings.  The General Partner is responsible for ensuring that there is an adequate and effective process for
establishing, maintaining and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures for the Partnerships external disclosures. 
The General Partners President and CFO have evaluated the effectiveness of the Partnerships disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of March 31, 2017, and, based on that evaluation, the General Partners
President and CFO have concluded that, at that date, the Partnerships disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
The Partnerships internal control over financial reporting is a process under the supervision of the General
Partners President and CFO to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These controls include policies and procedures that: 
 


 

 
 pertain to the maintenance of records, that in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Partnership; 
   


 

 
 provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and (ii) the Partnerships receipts are handled and expenditures are made only pursuant to authorizations of the General Partner; and 
   


 

 
 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection and correction of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the Partnerships assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
  There were no changes in the Partnerships internal control over financial
reporting process during the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2017 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Partnerships internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 


Item 1.
Legal Proceedings.  This section describes the major pending
legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, to which MS&Co. or its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of their property is subject. There are no material legal proceedings pending against the
Partnership or the General Partner.  On June 1, 2011, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated converted from a
Delaware corporation to a Delaware limited liability company. As a result of that conversion, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated is now named Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (MS&Co.). 
MS&Co. is a wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary of Morgan Stanley, a Delaware holding company. Morgan Stanley files periodic
reports with the SEC as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), which include current descriptions of material litigation and material proceedings and investigations, if any, by governmental and/or
regulatory agencies or self-regulatory organizations concerning Morgan Stanley and its subsidiaries, including MS&Co. As a consolidated subsidiary of Morgan Stanley, MS&Co. does not file its own periodic reports with the SEC that contain
descriptions of material litigation, proceedings and investigations. As a result, we refer you to the Legal Proceedings section of Morgan Stanleys SEC 10-K filings for 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, and 2012. In addition, MS&Co.
annually prepares an Audited Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition (Audited Financial Statement) that is publicly available on Morgan Stanleys website at www.morganstanley.com. We refer you to the Commitments,
Guarantees and ContingenciesContingenciesLegal section in MS&Co.s 2016 Audited Financial Statement. 
In addition to the matters described in those filings, in the normal course of business, each of Morgan Stanley and MS&Co.
has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions, and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global diversified financial services institution. Certain of the
legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. Each of Morgan Stanley and MS&Co. is also involved, from time to time, in investigations and proceedings by
governmental and/or regulatory agencies or self-regulatory organizations, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, fines or penalties. The number of these investigations and proceedings has increased in recent years with regard to many
financial services institutions, including Morgan Stanley and MS&Co.  MS&Co. is a Delaware limited liability
company with its main business office located at 1585 Broadway, New York, New York 10036. Among other registrations and memberships, MS&Co. is registered as a futures commission merchant and is a member of the National Futures Association. 
Regulatory and Governmental Matters  
MS&Co. has received subpoenas and requests for information from certain federal and state regulatory and governmental
entities, including among others various members of the RMBS Working Group of the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, such as the United States Department of Justice, Civil Division and several state Attorney Generals Offices, concerning
the origination, financing, purchase, securitization and servicing of subprime and non-subprime residential mortgages and related matters such as residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS), collateralized debt obligations
(CDOs), structured investment vehicles (SIVs) and credit default swaps backed by or referencing mortgage pass-through certificates. These matters, some of which are in advanced stages, include, but are not limited to,
investigations related to MS&Co.s due diligence on the loans that it purchased for securitization, MS&Co.s communications with ratings agencies, MS&Co.s disclosures to investors, and MS&Co.s handling of
servicing and foreclosure related issues.  On February 25, 2015, MS&Co. reached an agreement in principle with
the United States Department of Justice, Civil Division and the United States Attorneys Office for the Northern District of California, Civil Division (collectively, the Civil Division) to pay $2.6 billion to resolve certain
claims that the Civil Division indicated it intended to bring against MS&Co. That settlement was finalized on February 10, 2016. 
In October 2014, the Illinois Attorney Generals Office (ILAG) sent a letter to MS&Co. alleging that
MS&Co. knowingly made misrepresentations related to RMBS purchased by certain pension funds affiliated with the State of Illinois and demanding that MS&Co. pay ILAG approximately $88 million. MS&Co. and ILAG reached an agreement to
resolve the matter on February 10, 2016. 
  24 


On January 13, 2015, the New York Attorney Generals Office
(NYAG), which is also a member of the RMBS Working Group, indicated that it intended to file a lawsuit related to approximately 30 subprime securitizations sponsored by MS&Co. NYAG indicated that the lawsuit would allege that
MS&Co. misrepresented or omitted material information related to the due diligence, underwriting and valuation of the loans in the securitizations and the properties securing them and indicated that its lawsuit would be brought under the Martin
Act. MS&Co. and NYAG reached an agreement to resolve the matter on February 10, 2016.  On June 5, 2012,
MS&Co. consented to and became the subject of an Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 6(c) and 6(d) of the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions by The Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (CFTC) to resolve allegations related to the failure of a salesperson to comply with exchange rules that prohibit off-exchange futures transactions unless there is an Exchange for Related Position (EFRP). Specifically, the
CFTC found that from April 2008 through October 2009, MS&Co. violated Section 4c(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended (the CEA) and CFTC Regulation 1.38 by executing, processing and reporting numerous off-exchange
futures trades to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) as EFRPs in violation of CME and CBOT rules because those trades lacked the corresponding and related cash, OTC swap, OTC option, or
other OTC derivative position. In addition, the CFTC found that MS&Co. violated CFTC Regulation 166.3 by failing to supervise the handling of the trades at issue and failing to have adequate policies and procedures designed to detect and
deter the violations of the CEA and CFTC Regulations. Without admitting or denying the underlying allegations and without adjudication of any issue of law or fact, MS&Co. accepted and consented to entry of findings and the imposition of a cease
and desist order, a fine of $5,000,000, and undertakings related to public statements, cooperation and payment of the fine. MS&Co. entered into corresponding and related settlements with the CME and CBOT in which the CME found that MS&Co.
violated CME Rules 432.Q and 538 and fined MS&Co. $750,000 and CBOT found that MS&Co. violated CBOT Rules 432.Q and 538 and fined MS&Co. $1,000,000. 
On July 23, 2014, the SEC approved a settlement by MS&Co. and certain affiliates to resolve an investigation related
to certain subprime RMBS transactions sponsored and underwritten by those entities in 2007. Pursuant to the settlement, MS&Co. and certain affiliates were charged with violating Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the Securities Act), agreed to pay disgorgement and penalties in an amount of $275 million and neither admitted nor denied the SECs findings. 
On April 21, 2015, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Incorporated (CBOE) and the CBOE Futures Exchange, LLC
(CFE) filed statements of charges against MS&Co. in connection with trading by one of MS&Co.s former traders of EEM options contracts that allegedly disrupted the final settlement price of the November 2012 VXEM
futures. CBOE alleged that MS&Co. violated CBOE Rules 4.1, 4.2 and 4.7, Sections 9(a) and 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. CFE alleged that MS&Co. violated CFE Rules 608, 609 and 620. The
matters were resolved on June 28, 2016 without any findings of fraud.  On June 18, 2015, MS&Co. entered into
a settlement with the SEC and paid a fine of $500,000 as part of the MCDC Initiative to resolve allegations that MS&Co. failed to form a reasonable basis through adequate due diligence for believing the truthfulness of the assertions by issuers
and/or obligors regarding their compliance with previous continuing disclosure undertakings pursuant to Rule 15c2-12 in connection with offerings in which MS&Co. acted as senior or sole underwriter.
On August 6, 2015, MS&Co. consented to and became the subject of an order by the CFTC to resolve allegations that
MS&Co. violated CFTC Regulation 22.9(a) by failing to hold sufficient US Dollars in cleared swap segregated accounts in the United States to meet all US Dollar obligations to cleared swaps customers. Specifically, the CFTC found that while
MS&Co. at all times held sufficient funds in segregation to cover its obligations to its customers, on certain days during 2013 and 2014, it held currencies, such as euros, instead of US dollars, to meet its US dollar obligations. In addition,
the CFTC found that MS&Co. violated CFTC Regulation 166.3 by failing to have in place adequate procedures to ensure that it complied with CFTC Regulation 22.9(a). Without admitting or denying the findings or conclusions and without
adjudication of any issue of law or fact, MS&Co. accepted and consented to the entry of findings, the imposition of a cease and desist order, a civil monetary penalty of $300,000, and undertakings related to public statements, cooperation, and
payment of the monetary penalty. 
  25 


On December 20, 2016, MS&Co. consented to and became the subject of an
order by the SEC in connection with allegations that MS&Co. willfully violated Sections 15(c)(3) and 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and Rules 15c3-3(e), 17a-5(a), and 17a-5(d) thereunder, by inaccurately calculating its Reserve Account
requirement under Rule 15c3-3 by including margin loans to an affiliate in its calculations, which resulted in making inaccurate records and submitting inaccurate reports to the SEC. Without admitting or denying the underlying allegations and
without adjudication of any issue of law or fact, MS&Co. consented to a cease and desist order, a censure, and a civil monetary penalty of $7,500,000. 
Civil Litigation 
On July 15, 2010, China Development Industrial Bank (CDIB) filed a complaint against MS&Co., styled
China Development Industrial Bank v. Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated et al., which is pending in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County (Supreme Court of NY). The complaint relates to a
$275 million credit default swap referencing the super senior portion of the STACK 2006-1 CDO. The complaint asserts claims for common law fraud, fraudulent inducement and fraudulent concealment and alleges that MS&Co. misrepresented the
risks of the STACK 2006-1 CDO to CDIB, and that MS&Co. knew that the assets backing the CDO were of poor quality when it entered into the credit default swap with CDIB. The complaint seeks compensatory damages related to the approximately
$228 million that CDIB alleges it has already lost under the credit default swap, rescission of CDIBs obligation to pay an additional $12 million, punitive damages, equitable relief, fees and costs. On February 28, 2011,
the court denied MS&Co.s motion to dismiss the complaint. Based on currently available information, MS&Co. believes it could incur a loss of up to approximately $240 million plus pre- and post-judgment interest, fees and costs.
 On October 15, 2010, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago filed a complaint against MS&Co. and other
defendants in the Circuit Court of the State of Illinois, styled Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago v. Bank of America Funding Corporation et al. A corrected amended complaint was filed on April 8, 2011, which alleges that
defendants made untrue statements and material omissions in the sale to plaintiff of a number of mortgage pass-through certificates backed by securitization trusts containing residential mortgage loans and asserts claims under Illinois law. The
total amount of certificates allegedly sold to plaintiff by MS&Co. at issue in the action was approximately $203 million. The complaint seeks, among other things, to rescind the plaintiffs purchase of such certificates. The defendants
filed a motion to dismiss the corrected amended complaint on May 27, 2011, which was denied on September 19, 2012. On December 13, 2013, the court entered an order dismissing all claims related to one of the securitizations at issue.
After that dismissal, the remaining amount of certificates allegedly issued by MS&Co. or sold to plaintiff by MS&Co. was approximately $78 million. At December 25, 2016, the current unpaid balance of the mortgage pass-through
certificates at issue in this action was approximately $46 million, and the certificates had not yet incurred actual losses. Based on currently available information, MS&Co. believes it could incur a loss in this action up to the difference
between the $46 million unpaid balance of these certificates (plus any losses incurred) and their fair market value at the time of a judgment against MS&Co., plus pre- and post-judgment interest, fees and costs. MS&Co. may be entitled to be
indemnified for some of these losses and to an offset for interest received by the plaintiff prior to a judgment.  On
April 20, 2011, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston filed a complaint against MS&Co. and other defendants in the Superior Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts styled Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston v. Ally Financial, Inc. F/K/A
GMAC LLC et al. An amended complaint was filed on June 29, 2012 and alleges that defendants made untrue statements and material omissions in the sale to plaintiff of certain mortgage pass-through certificates backed by securitization trusts
containing residential mortgage loans. The total amount of certificates allegedly issued by MS&Co. or sold to plaintiff by MS&Co. was approximately $385 million. The amended complaint raises claims under the Massachusetts Uniform Securities
Act, the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act and common law and seeks, among other things, to rescind the plaintiffs purchase of such certificates. On May 26, 2011, defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the
District of Massachusetts. The defendants motions to dismiss the amended complaint were granted in part and denied in part on September 30, 2013. On November 25, 2013, July 16, 2014, and May 19, 2015, respectively, the
plaintiff voluntarily dismissed its claims against MS&Co. with respect to three of the securitizations at issue. After these voluntary dismissals, the remaining amount of certificates allegedly issued by MS&Co. or sold to plaintiff by
MS&Co. was approximately $332 million. At December 25, 2016, the current unpaid balance of the mortgage pass-through certificates at issue in this action was approximately $51 million, and the certificates had not yet incurred
actual losses. Based on currently available information, MS&Co. believes it could incur a loss in this action up to the difference between the $51 million unpaid balance of these certificates (plus any losses incurred) and their fair market
value at the time of a judgment against MS&Co., or upon sale, plus pre- and post-judgment interest, fees and costs. MS&Co. may be entitled to be indemnified for some of these losses and to an offset for interest received by the plaintiff
prior to a judgment.
  26 


On May 3, 2013, plaintiffs in Deutsche Zentral-Genossenschaftsbank AG et
al. v. Morgan Stanley et al. filed a complaint against MS&Co., certain affiliates, and other defendants in the Supreme Court of NY. The complaint alleges that defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions in the sale to
plaintiffs of certain mortgage pass-through certificates backed by securitization trusts containing residential mortgage loans. The total amount of certificates allegedly sponsored, underwritten and/or sold by MS&Co. to plaintiff currently at
issue in this action was approximately $644 million. The complaint alleges causes of action against MS&Co. for common law fraud, fraudulent concealment, aiding and abetting fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and rescission and seeks, among
other things, compensatory and punitive damages. On June 10, 2014, the court granted in part and denied in part MS&Co.s motion to dismiss the complaint. MS&Co. perfected its appeal from that decision on June 12, 2015. At
March 25, 2017, the current unpaid balance of the mortgage pass-through certificates at issue in this action was approximately $242 million, and the certificates had incurred actual losses of approximately $86 million. Based on
currently available information, MS&Co. believes it could incur a loss in this action up to the difference between the $242 million unpaid balance of these certificates (plus any losses incurred) and their fair market value at the time of a
judgment against MS&Co., or upon sale, plus pre- and post-judgment interest, fees and costs. MS&Co. may be entitled to be indemnified for some of these losses. 
On May 17, 2013, plaintiff in IKB International S.A. in Liquidation, et al. v. Morgan Stanley, et al. filed a
complaint against MS&Co. and certain affiliates in the Supreme Court of NY. The complaint alleges that defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions in the sale to plaintiff of certain mortgage pass-through certificates backed by
securitization trusts containing residential mortgage loans. The total amount of certificates allegedly sponsored, underwritten and/or sold by MS&Co. to plaintiff was approximately $132 million. The complaint alleges causes of action
against MS&Co. for common law fraud, fraudulent concealment, aiding and abetting fraud, and negligent misrepresentation, and seeks, among other things, compensatory and punitive damages. On October 29, 2014, the court granted in part and
denied in part MS&Co.s motion to dismiss. All claims regarding four certificates were dismissed. After these dismissals, the remaining amount of certificates allegedly issued by MS&Co. or sold to plaintiff by MS&Co. was
approximately $116 million. On August 26, 2015, MS&Co. perfected its appeal from the courts October 29, 2014 decision. On August 11, 2016, the Appellate Division, First Department affirmed the trial courts decision
denying in part MS&Co.s motion to dismiss the complaint. At December 25, 2016, the current unpaid balance of the mortgage pass-through certificates at issue in this action was approximately $25 million, and the certificates had
incurred actual losses of $58 million. Based on currently available information, MS&Co. believes it could incur a loss in this action up to the difference between the $25 million unpaid balance of these certificates (plus any losses
incurred) and their fair market value at the time of a judgment against MS&Co., or upon sale, plus pre- and post-judgment interest, fees and costs. MS&Co. may be entitled to be indemnified for some of these losses and to an offset for
interest received by the plaintiff prior to a judgment.  On April 1, 2016, the California Attorney Generals
Office filed an action against MS&Co. in California state court styled California v. Morgan Stanley, et al., on behalf of California investors, including the California Public Employees Retirement System and the California
Teachers Retirement System. The complaint alleges that MS&Co. made misrepresentations and omissions regarding residential mortgage-backed securities and notes issued by the Cheyne SIV, and asserts violations of the California False Claims
Act and other state laws and seeks treble damages, civil penalties, disgorgement, and injunctive relief. On September 30, 2016, the court granted MS&Co.s demurrer, with leave to replead. On October 21, 2016, the California
Attorney General filed an amended complaint. On January 25, 2017, the court denied MS&Co.s demurrer with respect to the amended complaint. 
Settled Civil Litigation 
On August 25, 2008, MS&Co. and two ratings agencies were named as defendants in a purported class action related to
securities issued by a structured investment vehicle called Cheyne Finance PLC and Cheyne Finance LLC (together, the Cheyne SIV). The case was styled Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, et al. v. Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc., et al.
The complaint alleged, among other things, that the ratings assigned to the securities issued by the Cheyne SIV were false and misleading, including because the ratings did not accurately reflect the risks associated with the subprime RMBS held by
the Cheyne SIV. The plaintiffs asserted allegations of aiding and abetting fraud and negligent misrepresentation relating to approximately $852 million of securities issued by the Cheyne SIV. On April 24, 2013, the parties reached an agreement
to settle the case, and on April 26, 2013, the court dismissed the action with prejudice.

complaint against MS&Co. and another defendant in the Superior Court of the State of Washington, styled Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle v. Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc., et al. The amended complaint, filed on September 28,
2010, alleges that defendants made untrue statements and material omissions in the sale to plaintiff of certain mortgage pass-through certificates backed by securitization trusts containing residential mortgage loans. The total amount of

Morgan Stanley/Ceres Managed
Futures Funds
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC (MSSB) through Morgan Stanley Wealth Management and Ceres Managed Futures, LLC, which are both owned and controlled by MSSB, market and manage the sale of the Morgan Stanley Spectrum Series of Managed Futures Funds. Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and Ceres Managed Futures, LLC acting as sponsor, general partner, manager, investment manager and investment advisor to pooled investment vehicles with portfolios of managed futures funds are marketed and sold to institutional and high-net-worth (HNW) investors through the MSSB Spectrum Series of Managed Futures Funds.
The rationale provided by Morgan Stanley’s financial advisors used to support its recommendation that investors allocate a portion of their portfolio in managed futures contracts, is to generate portfolio returns with greater returns on a risk-adjusted basis. The purported low correlation of managed futures funds with the overall securities markets provides superior results for an investment portfolio during “down markets” which smooth portfolio returns over time. Morgan Stanley financial advisors caution investors that they cannot “market-time” when to invest in managed futures funds which they argue makes investments in managed futures funds a permanent part of a buy-hold asset allocation strategy.
The Morgan Stanley Spectrum Series of managed futures funds invest in asset classes that include trading futures contracts in equity indices (i.e. developed and emerging markets), interest rates (i.e. U.S. Bonds, Eurodollar Bonds, Euro-Bund), commodities (i.e. energy, agriculture and metals) and currencies (i.e. Dollar, Euro, Pound, Yen). Through investments in managed futures funds, investors are allegedly able to access invests in non-traditional asset classes that have a low correlation with traditional equity and fixed income securities markets resulting an overall increase in investment returns on a risk-adjusted basis.
At issue for investors is the performance of Morgan Stanley’s managed futures funds after the management fees have been deducted from the account. In most instances, investment advisors are compensated by a flat management fee based on assets under management. Additionally, an “incentive-based” fee is deducted based on profits in “up” years. This “performance-based” fee is usually paid net of all fees. In addition to management and performance fees, a managed futures account has deducted from the balance expenses for transactions costs and commissions. The net result for investors has been the loss of trading profits from a poorly-explained regime of excessive fees and conflicts of interest designed to enrich Morgan Stanley.
The Morgan Stanley Spectrum Series of managed futures funds are privately-placed and are sold to institutions and high-net-worth investors. Morgan Stanley Wealth Management offers various managed futures funds, including:

Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Strategic L.P.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Technical L.P.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Currency and Commodity L.P.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Global Balanced L.P.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Strategic L.P.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Select L.P.
Polaris Futures Fund L.P.
Meritage Futures Fund L.P.
LV Futures Fund L.P.
Managed Futures Premier BHM, L.P.
Managed Futures Premier Graham L.P.
Managed Futures Premier Aventis II L.P.
Managed Futures Premier Warrington L.P.

Silver Law Group is currently investigating whether Morgan Stanley Spectrum Series of managed futures funds managed by Ceres Managed Futures, LLC are in compliance with the securities industry’s rules and regulations concerning the suitability and disclosure requirements related to the risks, fees and terms associated with the management of their managed futures funds. The focus of the investigation includes whether the fees and terms were adequately disclosed to investors for potential FINRA sales practice violations of misrepresentation or omission of material facts, and excessive markups and markdowns, and whether the recommendations made to investors resulted in unsuitable investment advice based on client investment ability to understand and assume the risks associated with managed futures funds.
