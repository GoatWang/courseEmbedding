Robert Agdern Elected to Tronox Incorporated Board of Directors



Published on 2006-05-24. Author :
SpecialChem













 OKLAHOMA CITY -- Robert D. Agdern has been elected to
the Tronox Incorporated (NYSE: TRX - News, TRX.B - News) board of directors,
effective May 19, 2006.
Agdern, founder of Value Negotiation, a consulting business
that provides training for negotiators, has more than 30 years of experience
in corporate law, with expertise in the areas of chemical, international,
and mergers and acquisitions law. Prior to forming his consulting firm
in 2002, Agdern served as deputy general counsel responsible for western
hemisphere matters for BP PLC from 1999 to 2001.
He began his career as an attorney for Standard Oil Company
of Indiana in 1975. In 1978, he was named senior attorney for Amoco Chemical
Europe. With Amoco, he held various positions of increasing responsibility,
including assistant general counsel and associate general counsel responsible
for corporate, chemical, and refining and marketing matters and special
assignments. In his positions with Amoco and BP, he played a key role
in negotiating the sale of Amoco to British Petroleum and led the Federal
Trade Commission negotiations to clear BP's acquisition of ARCO.
Agdern, 56, holds a bachelor of science degree in engineering
from the University of Michigan and a juris doctor from George Washington
University. He serves on the Advisory and Executive Committee of the Dispute
Resolution Research Center at the Kellogg Graduate School of Business,
Northwestern University.
Headquartered in Oklahoma City, Tronox is the world's
third-largest producer and marketer of titanium dioxide pigment, with
an annual production capacity of 624,000 tonnes. Titanium dioxide pigment
is an inorganic white pigment used in paint, coatings, plastics, paper
and many other everyday products. The company's five pigment plants, which
are located in the United States, Australia, Germany and the Netherlands,
supply high-performance products to more than 1,100 customers in approximately
100 countries. In addition, Tronox produces electrolytic products, including
sodium chlorate, electrolytic manganese dioxide, boron trichloride, elemental
boron and lithium manganese oxide.
