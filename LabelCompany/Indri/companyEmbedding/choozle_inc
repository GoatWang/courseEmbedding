With so many DSPs to choose from, we liked Choozle's platform because it felt right for small to mid-sized agencies. Support is helpful and I actually liked how you are required to watch the "Choozle Academy" videos before you can contact support. Since we run a lot of B2B programs, the IP targeting is a nice feature when we are running Account Based campaigns.What do you dislike?Choozle does not currently have the functionality to bulk upload ad creatives.. This can be cumbersome when uploading a large number of ads at once. It also does not have the level of optimization options for the user that larger DSPs, like the TradeDesk, offer.What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?Choozle allows us to sell display advertising to our clients. As a digital marketing agency, programmatic display is almost a must-have. We have seen the benefit of adding display as a complement to our other campaigns, such as SEO, paid search, content syndication, social advertising, etc.Read MoreShare on20 of 0 found this helpful.Helpful?YesNo0 CommentsAdd a CommentAdd a CommentRespond as ChoozleReport a ConcernJohnathan M.Review SourceJohnathan M.Validated ReviewReview SourceGreat product as a "starter" DSPUpdated On February  8, 2017Validated ReviewWhat do you like best?If you are new to programmatic display ads then Choozle is a good place to start, especially if you want to test the waters with a low budget. I appreciated how easy it was to implement their tag and get going quickly with my initial campaign. You can get up-and-running in an hour, including the length of time it takes to work through their on-boarding documentation. What do you dislike?Analytics seem somewhat limited, although you can upgrade your account for deeper analytics info. Customer service was prompt, although sometimes a little confusing. Recommendations to others considering the productTry it if you're interested in deciding if programmatic display advertising is right for you. What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?We wanted to try out programmatic display advertising for the first time. We wanted to use a limited "test" budget before going all-in. Choozle was a good platform to do exactly that. We have since moved on to a more robust platform that offers more in the way of analytics and has a more intuitive interface.

Everything about the platform seems intuitive. You can literally start a campaign in minutes and begin serving ads immediately..What do you dislike?The only thing I really disliked was the inability to directly integrate data from the Insights to build an audience to a live campaign 100% of the time. When it worked is was glorious but many of the Insights data sets were not directly available to build an audience and required manually searching the catalog for similar matches. Small dislike but a dislike nonetheless.Recommendations to others considering the productI would recommend at least trying a small campaign with Choozle so you can introduce yourself to the product. It is very simple to use but there are small idiosyncrasies that separate this platform from others in a positive way. Once you have a handle on them you will be able to be very successful with this platform.What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?Basically being able to effectively run an effective programmatic solution that doesn't require days to set up and implement. You literally just collect your targets, creative, and budget and let her rip!Read MoreShare on0 of 0 found this helpful.Helpful?YesNo0 CommentsAdd a CommentAdd a CommentRespond as ChoozleReport a ConcernGalen D.Review SourceGalen D.Validated ReviewReview SourceChoozle is a great all around Programmatic PlatformUpdated On November  2, 2016Validated ReviewWhat do you like best?It's a very well rounded platform that gives us everything that we need, but it's also really simple to get started on. No minimum budgets means that it's a great platform for brands that want to test the waters before going all in. They are doing a great job evolving the product to add relevant capabilities in a timely way. The educational resources are great and getting better and the sales and support team are fantastic!What do you dislike?As other people noted the way that campaigns are billed ahead of time. The only thing I worry about is that it feels a bit like there's a cash management crunch, which if you are scaling on this platform might be a little worrisome. It's just something that you have to manage yourself between how you are billed and how you bill your own clients.What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?The datasets are super-pro, the data brands are top notch and the ability to reach very tight audiences is important to us.Read MoreShare on0 of 0 found this helpful.Helpful?YesNo0 CommentsAdd a CommentAdd a CommentRespond as ChoozleReport a ConcernLoni W.Review SourceLoni W.Validated ReviewVerified Current UserReview SourcePowerful, Easy To Use Digital Advertising Platform for Small & Medium BusinessesUpdated On May 31, 2017Validated ReviewVerified Current UserWhat do you like best?We use Choozle for our small to medium sized business clients. It delivers the same data sets and capabilities as the trade desk and other DSP's, but it is incredibly easy to use, and has a price point that is acceptable for nearly any business. We also love Michael Fischer and the sales and customers service team. They are top notch!"What do you dislike?Having to upload individual banner art files. Also that there is no map function for selecting target geography. What business problems are you solving with the product?

It is very intuitive and all you need to do is find the right data sets, drag, and drop into the audience field for creation. You do not need to assemble audiences from scratch like you do in some platforms, and have more control over your spend.What do you dislike?That you need to pay so much more money for Insights detailed performance information to help optimize your audiences. What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?Benefits are still pending as we wait for the complete and detailed report showing all the Tail Aggregate information. We are trying to solve the issue being able to highly target and focus our ad spend on putting our static image ads in front of decision makers on prominent websites using the data points from several sources to build our specific target audiences.Read MoreShare on0 of 0 found this helpful.Helpful?YesNo0 CommentsAdd a CommentAdd a CommentRespond as ChoozleReport a Concern1 2 3 4 5 Next › Last » Learning about Choozle?We can help you find the solution that fits you best.Chat with a G2 advisor* We monitor all Choozle reviews to prevent fraudulent reviews and keep review quality high.
