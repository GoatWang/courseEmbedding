About Arrowhead
Target the Gene
Silence the Disease







Overview
Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals develops medicines that treat intractable diseases by silencing the genes that cause them. Using a broad portfolio of RNA chemistries and efficient modes of delivery, Arrowhead therapies trigger the RNA interference mechanism to induce rapid, deep and durable knockdown of target genes. RNA interference, or RNAi, is a mechanism present in living cells that inhibits the expression of a specific gene, thereby affecting the production of a specific protein. Arrowhead’s RNAi-based therapeutics leverage this natural pathway of gene silencing.




Pipeline Development Strategy
Arrowhead is focused on developing innovative drugs for diseases with a genetic basis, characterized by the overproduction of one or more proteins. The depth and versatility of our RNAi technologies enable us to address conditions in virtually any therapeutic area and pursue disease targets that are not otherwise druggable by small molecules and biologics.




Leadership
Arrowhead has built an experienced team of leaders that foster a culture of innovation and have a proven ability to advance development programs from idea stage into commercial pharmaceutical products.

Here's Why Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Inc. Is Being Obliterated Today
Shares collapsed after the company announced that it will discontinue development of some of its most promising product candidates.











                Brian Feroldi
            

                (TMFTypeoh)

What happened
It is a rough day to be an investor in Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ARWR). Shares of the clinical-stage biotech are collapsing, falling more than 65% as of 11:36 a.m. EST on Tuesday in response to the news that the company is abandoning clinical development of several of its late-stage compounds.
So what
Arrowhead announced today that it will discontinue development of ARC-520, ARC-521, and ARC-AAT, which are three of its most promising clinical-stage drugs. In addition, management has decided to reduce its workforce by approximately 30%.
This decision was made mostly in response to the clinical hold that was placed on Arrowhead's Heparc-2004 study, which was researching the company's lead compound ARC-520 as a potential cure for hepatitis B. Arrowhead had previously disclosed that the FDA had ordered the clinical hold so the company could answer liver toxicology questions related to EX1, the company's intravenously administered delivery vehicle, which is used with ARC-520, ARC-521, and ARC-AAT.
Management announced on Wednesday that gathering all of the clinical data to alleviate the FDA's concerns over EX1 would take at least 18 months, and even then there wouldn't be a guarantee of success. Instead of waiting and potentially wasting resources, management felt the prudent decision was to discontinue development of the drugs and refocus the company's efforts on its other clinical programs.





Now what
There's no doubt that this news blows a hole in the bull case for the stock. ARC-520, in particular, held promise to potentially cure patients of hepatitis B, which is a disease that afflicts roughly 350 million people globally. If Arrowhead could have brought it across the finish line it could have easily turned into a blockbuster, so it is painful to see the company abandoning it now.
Looking ahead, Arrowhead plans on throwing all of its might behind its preclinical subcutaneous and extrahepatic programs. Included in this list are the drugs ARC-LPA and ARC-AMG1, both of which are partnered with the biotech giant Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN).
After accounting for the layoffs and recent payments from Amgen, Arrowhead expects to have enough capital to keep its doors open into 2019. That should be enough time for the company to make some progress on its other programs, and provide clinical data that could get its stock moving back in the right direction.
Regardless, Arrowhead was already a high-risk stock, and today's news raises the company's risk profile even more. I, for one, now plan on keeping far away from this once-promising company.

Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals is a publicly traded (NASDAQ: ARWR) biopharmaceutical company based in Pasadena, California. Arrowhead’s products in development act through RNA interference (RNAi) mechanisms of action.[1][2] The company focuses on treatments for Hepatitis B,the liver disease associated with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) and cardiovascular disease.[1] The company has six products in its pipeline, in various stages of development.[1]
