At the heart of every retirement is a common goal. You want your money to work as hard for you as you have for it. At CG Financial Services, we understand that drive for the dream.

You’re working for the peace of mind to take a well-deserved break. The confidence to enjoy the true pleasures of life: clowning with the grandkids, finally seeing the Grand Canyon, hitting the links every day or truly relaxing for the first time ever.
Taking that vision beyond retirement planning, we’re looking at the big picture to encompass everything impacting your financial future: health & life insurance, long term care planning, tax planning, education planning, asset management and finally, estate planning.
We share your goals, dreams and passions, truly partnering with you to help you live the way you want to. It’s a dynamic, evolving process, and one of constant re-evaluation.

Retirement Planning




Planning for retirement is no easy task and can be very stressful for many.  Many people are unsure if they have saved enough or if Social Security will be there for them.  As you near retirement, how much risk should you be taking with your investments?  At CG Financial, we analyze all these factors and many more, which simulate various market conditions going back to 1926.  This provides peace of mind knowing that if we go through a recession, you will not have to change your goals or go back to work.  
BudgetAs you prepare for retirement you will need to start thinking about how much you want to spend in retirement. Many people plan to maintain their current standard of living, while other individuals desire to spend more. While others plan to live on less in order to retire early and reduce stress. No matter what lifestyle you want to live, a detailed plan is necessary.
Income PlanningYou spend most of your working career accumulating assets, but have little experience withdrawing income from your nest egg in a sustainable, tax efficient manner. Once your retirement plan is developed, we help you determine where you will draw income from. We work closely with you to develop a strategy in which your monthly income matches your monthly expenses and when emergencies arise they can taken care of quickly.

Tax Planning




When it’s time to retire, the tax man may bring a harsh reality to the newest chapter of your life — unless you have a plan.
That’s where CG Financial Services comes in, with in-house tax and accounting professionals. We’ll work closely with you or your current tax consultant to help maximize your retirement and minimize the tax implications.
Virtually every aspect of your retirement strategy has tax implications, from social security to pension and annuities to 401(k) and IRA distribution. We’ll help you review your options, including tax-exempt and tax-deferred alternatives, understand your tax liabilities and project the value of your estate.
Understanding what’s happening now doesn’t mean you’re ready for later. Both current and long-term projections and strategies are critical for retirement.
Our advisors will partner with you to explore time-tested strategies for tax reduction, including options like maximizing standard deductions and exemptions or accelerating retirement distribution with excess deductions. test

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.
