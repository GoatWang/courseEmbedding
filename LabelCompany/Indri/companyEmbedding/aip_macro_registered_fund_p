Investment Approach

											AIP Macro Registered Fund P, through its investment in its master fund, AIP Macro Registered Fund A ("MRF A"), invests substantially all of its assets in private investment funds (commonly referred to as hedge funds) that are managed by a select group of alternative investment managers that employ global macro investment strategies. Global macro strategies, like other types of alternative investment strategies, allow investment managers the flexibility to use leveraged or short-sale positions to take advantage of perceived inefficiencies across the global capital markets.

							Past performance is not indicative of future results.
							
							
								
									
								
								
								
								
									Growth of investment performance is since the Fund's inception date, based on the net of fees return experience of the Fund. Fund net return is unaudited and subject to change and represents the total return for the month based on information received from underlying managers. The return is equal to the change in value of the Fund, including capital appreciation and income, as a percentage of the beginning value. The amount earned is the difference between the beginning and ending values, adjusted for the net of all contributions and withdrawals (cash flow). The rate of return is calculated on a time-weighted basis for all investments and is net of 1) underlying manager fees;  2) broker commissions and expenses related to trading and the administration of the underlying managers' funds and the Fund; 3) the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains; 4) the 1.00% per annum management fee (1.25% prior to May 1, 2005); 5) the Fund's 0.75% (0.85% prior to May 1, 2015) per annum shareholder servicing fee; and 6) operating expenses. Performance links monthly performance through compound multiplication. Results are hypothetical.

Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the AIP Macro Registered Fund A and the AIP Macro Registered Fund P, as applicable, carefully before investing. The prospectus for each AIP Macro Registered Fund contains this and other information about the relevant AIP Macro Registered Fund and can be obtained by contacting your financial advisor. Please read the prospectus of the relevant AIP Macro Registered Fund carefully before investing.
AIP Macro Registered Fund A and AIP Macro Registered Fund P are Delaware statutory trusts that issue shares.
Morgan Stanley does not provide tax advice. The tax information contained herein is general and is not exhaustive by nature. It was not intended or written to be used, and it cannot be used by any taxpayer, for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may be imposed on the taxpayer under U.S. federal tax laws. Federal and state tax laws are complex and constantly changing. Your clients should always consult their own legal or tax advisor for information concerning their individual situations.
Morgan Stanley Distribution, Inc. is a principal underwriter of the Funds. Morgan Stanley is a full-service securities firm engaged in securities trading and brokerage activities, investment banking, research and analysis, financing and financial advisory services.
Past performance is not indicative of future returns.
Risk Considerations
Alternative investments, like the AIP Macro Registered Fund A and the AIP Macro Registered Fund P, are speculative and include a high degree of risk.
Investors could lose all or a substantial amount of their investment. The AIP Macro Registered Fund is suitable only for long-term investors willing to forgo liquidity and put capital at risk for an indefinite period of time. The AIP Macro Registered Fund is highly illiquid - there is no secondary market for the shares of the AIP Macro Registered Fund, and there are restrictions on assigning or otherwise transferring interests in the AIP Macro Registered Fund. The AIP Macro Registered Fund's shares are not readily marketable and liquidity is provided only through expected quarterly repurchase offers. The AIP Macro Registered Fund has higher fees and expenses than other investment vehicles, and such fees and expenses will lower the returns achieved by investors. Funds of funds often have a higher fee structure than single manager funds as a result of the additional layer of fees. The underlying funds in which the AIP Macro Registered Fund invests (the "Underlying Funds") often engage in leverage and other speculative practices that may increase volatility and risk of loss. The Underlying Funds are often unregulated, are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds, and are not required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors.
See Risk Factors and Other Considerations for important disclosures. Investment in the Fund involves a high degree of risk and is suitable only for investors who can bear the risks associated with limited liquidity and therefore should be viewed as a long-term investment. For a complete description of terms and conditions, fees and other expenses, see the Fund's prospectus.

The Fund is offering shares solely pursuant to its prospectus, and any information regarding the Fund or shares in the Fund that is not contained in the relevant prospectus shall not constitute an offering of shares in the Fund. Consequently, this material has been prepared solely for informational purposes and is not an offer, or a solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell shares of the Funds or any other security or instrument or to participate in any trading strategy. No person or entity has been authorized in connection with this offering to give any information or make any representations other than as contained in the prospectus or in this marketing material. This does not constitute an offer to, or solicitation of, such person or entity.
Fund net return is unaudited and subject to change and represents the total return for the month based on information received from underlying managers. The return is equal to the change in value of the Fund, including capital appreciation and income, as a percentage of the beginning value. The amount earned is the difference between the beginning and ending values, adjusted for the net of all contributions and withdrawals (cash flow). The rate of return is calculated on a time-weighted basis for all investments and is net of 1) Macro Registered Fund A's underlying manager fees; 2) broker commissions and expenses related to trading and the administration of Macro Registered Fund A's underlying managers' funds; 3) the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains; 4) the 1.00% (1.25% prior to May 1, 2015) per annum management fee; 5) the Fund's 0.75% (0.85% prior to May 1, 2015) per annum shareholder servicing fee; and 6) operating expenses.
a In parallel with MRF A, subject to authorization by Board of Trustees, generally in an amount up to 15% of NAV of MRF A.
b The Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses include the operating expenses (1.81%), trading expenses (1.34%) and performance-based incentive fees of the Investment Funds in which the Master Fund was invested (1.49%) for the period ended December 31, 2016. The operating expenses consist of management fees, administration fees, professional fees (i.e., audit and legal fees), and other operating expenses. Trading expenses are primarily interest and dividend expenses and are the byproduct of leveraging or hedging activities employed by the Investment Managers in order to enhance the Investment Funds’ returns. The information used to determine the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses is generally based on the most recent shareholder reports received from the respective Investment Funds or, when not available, from the most recent communication from the Investment Funds. The agreements related to investments in Investment Funds provide for compensation to the Investment Funds’ managers/general partners in the form of management fees generally ranging from 1.0% to 3.0% annually of net assets and performance incentive allocations generally ranging from 10% to 30% of net profits earned. Some Investment Funds employ a pass-through expense arrangement with no stated management fee. Fees and expenses of Investment Funds are based on historical fees and expenses. Future Investment Funds’ fees and expenses may be substantially higher or lower because certain fees are based on the performance of the Investment Funds, which may fluctuate over time.
c The Net Annual Fund Fees and Expenses include the Fund’s Management Fee (1.00%), Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses (3.64%), Interest Payments on Borrowed Funds (0.01%) and Other Expenses (1.65%), which include professional fees and other expenses, including, without limitation, the Fund’s Distribution and Shareholder Servicing Fee, that the Fund will bear directly and indirectly through the Master Fund, less a Fee Waiver and Expense Reimbursement (-0.40%).  The Adviser has agreed to waive and/or reimburse the Fund’s expenses (other than Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses and extraordinary expenses and the following investment related expenses: foreign country tax expense and interest expense on amounts borrowed by the Fund) to the extent necessary in order to cap total annual fund expenses at 2.25% until the termination of the Fund’s investment advisory agreement. The Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses are not subject to this expense cap.

  WAM is the weighted average maturity of the portfolio. The WAM calculation utilizes the interest-rate reset date, rather than a security's stated final maturity, for variable- and floating- rate securities. By looking to a portfolio's interest rate reset schedule in lieu of final maturity dates, the WAM measure effectively captures a fund's exposure to interest rate movements and the potential price impact resulting from interest rate movements.
 


  WAL is the weighted average life of the portfolio. The WAL calculation utilizes a security's stated final maturity date or, when relevant, the date of the next demand feature when the fund may receive payment of principal and interest (such as a put feature). Accordingly, WAL reflects how a portfolio would react to deteriorating credit (widening spreads) or tightening liquidity conditions.
 


  Tracking error and information ratio are calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index (added October 2, 2013), as this is a better representation of the Portfolio's global multi-asset strategy. The investment team manages the Portfolio relative to this Blended Index.
 


  Excess return versus Custom Benchmark is calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index based on the period since it was added as a benchmark on October 2, 2013.
 


  NTM = Next Twelve Months
 


  LTM = Last Twelve Months
 


  Because the Portfolio had not commenced operations as of the most recent fiscal year end, no portfolio turnover rate is available for the Portfolio.
 


  The Reorganization occurred on January 6, 2015. The inception date reflects the inception date of the Private Fund.
 


  Global equities is represented by the MSCI All Country World Index.
 


  Net exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)-(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV)
 


  Gross exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)+(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV).
 


  Fixed income net and gross exposure is duration adjusted (U.S. Treasury 10-Year equivalents)
 


  Security ratings disclosed above have been obtained from Standard & Poor's Ratings Group ("S&P"). S&P's credit ratings express its opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer to meet its financial obligations in full and on time.'AAA' is the highest rating. Any rating below 'BBB-' rating 
		is considered non-investment grade. Ratings are relative and subjective and are not absolute standards of quality. Ratings apply only to the underlying holdings of the portfolio and does not remove market risk.
		"NR" or "Not Rated" indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that S&P does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy. Futures are not rated.

Investment Approach

											AIP Macro Registered Fund A invests substantially all of its assets in private investment funds (commonly referred to as hedge funds) that are managed by a select group of alternative investment managers that employ global macro investment strategies. Global macro strategies, like other types of alternative investment strategies, allow investment managers the flexibility to use leveraged or short-sale positions to take advantage of perceived inefficiencies across the global capital markets.

							Past performance is not indicative of future results.
							
							
								
									
								
								
								
									Growth of investment performance is since the Fund's inception date, based on the net of fees return experience of the Fund. Fund net return is unaudited and subject to change and represents the total return for the month based on information received from underlying managers. The return is equal to the change in value of the Fund, including capital appreciation and income, as a percentage of the beginning value. The amount earned is the difference between the beginning and ending values, adjusted for the net of all contributions and withdrawals (cash flow). The rate of return is calculated on a time-weighted basis for all investments and is net of 1) underlying manager fees;  2) broker commissions and expenses related to trading and the administration of the underlying managers' funds and the Fund; 3) the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains; 4) the 1.00% per annum management fee (1.25% prior to May 1, 2005); and 5) operating expenses. Performance links monthly performance through compound multiplication. Results are hypothetical.

Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the AIP Macro Registered Fund A and the AIP Macro Registered Fund P, as applicable, carefully before investing. The prospectus for each AIP Macro Registered Fund contains this and other information about the relevant AIP Macro Registered Fund and can be obtained by contacting your financial advisor. Please read the prospectus of the relevant AIP Macro Registered Fund carefully before investing.
AIP Macro Registered Fund A and AIP Macro Registered Fund P are Delaware statutory trusts that issue shares.
Morgan Stanley does not provide tax advice. The tax information contained herein is general and is not exhaustive by nature. It was not intended or written to be used, and it cannot be used by any taxpayer, for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may be imposed on the taxpayer under U.S. federal tax laws. Federal and state tax laws are complex and constantly changing. Your clients should always consult their own legal or tax advisor for information concerning their individual situations.
Morgan Stanley Distribution, Inc. is a principal underwriter of the Funds. Morgan Stanley is a full-service securities firm engaged in securities trading and brokerage activities, investment banking, research and analysis, financing and financial advisory services.
Past performance is not indicative of future returns.
Risk Considerations
Alternative investments, like the AIP Macro Registered Fund A and the AIP Macro Registered Fund P, are speculative and include a high degree of risk.
Investors could lose all or a substantial amount of their investment. The AIP Macro Registered Fund is suitable only for long-term investors willing to forgo liquidity and put capital at risk for an indefinite period of time. The AIP Macro Registered Fund is highly illiquid - there is no secondary market for the shares of the AIP Macro Registered Fund, and there are restrictions on assigning or otherwise transferring interests in the AIP Macro Registered Fund. The AIP Macro Registered Fund's shares are not readily marketable and liquidity is provided only through expected quarterly repurchase offers. The AIP Macro Registered Fund has higher fees and expenses than other investment vehicles, and such fees and expenses will lower the returns achieved by investors. Funds of funds often have a higher fee structure than single manager funds as a result of the additional layer of fees. The underlying funds in which the AIP Macro Registered Fund invests (the "Underlying Funds") often engage in leverage and other speculative practices that may increase volatility and risk of loss. The Underlying Funds are often unregulated, are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds, and are not required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors.
See Risk Factors and Other Considerations for important disclosures. Investment in the Fund involves a high degree of risk and is suitable only for investors who can bear the risks associated with limited liquidity and therefore should be viewed as a long-term investment. For a complete description of terms and conditions, fees and other expenses, see the Fund's prospectus.
The Fund is offering shares solely pursuant to its prospectus, and any information regarding the Fund or shares in the Fund that is not contained in the relevant prospectus shall not constitute an offering of shares in the Fund. Consequently, this material has been prepared solely for informational purposes and is not an offer, or a solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell shares of the Funds or any other security or instrument or to participate in any trading strategy. No person or entity has been authorized in connection with this offering to give any information or make any representations other than as contained in the prospectus or in this marketing material. This does not constitute an offer to, or solicitation of, such person or entity.
Benchmark/Index Descriptions
Data provided under the "Financial Indices" sections reflect the most recent data available as of the date this report was produced and is sourced from Bloomberg.
Fund net return is unaudited and subject to change and represents the total return for the month based on information received from underlying managers. The return is equal to the change in value of the Fund, including capital appreciation and income, as a percentage of the beginning value. The amount earned is the difference between the beginning and ending values, adjusted for the net of all contributions and withdrawals (cash flow). The rate of return is calculated on a time-weighted basis for all investments and is net of 1) underlying manager fees; 2) broker commissions and expenses related to trading and the administration of the Fund's underlying managers' funds; 3) the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains; 4) the 1.00% (1.25% prior to May 1, 2015) per annum management fee; and 5) operating expenses.
a Subject to authorization by Board of Trustees, generally in an amount up to 15% of NAV.
b The Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses include the operating expenses (1.81%), trading expenses (1.34%) and performance-based incentive fees of the Investment Funds in which the Fund was invested (0.49%) for the period ended December 31, 2016. The operating expenses consist of management fees, administration fees, professional fees (i.e., audit and legal fees), and other operating expenses. Trading expenses are primarily interest and dividend expenses and are the byproduct of leveraging or hedging activities employed by the Investment Managers in order to enhance the Investment Funds’ returns. The information used to determine the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses is generally based on the most recent shareholder reports received from the respective Investment Funds or, when not available, from the most recent communication from the Investment Funds. The agreements related to investments in Investment Funds provide for compensation to the Investment Funds’ managers/general partners in the form of management fees generally ranging from 1.0% to 3.0% annually of net assets and performance incentive allocations generally ranging from 10% to 30% of net profits earned. Some Investment Funds employ a pass-through expense arrangement with no stated management fee. Fees and expenses of Investment Funds are based on historical fees and expenses. Future Investment Funds’ fees and expenses may be substantially higher or lower because certain fees are based on the performance of the Investment Funds, which may fluctuate over time.
c The Net Annual Fund Expenses include the Fund’s Management Fee (1.00%), Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses (3.64%), Interest Payments on Borrowed Funds (0.01%) and Other Expenses (0.71%) less Fee Waiver and Expense Reimbursement (-0.21%).  The Adviser has agreed to waive and/or reimburse the Fund’s expenses (other than Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses and extraordinary expenses and the following investment related expenses: foreign country tax expense and interest expense on amounts borrowed by the Fund) to the extent necessary in order to cap total annual fund expenses at 1.50% until the termination of the Fund’s investment advisory agreement.


 




  Subject to authorization by Board of Trustees, generally in an amount up to 15% of NAV.





 





 

  WAM is the weighted average maturity of the portfolio. The WAM calculation utilizes the interest-rate reset date, rather than a security's stated final maturity, for variable- and floating- rate securities. By looking to a portfolio's interest rate reset schedule in lieu of final maturity dates, the WAM measure effectively captures a fund's exposure to interest rate movements and the potential price impact resulting from interest rate movements.
 


  WAL is the weighted average life of the portfolio. The WAL calculation utilizes a security's stated final maturity date or, when relevant, the date of the next demand feature when the fund may receive payment of principal and interest (such as a put feature). Accordingly, WAL reflects how a portfolio would react to deteriorating credit (widening spreads) or tightening liquidity conditions.
 


  Tracking error and information ratio are calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index (added October 2, 2013), as this is a better representation of the Portfolio's global multi-asset strategy. The investment team manages the Portfolio relative to this Blended Index.
 


  Excess return versus Custom Benchmark is calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index based on the period since it was added as a benchmark on October 2, 2013.
 


  NTM = Next Twelve Months
 


  LTM = Last Twelve Months
 


  Because the Portfolio had not commenced operations as of the most recent fiscal year end, no portfolio turnover rate is available for the Portfolio.
 


  The Reorganization occurred on January 6, 2015. The inception date reflects the inception date of the Private Fund.
 


  Global equities is represented by the MSCI All Country World Index.
 


  Net exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)-(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV)
 


  Gross exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)+(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV).
 


  Fixed income net and gross exposure is duration adjusted (U.S. Treasury 10-Year equivalents)
 


  Security ratings disclosed above have been obtained from Standard & Poor's Ratings Group ("S&P"). S&P's credit ratings express its opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer to meet its financial obligations in full and on time.'AAA' is the highest rating. Any rating below 'BBB-' rating 
		is considered non-investment grade. Ratings are relative and subjective and are not absolute standards of quality. Ratings apply only to the underlying holdings of the portfolio and does not remove market risk.
		"NR" or "Not Rated" indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that S&P does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy. Futures are not rated.

1 AIP MACRO REGISTERED FUND A Financial Statements with Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm For the Year Ended December 31, 20152 Financial Statements with Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm For the Year Ended December 31, 2015 Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm... 1 Audited Financial Statements Statement of Assets and Liabilities... 2 Statement of Operations 3 Statements of Changes in Net Assets 4 Statement of Cash Flows 5 Schedule of Investments 6 Notes to Financial Statements 9 Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures and Proxy Voting Record (Unaudited) 20 Quarterly Portfolio Schedule (Unaudited) 20 Distributions (Unaudited) 20 U.S. Privacy Policy (Unaudited) 21 Information Concerning Trustees and Officers (Unaudited) 263 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of AIP Macro Registered Fund A We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of AIP Macro Registered Fund A (the Fund ), including the schedule of investments, as of December 31, 2015, and the related statements of operations and cash flows for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended and the financial highlights for each of the three years in the period then ended and for the period July 1, 2012 (commencement of operations) to December 31, These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of investments owned as of December 31, 2015, by correspondence with the custodian, management of the investment funds and others. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of AIP Macro Registered Fund A at December 31, 2015, the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended and the financial highlights for each of the three years in the period then ended and for the period July 1, 2012 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

The Fund is registered under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ), as a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. While non-diversified for 1940 Act purposes, the Fund intends to comply with the diversification requirements of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), as such requirements are described in more detail below. The Fund s investment objective is to seek long-term capital appreciation principally through investing in investment funds ( Investment Funds ) managed by third party investment managers who primarily employ a variety of global macro investment strategies in pursuit of attractive risk-adjusted returns consistent with the preservation of capital. These investment strategies allow investment managers the flexibility to use leveraged or short-sale positions to take advantage of perceived inefficiencies across the global capital markets. The Fund may seek to gain investment exposure to certain Investment Funds or to adjust market or risk exposure by entering into derivative transactions, such as total return swaps, options and futures. Morgan Stanley AIP GP LP serves as the Fund s investment adviser (the Investment Adviser ) and Morgan Stanley Investment Management Limited serves as the Fund s sub-adviser (the Sub-Adviser ) (collectively with the Investment Adviser, the Adviser ). The Adviser is responsible for providing dayto-day investment management services to the Fund, subject to the supervision of the Fund s Board of Trustees (the Board ). Each of the Investment Adviser and Sub-Adviser is an affiliate of Morgan Stanley and is registered as an investment adviser under the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act ). The Fund has no fixed termination date and will continue unless the Fund is otherwise terminated under the terms of the Trust Deed or unless and until required by law. The Fund is a Master fund in a Master-Feeder structure whereby the feeder fund invests substantially all of its assets in the Fund. As of December 31, 2015, AIP Macro Registered Fund P, a feeder fund to the Fund, represented % of the Fund s net assets. The Board has overall responsibility for monitoring and overseeing the Fund s investment program and its management and operations. A majority of the members of the Board are not interested persons (as defined by the 1940 Act) of the Fund, the Investment Adviser or the Sub-Adviser. The Fund offers on a continuous basis through Morgan Stanley Distribution, Inc. (the Distributor ), an affiliate of Morgan Stanley, 1,000,000 shares of beneficial interest ( Shares ). The initial closing date ( Initial Closing Date ) for public offering of Shares was August 1, Shares were offered until the Initial Closing Date at an initial offering price of $1,000 per Share, and have been continuously offered thereafter for purchase as of the first day of each calendar month at the Fund s then current net asset value per Share. Investors purchasing Shares in the Fund ( Shareholders ) will not be charged a sales load. Shares may also be purchased through any registered investment adviser (a RIA ) that has entered into 912 Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 1. Organization (continued) an arrangement with the Distributor for such RIA to recommend Shares to its clients in conjunction with a wrap fee, asset allocation or other management asset program by such RIA. Shares are to be sold only to Shareholders that represent that they are accredited investors within the meaning of Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The minimum initial investment in the Fund by any Shareholder is $25,000 and the minimum additional investment in the Fund by any Shareholder is $10,000. The Fund may modify these minimums from time to time. Shareholders may only purchase their Shares through the Distributor or a RIA. Any RIA who offers Shares may impose additional eligibility requirements on investors who purchase Shares through such RIA. The Fund may from time to time offer to repurchase Shares (or portions of them) at net asset value pursuant to written tenders by Shareholders, and each such repurchase offer will generally apply to up to 15% of the net assets of the Fund. Repurchases will be made at such times, in such amounts and on such terms as may be determined by the Board, in its sole discretion. In determining whether the Fund should offer to repurchase Shares (or portions of them) from Shareholders, the Board will consider the recommendations of the Adviser as to the timing of such offer, as well as a variety of operational, business and economic factors. The Adviser expects that, generally, it will recommend to the Board that the Fund offer to repurchase Shares (or portions of them) from Shareholders quarterly, on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31. In general, the Fund will initially pay at least 95% of the estimated value of the repurchased Shares to Shareholders as of the later of: (1) a period of within 30 days after the value of the Shares to be repurchased is determined, or (2) if the Fund has requested withdrawals of its capital from any Investment Funds in order to fund the repurchase of Shares, within ten business days after the Fund has received at least 95% of the aggregate amount withdrawn by the Fund from such Investment Funds. The remaining amount (the Holdback Amount ) will be paid out promptly after completion of the annual audit of the Fund and preparation of the Fund s audited financial statements. As of December 31, 2015, the Holdback Amount was $196,982, which includes any Holdback Amount for repurchases as of December 31, 2015, and is included in payable for share repurchases in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. 2. Significant Accounting Policies The following significant accounting policies are in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( US GAAP ). Such policies are consistently followed by the Fund in preparation of its financial statements. Management has determined that the Fund is an investment company in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 946 for the purpose of financial reporting. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases or decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 1013 Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Portfolio Valuation The net asset value of the Fund is determined as of the close of business at the end of any fiscal period, generally monthly, in accordance with the valuation principles set forth below or as may be determined from time to time pursuant to policies established by the Board. As of December 31, 2015, all of the Fund s portfolio was comprised of investments in Investment Funds. The Board has approved procedures pursuant to which the Fund values its investments in Investment Funds at fair value, which ordinarily will be the amount equal to the Fund s pro rata interest in the net asset value of each such Investment Fund ( NAV ), as such value is supplied by, or on behalf of, the Investment Fund s investment manager from time to time, usually monthly. Values received from, or on behalf of, the Investment Funds respective investment managers are typically estimates only, subject to subsequent revision by such investment managers. Such values are generally net of management fees and performance incentive fees or allocations payable to the Investment Funds managers or general partners pursuant to the Investment Funds operating agreements. The Investment Funds value their underlying investments in accordance with policies established by each Investment Fund, as described in each of their financial statements or offering memoranda. The Fund s investments in Investment Funds are subject to the terms and conditions of the respective operating agreements and offering memoranda, as appropriate. While the Fund does not currently intend to invest in Investment Funds which maintain side pockets, as defined below, as of the time of the Fund s investment by a manner which would expose the Fund to such side pockets, one or more Investment Funds subsequently may establish such side pockets and therefore expose the Fund (and thus its Shareholders) to such side pockets. Side pockets are sub-funds within the Investment Funds that have restricted liquidity, potentially extending over a much longer period than the typical liquidity an investment in the Investment Funds may provide. Should the Fund seek to liquidate its investment in an Investment Fund that maintains these side pockets, the Fund might not be able to fully liquidate its investment without delay, which could be considerable. In such cases, until the Fund is permitted to fully liquidate its interest in the Investment Fund, the fair value of its investment could fluctuate based on adjustments to the value of the side pocket as determined by the Investment Fund s investment manager. As of December 31, 2015, none of the Fund s net assets were invested in side pockets maintained by the Investment Funds. The Adviser has designed ongoing due diligence processes with respect to Investment Funds and their investment managers, which assist the Adviser in assessing the quality of information provided by, or on behalf of, each Investment Fund and in determining whether such information continues to be reliable or whether further investigation is necessary. Such investigation, as applicable, may or may not require the Adviser to forego its normal reliance on the value supplied by, or on behalf of, such Investment Fund and to determine independently the fair value of the Fund s interest in such Investment Fund, consistent with the Fund s fair valuation procedures. 1114 Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Portfolio Valuation (continued) Where no value is readily available from an Investment Fund or where a value supplied by an Investment Fund is deemed by the Adviser not to be indicative of its fair value, the Adviser will determine the fair value of the Investment Fund. In order to determine the fair value of these Investment Funds, the Adviser has established the Fund of Hedge Funds Valuation Committee (the Valuation Committee ). The Valuation Committee is responsible for determining and implementing the Fund s valuation policies and procedures, which have been adopted by the Board and are subject to Board supervision. The Valuation Committee consists of voting members from Morgan Stanley s accounting, financial reporting and risk management groups, and non-voting members from portfolio management, legal and compliance groups. A member of the portfolio management team may attend each Valuation Committee meeting to provide knowledge, insight, and recommendations on valuation issues. The portfolio management team will recommend to the Valuation Committee a fair value for an investment using valuation techniques such as a market approach or income approach. In applying these valuation techniques, the portfolio management team uses their knowledge of the Investment Fund, industry expertise, information obtained through communication with the Investment Fund s investment manager, and available relevant information as it considers material. After consideration of the portfolio management team s recommendation, the Valuation Committee will determine, in good faith, the fair value of the Investment Fund. The Valuation Committee shall meet at least annually to analyze changes in fair value measurements. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, the fair values of the Fund s investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for these Investment Funds held by the Fund been available. Income Recognition and Expenses The Fund recognizes income and records expenses on an accrual basis. Income, expenses and realized and unrealized gains and losses are recorded monthly. The changes in Investment Funds fair values are included in net change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on investments in Investment Funds in the Statement of Operations. Realized gain (loss) from investments in Investment Funds is calculated using specific identification. Income Taxes The Fund intends to comply with the requirements of Subchapter M of the Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its Shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required. The Fund files tax returns with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and various states. The Fund may be subject to taxes imposed by countries in which it invests. Such taxes are generally based on income earned or gains realized or repatriated. Taxes are accrued and applied to net investment income, net realized capital gains and net unrealized appreciation, as applicable, as the income is earned or capital gains are recorded. The Fund has concluded there are no significant uncertain tax positions that would require recognition in the financial statements as of December 31, If applicable, the Fund recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax 1215 Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Income Taxes (continued) benefits in interest expense and penalties in other expenses in the Statement of Operations. Generally, open tax years under potential examination vary by jurisdiction, but at least each of the tax years in the four-year period ended December 31, 2015 remains subject to examination by major taxing authorities. At December 31, 2015, the Fund had available for Federal income tax purposes unused short-term and long-term capital losses that will not expire of: Short-term losses (no expiration) $ 873,965 Long-term losses (no expiration) $ 499,368 To the extent that capital loss carryforwards are used to offset any future capital gains realized during the carryover period as provided by U.S. Federal income tax regulations, no capital gains tax liability will be incurred by a fund for gains realized and not distributed. To the extent that capital gains are offset, such gains will not be distributed to the shareholders. At December 31, 2015, the cost and related gross unrealized appreciation and depreciation for tax purposes were as follows: Cost of investments for tax purposes $ 49,387,381 Gross tax unrealized appreciation $ - Gross tax unrealized depreciation (203,290) Net tax unrealized appreciation/depreciation on investments $ (203,290) Distribution of Income and Gains The Fund declares and pays dividends annually from net investment income. Net realized gains, if any, are distributed at least annually. Distributions from net realized gains for book purposes may include short-term capital gains, which are included as ordinary income for tax purposes. In order to satisfy the diversification requirements under Subchapter M of the Code, the Fund generally invests its assets in Investment Funds organized outside the United States that are treated as corporations for U.S. tax purposes and are expected to be classified as passive foreign investment companies ( PFICs ). As such, the Fund expects that distributions generally will be taxable as ordinary income to the Shareholders. Pursuant to the dividend reinvestment plan established by the Fund (the DRIP ), each Shareholder whose Shares are registered in its own name will automatically be a participant under the DRIP and have all income, dividends and capital gains distributions automatically reinvested in additional Shares unless such Shareholder specifically elects to receive all income, dividends and capital gain distributions in cash. 1316 Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) Distribution of Income and Gains (continued) The tax character of distributions paid may differ from the character of distributions shown in the Statements of Changes in Net Assets due to short-term capital gains being treated as ordinary income for tax purposes. The tax character of distributions paid during fiscal 2015 and 2014 was as follows: December 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 Distributions paid from: Ordinary income $ 2,528,005 $ 2,257,505 The amount and character of income and gains to be distributed are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from US GAAP. These book/tax differences are considered either temporary or permanent in nature. Temporary differences are primarily due to differing book and tax treatments in the timing of the recognition of gains (losses) on certain investment transactions and the timing of the deductibility of certain expenses. Permanent differences, primarily due to tax adjustments on PFICs sold by the Fund resulted in the following reclassifications among the Fund s components of net assets at December 31, 2015: Accumulated undistributed net investment income (loss) $ 2,479,878 Accumulated undistributed net realized gain (loss) $ (2,479,878) Paid-in-capital $ - As of December 31, 2015, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis were as follows: Undistributed ordinary income $ 470, Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk In the normal course of business, the Investment Funds in which the Fund invests may trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities with off-balance sheet risk. These include, but are not limited to, short selling activities, written option contracts, and swaps. The Fund s risk of loss in each Investment Fund is limited to the value of the Fund s interest in each Investment Fund as reported by the Fund. 1417 Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 4. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The fair value of the Fund s assets and liabilities that qualify as financial instruments approximates the carrying amounts presented in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Fair value is defined as the price that the Fund would receive to sell an investment or pay to transfer a liability in a timely transaction with an independent buyer in the principal market, or in the absence of a principal market the most advantageous market for the investment or liability. The Fund uses a three-tier hierarchy to distinguish between (a) inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs) and (b) inputs that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs) and to establish classification of fair value measurements for disclosure purposes. Various inputs are used in determining the fair value of the Fund s investments. The inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below: Level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical investments Level 2 other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments), or short-term investments that are valued at amortized cost Level 3 significant unobservable inputs (including the Fund s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments) The inputs or methodology used for valuing investments are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those investments. The units of account that are valued by the Fund are its interests in the Investment Funds or other financial instruments and not the underlying holdings of such Investment Funds or other financial instruments. Thus, the inputs used by the Fund to value its investments in each of the Investment Funds or other financial instruments may differ from the inputs used to value the underlying holdings of such Investment Funds or other financial instruments. The Fund s policy is to recognize transfers between Levels 1, 2, or 3 and transfers due to strategy reclassification, if any, as if they occurred as of the beginning of the reporting period. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Fund did not have any transfers between Levels 1, 2, or 3. In May 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No ( ASU ), Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent). ASU removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the practical expedient, as defined by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement. The Fund has elected to early adopt and retrospectively apply ASU The impact of the early adoption has been reflected in the Notes to Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2015, all of the investments in Investment Funds are fair valued using the NAV as practical expedient and are therefore excluded from the fair value hierarchy. 1518 Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 5. Investments in Investment Funds The following table summarizes the fair value and liquidity terms of the Investment Funds as of December 31, 2015, aggregated by investment strategy: Redemption Redemption Frequency Notice Period Investment Funds Fair Value (if applicable) (if applicable) Commodity Trading Advisors - Managed Futures (a) $ 18,006,346 Daily to Monthly 2-60 days Equity L/S High Hedge (b) 600,721 Quarterly 45 days Macro (c) 25,576,212 Monthly to Semi-annually days Statistical Arbitrage (d) 5,000,812 Monthly to Quarterly days Total Investment Funds $ 49,184,091 (a) (b) (c) (d) Investment Funds in this strategy invest in a variety of futures contracts, including currencies, interest rates, stocks, stock market indexes, derivatives, and commodities. These Investment Funds build quantitative models to price futures and then take long and short positions in the futures. An Investment Fund in this strategy seeks to profit by exploiting pricing inefficiencies between related equity securities, neutralizing exposure to market risk by combining long and short positions. Investment Funds in this strategy invest by making leveraged bets on anticipated price movements of stock markets, interest rates, foreign exchange and physical commodities. Investment Funds in this strategy profit from temporary pricing discrepancies between related securities. This irregularity offers an opportunity to go long the cheaper security and to short the more expensive one in an attempt to profit as the prices of the two revert to their norm, or mean. For the year ended December 31, 2015, aggregate purchases and proceeds from sales of investments in Investment Funds were $10,325,108 and $21,038,652, respectively. 6. Investment Receivables and Prepaids As of December 31, 2015, $3,589,496 was due to the Fund from Investment Funds. The receivable amount represents the fair value of certain Investment Fund tranches, net of management fees and incentive fees/allocations, that were redeemed by the Fund at period-end or holdback amounts that will be received from certain Investment Funds. Substantially all of the receivable balance was collected subsequent to the balance sheet date. Prepaid investments in Investment Funds represent amounts transferred to Investment Funds prior to year-end relating to investments to be made effective January 1, 2016, pursuant to each Investment Fund s operation agreements. 7. Management Fee, Related Party Transactions and Other The Fund bears all expenses related to its investment program, including, but not limited to, expenses borne indirectly through the Fund s investments in the underlying Investment Funds. Prior to May 1, 2015, in consideration of the advisory and other services to be provided by the Investment Adviser to the Fund, the Fund paid the Investment Adviser a monthly management fee of % 1619 Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 7. Management Fee, Related Party Transactions and Other (continued) (1.25% on an annualized basis) of the Fund s month end net asset value. Effective May 1, 2015, the Fund pays the Investment Adviser a monthly management fee of 0.083% (1.00% on an annualized basis) of the Fund s month end net asset value. The management fee is an expense paid out of the Fund s assets and is computed based on the value of the net assets of the Fund as of the close of business on the last business day of each month, before adjustments for any repurchases effective on that day. The management fee is in addition to the asset-based fees and incentive fees or allocations charged by the underlying Investment Funds and indirectly borne by Shareholders in the Fund. The Investment Adviser pays the Sub-Adviser a portion of the net management fees the Investment Adviser receives from the Fund on a monthly basis. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Fund incurred management fees of $623,609, of which $84,745 was payable to the Investment Adviser at December 31, The Investment Adviser has contractually agreed to waive or reimburse the Fund for expenses (other than fees and expenses of the underlying hedge funds in which the Fund invests, extraordinary expenses and certain investment related expenses, such as foreign country tax expense and interest expense on amounts borrowed by the Fund) to the extent necessary in order to cap the Fund s total annual operating expenses at 1.50% until the termination of the Fund s investment advisory agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2015, management fee waivers were $126,371. State Street Bank and Trust Company ( State Street ) provides accounting and administrative services to the Fund. Under an administrative services agreement, State Street is paid an administrative fee, computed and payable monthly at an annual rate ranging from 0.045% to 0.075%, based on the aggregate monthly net assets of certain Morgan Stanley products, including the Fund, for which State Street serves as the administrator. State Street also serves as the Fund s custodian. Under a custody services agreement, State Street is paid a custody fee monthly at an annual rate of 0.020%, based on (1) the aggregate monthly net assets of certain Morgan Stanley products, including the Fund, for which State Street serves as the custodian, and (2) investment purchases and sales activity related to the Fund. The Fund is charged directly for certain reasonable out-of-pocket expenses related to the accounting, administrative and custodial services provided by State Street to the Fund. The Fund has a deferred compensation plan (the DC Plan ) that allows each member of the Board that is not an affiliate of Morgan Stanley to defer payment of all, or a portion, of the fees he or she receives for serving on the Board throughout the period. Each eligible member of the Board generally may elect to have the deferred amounts invested in the DC Plan in order to earn a return equal to the total return on one or more of the Morgan Stanley products that are offered as investment options under the DC Plan. Investments in the DC Plan, unrealized appreciation/depreciation on such investments and distributions received from these investments are recorded with an offsetting increase/decrease in the deferred compensation obligation and do not affect the net asset value of the Fund. At December 31, 2015, the Fund s proportionate share of assets attributable to the DC Plan was $494, which is included in the statement of Assets and Liabilities under other assets and the deferred compensation obligation under accrued expenses and other liabilities. 1720 Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 7. Management Fee, Related Party Transactions and Other (continued) UMB Fund Services, Inc. serves as the Fund s transfer agent. Transfer agent fees are payable monthly based on an annual Fund base fee, annual per Shareholder account charges, and out-of pocket expenses incurred by the transfer agent on the Fund s behalf. As of December 31, 2015, there was one Shareholder, affiliated with Morgan Stanley, that invested in the Fund indirectly through the feeder fund, with a net asset balance that represented approximately 21% of the Fund s net assets. 8. Line of Credit Effective July 30, 2013, the Fund entered into a secured credit agreement with State Street for a revolving line of credit (the Facility ). The maximum availability under the Facility is the lesser of $7,500,000 or 20% of the Fund s adjusted net assets, as defined in the credit agreement, subject to specific asset-based covenants. Prior to July 28, 2015, the Fund paid an annual administration fee related to the Facility of 0.25% of the unused commitment and the annual interest rate on borrowings is the greater of the Federal Funds Rate plus 1.50% or the overnight USD LIBOR plus 1.50%. Effective July 28, 2015, the rate changed from 0.25% to 0.35%. Under the terms of the Facility, borrowings are repayable no later than July 26, 2016, the termination date of the Facility. At December 31, 2015, there was $1,880,000 outstanding against the Facility. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Fund incurred interest expense of $8,557 in connection with the Facility. Borrowings are secured by the Fund s investments in Investment Funds. Detailed below is summary information concerning the borrowings: # of Days Outstanding Average Daily Balance Annualized Weighted Average Rate 237 $791, % 9. Contractual Obligations The Fund enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The Fund s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote. 1821 Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 10.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/25/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Analysts believe the company Westergren founded has been holding on to a failed ambition to compete with the likes of Apple and Spotify-- and it's time to move on.
