There are so many different fee structures and specialties, knowing how to sort through your options is difficult. You trust your financial advisor with your money, so it is important to make the best possible decision.How to Choose a Financial AdvisorWhen you start your search for a financial advisor, you need to find someone whose skills matches your needs. That means you need to recognize what you are looking for before you start looking.Here are some common needs from financial advisors: Cash flow management Budgeting Retirement planning Investing Paying for children's education No financial advisor is perfect for every need, which is why it is so important to understand your needs before hiring anyone.How to Find a Financial AdvisorYour first step in choosing a financial advisor after examining your needs is to find potential advisors. You will want someone who is easy to reach, and ideally not too far from your home or office so it is easy to get to a meeting if needed.There are over 750,000 registered financial advisors in the United States. SmartAsset's financial advisor search tool can help you navigate to the best advisor for your needs. Answer questions about where you live, your plans for retirement, and other financial priorities. In just a few minutes, you'll be all set and SmartAsset will have an advisor contact you.Questions to Ask a Financial AdvisorOnce you have found a few advisors, you should interview them to decide who is the best fit for your needs. Here are some example questions to ask to make sure you end up with the right advisor.How many years of experience do you have as a professional financial advisor? Do you want someone new and inexperienced managing your money? It is best to find someone with plenty of experience. Advisors with a decade or more under their belt have seen multiple economic cycles and can better help you weather the storm.What is your strongest focus area in financial planning? Some advisors are experts in retirement. Others have expertise in estates and trusts. Others still are best suited to help you pay for your child's education. Some financial advisors focus on people who are self-employed. Be sure to choose someone who can help with what you need, not what someone else needs.What is your budgeting philosophy? Every family's budget is unique. Budgets can be very detailed or more general. Some advisors suggest living frugally to meet your goals, others take a more balanced approach. Find an advisor with a philosophy that matches yours.How are you compensated? Some financial advisors are “fee only.” This means that you pay your advisor a flat fee for their services. Many advisors charge based on the size of your portfolio. The worst situation is where advisors are paid a commission by mutual funds. In this case, a conflict of interest exists. The advisor is incentivized to put your money into those funds even if they are not the best for your needs.How much does it cost to work with you? After learning how they are paid, make sure you know how much you will pay. No one wants a giant surprise bill after your first meeting.Are you a fiduciary? Fiduciary means putting your needs first. Many financial advisors work as a fiduciary and have to put your needs first, even if it means they earn less money. However, many financial advisors are not fiduciaries, and can give you advice that is not in your best interest.Do you own the same investments you'll suggest to me? Do they put their money where their mouth is? Advisors who suggest one strategy to clients and use a different strategy for their own finances should be a big red flag.How have your client's portfolios performed? How did you handle their portfolios during the Great Recession in 2008? These questions get to the root of their performance. If the advisor does not readily share this information, they are probably hiding something that went wrong in the past.  Make Sure Your Financial Advisor is LicensedFinancial advisors are not allowed to give you specific investment advice unless they are licensed. The most common and important license for a financial advisor is the CFP, or Certified Financial Planner. CFPs are regulated and must take a course and pass a test proving their competence in financial topics.Series 7 and Series 63 licenses give finance professionals the ability to recommend and trade stocks, bonds, and other investments on your behalf. Make sure your financial advisor has successfully completed both of these exams and has an up-to-date license.Beware of Lofty PromisesIf an advisor makes promises that sound like something from the 2016 Presidential Campaign, proceed with caution. Promises to beat the market and outperform other advisors and funds are easier said than done. Further, no advisor can promise that they will beat the market.At the end of the day, many financial advisors have similar skills. They use comparable tools and reports to stay up-to-date on the markets and help find the best investments for you. If any advisor gives you a bad vibe, don't feel bad looking elsewhere.Choose an Advisor You Can TrustAfter you have met with a few advisors, it is time to make your decision. Asking about licenses, fees, and past performance is black and white. There are other parts of the decision that are a bit more subjective.Do you like the person? Do you trust them? Would you trust them with your daughter's education fund? Your retirement?If you have been able to limit your list down to your final few, it is time to trust your gut. It is important to have an advisor you like, trust, and enjoy interacting with. Your money is too important to put in the hands of someone you don't trust. Pick and advisor who feels like a partner who will stand beside you through your financial journey. If you do, you'll be on track for a great financial future.If you're ready to start, answer a few questions in SmartAsset's financial advisor selection tool and you'll be contacted by a few advisors in your area to choose from.

Unlike hiring a mechanic or hairstylist, financial advisors are usually long term relationships. They are also taking responsibility for your money. With your entire livelihood on the line, choosing the wrong advisor would be a big mistake. Avoid these 7 common blunders when choosing an advisor to ensure you are on track to meet your financial goals.1. Hiring the First Advisor You MeetDepending on where you live, you could have dozens of options for advisors. It is tempting to hire the closest advisor to home. Some people might just pick the first advisor in the yellow pages. This decision requires more time. Take the time to interview at least a few advisors before picking the best match for you.2. Choosing an Advisor with the Wrong SpecialtyAdvisors can have different focus area. Some specialize on retirement planning. Some are best for business owners or those with a high net worth. Others are best for young professionals starting a family. This type of focus does not make an advisor better or worse. It makes them better for certain people than others. Be sure to understand an advisor’s strengths and weaknesses. Do that before signing on the dotted line.3. Picking an Advisor with an Incompatible StrategyEach advisor has a unique strategy. Some advisors may suggest aggressive investments. Others are more conservative. Again, there is no right or wrong. However, there is a right and wrong for you. If you don’t feel comfortable with risk, don’t choose an advisor that prefers aggressive investments. If you prefer to go all in on stocks, an advisor that prefers bonds and index funds is not a great match for your style.4. Skipping Checking ReferencesMost advisors are happy to offer references to prospective clients. If you ask about references and they act nervous, that's a red flag! Quality advisors are happy to discuss past missteps and what they learned. This helps them keep from repeating the same mistake in the future. Calling references only takes a couple of minutes. It can help put you at ease when handing over the keys to your bank account.5. Not Asking about CredentialsTo give investment advice, financial advisors are required to pass a test. Ask your advisor about their licenses, tests, and credentials. This ensures they are qualified to meet your needs. Financial advisors tests include the Series 7 and Series 66 or Series 65. Some advisors go a step further and become a Certified Financial Planner, or CFP. Also ask where they went to school and what degree they earned. Some advisors have a finance degree from a top school. Others could have an English degree from a community college.6. Making Assumptions When They are Affiliated with a Reputable BrandAn advisor might appear qualified and professional due to an association with a major firm like J.P. Morgan or Morgan Stanley. However, that doesn’t make them a great advisor. Working with an advisor from a reputable firm is not a bad idea. It often leads to stability and better tools and information. However, they still have quite a bit of autonomy. Choose an advisor because they are the best fit, not because of their branding.7. Not Understanding How They are PaidThere are different payment models for financial advisors. Some are “fee only.” In this case, they charge a flat rate no matter what. Others charge a percentage of assets under management. Some advisors are paid by mutual funds. This is the worst situation for you. This is a serious conflict of interest. If the advisor earns more by ignoring your best interests, do not hire them.Do Your Research to Find the Perfect AdvisorChoosing a financial advisor is an important decision. It requires the best information available. Gathering information about financial advisors can be tough. That is why SmartAsset created a financial advisor match tool.

Your Details Done By Eric Rosenberg        By Eric Rosenberg | November 23, 2016  Do you know enough about financial management to take care of all of your investing on your own? Or do you need help from a seasoned expert? That question comes up for millions of Americans each year. This article will help you decide if you need one - and the top 6 criteria to look at when choosing one.Dealing with your day-to-day finances is not always a challenge. Getting yourself prepared for retirement, buying the right life insurance, and managing your investments are big obstacles to face alone. With your retirement on the line, you are probably wondering the same thing. Do I need a financial advisor? Continue on for information that can help you decide if you need a little extra help managing your money or some more information on how to do so yourself.What is a Financial Advisor?A financial advisor is someone who helps you reach your financial goals. Their job is to help you manage your personal finances. This includes a wide range of personal finance focal areas. Topics include cash flow, investments, retirement, insurance, trusts, getting out of debt, and more.There are thousands of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, and countless alternative investments to choose from. Having an experienced expert on your team can be a huge benefit.How Do Financial Advisors Get Paid?One issue to take into account before hiring an advisor is the cost. Financial advisors typically charge clients a flat fee or a percentage of assets under management.Some financial advisors receive a commission for referring clients to specific mutual funds. This leads to a conflict of interest. The advisor may be incentivized to guide you to a poor investment for your needs. That is why it is important to work only with a financial advisor who acts as a fiduciary. This means that they have to put your best interest first, even if it means they make a few dollars less.For most people, a fee only financial advisor is the best option of the two. This model presents the least conflict of interest. It guarantees you know what you will be charged regardless of your portfolio. Fee only advisors have the best incentive to guide your investments to what makes sense for you.Test Your Own Personal Finance KnowledgeBefore you rush out and hire a financial advisor, look at your own personal finance knowledge. Doing so will help you answer the all-important question: are financial advisors worth it for your needs?What is your level of comfort with the following? Managing your income, expenses, and budget Investing for retirement Saving an emergency fund Surviving a layoff or job loss Ensuring your family’s financial stability in the event of your unexpected passing Paying off debt These are core financial competencies. This information is vital to your family’s long-term financial security. If you are not comfortable with managing these personal finance priorities yourself, it is okay to seek help.Our school system is great at teaching biology and history. Along the way, however, schools forgot to add classes on personal finance. If you struggle with your finances, you are not alone. But you won’t be able to fix it on your own if you don’t know what to do. That is where a financial advisor comes in.Find the Right Financial Advisor for Your NeedsIf you have decided that a financial advisor is right for your needs, your next step is picking one. Choosing a financial advisor is not always a simple task. It is best to talk to several financial advisors and pick the right one for your needs.To start, check out this tool, which can help you find a financial advisor in your local area.Here are some criteria to consider when choosing an advisor:Licenses and CertificationsFinancial advisors must be licensed to provide specific investment and financial advice. Series 7 and Series 63 licenses are common among financial advisors. These demonstrate that the advisor has sufficient knowledge to offer trustworthy investment advice.ExperienceNew advisors may have a fresh education under their belt, but they have not experienced many economic environments. Choosing an advisor with decades of experience may be a better option than someone fresh out of college.Services OfferedSome financial advisors only offer specific services in one area of personal finance management. Others have an entire array of skills including tax planning, estate planning, and managing finances after a divorce. Whatever specific needs you have, make sure you choose an advisor with experience and education in that space.Fee StructureDoes this advisor charge fees based on a percentage of assets or a flat fee? Do they charge additional commissions for trades? Do they charge by the month or the hour? Do they get kickbacks for pointing you to specific mutual funds? Are they a fiduciary looking out for your best interest first? These are all important questions to answer when choosing a financial advisor.Investment StrategyInvestors can look at the stock market as an option for conservative portfolio growth. It can also look like the Wild West of investments. It is important to find a financial advisor whose strategy aligns with your goals and values. If you prefer a conservative investment style, do not choose a financial advisor who will funnel your money into risky startups. If you are open to riskier investments, you don’t want an advisor who will only put your money in an S&P 500 ETF.Let Your Skills and Needs Guide Your DecisionAt the end of the day, no one can tell you whether or not you should hire a financial advisor. If you can look at your finances and know what to prioritize and invest for your future, you are fine on your own. However, if managing your money makes you nervous, there is no shame in hiring an expert.If you are in the market for a new financial advisor, interview a couple of advisors in your city. Then choose the perfect advisor to help you achieve the financial success and security you dream of.

Our expertise centers on developing and managing index-based and near-index investment portfolios that are designed to meet the unique and specific needs of each client.Founded in 2000, Alesco advises on over $3.1 billion in assets for foundations, endowments and retirement plans, as well as trusts, IRAs and individual taxable accounts.Our compensation is fee-based only.

Client-First 
As an independent, fee-based company,  Alesco’s interests are aligned with those of our clients.







Philosophy




Alesco's philosophy focuses on asset allocation, the primary driver of investment returns. We concentrate on analyzing specific asset classes, establishing appropriate asset class weightings, obtaining optimal diversification, and rebalancing our portfolios on an ongoing basis. Our core investment philosophy embraces the findings of numerous academic and industry studies. This research indicates that the majority of active investment managers do not outperform their benchmarks over time. Moreover, there is no persistency in the performance of active managers (e.g., managers who have performed favorably in the past are no more likely than other managers to perform favorably in the future). Therefore, Alesco rarely uses active investment managers when structuring client portfolios. Instead, we prefer index-based or near-index investment vehicles. This philosophy allows us to eliminate many common investment risks and mistakes. As a result, our efforts focus on proper asset allocation, broad diversification and keeping costs low.




Asset Allocation 
At Alesco, we focus on the things that matter most to help our clients achieve long-term investment success.

Investment Approach | Alesco Advisors

















































Investment Approach




Investment Approach




Alesco’s expertise is in strategic asset allocation, as well as portfolio construction, through the use of index-centric investments. Asset classes are selected based on their ability to obtain optimal diversification within the portfolio. Once it is determined that an asset class can provide additional diversification benefits to the current asset allocation, a search is conducted to identify the “best in class” index and product to represent that asset class. As a result, our strategy involves using “asset class” investments as the integral components of our clients’ portfolios. These securities often include index-based investments, as well as other passive investments that replicate the return and risk profile of specific segments of the capital markets. Because of their lower costs relative to other investment vehicles, these funds have historically outperformed the majority of actively managed investment funds.   Alesco is, in effect, a manager of managers. However, instead of selecting active money managers, Alesco often selects index-centric funds where each investment mirrors the returns of a particular asset-class benchmark.    Basing our work on academic research and empirical studies, Alesco develops objectives-based, long-term asset-allocation plans that capture the returns of the capital markets and reduce risk through diversification. We refer to this approach as “Intelligent Investing.”

Services




Individual Investors




Our investment philosophy is straightforward. We believe our clients are best served when the focus of their investment portfolio is on asset allocation, broad diversification and expense control. Our process works to maximize the return/risk tradeoff of investing. We accomplish this goal by implementing efficient investment solutions that often make use of index-centric investment vehicles. These investments offer investors broad diversification with exposure to nearly all segments of the capital markets, but with limited turnover and minimal expenses. For each client, we establish an optimal asset allocation, select the most efficient investment offering by asset class, and allow the portfolio to capture the returns of the capital markets. This approach ensures that the portfolio constantly maintains exposure to selected asset classes and does so in a very tax-efficient manner.  




Long Term 
          Our sole focus is to help our clients achieve their long-term financial objectives.  







Institutional Investors




Alesco specializes in providing asset-class-based consulting and discretionary investment management services. We are particularly strong in investment policy development, risk control, client education, investing as a fiduciary, and understanding the complexities and biases of the investment industry. As an independent, fee-based company, Alesco is structured to provide a conflict-free investment approach. Our mission statement, corporate values and code of ethics all mandate that the decisions we make and the advice we provide are for the sole benefit of our clients. We do not offer proprietary investment products, we do not participate in soft-dollar trading relationships, and we do not receive compensation from any of the managers with whom we work. Accordingly, we are in a position to provide our clients with unbiased advice that is truly in their organization’s best long-term interest.




Trusted Advisors 
          Alesco provides comprehensive investment solutions without conflict.  







Financial Professionals




We believe the best way to ensure long-term relationships is by providing consistent service and investment solutions. Within the advisor network, we consider each relationship a partnership. At select firms, Alesco Advisors offers our broadly diversified GLOBAL BALANCED PORTFOLIO to financial professionals and their clients. The GLOBAL BALANCED PORTFOLIO’S objective is to produce long-term capital appreciation through intelligent beta strategies, as well as carefully selected, risk-controlled, tactical allocation trades. To gain the return/risk benefits of broad diversification, the portfolio will hold 15-25 index-based ETFs. The portfolio includes exposure to the traditional domestic and international investment asset classes. Investment decisions are made using both proprietary and third-party asset-class modeling software, as well as our own relative-value analysis. We analyze data on more than 30 different asset classes and choose from a product universe of more than 1,750 ETFs issued by multiple companies.

There are so many different fee structures and specialties, knowing how to sort through your options is difficult. You trust your financial advisor with your money, so it is important to make the best possible decision.How to Choose a Financial AdvisorWhen you start your search for a financial advisor, you need to find someone whose skills matches your needs. That means you need to recognize what you are looking for before you start looking.Here are some common needs from financial advisors: Cash flow management Budgeting Retirement planning Investing Paying for children's education No financial advisor is perfect for every need, which is why it is so important to understand your needs before hiring anyone.How to Find a Financial AdvisorYour first step in choosing a financial advisor after examining your needs is to find potential advisors. You will want someone who is easy to reach, and ideally not too far from your home or office so it is easy to get to a meeting if needed.There are over 750,000 registered financial advisors in the United States. SmartAsset's financial advisor search tool can help you navigate to the best advisor for your needs. Answer questions about where you live, your plans for retirement, and other financial priorities. In just a few minutes, you'll be all set and SmartAsset will have an advisor contact you.Questions to Ask a Financial AdvisorOnce you have found a few advisors, you should interview them to decide who is the best fit for your needs. Here are some example questions to ask to make sure you end up with the right advisor.How many years of experience do you have as a professional financial advisor? Do you want someone new and inexperienced managing your money? It is best to find someone with plenty of experience. Advisors with a decade or more under their belt have seen multiple economic cycles and can better help you weather the storm.What is your strongest focus area in financial planning? Some advisors are experts in retirement. Others have expertise in estates and trusts. Others still are best suited to help you pay for your child's education. Some financial advisors focus on people who are self-employed. Be sure to choose someone who can help with what you need, not what someone else needs.What is your budgeting philosophy? Every family's budget is unique. Budgets can be very detailed or more general. Some advisors suggest living frugally to meet your goals, others take a more balanced approach. Find an advisor with a philosophy that matches yours.How are you compensated? Some financial advisors are “fee only.” This means that you pay your advisor a flat fee for their services. Many advisors charge based on the size of your portfolio. The worst situation is where advisors are paid a commission by mutual funds. In this case, a conflict of interest exists. The advisor is incentivized to put your money into those funds even if they are not the best for your needs.How much does it cost to work with you? After learning how they are paid, make sure you know how much you will pay. No one wants a giant surprise bill after your first meeting.Are you a fiduciary? Fiduciary means putting your needs first. Many financial advisors work as a fiduciary and have to put your needs first, even if it means they earn less money. However, many financial advisors are not fiduciaries, and can give you advice that is not in your best interest.Do you own the same investments you'll suggest to me? Do they put their money where their mouth is? Advisors who suggest one strategy to clients and use a different strategy for their own finances should be a big red flag.How have your client's portfolios performed? How did you handle their portfolios during the Great Recession in 2008? These questions get to the root of their performance. If the advisor does not readily share this information, they are probably hiding something that went wrong in the past.  Make Sure Your Financial Advisor is LicensedFinancial advisors are not allowed to give you specific investment advice unless they are licensed. The most common and important license for a financial advisor is the CFP, or Certified Financial Planner. CFPs are regulated and must take a course and pass a test proving their competence in financial topics.Series 7 and Series 63 licenses give finance professionals the ability to recommend and trade stocks, bonds, and other investments on your behalf. Make sure your financial advisor has successfully completed both of these exams and has an up-to-date license.Beware of Lofty PromisesIf an advisor makes promises that sound like something from the 2016 Presidential Campaign, proceed with caution. Promises to beat the market and outperform other advisors and funds are easier said than done. Further, no advisor can promise that they will beat the market.At the end of the day, many financial advisors have similar skills. They use comparable tools and reports to stay up-to-date on the markets and help find the best investments for you. If any advisor gives you a bad vibe, don't feel bad looking elsewhere.Choose an Advisor You Can TrustAfter you have met with a few advisors, it is time to make your decision. Asking about licenses, fees, and past performance is black and white. There are other parts of the decision that are a bit more subjective.Do you like the person? Do you trust them? Would you trust them with your daughter's education fund? Your retirement?If you have been able to limit your list down to your final few, it is time to trust your gut. It is important to have an advisor you like, trust, and enjoy interacting with. Your money is too important to put in the hands of someone you don't trust. Pick and advisor who feels like a partner who will stand beside you through your financial journey. If you do, you'll be on track for a great financial future.If you're ready to start, answer a few questions in SmartAsset's financial advisor selection tool and you'll be contacted by a few advisors in your area to choose from.

Unlike hiring a mechanic or hairstylist, financial advisors are usually long term relationships. They are also taking responsibility for your money. With your entire livelihood on the line, choosing the wrong advisor would be a big mistake. Avoid these 7 common blunders when choosing an advisor to ensure you are on track to meet your financial goals.1. Hiring the First Advisor You MeetDepending on where you live, you could have dozens of options for advisors. It is tempting to hire the closest advisor to home. Some people might just pick the first advisor in the yellow pages. This decision requires more time. Take the time to interview at least a few advisors before picking the best match for you.2. Choosing an Advisor with the Wrong SpecialtyAdvisors can have different focus area. Some specialize on retirement planning. Some are best for business owners or those with a high net worth. Others are best for young professionals starting a family. This type of focus does not make an advisor better or worse. It makes them better for certain people than others. Be sure to understand an advisor’s strengths and weaknesses. Do that before signing on the dotted line.  3. Picking an Advisor with an Incompatible StrategyEach advisor has a unique strategy. Some advisors may suggest aggressive investments. Others are more conservative. Again, there is no right or wrong. However, there is a right and wrong for you. If you don’t feel comfortable with risk, don’t choose an advisor that prefers aggressive investments. If you prefer to go all in on stocks, an advisor that prefers bonds and index funds is not a great match for your style.4. Skipping Checking ReferencesMost advisors are happy to offer references to prospective clients. If you ask about references and they act nervous, that's a red flag! Quality advisors are happy to discuss past missteps and what they learned. This helps them keep from repeating the same mistake in the future. Calling references only takes a couple of minutes. It can help put you at ease when handing over the keys to your bank account.5. Not Asking about CredentialsTo give investment advice, financial advisors are required to pass a test. Ask your advisor about their licenses, tests, and credentials. This ensures they are qualified to meet your needs. Financial advisors tests include the Series 7 and Series 66 or Series 65. Some advisors go a step further and become a Certified Financial Planner, or CFP. Also ask where they went to school and what degree they earned. Some advisors have a finance degree from a top school. Others could have an English degree from a community college.6. Making Assumptions When They are Affiliated with a Reputable BrandAn advisor might appear qualified and professional due to an association with a major firm like J.P. Morgan or Morgan Stanley. However, that doesn’t make them a great advisor. Working with an advisor from a reputable firm is not a bad idea. It often leads to stability and better tools and information. However, they still have quite a bit of autonomy. Choose an advisor because they are the best fit, not because of their branding.7. Not Understanding How They are PaidThere are different payment models for financial advisors. Some are “fee only.” In this case, they charge a flat rate no matter what. Others charge a percentage of assets under management. Some advisors are paid by mutual funds. This is the worst situation for you. This is a serious conflict of interest. If the advisor earns more by ignoring your best interests, do not hire them.Do Your Research to Find the Perfect AdvisorChoosing a financial advisor is an important decision. It requires the best information available. Gathering information about financial advisors can be tough. That is why SmartAsset created a financial advisor match tool. Answering basic questions results in a list of local advisors to choose from. It doesn't matter if you need help with your finances or just want a second opinion.
