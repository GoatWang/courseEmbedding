ABS Capital Partners














 » About Us
About Us





WE'RE HERE TO TEAM WITH EXCEPTIONAL COMPANIES AND HELP THEM ACCELERATE AT THEIR MOST IMPORTANT STAGE.                
Many successful CEOs and their companies started with a bold idea, or a better way – bent on making a game-changing impact in their industry.  Our most productive partnerships begin with CEOs who have successfully piloted their companies through their exciting first stages and are now determined to make the choices to take them further.
What may have served them best at the start may be evolving in later stage growth, and ABS Capital can serve as a guiding partner through this exciting time. We deliver years of personal experience in the same fields where we invest most: business and tech-enabled services and health care.
Here you’ll find a dedicated team (many former C-level executives themselves) eager to work with CEOs focused on doing what’s best – and most impactful – for the next stage in growth.  We focus on helping face the dreams and realities associated with helming a company beyond its initial growth spurt; we’ve faced these things ourselves.
So we carefully choose the companies and CEOs we partner with, just as they carefully choose us. Once we’ve decided to work together, we prioritize growth potential above all. Therefore, we’re comfortable taking minority or majority positions, providing capital for expansion, and delivering acquisitions or liquidity for shareholders. Whatever’s right for building enduring value.
The goal is to unleash the most potential for lasting growth.  We find this to be the best measure of success – for us and for our CEO partners.
ABS Capital. Here, we grow.

WE MAKE SURE THERE’S AN EXCELLENT FIT WITH EVERY COMPANY WE WORK WITH.
Each falls within our area of expertise and lies within our preferred stage of development. As many of us are former C-level executives, investment bankers and consultants in these industries ourselves, we bring expertise to the business and tech-enabled services and health care sectors. We further make it our business to find the most promising companies across these areas.

Working With Us





Our value goes way beyond capital.                
Over 120 companies have benefited greatly from working with us at ABS Capital. Each has received individual attention to their specific goals – while always sharing a focus on enduring, valuable growth.
We simply do not view valuation as our number one criteria for partnership – and neither should you.
Instead, we become deeply involved in the longer-term potential of later-stage growth companies, focusing the same enthusiasm and excitement that is normally reserved for the initial start up phase of a company's lifespan. Add years of experience and expertise in your line of business and real partnership becomes evident.
We believe this is the true meaning of partnership with ABS - choosing longer-term growth and returns over transactional relationships.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

Item 1.        Security and Issuer. This statement on Schedule 13D relates to 11,337,646 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Shares"), of Alarm.com Holdings, Inc. (the "Issuer"). The principal executive offices of the Issuer are located at 8281 Greensboro Drive, Suite 100, Tysons, Virginia 22102.   Item 2.        Identity and Background. (a)  The names of the persons filing this Schedule 13D are ABS Capital Partners V Trust, a Delaware trust ("ABS Trust"), and ABS Capital Partners, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("Trustee", and together with ABS Trust, the "Reporting Persons"). Identifying information for each of the executive officers, directors and control persons of Trustee (collectively, the "Associated Persons") is set forth on Appendix I hereto, which is incorporated by reference into this Schedule 13D. (b)  The business address of each of the Reporting Persons and each of the Associated Persons is c/o ABS Capital Partners, 400 East Pratt Street, Suite 910, Baltimore, Maryland 21202-3116. (c)  The principal business of ABS Trust is a grantor trust established by ABS Capital Partners V, L.P., ABS Capital Partners V Offshore, L.P., ABS Capital Partners V-A, L.P., ABS Partners V, LLC and ABS Partners V, L.P. (collectively, the "Funds") to liquidate the Funds' assets.  The principal business of Trustee is to manage growth equity funds. The present principal occupation or employment of each of the Associated Persons is set forth on Appendix I.  (d)-(e)  During the last five years, neither of the Reporting Persons nor any of Associated Persons has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or (ii) has been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction as a result of which such person was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. (f)  ABS Trust is organized under the laws of the State of Delaware.  Trustee is organized under the laws of the State of Maryland. The citizenship of each of the Associated Persons is set forth on Appendix I.   Item 3.       Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration. ABS Trust acquired, for no consideration, all existing portfolio investments of the Funds, including the Shares, on December 31, 2015 in connection with the liquidation of the Funds. The Shares are directly owned by ABS Trust. In its capacity as trustee of ABS Trust, Trustee may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of the Shares directly owned by ABS Trust. As described in Item 5(c), on August 17, 2016, ABS Trust distributed 3,000,000 shares of the Issuer's Common Stock on a pro rata basis, for no consideration, to ABS Trust's beneficiaries, including the Associated Persons.   Item 4.       Purpose of Transaction. (a)-(j)  The Shares were originally acquired in connection with the liquidation of the Funds.  ABS Trust did not acquire and the Shares are not held for the purpose or with the effect of changing or influencing the control of the Issuer. ABS Trust was formed in connection with the liquidation and dissolution of the Funds, and as such, has the ultimate purpose of disposing of the Funds' former assets, including the Shares. These dispositions may be accomplished through future distributions of the Trust's assets to its beneficiaries, sales of the Trust's assets in private or public transactions, or otherwise.  However, ABS Trust and Trustee currently have no specific plans or proposals that would lead to the disposition of securities of the Issuer. Other than as set forth above, none of the Reporting Persons or the Associated Persons have any plans or proposals that relate to or would result in any of the actions specified in clauses (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D. To the extent deemed advisable in light of their general investment policies, or other factors, any of the Reporting Persons or Associated Persons may, at any time and from time to time, formulate other purposes, plans or proposals regarding the Issuer or the Shares, or any other actions that could involve one or more of the types of transactions or have one or more of the results described in paragraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D. The foregoing is subject to change at any time, and there can be no assurance that the Reporting Persons will take any of these actions.  The Associated Persons' shares of the Issuer's Common Stock are "restricted" securities within the meaning of Rule 144(a) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The Associated Persons may not transfer these shares in the absence of an effective registration statement covering the resale or other disposition of such shares or an exemption therefrom under the Securities Act.     Item 5.       Interest in Securities of the Issuer.  (a)-(b)  The table below sets forth (i) the aggregate number of shares of the Issuer's Common Stock beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons as of December 31, 2015, as of August 17, 2016 and as of the date of this filing, and (ii) the percentage of the shares of the Issuer's Common Stock beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons as of each such date, calculated based upon the total number of shares outstanding reported in the most recent periodic report filed by the Issuer with respect to a reporting period ending prior to the applicable date.  Each of the Reporting Persons has shared voting and dispositive power over the shares disclosed in the table below.          Date    Number of Shares   Percent Ownership         December 31, 2015   14,337,646   31.5% (1)         August 17, 2016   11,337,646   24.8% (2)         September 23, 2016   11,337,646   24.8% (2)     (1) This percentage is calculated based on 45,574,172 shares of the Issuer's Common Stock reported to be outstanding as of October 30, 2015 by the Issuer in the Issuer's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 12, 2015.

What are analysts saying about CA stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about CA stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period." (7/17/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "CA announced the acquisition of privately held Veracode for $614M in cash. Veracode provides SaaS-based application security for integration across the software development lifecycle. The deal value represents about 6.0-8.0x NTM revenue, which we view as reasonable, and discuss in more detail below. We believe providing security at the application level will become even more important over time given the ever increasing distributed nature of IT infrastructures." (3/7/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for CA (NASDAQ:CA) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Sell Ratings, 7 Hold Ratings, 5 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.13)Consensus Price Target: $34.85 (0.36% upside)
