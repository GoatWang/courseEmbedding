	NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	 


	NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

	Unaudited Interim Financial Information






	These unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial reporting and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods. Therefore, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted. In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented have been made. The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2017.





	The balance sheets and certain comparative information as of December 31, 2016 are derived from the audited financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2016 (“2016 Annual Financial Statements”), included in the Company’s 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These unaudited interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the 2016 Annual Financial Statements.


	 


	BASIS OF PRESENTATION


	 


	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


	 


	CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS


	 


	Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, cash on deposit with banks, and highly liquid debt investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased. The Company has no cash equivalents as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.


	 


	GOING CONCERN


	 


	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.









	6








	Table of Contents







	At March 31, 2017, the Company had a stockholders' deficit of $623,653 and a negative working capital of $52,109, which mainly resulted from the accumulated deficit of its former parent company that was transferred to the Company upon its spin-off from the parent company, and a lack of profitable operating history. The Company hopes to increase revenues from its real estate business and financial advisory services business. In the absence of significant increases in revenues, the Company intends to fund operations through additional debt and equity financing arrangements. The successful outcome of future activities cannot be determined at this time and there are no assurances that if achieved, the Company will have sufficient funds to execute its intended business plan or generate positive operating results.


	 


	The Company's success is dependent upon numerous items, certain of which are the successful growth of revenues from its services and its ability to obtain new customers in order to achieve levels of revenues adequate to support the Company's current and future cost structure, for which there is no assurance. Unanticipated problems, expenses, and delays are frequently encountered in establishing and maintaining profitable operations. These include, but are not limited to, competition, the need to develop customer support capabilities and market expertise, technical difficulties, market acceptance and sales and marketing. The failure of the Company to meet any of these conditions could have a materially adverse effect on the Company and may force the Company to reduce or curtail operations. No assurance can be given that the Company can achieve or maintain profitable operations.





	The Company believes it will have adequate cash to sustain operations until it achieves sustained profitability. However, until the Company has a history of maintaining revenue levels sufficient to support its operations and repay its working capital deficit, the Company may require additional financing. Sources of financing could include capital infusions, additional equity financing or debt offerings. There can be no assurance that funding will be available on acceptable terms, if at all, or that such fund, if raised, would enable the Company to achieve or sustain profitable operations.


	 


	These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.


	 


	FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS


	 


	The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash, prepaid expenses and other receivables, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and due to/from affiliated company.  The fair value of these financial instruments approximate their carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets due to the short term maturity of these instruments.





	Fair Value Measurements


	 


	ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows:


	 


	Level 1 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.


	 


	Level 2 - Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.


	 


	Level 3 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.


	 


	The Company's financial instruments consisted of cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, advances due to or from affiliated companies and notes payable to officers.  The estimated fair value of cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, due to or from affiliated companies, and notes payable approximates its carrying amount due to the short maturity of these instruments.


	 


	USE OF ESTIMATES


	 


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with the GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

	REVENUE RECOGNITION


	 


	Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 605,

	Revenue Recognition

	which outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provide guidance for presentation of revenue and for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies in financial statements filed with Securities and Exchange Commission. Management believes the Company's revenue recognition policies conform to ASC 605. 


	 


	Revenues are mainly consulting fees. The consulting fees are recognized when work is complete.  Consulting fees from real estate advisory services that are subject to refund are recorded as deferred revenue until the project is completed and the fees are no longer refundable.


	 


	INCOME TAXES


	 


	Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, net of operating loss carry forwards and credits, by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years.  Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.  Current income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the relevant taxing authorities.


	 


	EARNINGS PER SHARE


	 


	A basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the year. Dilutive earnings per share include the effect of any potentially dilutive debt or equity under the treasury stock method, if including such instruments is dilutive.

	OVERVIEW


	 


	ASAP Expo (“ASAP” or “The Company” or “Our” or “We”) mission is to be the bridge between China and the Western world. ASAP is a holding company that assists Chinese institutional and high net worth individuals with acquisition advisory and asset management of U.S. hotels.





	Our investors include AVIC International USA, Junson Capital, Urban Commons, Sky Harbor Management, Shenzhen New World, American Curvet, and USA Heritage.





	From August 2010 until now, our group has provided consulting services regarding purchasing 20 hotels primarily in California, Florida, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia and Michigan. Hotel brands include Marriott, Hilton, Westin, Doubletree by Hilton, Four Points by Sheraton, and Holiday Inn. We are one of the most active hotel buyers in the market.





	ASAP believes we will continue this growth for the next couple of years, taking advantage of current below replacement cost assets with reasonable cap rates and value-add opportunities in the current U.S. hotel market.





	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


	 



	Revenues






	Since the Company’s primary business is based upon potential transactions in real estate, the Company is subject to variance in revenues due to investors sentiment towards real estate.





	Substantially all of our revenues are in the form of consulting fees collected from our clients, usually negotiated on a transaction-by-transaction basis. The company’s consulting fees primarily consist of revenue derived from transaction commission received from acquisition advisory. The company earns the consulting fees by sourcing the deal, underwriting financials, coordinating due diligence on all contracts, recommending lenders, hiring third party property management companies, and negotiating franchise agreements. Another revenue source for the company includes asset management fees, which consist of supervision of daily, weekly, and monthly operating results of the hotel, review of capital expenditure requests, communication with lenders, negotiating personal and real property tax assessments, and most importantly, oversight on brand relations.





	The Company’s clients include concentration of two to three main clients. Our concentration of clients does provide a risk for revenue growth. The Company has established strong relationships with our clients. Our business and client relationships, and our culture and philosophy are firmly centered on putting the clients’ interests first.

	During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company earned consulting fee of $369,500 including $154,500 from affiliated companies and management fee of $19,200 from affiliated companies, respectively, as compared to consulting fee of $255,000 for the same period last year from affiliated companies and no management fee. The increase in consulting fee was mainly because the Company closed one big hotel acquisition deal versus zero in the same period of 2016.

	Table of Contents







	Cost of Sales





	In the course of providing real estate advisory services and asset management services, the Company pays consulting fees for finding properties and other services that facilitate the closing of deals.  





	Cost of sales consisting mainly of consulting expense, is primarily the result of the commissions and other incentive compensation incurred directly related to acquisition advisory services. Therefore, the fluctuation in revenue will directly impact the cost of sales.





	For the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company incurred consulting expense of $252,000, respectively, for providing advisory services in real estate acquisition as compared to $105,000 for the same period last year. The higher consulting expenses in the first three months of 2017 were mainly due to the closing of one big hotel acquisition deal mentioned above. 






	Operating Expenses



	 


	General and administrative (“G&A”) expenses consist primarily of administrative personnel costs, facilities expenses, and professional fee expenses.


	 


	For the three months ended March 31, 2017, G&A expenses decreased by $27,354 or 16.7% to $136,456 compared to $163,810 for the same period last year. The decrease was mainly due to one highly paid manager was off the payroll during the first quarter of 2017, partly offset by a new auto lease.


	 



	Interest Expense






	Interest expense increased to $9,241 during the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $4,965 for the same period last year. The changes in interest expense were mainly due to the higher average note payable balances.


	 



	Net Income






	The Company recorded a net loss of $9,797 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to a net loss of $4,575 for the same period last year. The increase in net loss was mainly due to the higher consulting expense, the lack of other income and higher interest expense, offset by higher revenue and lower G&A expenses.





	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES





	During the next twelve months, ASAP Expo will focus on its real estate transactions to generate additional revenue. With the net revenue from its services, and continuing support from its major shareholders to provide a note payable, management believes ASAP Expo will have enough net working capital to sustain its business for another 12 months.


	 


	The forecast of the period of time through which ASAP Expo’s financial resources will be adequate to support its operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties. ASAP Expo’s actual funding requirements may differ materially as a result of a number of factors, including unknown expenses associated with the cost of providing real estate advisory, investment banking, and management consulting services.





	The Report of the Company's Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on our December 31, 2016 financial statements includes an explanatory paragraph stating that the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has an accumulated stockholders' deficit, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	Operating Activities





	For the three months ended March 31, 2017, net cash used in operating activities was $65,615. This was primarily due to a net loss of $9,797, adjusted by non-cash related expenses of depreciation of $2,741, then decreased by unfavorable changes in working capital of $58,559. The unfavorable changes in working capital mainly resulted from a deposit of $50,000 for office building and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $9,359, offset by increase in income tax payable of $800..





	For the three months ended March 31, 2016, net cash used in operating activities was $7,767. This was primarily due to a net loss of $4,575, adjusted by non-cash related expenses of depreciation of $2,118, then decreased by unfavorable changes in working capital of $5,310. The unfavorable changes in working capital mainly resulted from a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $6,110, offset by increase in income tax payable of $800.





	Investing Activities





	For the three months ended March 31, 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $41,648. This was primarily due to an advance to affiliated companies of $41,648.





	For the three months ended March 31, 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $14,988. This was primarily due to an advance to affiliated companies of $14,988.





	Financing activities





	For the three months ended March 31, 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was $74,702 which was mainly resulted from net proceeds from note payable from officers of $5,001 and the outstanding checks payable of $70,928, offset by payments on auto loan of $1,227.





	For the three months ended March 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $8,774 which was mainly resulted from an advance from note payable from officers of $10,000, offset by payments on auto loan of $1,226.





	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES


	 


	The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the our financial statements and the accompanying notes. The amounts of assets and liabilities reported on our balance sheet and the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for each of our fiscal periods are affected by estimates and assumptions, which are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for revenue recognition, stock based compensation and the valuation of deferred taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The following critical accounting policies are significantly affected by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements:


	 


	Revenue Recognition


	 


	Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 605, "Revenue Recognition" outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provide guidance for presentation of revenue and for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies in financial statements filed with Securities and Exchange Commission. Management believes the Company's revenue recognition policies conform to ASC 605.   


	 


	Revenues are mainly consulting fees. The Consulting fees are recognized when earned.  Consulting fees subject to refund are recorded as deferred revenue until the project is completed and the fees are no longer refundable. 









	13








	Table of Contents







	Income Taxes


	 


	The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740, "Income Taxes." Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Management provides a valuation allowance for significant deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such asset will not be recovered.











	ITEM 3. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES





	Our management evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this Report.  Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Our disclosure controls and procedures include components of our internal control over financial reporting and, as such, are designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management.  Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is expressed at the level of reasonable assurance that the control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met (see the section below in this Item 3 entitled

	Limitations on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls

	).


	 


	Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting


	 


	There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that occurred during the period covered by this Report, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.


	 


	Limitations on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls


	 


	Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all fraud and material error. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving our objectives and our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at that reasonable assurance level. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the internal control. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
