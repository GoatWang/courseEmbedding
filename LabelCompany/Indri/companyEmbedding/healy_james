                                Report abuseTranscript of Healy v. JamesHealy v. James, 408 U.S. 169 (1972)FACTSIn September, 1969, a group of students at Central Connecticut State College, a state-supported institution, started procedures to organize a local chapter of the Students for a Democratic Society and petitioned the Student Affairs Committee of the College for official recognition, according to the College regulations. Andy Bryant & Troy Lee CampbellChief Justice Warren E. Burger Justice William RehnquistJustice William O. DouglasJustice Harry BlackmunJustice Byron WhiteJustice Thurgood MarshallJustice William J. Brennan, Jr.Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.Justice Potter StewartISSUESIssue #1: Did the president and administration of the university have the right to reject the petition made by a group of college students to form an organization called the Central Connecticut State College local chapter of Students for a Democratic Society (CCSC local chapter of SDS)?FACTSThe committee voted 6-2 to recommend that the petition and application be granted by the President , Dr. James. President James rejected the application, stating that he could not recognize a group with policies (whether local or national) contrary to the approved College policies, especially since the question of the group's national affiliation was unclear to him.REASONING/ANALYSIS OF THE COURTJustice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, Justice William O. Douglas, Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., Justice Potter Stewart, Justice Byron White, Justice Thurgood Marshall, and Justice Harry Blackmun agreed. Justice Rehnquist agreed with the decision of the Court but disagreed from the majority opinion.  HOLDINGSThe Supreme Court determined the lower courts erred in their findings and reversed the decisions of the District Court and Court of Appeals by affirming the plaintiffs‚Äô First Amendment rights had been violated. The court reiterated that state colleges are not immune from First Amendment protection. REASONING/ANALYSIS OF THE COURTDenial of official recognition posed serious problems for the organization's existence and growth. Its members were deprived of the opportunity to place announcements regarding meetings, rallies, or other activities in the student newspaper; they were precluded from using various campus bulletin boards; and -- most importantly -- non-recognition barred them from using campus facilities for holding meetings.ISSUESSome background on SDS: It was a student group from the 1960‚Äôs first based on nonviolent disobedience that later manifested into more extreme tactics. By the mid 60‚Äôs, marijuana use at rallies was common and the Vietnam War became a large focus. Towards the end of the 60‚Äôs, the ‚Äúsit-in‚Äù was a common disruptive tactic used and many erupted into violence leading to injuries and arrests. HOLDINGSThe burden of proof to show a group would be disruptive should be placed on the university and denying them recognition was a restraint of free speech.Having a relationship with a larger national organization was not reason enough to deny recognition.The president of the university being in disagreement with the philosophy of the group was also not enough reason to deny recognitionIMPORTANCE TO HIGHER EDUCATIONA year later, in Papish v. Board of Curators of the University of Missouri, 410 U.S. 667 (1973), the Court said Healy made "clear that the mere dissemination of ideas - no matter how offensive to good taste - on a state university campus may not be shut off in the name alone of 'conventions of decency.'" IMPORTANCE TO HIGHER EDUCATIONGay Students Organization of the University of New Hampshire v. Bonner (1st Cir. 1974). GSO was an officially recognized campus organization and after it sponsored a dance on campus the state governor criticized the school. in reaction the university announced that GSO could no longer hold social events on campus. Healy was the controlling precedent, even though GSO had not been denied recognition. ISSUESIssue #2: Where the reasons the president gave for this rejection valid? Specifically the alleged affiliation with a violent group, the perceived philosophy of disruption and dissent, the expectation of real violence on their campus.SOURCESFindLaw's United States Supreme Court case and opinions.

Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"

"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."
