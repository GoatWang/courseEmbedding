Before joining Rocket, he was Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for Activant Solutions, a business management software company. Previously, Mr. Agle spent 14 years at Novell Inc. where he operated in several financial leadership roles including Vice President, CFO of Global Field Operations with financial responsibility for the $1 billion business. Mr. Agle began his career with Ernst & Young and is a licensed CPA (inactive) in California, with both a bachelor’s degree in accounting and a master’s of accountancy from Brigham Young University.
“Brian is a seasoned financial executive with extensive experience leading global financial organizations in technology and software businesses with a history of leading and completing business transformations, and a strong discipline in cost and cash management,” said Louis Hernandez, Jr., chairman, president and chief executive officer of Avid. “His experience in enterprise software and recurring revenue models such as SaaS business models makes him an ideal fit as Avid increasingly shifts its own business to more cloud-based subscriptions and enterprise software models.”
Mr. Hernandez added, “As we conducted the search process it was important that we found the right individual to both assist us in the completion of our transformation in Q2 2017, and contribute into the future as we transition to a focus on growth in the second half of 2017 and beyond. Brian has the right profile to help the company make this transition successfully.”
“It is clear to me that Avid has an incredible brand, a committed team, supportive and engaged clients, and has continued its industry-defining innovation once again with its Avid Everywhere platform strategy,” said Brian E. Agle, Avid’s incoming senior vice president and chief financial officer. “While company transformations are never easy, I’ve been impressed with the progress they’ve made on this ambitious transformation and can see the pieces coming together. I look forward to helping the Avid team drive to the end of the transformation and shift to a focus on growth, earnings and cash flow.”
Ilan Sidi, who served as interim Chief Financial Officer while the search was being conducted, will help support the transition of the finance, accounting and investor relations functions to Mr. Agle over the next several weeks, and will resume his role as the Vice President of Human Resources for the company.  
“On behalf of the board, the executive leadership and Avid team as a whole, I wish to thank Ilan for serving as the interim Chief Financial Officer these past several months,” continued Mr. Hernandez. “Ilan’s background and experience as a public company CFO allowed us to take the needed time to find the right individual to assume the CFO role during this important time in the execution of the company’s strategy.”
In connection with Mr. Agle’s appointment as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, on December 12, 2016 the Company expects to issue Mr. Agle 245,700 restricted stock units (RSUs) of the Company. The RSUs will vest as follows: 33.33% will vest on the first anniversary of the grant date, and an additional 8.33% will vest at the end of each three-month period, starting from the first anniversary of the grant date. The inducement grants were approved by Avid’s Compensation Committee and will be made as an inducement material to Mr. Agle’s acceptance of employment with the Company in accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(c)(4).
