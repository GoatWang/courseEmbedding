Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.

Five American Funds that Beat the First Index Fund’s Lifetime Results 







A look at the first index fund ― the Vanguard 500 Index Fund ― and the five U.S.-focused American Funds available when it launched confirms the following: The idea that you can’t beat the index over long-term periods is a myth. 





























The Potential for Greater Wealth 
As you can see, an investment manager with a proven track record of outpacing the market can produce significantly greater wealth than an index investment.
A comparison of the lifetime results of the first index fund to the results of five American Funds over that same period illustrates our advantage. Those funds are AMCAP Fund, American Mutual Fund, The Growth Fund of America, The Investment Company of America and Washington Mutual Investors Fund. The comparison is especially apt as that index fund was designed to track the S&P 500, which is also the benchmark for the five American Funds which seek to pursue investment objectives such as growth, income or preservation of capital. Watch and see how the American Funds fared since the index fund’s inception — from August 31, 1976, through December 31, 2016:

 Q&A: Why We Believe You Can Beat the Index 
 How Well Have American Funds Scored? 
 The Capital Advantage: A Closer Look 
 


























Figures shown are past results for Class A shares for American Funds (Investor shares for Vanguard 500 Index Fund) and are not predictive of results in future periods. Current and future results may be lower or higher than those shown. Share prices and returns will vary, so investors may lose money. Investing for short periods makes losses more likely. Unless otherwise indicated, American Funds returns are shown at maximum offering price (MOP) and reflect deduction of the 5.75% maximum sales charge at the beginning of the period shown. Thus, the net amount invested was $9,425 ($1,885/per fund in the American Funds Blend scenario.). The maximum initial sales charge  was 8.50% prior to July 1, 1988. All distributions were reinvested. The Vanguard fund has no up-front sales charge and is available in another share class with a lower expense ratio. This share class was not available for investment at the inception of the fund. The American Funds are now also available in less expensive share classes that do not feature a sales charge. Current information and month-end results for the Vanguard fund can be found at vanguard.com. For current information and month-end results for the American Funds, visit americanfunds.com.

  Fund Objectives, Investment Strategies and Risks  




















Objective(s)













Investment Strategies













Risks













 American Mutual Fund 









The fund strives for the balanced accomplishment of three objectives: current income, growth of capital and conservation of principal.











The fund seeks to invest primarily in common stocks of companies that are likely to participate in the growth of the American economy and whose dividends appear to be sustainable. Although the fund focuses on investments in medium to larger capitalization companies, the fund’s investments are not limited to a particular capitalization size. The fund invests primarily in securities of issuers domiciled in the United States and Canada. The fund may also invest in bonds and other debt securities, including those issued by the U.S. government and by federal agencies and instrumentalities.











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, AMF investors exposure includes the following risks:

Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds. Bond prices and a bond fund’s share price will generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates.
Income provided by the fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available for dividend payments at, the companies in which the fund invests.











 AMCAP Fund 









The fund’s investment objective is to provide you with long-term growth of capital. 











The fund invests primarily in common stocks of U.S. companies that have solid long-term growth records and the potential for good future growth. The fund may invest in common stocks and other securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States to a limited extent. 











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, AMCAP investors exposure includes the following risks:

Investing outside the United States involves risks such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries.
Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks. 











 The Growth Fund of America 









The fund’s investment objective is to provide you with growth of capital. 











The fund invests primarily in common stocks and seeks to invest in companies that appear to offer superior opportunities for growth of capital. The fund invests primarily in common stocks of large- and mid-capitalization issuers. The fund may invest up to 25% of its assets in securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States. 











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, GFA investors exposure includes the following risks:

Investing outside the United States involves risks such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries.
Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks. 











 The Investment Company of America 









The fund’s investment objectives are to achieve long-term growth of capital and income. 











The fund invests primarily in common stocks, most of which have a history of paying dividends. In the selection of common stocks and other securities for investment, potential for capital appreciation and future dividends are given more weight than current yield. Although the fund focuses on investments in medium to larger capitalization companies, the fund’s investments are not limited to a particular capitalization size. The fund may invest up to 15% of its assets, at the time of purchase, in securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States. 











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, ICA investors exposure includes the following risks:

Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
Investing outside the United States involves risks such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries.
Income provided by the fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available for dividend payments at, the companies in which the fund invests. 











 Washington Mutual Investors Fund 









The fund’s investment objective is to produce income and to provide an opportunity for growth of principal consistent with sound common stock investing. 











The fund invests primarily in common stocks of established companies that are listed on, or meet the financial listing requirements of, the New York Stock Exchange and have a strong record of earnings and dividends. In the selection of common stocks and other securities for investment, current and potential yield as well as the potential for long-term capital appreciation are considered. The fund seeks to provide an above-average yield in relation to the S&P 500 Index. The fund strives to maintain a fully invested, diversified portfolio, consisting primarily of high-quality common stocks. 











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, WMIF investors exposure includes the following risks:

Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
Income provided by the fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available for dividend payments at, the companies in which the fund invests. 











 Vanguard 500 Index Fund 









The Fund seeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of large- capitalization stocks. 











The fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the Standard & Poor‘s 500 Index, a widely recognized benchmark of U.S. stock market performance that is dominated by the stocks of large U.S. companies. The Fund attempts to replicate the target index by investing all, or substantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the Index, holding each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the Index. 











The fund exposes investors to the risks inherent in investing in stocks of companies domiciled in the U.S., including the volatility that comes with its full exposure to the stock market. 

















































*Figures shown are for the period August 31, 1976, the inception date of the first index fund, through March 31, 2017. Standard deviation is a measure of how returns over time have varied from the mean and is one of the most common measures of absolute volatility. A lower number signifies lower volatility.
†The Vanguard 500 Index Fund has no up-front sales charge
Actively managed funds typically have higher turnover than index funds, which may have tax implications. Portfolio turnover is a measure of how frequently assets within a fund are bought and sold within a 12-month period. The lower the percentage, the less buying and selling took place. 
Expense ratios are as of each fund’s prospectus. 











Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses. Expense ratios are as of each fund’s prospectus available at time of publication. When applicable, investment results reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which results would have been lower. Please see americanfunds.com for more information. Source for industry average expense ratios is Lipper, based on comparable categories for front-end load funds (except for the Vanguard fund, which is no load, not front-end load), excluding funds of funds, as of each fund’s most recent fiscal year-end available as of March 31, 2017. The Lipper categories for the funds are: AMCAP Fund (Growth); The Growth Fund of America (Large-Cap Growth); The Investment Company of America, Washington Mutual Investors Fund and American Mutual Fund (Growth & Income); and Vanguard 500 Index Fund (S&P 500 Index Objective Funds).

Compare mutual funds with high manager ownership and low fees.

American Funds Have Two Important Traits 



 
 










When you compare mutual funds, it’s not surprising that funds from investment managers who “eat their own cooking” — investing more of their own money in the funds they oversee — have tended to outpace the market index more frequently than their peers. It’s also logical that funds with lower expense ratios have tended to outpace the index more frequently. Combining these two traits — high manager ownership and low expense ratios — can help you identify a select group of funds with a track record of outpacing indexes over long periods.1









 Characteristics of Core Funds That Added Value  Two Screens Can Help Sharpen Your Search  





    





Source: Capital Group, based on Morningstar® data.1 






















 






Narrowing Your Search


















 
 










The sheer number of available funds can be overwhelming. We examined the large universe of equity funds in Morningstar’s U.S. and foreign large-cap categories over a 20-year period and looked for funds with two traits: those within the lowest 25% of expenses, and those within the highest 25% in manager ownership. We found that the funds with both characteristics (highest manager ownership and lowest expense ratios) meaningfully improved average outcomes for investors.







 Look for Funds That Meet Two Key Criteria  Large-Cap Equity Funds With Low Expense Ratios and High Manager Ownership  











Source: Capital Group, based on Morningstar data.2






















 






Boosting Success Rates





 
 










As shown in the chart below, not all funds are equal. Most, in fact, rarely outpace the index. However, funds with the lowest expenses have tended to do better than their peers. And funds with high manager ownership have done even better than that. Significantly, the group of funds that share both those characteristics have done better over five- and 10-year periods.
A portfolio of large-cap funds with lower expense ratios and higher manager ownership, on average, outpaced indexes more frequently than other funds. Since large-cap funds account for a big part of most portfolios, those higher success rates can result in substantial gains. 











 Two Steps Raised the Success Rate  Success Rates in Large-Cap Equities (Net of Fees)  





























Source: Capital Group, based on Morningstar data.1
































1 Source: Capital Group, based on Morningstar data. Based on monthly returns from January 1997 to December 2016. U.S. funds are those in the Morningstar Large Value, Large Blend and Large Growth categories. U.S. index is S&P 500. International funds are those in the Morningstar Foreign Large Value, Foreign Large Blend and Foreign Large Growth categories. International index is MSCI ACWI ex USA. The indexes are unmanaged and, therefore, have no expenses. Investors cannot invest directly in an index. Unless otherwise indicated, all distributions were reinvested. For more information about the screening process, see Methodology. 
2 Data as of December 31, 2016. Domestic funds are those in the Morningstar Large Value, Large Blend and Large Growth categories. International funds are those in the Morningstar Foreign Large Value, Foreign Large Blend and Foreign Large Growth categories. Size of quartiles varies because those funds in the Morningstar database that did not include an expense ratio or firm-level investment ownership were excluded from the analysis. For more information about the screening process, see Methodology.

















Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.

Select Funds Can Reduce Risk
Index funds fall as far as the market they track, but investors don’t have to. Over time they can gain more by losing less.





















  AUGUST 2016





Share




 
 















Gain by Losing Less
There are two ways to beat the index and fuel investment growth – earn more than the market or lose less than the market.
Losing less – the so-called low-downside capture approach – holds appeal for investors. Especially considering that 78% of them list protecting assets as their top investment priority but only about half are aware that index funds expose them to 100% of market downturns. 

Downside capture:
A fund’s downside capture ratio is an indication of whether a fund has lost more or less than the market during periods of market weakness. For example, if over the course of a downturn a fund fell only 96% as far as the market, its downside capture ratio is 96%. If it fell 5% more than the market, its downside capture ratio is 105%. 














  See how American Funds delivered index-beating returns by losing less  







    






                A closer look at the power of low “downside capture” shows how our U.S. stock focused goods have tended to beat the index even as they trailed the market during the good times.  
              

























Why It Matters
Consistently losing less during downturns can be instrumental in producing larger balances and superior outcomes for long-term investors. Funds that limit downside risk tend to also provide a smoother ride, making it easier for those with long-term objectives to stay the course during turbulent markets.




















The Arithmetic of Loss
The ability to achieve superior outcomes by losing less is an example of what’s known as the arithmetic of loss. Consider the following:
If a $1,000 investment loses 50%, its value drops to $500. In order for the investment to return to the $1,000 level, that $500 must do more than gain 50% (which would only bring it to $750); it needs to double.
Digging out of a hole is never easy, but the shallower the hole, the shorter the climb.










Better Positioned by Losing Less
The farther an investment falls, the longer the path back to break even. Some funds offer the potential to hold on to more of one’s investment during market declines which leaves investors better positioned for a rebound.








































To Mitigate Risk, Seek Funds That Have Held Up Better During Declines
Looking at a fund’s downside capture ratio — a comparison of how far it has fallen relative to its index during downturns — is one way to evaluate its riskiness.
When we added downside capture to two other screening criteria — low expenses and high levels of manager investment — we uncovered a group of funds that has, on average, delivered index-beating results.









Finding Funds That Can Mitigate Risk
Within the universe of Large Cap U.S. funds, screening for funds with downside resilience — funds that capture less of a market decline than the index — results in a lower risk group that, on average, outpaced its peers as well as the S&P 500 Index.
Further narrowing the low-downside group using low expenses and high manager ownership as additional screening criteria increased the advantage over the index and reduced risk further. The chart shown here is based on data for rolling five-year periods for the 20 years ended December 31, 2015.




















See methodology.























Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.

During the weekend of August 22/23, our third-party Administrator (The Bank of New York Mellon – BNYM) experienced a technical malfunction resulting in it being unable to calculate timely NAVs for its mutual funds and ETF clients, including the PowerShares ETFs. As we disclosed to you last week, we experienced a delay in the dissemination of the NAV. PowerShares worked aggressively with BNYM to resolve the issue. We are pleased to report that the malfunction has been corrected by the Administrator and that the system is back to normal. The NAV that is being disseminated today is the most recent NAV for the Funds (as of Thursday, September 3).
For primary market participants, please note that, in accordance with the Prospectus and the SAI for each PowerShares ETF, orders received before the cut-off time on any given day were processed at the NAV that was calculated by the Administrator for that day. Given the delay in the calculation and dissemination of the NAV by the Administrator, we expect that most of the orders that the Administrator received last week will settle in the normal settlement cycle. Certain orders may experience (or have experienced) a  delay in settlement. Secondary market transactions were not affected by the delay and  are anticipated to settle in ordinary course.
See detailed list of last week's NAVs  
For additional information please contact PowerShares at 1-800-983-0903.

Equity - International and Global Equity




Product Details
The BLDRS Emerging Markets 50 ADR Index Fund (Fund) seeks to provide investment results that correspond generally, before fees and expenses, to the price and yield performance  of the BNY Mellon Emerging Markets 50 ADR Index (Index). The Fund normally holds at least 95% of its total assets in depositary receipts (DR) that comprise the Index. The Index is capitalization-weighted and designed to track the performance of approximately 50 emerging market-based DRs. The Fund and the Index are rebalanced and reconstituted quarterly. The Fund is an "index fund" that holds publicly traded DRs, negotiable U.S. securities that generally represent a non-U.S. company's publicly traded equity or debt, of non-U.S. companies in a particular geographic region or market represented by a specified relevant benchmark BNY Mellon ADR Index.

Market returns are based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4 p.m. ET and do not represent the returns an investor would receive if shares were traded at other times. Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be higher or lower than performance data quoted. After-tax returns reflect the highest federal income tax rate but exclude state and local taxes. Fund performance reflects applicable fee waivers, absent which, performance data quoted would have been lower. After Tax Held and After Tax Sold are based on NAV. Returns less than one year are cumulative.

Distribution Information



Fund Distributions

Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid either quarterly or monthly, depending on the Fund. For Funds on a quarterly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the third Friday of each March, June, September and December, payable the last business day of the month. For Funds on a monthly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the 15th of each month, payable the last business day of the month. 
The fund distributes its net realized capital gains, if any, to shareholders annually. Prior to paying a distribution of net investment income, the fund has the ability to invest cash generated from investment income into additional securities or money market instruments.
Distributions in cash may be reinvested automatically in additional whole shares of the fund only if the broker through whom you purchased shares makes such option available. Shareholders of the fund may contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation. Brokers may require shareholders to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the fund purchased in the secondary market. 
Taxes on Distributions
In general, your distributions are subject to federal income tax when they are paid, whether you take them in cash or reinvest them in the Fund. Dividends paid out of the Fund’s income and net short-term gains, if any, are taxable as ordinary income. Distributions of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses are taxable as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Shares. Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid quarterly. The Fund may also pay a special distribution at the end of the calendar year to comply with federal tax requirements. 
Under the provisions of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (the “2003 Tax Act”), long-term capital gains tax rates have generally been reduced for individuals to a maximum of 15% for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2009. In addition, some ordinary dividends declared and paid by the Fund to individual shareholders may qualify for taxation at the lower reduced tax rates applicable to long-term capital gains, provided that holding period and other requirements are met by the Fund and the shareholder. 
Distributions in excess of the Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits are treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of your basis in the Shares, and as capital gain thereafter. A distribution will reduce the Fund’s net asset value per Share and may be taxable to you as ordinary income or capital gain even though, from an investment standpoint, the distribution may constitute a return of capital. 
By law, the Fund must withhold a percentage of your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number. The backup withholding rate is currently 28%.

Shareholders may pay more than net asset value when they buy Fund shares and receive less than net asset value when they sell those shares, because shares are bought and sold at current market prices. Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results.

 Risk & Other Information 
 
Typically, security classifications used in calculating allocation tables are as of the last trading day of the previous month. There are risks involved with investing in ETFs, including possible loss of money. Shares are not actively managed and are subject to risks similar to those of stocks, including those regarding short selling and margin maintenance requirements. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. The Fund's return may not match the return of the Underlying Index. The Fund is subject to certain other risks. Please see the current prospectus for more information regarding the risk associated with an investment in the Fund. Depositary receipts involve many of the same risks as a direct investment in foreign securities, and issuers of certain depositary receipts are under no obligation to distribute shareholder communications to the holders or to pass through to them any voting rights with respect to the deposited securities. The risks of investing in securities of foreign issuers, including emerging market issuers, can include fluctuations in foreign currencies, political and economic instability, and foreign taxation issues. The Fund may invest in foreign markets and because foreign exchanges may be open on days when the Fund does not price its shares, the value of the non-US securities in the Fund's portfolio may change on days when you will not be able to purchase or sell your shares. The Fund may hold illiquid securities that it may be unable to sell at the preferred time or price and could lose its entire investment in such securities. The Fund is non-diversified and may experience greater volatility than a more diversified investment.  The Sponsor may direct the Trustee to terminate and liquidate the Fund – See "Termination of a Fund" in the prospectus for further information. In the event the Fund is terminated, the trading pattern of the Fund's Shares could be negatively affected. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index and the MSCI EAFE® Index are unmanaged indexes considered representative of stocks of developing countries; and stocks of Europe, Australasia and the Far East, respectively. These indexes are computed using the net return, which withholds applicable taxes for non-resident investors. The S&P 500® Index is an unmanaged index considered representative of the US stock market. The Global Industry Classification Standard was developed by and is the exclusive property and a service mark of MSCI, Inc. and Standard & Poor's.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the Commission's Public Reference Branch, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549-0102 (tel. 202-942-8090). 
Applicants' Representations:
1. BLDRS Trust and Nasdaq-100 Trust (together, the “Trusts”) are unit investment trusts organized under New York law and registered under the Act. BLDRS Trust is comprised of separate series (“BLDRS Index Funds”). The BLDRS Index Funds and the Nasdaq-100 Trust (together, the “NFPS ETFs”) seek to provide investment results that correspond generally, before fees and expenses, to the price and yield performance of specified benchmark indices (“Indices” or “Benchmark Indices”). The NFPS ETFs operate as exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”). NFPS is the sponsor of each NFPS ETF. 
2. Applicants request relief to permit registered management investment companies and unit investment trusts to acquire shares of the Nasdaq-100 Trust (“Nasdaq-100 Shares”) and of the BLDRS Index Funds (“Trust Shares,” and together with Nasdaq-100 Shares, “Units”) beyond the limitations in section 12(d)(1)(A). To the extent that an Investing Fund (as defined below) owns 5% or more of the Units of an NFPS ETF, applicants further request relief from sections 17(a)(1) and (2) of the Act to permit such an NFPS ETF, as an affiliated person of the Investing Fund, to sell Units to, and redeem Units from, the Investing Fund. Applicants request that the relief apply to (i) Nasdaq-100 Trust; (ii) BLDRS Trust and each registered unit investment trust that operates as an ETF, is currently or subsequently part of the same “group of investment companies” as BLDRS Trust within the meaning of section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the Act, and is sponsored by NFPS or an entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with NFPS (included in the defined term “NFPS ETFs”); and (iii) registered management investment companies (“Investing Management Companies”) and unit investment trusts (“Investing Trusts”) that are not sponsored or advised by NFPS or an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with NFPS and that are not part of the same “group of investment companies” as the Trusts within the meaning of section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the Act. Investing Management Companies and Investing Trusts are collectively referred to as “Investing Funds.” [1] 
           Investing Trusts do not include NFPS ETFs. Each Investing Management Company will be advised by an investment adviser that is registered under the Advisers Act or exempt from registration (“Advisor”) and may be advised by investment adviser(s) within the meaning of section 2(a)(20)(B) of the Act (each, a “Subadviser”). 
3. Applicants state that the NFPS ETFs will offer the Investing Funds simple and efficient vehicles to achieve their asset allocation, diversification and other investment objectives, and to implement various investment strategies. Among other purposes, applicants assert that the NFPS ETFs provide instant and highly liquid exposure to the markets represented by each Benchmark Index and permit investors to achieve such exposure through a single transaction instead of the many transactions that might otherwise be needed to obtain comparable market exposure. 
Applicants' Legal Analysis
A. Section 12(d)(1) 
1. Section 12(d)(1)(A) of the Act prohibits a registered investment company from acquiring shares of an investment company if the securities represent more than 3% of the total outstanding voting stock of the acquired company, more than 5% of the total assets of the acquiring company, or together with the securities of any other investment companies, more than 10% of the total assets of the acquiring company. 
2. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions, from any provision of section 12(d)(1) if the exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors. Applicants seek an exemption under section 12(d)(1)(J) to permit the Investing Funds to acquire Units beyond the limits set forth in section 12(d)(1)(A). 
3. Applicants state that the proposed arrangement and conditions will adequately address the policy concerns underlying section 12(d)(1)(A), which include concerns about undue influence by a fund of funds over underlying funds, excessive layering of fees, and overly complex fund structures. Accordingly, applicants believe that the requested exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors. 
4. Applicants state that the proposed arrangement will not result in undue influence by an Investing Fund or its affiliates over the NFPS ETFs. To limit the influence that an Investing Fund may have over an NFPS ETF, applicants propose a condition that prohibits the Advisor or a sponsor to an Investing Trust (“Sponsor”) and certain affiliates from controlling (individually or in the aggregate) an NFPS ETF within the meaning of section 2(a)(9) of the Act. The condition also prohibits any Subadviser and certain affiliates from controlling (individually or in the aggregate) an NFPS ETF within the meaning of section 2(a)(9) of the Act. To limit further the potential for undue influence by the Investing Funds over the NFPS ETFs, applicants propose conditions 2, 3 and 4, stated below, to preclude an Investing Fund and its affiliated entities from taking advantage of an NFPS ETF with respect to transactions between the entities and to ensure the transactions will be on an arm's length basis. 
5. As an additional assurance that an Investing Fund understands the implications of an investment by it in an NFPS ETF under the requested order, each Investing Fund and Trust will execute an agreement (“Investing Fund Agreement”) stating that the board of directors or trustees (“Board”) of, and the Advisor and any Subadviser to, an Investing Management Company, and the Sponsor and trustee of an Investing Trust (“Trustee”), as applicable, understand the terms and conditions of the order and agree to fulfill their responsibilities under the order. 
6. Applicants do not believe that the proposed arrangement will involve excessive layering of fees. Applicants state that because each NFPS ETF is a unit investment trust that does not charge any advisory fee, there will be no layered or duplicative advisory fees. Further, applicants note that Units are sold without sales charges, and Start Printed Page 13074applicants propose a condition that precludes any sales charges and/or service fees charged with respect to shares of an Investing Fund from exceeding the limits applicable to a fund of funds under Conduct Rule 2830 of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (“Rule 2830”). The Advisor, or Trustee or Sponsor, as applicable, of an Investing Fund also will waive fees otherwise payable to it by the Investing Fund in an amount at least equal to any compensation received by the Advisor, or Trustee or Sponsor, or an affiliated person of the Advisor, or Trustee or Sponsor, from an NFPS ETF in connection with the investment by the Investing Fund in the NFPS ETF. Any Subadviser will waive fees otherwise payable to it by an Investing Management Company in an amount at least equal to any compensation received by the Subadviser, or its affiliate, in connection with any investment by the Investing Management Company in the NFPS ETF that is made at the direction of the Subadviser. 
7. Applicants submit that the proposed arrangement will not create an overly complex fund structure. Applicants note that the NFPS ETFs will be prohibited from acquiring securities of any investment company, or company relying on section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Act, in excess of the limits contained in section 12(d)(1)(A). Applicants also represent that the Investing Fund Agreement will require an Investing Fund that exceeds the 5% or 10% limitation in section 12(d)(1)(A)(ii) or (iii), respectively, to disclose in its prospectus that it may invest in ETFs and to disclose, in “plain English,” in its prospectus the unique characteristics of the Investing Fund investing in ETFs, including but not limited to the expense structure and any additional expenses of investing in ETFs. 
B. Section 17(a) 
1. Section 17(a) of the Act generally prohibits sales or purchases of securities between a registered investment company and any affiliated person of the company. Section 2(a)(3)(B) of the Act defines an “affiliated person” of another person to include any person 5% or more of whose outstanding voting securities are directly or indirectly owned, controlled, or held with power to vote by the other person. 
2. Applicants state that an NFPS ETF could become an affiliated person of an Investing Fund if the Investing Fund acquires 5% or more of an NFPS ETF's securities. Although applicants believe that most Investing Funds will purchase Units in the secondary market and not directly from an NFPS ETF, an Investing Fund might seek to transact directly with an NFPS ETF.[2] 
           Section 17(a) could prevent an NFPS ETF from selling Units to, and redeeming Units from, an Investing Fund that owns 5% or more of an NFPS ETF. 
3. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to grant an order permitting a transaction otherwise prohibited by section 17(a) if it finds that (i) the terms of the proposed transaction are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (ii) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of each registered investment company involved; and (iii) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act. Section 6(c) of the Act permits the Commission to exempt any persons or transactions from any provision of the Act if such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. 
4. Applicants submit that the proposed arrangement satisfies the standards for relief under sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act. Applicants state that the terms of the arrangement are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching. Applicants note that any consideration for the purchase or redemption of Units directly from an NFPS ETF will be based on the net asset value (“NAV”) of the NFPS ETF. Applicants state that the proposed arrangement will be consistent with the policies of each Investing Fund and NFPS ETF, and with the general purposes of the Act. Applicants also believe that the requested exemption is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. 
C. Prior Orders 
1. Applicants seek to amend certain prior exemptive orders (“Prior Orders”).[3] 
           Specifically, applicants seek to amend condition 2 to each of the Prior Orders so that it is consistent with the relief being requested from section 12(d)(1). Condition 2 currently provides that each NFPS ETF prospectus and Product Description [4] 
           will clearly disclose that, for purposes of the Act, Units are issued by the NFPS ETF and that the acquisition of Units by investment companies is subject to the restrictions of section 12(d)(1) of the Act. Under new condition 2, Investing Funds will be alerted that they may invest in the NFPS ETFs in excess of the limits of section 12(d)(1) to the extent that they comply with the terms and conditions of the requested order granting relief from section 12(d)(1), including the requirement that they enter into an Investing Fund Agreement with the NFPS ETF regarding the terms of the investment. Applicants will replace current condition 2 in BLDRS Trust's Prior Order with condition 9, as stated below, and in Nasdaq-100 Trust's Prior Order with condition 12, as stated below. 
2.

Start Preamble
        
        
        
        February 28, 2007. 
        
          AGENCY:
Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”). 
ACTION:

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:
Jaea F. Hahn, Senior Counsel, at (202) 551-6870, or Janet M. Grossnickle, Branch Chief, at (202) 551-6821 (Division of Investment Management, Office of Investment Company Regulation). 
Applicants' Representations 
1. Each Trust is a unit investment trust that is or will be organized under the laws of the State of New York. The Sponsor is a wholly owned subsidiary of AIM Management Group Inc.[2] 
             The Bank of New York (“BoNY”) acts as trustee to each Trust (“Trustee”) pursuant to a trust agreement entered into by and between BoNY and the Initial Sponsor (each a “Trust Agreement”). The Distributor is registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and serves, on an agency basis, as principal underwriter of the Trusts. 
2. Each Trust holds a portfolio of securities (“Portfolio Securities”) consisting of substantially all of the securities in substantially the same weighting as the component securities of the Benchmark Index that it tracks (the “Index Securities”). There are currently four Trusts (“Current Trusts”).[3] 
             The Benchmark Indices for the Current Trusts (the “Initial Benchmark Indices”) are compiled by BoNY (the “BoNY Index Provider”).[4] 
             Pursuant to guidelines adopted by BoNY for the Index Provider, the BoNY personnel involved in compiling the Benchmark Indices cannot include any BoNY employees who are members of the BoNY division that provides trustee services to the Trusts, any broker-dealer affiliated with BoNY, BoNY's asset management division, or BoNY's private banking group. 
3. In the future, applicants may offer additional Trusts based on other Benchmark Indices (“Future Trusts”). Any Future Trust will (a) be organized under New York state law pursuant to a trust agreement substantially identical to the Trust Agreements, (b) be sponsored by the Sponsor, and (c) comply with the terms and conditions of the requested order. No entity that creates, compiles, sponsors or maintains a Benchmark Index will be an affiliated person, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Act, or an affiliated person of an affiliated person, of the Sponsor, Distributor or promoter of a Trust. 
4. Trust Shares, units of beneficial interest in the Trusts, are designed to provide investors with an instrument that closely tracks the Benchmark Indices, trades like a share of common stock, and pays periodic dividends proportionate to those paid by the Index Securities to the extent they exceed the Trust's fees and expenses.[5] 
             The Trustee makes adjustments to the Portfolio Securities to reflect changes made by the BoNY Index Provider to the composition and weighting of the Index Securities.[6] 
             All adjustments to the Portfolio Securities are made by the Trustee as set forth in the Trust Agreements and are non-discretionary. Applicants state that the Trustee, consistent with its fiduciary duties, may utilize a broker-dealer that is an “affiliated person,” as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Act, of the Trustee (each, an “Affiliated Broker-Dealer”) in executing the transactions that are necessitated by the required adjustment(s).[7] 
             Applicants state that neither BoNY nor any Affiliated Broker-Dealer purchases or sells DRs on a principal basis, or intends to sell DRs or any other securities to any Trust on a principal basis. BoNY and its Affiliated Broker-Dealers would engage in transactions with a Trust on an agency basis only. 
5. Trust fees and expenses are first paid out of income received by the Trust in the form of dividends and other distributions on Portfolio Securities.[8] 
             Each Trust pays the Trustee a fee ranging from 0.06% to 0.10% of the net asset value (“NAV”) of the Trust on an annualized basis, such percentage to vary based on the NAV of the Trust. The Trustee in its discretion may waive all or any portion of such fee. 
6. Pursuant to a license agreement (“License Agreement”), the BoNY Index Start Printed Page 9789Provider has granted the Sponsor a license to use the Benchmark Indices and certain trademarks of BoNY. The Sponsor will pay the BoNY Index Provider an annual licensing fee for each Benchmark Index and will seek reimbursement from each Trust for the fee charged in connection with its Benchmark Index. The Sponsor will pay the Distributor a flat annual fee for services provided to the Trusts. The Sponsor will not seek reimbursement from any Trust for such payment without obtaining prior exemptive relief from the Commission. 
7. Trust Shares are issued in aggregations of 50,000 shares (“Creation Units”). Orders to purchase Creation Units generally must be delivered to the Distributor through a party that has executed a participant agreement with the Distributor and Trustee, and is either (a) a participant in the Continuous Net Settlement System of the National Securities Clearing Corporation (“NSCC,” and the NSCC process of placing orders, the “Trust Shares Clearing Process”), or (b) a Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) participant, but such entity or person is not required to be a Nasdaq member. 
8. An investor wishing to purchase a Creation Unit from the Trust will have to transfer to the Trustee a “Portfolio Deposit,” consisting of the following: (a) A portfolio of securities substantially similar in composition and weighting to the Index Securities (“Deposit Securities”); [9] 
             (b) a cash payment equal to the dividends accrued on the Portfolio Securities since the last dividend payment on the Portfolio Securities, net of expenses and liabilities (“Income Net of Expense Amount”); and (c) a cash payment or credit to equalize any differences between the market value of the Deposit Securities and the NAV of the Trust on a per Creation Unit basis (“Balancing Amount,” and together with the Income Net of Expense Amount, the “Cash Component”).[10] 
             The Sponsor or its designee makes available on each Business Day a list of the names and the required number of shares of each of the Deposit Securities in the current Portfolio Deposit, as well as the Income Net of Expense Amount, effective through and including the previous Business Day, per outstanding Trust Share.[11] 
             The Sponsor or its designee makes available on the Exchange, every 15 seconds of each Business Day, the sum of the Income Net of Expense Amount and the value of the Deposit Securities, on a per Trust Share basis. An investor making a Portfolio Deposit is charged a service fee (“Transaction Fee”) to be paid to the Trustee to defray the Trustee's costs in processing transactions for the Trust.[12] 

9. Orders to purchase Creation Units are placed with the Distributor, who is responsible for transmitting orders to the Trustee. The Distributor issues confirmations of acceptance, issues delivery instructions to the Trustee to implement the delivery of Creation Units, and maintains records of the orders and the confirmations. The Distributor also is responsible for delivering prospectuses to purchasers of Creation Units and may provide certain other administrative services. 
10. Persons purchasing Creation Units from the Trust may hold the Trust Shares or sell some, or all, of them in the secondary market. Trust Shares of the Current Trusts are listed on Nasdaq and all Trust Shares will be listed on a national securities exchange as defined in section 2(a)(26) of the Act (“Exchange”). Trust Shares are traded in the secondary market as individual units (i.e., in less than Creation Units) in the same manner as other equity securities. Participating Parties act as market makers (“Market Makers”) on Nasdaq and maintain a market for Trust Shares.[13] 
             The price of each Trust Share that trades on Nasdaq is based on the current bid-offer market. Transactions involving Trust Shares on Nasdaq are subject to customary brokerage commissions and charges. Applicants state that the price at which Trust Shares trade is disciplined by arbitrage opportunities created by the continuous ability to purchase or redeem Creation Units at their NAV, which ensures that Trust Shares do not trade at a material premium or discount in relation to their NAV.[14] 

11. Purchasers of Creation Units include institutional investors and arbitrageurs, which include institutional investors. Market Makers or specialists of an Exchange also may purchase Trust Shares in connection with their market making activities. Secondary market purchasers of Trust Shares include both institutional and retail investors.[15] 

12. Applicants make available a standard Trust Shares product description (“Product Description”) to members and member organizations for Start Printed Page 9790distribution to investors purchasing Trust Shares in accordance with Exchange rules. Currently, the rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers (“NASD”) require that NASD members distribute a Product Description to all purchasers of Trust Shares. The Product Description provides a plain English overview of a Trust, including the material risks and potential rewards of owning Trust Shares, and discloses the salient aspects of Trust Shares. The Product Description advises investors that a prospectus for Trust Shares is available without charge from the investor's broker or from the Distributor. Applicants believe that the volume of purchase transactions in which an investor will not receive a Product Description does not constitute a significant portion of the market activity in Trust Shares. 
13. Trust Shares are not individually redeemable, except upon termination of the Trust. Trust Shares are redeemable in Creation Units only. An investor redeeming a Creation Unit will receive a portfolio of securities typically identical in composition and weighting to the Deposit Securities as of the date the redemption request was made (“Redemption Securities”). The redeeming investor may receive the cash equivalent of an Index Security (a) when the Trustee determines that an Index Security is likely to be unavailable or available in insufficient quantity for delivery by the Trust, or (b) upon the request of the redeeming investor (because, for example, the redeeming investor is restricted by regulation or otherwise from holding an Index Security). The redeeming investor also may receive, or may pay, cash in an amount equal to the Cash Component in effect on the relevant Business Day for Portfolio Deposits (“Cash Redemption Amount”). The redeeming investor will pay a Transaction Fee, which will be calculated in the same manner as a Transaction Fee payable in connection with the purchase of a Creation Unit on the relevant Business Day. 
14. Because each Trust ordinarily redeems in kind, rather than in cash, the Trustee will not have to maintain cash reserves for redemptions. This allows the assets of each Trust to be committed as fully as possible to tracking the relevant Benchmark Index, and allows each Trust to track the relevant Benchmark Index more closely than other market basket products that must allocate a portion of their assets to cash for redemptions. 
Applicants' Legal Analysis 
1. Applicants request an order under (a) section 6(c) of the Act granting an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 4(2), 22(d), 24(d) and 26(a)(2)(C) of the Act and rule 22c-1 under the Act; (b) sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act granting an exemption from sections 17(a)(1) and (2) of the Act; and (c) section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 under the Act to permit certain joint transactions. 
2. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class of persons, securities, or transactions, if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. 
Sections 4(2) and 2(a)(32) of the Act 
3. Section 4(2) of the Act defines a UIT as an investment company that, among other things, issues only redeemable securities. Section 2(a)(32) of the Act defines a redeemable security as any security, other than short-term paper, under the terms of which the holder, upon its presentation to the issuer is entitled to receive approximately a proportionate share of the issuer's current net assets, or the cash equivalent. Because Trust Shares would not be individually redeemable, applicants request an order that would permit the Trust to register as a UIT and issue Trust Shares that are redeemable in Creation Units only. Applicants state that investors may purchase and redeem Trust Shares through the Trust in Creation Units. Applicants further state that, because the market price of Creation Units is disciplined by arbitrage opportunities, investors should be able to sell individual Trust Shares in the secondary market at approximately NAV. 
Section 22(d) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 Under the Act 
4. Section 22(d) of the Act, among other things, prohibits a dealer from selling a redeemable security that is being currently offered to the public by or through an underwriter, except at the current public offering price described in the prospectus. Rule 22c-1 under the Act generally requires that a dealer selling, redeeming, or repurchasing a redeemable security do so only at a price based on its NAV next computed after receipt of a tender of the security for redemption or of an order to purchase or sell the security. Applicants state that secondary market trading in Trust Shares takes place at negotiated prices, not at a current offering price described in the prospectus and not at a price based on NAV. Thus, purchases and sales of Trust Shares in the secondary market do not comply with section 22(d) and rule 22c-1, and applicants request an exemption from these provisions. 
5. Applicants maintain that, while there is little legislative history regarding section 22(d), its provisions and those of rule 22c-1 appear to have been designed to (a) prevent dilution caused by certain riskless trading schemes by principal underwriters and contract dealers, (b) prevent unjust discrimination or preferential treatment among buyers, and (c) assure an orderly distribution of shares by eliminating price competition from dealers offering shares at less than the published sales price and repurchasing shares at more than the published redemption price. Applicants believe that none of these purposes is thwarted by permitting Trust Shares to trade in the secondary market at negotiated prices. Applicants state that secondary market trading in Trust Shares does not involve the Trust directly and cannot, therefore, result in dilution of Trust assets. Applicants also state that, to the extent different prices exist during a trading day, or from day to day, for Trust Shares, such variances occur as a result of third-party market forces, such as supply and demand, and not as a result of unjust or discriminatory manipulation. Therefore, applicants assert that secondary market transactions in Trust Shares do not create discrimination or preferential treatment among buyers. Finally, applicants contend that the proposed distribution system is orderly because arbitrage activity ensures that the difference between the market price of Trust Shares and their NAV remains narrow. 
Section 24(d) of the Act 
6. Section 24(d) of the Act provides, in pertinent part, that the prospectus delivery exemption provided to dealer transactions by section 4(3) of the Securities Act does not apply to any transaction in a redeemable security issued by a UIT. Applicants request an exemption from section 24(d) to permit dealers in Trust Shares to rely on the prospectus delivery exemption provided by section 4(3) of the Securities Act.[16] 

Start Printed Page 9791
7. Applicants state that the secondary market for Trust Shares is significantly different from the typical secondary market for UIT securities, which is usually maintained by the sponsor of the UIT. Trust Shares are listed on an Exchange and trade in the same manner as listed securities issued by operating companies and closed-end investment companies. Dealers selling shares of operating companies and closed-end investment companies in the secondary market are generally not required to deliver a prospectus to a purchaser. 
8. Applicants contend that Trust Shares, as listed securities, merit a reduction in the compliance costs and regulatory burdens resulting from the imposition of prospectus delivery obligations in the secondary market. Because Trust Shares are exchange-listed, prospective investors have access to several types of market information about the product. Applicants state that quotations, last sale price, and volume information are continually available on a real-time basis through the consolidated tape and are available throughout the day on brokers' computer screens and other electronic services. The previous day's price and volume information also is published in the financial section of newspapers. The Sponsor publishes daily, on a per Trust Share basis, the Income Net of Expense Amount. The Fund's Web site contains quantitative information, updated on a daily basis, regarding the previous Business Day's NAV and the reported closing price. The Web site also includes for each Trust, a calculation of the premium or discount of the closing price against NAV and data, in chart format, displaying the frequency distribution of discounts and premiums of the closing price against the NAV, within appropriate ranges, for each of the four previous calendar quarters. 
9. In addition, secondary market purchasers generally receive the Product Description. Applicants state that, while the Product Description is not intended as a substitute for a prospectus, it contains pertinent information about Trust Shares. Applicants also note that Trust Shares are understandable to retail investors as a product that tracks the Benchmark Indices. 
Section 26(a)(2)(C) of the Act 
10. Section 26(a)(2)(C) of the Act requires, among other things, that a UIT's trust indenture prohibit payments to the trust's depositor (in the case of a Trust, the Sponsor), and any affiliated person of the depositor, except payments for performing certain administrative services. Applicants request an exemption from section 26(a)(2)(C) to permit any Trust to reimburse the Sponsor for certain licensing, registration, and marketing expenses. 
11. Applicants state that, ordinarily, a sponsor of a UIT has an opportunity to profit in connection with the creation of a trust in two ways—through the difference between the acquisition cost of the securities and their value on the date of deposit in the trust and, to the extent a secondary market is maintained for units, through the imposition of sales charges on resales of units. Expenses normally incurred in the creation and maintenance of a trust can then be offset against such profits. Applicants assert, however, that under the proposed structure, the usual sources of income are not available because the Sponsor does not impose a sales load or deposit Index Securities into the Trust. Applicants contend that the motivation for the limitations imposed in section 26(a)(2)(C) of the Act was the fear that sponsors could take unfair advantage of a trust to profit, when profits were already being generated through sales charges and market gains (on the securities deposited by the sponsor). Applicants contend that no such opportunity to profit exists for Sponsor. 
12. Applicants state that permitting a Trust to reimburse the Sponsor for certain of the Trust's expenses is no more disadvantageous to the holders of Trust Shares than allowing the expenses to be imposed indirectly as offsets to sales loads and other charges, as is done by typical UITs. Applicants state that a Trust pays the Sponsor only its actual out-of-pocket expenses. Finally, applicants state that the payment is capped at 30 basis points of the Trust's NAV on an annualized basis, with any expenses in excess of that amount to be absorbed by the Sponsor. 
Section 17(a) of the Act 
13. Section 17(a) of the Act generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company, or an affiliated person of such person, from selling any security to or purchasing any security from, the investment company. Section 2(a)(3) defines “affiliated person” to include any person directly or indirectly owning, controlling, or holding with power to vote, 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the other person, and any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with the other person. Section 2(a)(9) provides that a control relationship will be presumed where one person owns 25% or more of another person's voting securities. Applicants state that, because the definition of “affiliated person” includes any person owning 5% or more, or more than 25%, of an issuer's outstanding voting securities, every purchaser of a Creation Unit will be an affiliated person of the Trust so long as 20 or fewer Creation Units are in existence. Applicants request an exemption from section 17(a) under sections 6(c) and 17(b) to permit persons that are affiliated persons solely by virtue of a 5% or more, or more than 25%, ownership interest in a Trust (or affiliated persons of such persons that are not otherwise affiliated with the Trusts) to purchase and redeem Creation Units through in-kind transactions. 
14. Section 17(b) authorizes the Commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section 17(a) if the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching, and the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of the registered investment company and with the general purposes of the Act. Applicants assert that no useful purpose would be served by prohibiting the affiliated persons described above from making in-kind purchases and redemptions of Creation Units. The composition of a Portfolio Deposit made by a purchaser, like the Redemption Securities and Cash Redemption Amount given to a redeeming investor, is the same regardless of the investor's identity, and is valued under the same objective standards applied to valuing the Portfolio Securities in connection with determining the Trust's NAV. Therefore, applicants state that in-kind purchases and redemptions afford no opportunity for the affiliated persons described above to effect a transaction detrimental to other holders of Trust Shares. Applicants also believe that in-kind Start Printed Page 9792purchases and redemptions do not result in abusive self-dealing or overreaching by affiliated persons of the Funds. 
Section 17(d) of the Act and Rule 17d-1 Under the Act 
15. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act prohibit any affiliated person of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of the affiliated person or the principal underwriter, acting as principal, from effecting any transaction in connection with any joint enterprise or other arrangement or profit-sharing plan in which the investment company participates, unless an application regarding the joint transaction has been filed with the Commission and granted by order. Under rule 17d-1, in passing upon such applications, the Commission considers whether the participation of the registered investment company in the joint transaction is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants. 
16. Applicants request an order under rule 17d-1 that would permit a Trust to reimburse the Sponsor for the payment to the BoNY Index Provider of an annual license fee under the License Agreement. Applicants believe that relief is necessary because the Sponsor may be deemed an affiliated person of the Trust, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Act, and the Trust's undertaking to reimburse the Sponsor might be deemed a joint enterprise or other joint arrangement in which the Trust is a participant, in contravention of section 17(d) and rule 17d-1. 
17. The License Agreement allows applicants to use the Benchmark Indices as bases for Trust Shares and to use certain of BoNY's trade name and trademark rights. Applicants believe that BoNY is a valuable name that is well-known to investors and believe that investors wish to invest in instruments that closely mirror the Benchmark Indices. In view of this, applicants state that it is necessary to obtain from BoNY the License Agreement so that appropriate reference to BoNY may be made in materials describing Trust Shares and the Trust. Applicants assert that the terms and provisions of the License Agreement are comparable to the terms and provisions of other similar license agreements and that the annual license fee is for fair value, is in an amount comparable to that which would be charged by the BoNY Index Provider for similar arrangements, and is in an amount comparable to that charged by licensors in connection with the formation of other UITs based on other indices. For these reasons, applicants state that the proposed license fee arrangement satisfies the standards of section 17(d) and rule 17d-1. 
Applicants' Conditions 

Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:

1. Each Trust's prospectus and Product Description will clearly disclose that, for purposes of the Act, Trust Shares are issued by a registered investment company, and the acquisition of Trust Shares by investment companies is subject to the restrictions of Section 12(d)(1) of the Act, except as permitted by an exemptive order that permits registered investment companies to invest in Trust Shares beyond the limits in Section 12(d)(1)(A), subject to certain terms and conditions, including that the registered investment company enter into an agreement with the Trust regarding the terms of the investment. 
2. As long as a Trust operates in reliance on the requested order, the Trust Shares will be listed on an Exchange. 
3. The Web site for the Trusts, which will be publicly accessible at no charge, will contain the following information, on a per Trust Share basis, for each Trust: (a) The prior Business Day's NAV and the reported closing price, and a calculation of the premium or discount of such price against such NAV; and (b) data in chart format displaying the frequency distribution of discounts and premiums of the daily closing price against the NAV, within appropriate ranges, for each of the four previous calendar quarters. In addition, the Product Description for each Trust will state that the Web site for the Trusts has information about the premiums and discounts at which the Trust Shares have traded. 
4. The prospectus and annual report for each Trust will also include: (a) The information listed in condition 3(b) above, (i) in the case of the prospectus, for the most recently completed year (and the most recently completed quarter or quarters, as applicable), and (ii) in the case of the annual report, for the immediately preceding five years, as applicable; and (b) the following data, calculated on a per Trust Share basis for one, five and ten year periods (or life of that Trust), (i) the cumulative total return and the average annual total return based on NAV and closing price, and (ii) the cumulative total return of the relevant Benchmark Index. 
5. Before a Trust may rely on the order, the Commission will have approved pursuant to rule 19b-4 under the Exchange Act, an Exchange rule requiring Exchange members and member organizations effecting transactions in Trust Shares to deliver a Product Description to purchasers of Trust Shares.

     On October 18, 2006, PowerShares entered into a Transaction Agreement (“Transaction Agreement”) with The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”), the parent of Nasdaq Global Funds, Inc. (formerly named Nasdaq AMEX Investment Product Services, Inc., and later renamed Nasdaq Financial Products Services, Inc., the “Initial Sponsor”) pursuant to which the Initial Sponsor will transfer sponsorship of the Trusts to PowerShares. In connection with the Transaction Agreement, PowerShares is seeking exemptive relief substantially identical to the relief granted to the Trust pursuant to a Commission order (Investment Company Act Release No. 25797 (Nov. 8, 2002), as amended by Investment Company Act Release No. 26415 (Apr. 9, 2004)). The transfer of sponsorship of the Trust from the Initial Sponsor to PowerShares is contingent upon receipt of the exemptive relief requested in the application.

     The Current Trusts are the BLDRS Asia 50 ADR Index Fund, BLDRS Developed Markets 100 ADR Index Fund, BLDRS Emerging Markets 50 ADR Index Fund and BLDRS Europe 100 ADR Index Fund. All Trusts that currently intend to rely on the requested order have been named as applicants. Any other existing Trust or any Trust organized in the future that relies on the requested order will comply with the terms and conditions of the application. 

        Back to Citation
      


4.
     The Benchmark Indices are the (a) BoNY Asia 50 ADR Index, (b) BoNY Developed Markets 100 ADR Index, (c) BoNY Emerging Markets 50 ADR Index and (d) BoNY Europe 100 ADR Index. The Initial Benchmark Indices are sub-indices of the BoNY ADR Index, which is an index of all U.S. exchange-listed Depositary Receipts (“DRs”), subject to certain eligibility requirements. Applicants note that BoNY is a prominent participant in the DR market, and receives various fees and commissions in connection with its DR program functions. BoNY has informed applicants that the index compilation is bound by objective criteria, and that the identity of the depositary bank for a DR is never a criterion in the selection of Index Securities. As discussed in the application, BoNY represents that its DR sales efforts are not coordinated with the compilation of the Benchmark Indices. 

        Back to Citation
      


5.
     The Trusts make quarterly distributions when dividends on the Portfolio Securities and other income of the Trust, if any, exceed fees and expenses accrued by the Trust during the previous quarter. The Trustee may vary the frequency of dividend distributions under certain circumstances.

        Back to Citation
      


6.
     The BoNY Index Provider determines, comprises and calculates Benchmark Indices without regard to any Trust. BoNY has instituted formal firewall procedures to ensure that no BoNY personnel involved in providing trustee services to the Trusts have access to information regarding changes to the Benchmark Indices prior to their public announcement.

        Back to Citation
      


7.
     BoNY has adopted firewall procedures that prohibit communications regarding changes or proposed changes to the Benchmark Indices between any Affiliated Broker-Dealer and the BoNY personnel involved in the compilation of the Benchmark Indices.

        Back to Citation
      


8.
     Applicants expect that the income of the Trust may be insufficient to pay the fees and expenses of the Trust. In such circumstances, the Trustee will sell Portfolio Securities to generate sufficient cash to pay the Trust fees and expenses in excess of Trust income. The Trustee is ordinarily required to sell Portfolio Securities whenever the Trustee determines that accrued fees and expenses exceed dividends and other Trust accrued income on a projected basis by more than 0.01% of the NAV of the Trust.

        Back to Citation
      


9.
     The Trusts will comply with the federal securities laws in accepting Deposit Securities and satisfying redemptions with Redemption Securities (as defined below), including that the Deposit Securities and Redemption Securities are sold in transactions that would be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933. The specified Deposit Securities and Redemption Securities generally will correspond pro rata to the Portfolio Securities.

        Back to Citation
      


10.
     At the close of the market on each Business Day (as defined below), the Trustee calculates the NAV of each Trust, divides that amount by the total number of shares outstanding (yielding a “Per Trust Share NAV”), multiplies the Per Trust Share NAV by the number of Trust Shares in a Creation Unit (e.g., 50,000), thereby calculating the NAV per Creation Unit. The Trustee then calculates the required number of shares of Index Securities and the Cash Component that will comprise a Portfolio Deposit for the following Business Day. A “Business Day” is any day that the Nasdaq or any other Exchange that lists Trust Shares is open for business and any day that the Trusts are open for business as required by section 22(e) of the Act.

        Back to Citation
      


11.
     The cash equivalent of an Index Security may be included in the Cash Component of a Portfolio Deposit in lieu of the Index Security if (a) the Trustee determines that an Index Security is likely to be unavailable or available in insufficient quantity for inclusion in a Portfolio Deposit, or (b) a particular investor is restricted from investing or engaging in transactions in the Index Security (for example, when the investor is a broker-dealer restricted by regulation or internal policy from investing in securities issued by a company on whose board of directors one of its principals serves or when the investor is a broker-dealer and the security is on its “restricted list”).

        Back to Citation
      


12.
     The Transaction Fee will be $10 per each security “name” (i.e., each security identified by a separate CUSIP number) in the Portfolio Deposit, rounded to the nearest $500 for BLDRS Asia 50 ADR Index Fund and BLDRS Emerging Markets 50 ADR Index Fund and $1,000 for BLDRS Developed Markets 100 ADR Index Fund and BLDRS Europe 100 ADR Index Fund per Participating Party (as defined below) per day, regardless of the number of Creation Units purchased by such Participating Party on such day. “Participating Party” means an NSCC participant who may place orders through the Trust Shares Clearing Process. The Transaction Fee may be changed by the Trustee with the Sponsor's consent, but will not exceed 0.20% of the value of a Creation Unit. Investors who purchase Creation Units outside the Trust Shares Clearing Process will pay the Transaction Fee plus an amount not to exceed three times the Transaction Fee. The amount of the Transaction Fee is disclosed in the prospectus for the Trust.

        Back to Citation
      


13.
     No particular Market Maker is contractually obligated to make a market in Trust Shares although Nasdaq's listing requirements stipulate that at least two Market Makers must be registered in Trust Shares to maintain a listing on Nasdaq. Applicants state that no Market Maker will be an affiliated person, promoter, or principal underwriter of the Trusts, or an affiliated person of such persons, within the meaning of section 2(a)(3) of the Act, except pursuant to section 2(a)(3)(A) or (C) of the Act due to ownership of Trust Shares, as described below.

        Back to Citation
      


14.
     Applicants do not believe there are any special liquidity issues as to constituents in the Benchmark Indices, in light of the fact that constituent DRs are selected based on liquidity that is high relative to DRs that would otherwise fit the relevant criteria. The constituent DRs of the Benchmark Indices are traded and priced on national securities exchanges, as are the constituent securities of other indices on which exchange-traded funds investing in domestic securities are based. Accordingly, applicants believe that the pricing transparency for DRs should be equivalent to that of other securities that are traded and priced on national securities exchanges. Because there are no apparent differences in the pricing transparency between DRs and such other equity securities, applicants believe that there are no corresponding differences in, and no deleterious effects on, the arbitrage efficiency of the Trusts.

        Back to Citation
      


15.
     Trust Shares are registered in book-entry form only. DTC or its nominee is the record owner of all outstanding Trust Shares. Beneficial ownership of Trust Shares is shown on the records of DTC or its participants.

        Back to Citation
      


16.
     Applicants are not seeking relief from the prospectus delivery requirement for non-secondary market transactions, including purchases of Creation Units or those involving an issuer. Applicants state that persons purchasing Creation Units will be cautioned in the prospectus that some activities on their part may, depending on the circumstances, result in their being deemed statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the Securities Act. For example, a broker-dealer firm and/or its client may be deemed a statutory underwriter if it takes Creation Units after placing an order with the Distributor, breaks them down into the constituent Trust Shares, and sells Trust Shares directly to its customers, or if it chooses to couple the purchase of a supply of new Trust Shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand for Trust Shares. The prospectus states that whether a person is an underwriter depends upon all the facts and circumstances pertaining to that person's activities. The prospectus also states that dealers who are not “underwriters” but are participating in a distribution (as contrasted to ordinary secondary market trading transactions), and thus dealing with Trust Shares that are part of an “unsold allotment” within the meaning of section 4(3)(C) of the Securities Act, would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by section 4(3) of the Securities Act.

Five American Funds that Beat the First Index Fund’s Lifetime Results 







A look at the first index fund ― the Vanguard 500 Index Fund ― and the five U.S.-focused American Funds available when it launched confirms the following: The idea that you can’t beat the index over long-term periods is a myth. 





























The Potential for Greater Wealth 
As you can see, an investment manager with a proven track record of outpacing the market can produce significantly greater wealth than an index investment.
A comparison of the lifetime results of the first index fund to the results of five American Funds over that same period illustrates our advantage. Those funds are AMCAP Fund, American Mutual Fund, The Growth Fund of America, The Investment Company of America and Washington Mutual Investors Fund. The comparison is especially apt as that index fund was designed to track the S&P 500, which is also the benchmark for the five American Funds which seek to pursue investment objectives such as growth, income or preservation of capital. Watch and see how the American Funds fared since the index fund’s inception — from August 31, 1976, through December 31, 2016:

 The Capital Advantage: A Closer Look 
 


























Figures shown are past results for Class A shares for American Funds (Investor shares for Vanguard 500 Index Fund) and are not predictive of results in future periods. Current and future results may be lower or higher than those shown. Share prices and returns will vary, so investors may lose money. Investing for short periods makes losses more likely. Unless otherwise indicated, American Funds returns are shown at maximum offering price (MOP) and reflect deduction of the 5.75% maximum sales charge at the beginning of the period shown. Thus, the net amount invested was $9,425 ($1,885/per fund in the American Funds Blend scenario.). The maximum initial sales charge  was 8.50% prior to July 1, 1988. All distributions were reinvested. The Vanguard fund has no up-front sales charge and is available in another share class with a lower expense ratio. This share class was not available for investment at the inception of the fund. The American Funds are now also available in less expensive share classes that do not feature a sales charge. Current information and month-end results for the Vanguard fund can be found at vanguard.com. For current information and month-end results for the American Funds, visit americanfunds.com.

  Fund Objectives, Investment Strategies and Risks  




















Objective(s)













Investment Strategies













Risks













 American Mutual Fund 









The fund strives for the balanced accomplishment of three objectives: current income, growth of capital and conservation of principal.











The fund seeks to invest primarily in common stocks of companies that are likely to participate in the growth of the American economy and whose dividends appear to be sustainable. Although the fund focuses on investments in medium to larger capitalization companies, the fund’s investments are not limited to a particular capitalization size. The fund invests primarily in securities of issuers domiciled in the United States and Canada. The fund may also invest in bonds and other debt securities, including those issued by the U.S. government and by federal agencies and instrumentalities.











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, AMF investors exposure includes the following risks:

Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds. Bond prices and a bond fund’s share price will generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates.
Income provided by the fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available for dividend payments at, the companies in which the fund invests.











 AMCAP Fund 









The fund’s investment objective is to provide you with long-term growth of capital. 











The fund invests primarily in common stocks of U.S. companies that have solid long-term growth records and the potential for good future growth. The fund may invest in common stocks and other securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States to a limited extent. 











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, AMCAP investors exposure includes the following risks:

Investing outside the United States involves risks such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries.
Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks. 











 The Growth Fund of America 









The fund’s investment objective is to provide you with growth of capital. 











The fund invests primarily in common stocks and seeks to invest in companies that appear to offer superior opportunities for growth of capital. The fund invests primarily in common stocks of large- and mid-capitalization issuers. The fund may invest up to 25% of its assets in securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States. 











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, GFA investors exposure includes the following risks:

Investing outside the United States involves risks such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries.
Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks. 











 The Investment Company of America 









The fund’s investment objectives are to achieve long-term growth of capital and income. 











The fund invests primarily in common stocks, most of which have a history of paying dividends. In the selection of common stocks and other securities for investment, potential for capital appreciation and future dividends are given more weight than current yield. Although the fund focuses on investments in medium to larger capitalization companies, the fund’s investments are not limited to a particular capitalization size. The fund may invest up to 15% of its assets, at the time of purchase, in securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States. 











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, ICA investors exposure includes the following risks:

Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
Investing outside the United States involves risks such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries.
Income provided by the fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available for dividend payments at, the companies in which the fund invests. 











 Washington Mutual Investors Fund 









The fund’s investment objective is to produce income and to provide an opportunity for growth of principal consistent with sound common stock investing. 











The fund invests primarily in common stocks of established companies that are listed on, or meet the financial listing requirements of, the New York Stock Exchange and have a strong record of earnings and dividends. In the selection of common stocks and other securities for investment, current and potential yield as well as the potential for long-term capital appreciation are considered. The fund seeks to provide an above-average yield in relation to the S&P 500 Index. The fund strives to maintain a fully invested, diversified portfolio, consisting primarily of high-quality common stocks. 











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, WMIF investors exposure includes the following risks:

Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
Income provided by the fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available for dividend payments at, the companies in which the fund invests. 











 Vanguard 500 Index Fund 









The Fund seeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of large- capitalization stocks. 











The fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the Standard & Poor‘s 500 Index, a widely recognized benchmark of U.S. stock market performance that is dominated by the stocks of large U.S. companies. The Fund attempts to replicate the target index by investing all, or substantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the Index, holding each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the Index. 











The fund exposes investors to the risks inherent in investing in stocks of companies domiciled in the U.S., including the volatility that comes with its full exposure to the stock market. 

















































*Figures shown are for the period August 31, 1976, the inception date of the first index fund, through March 31, 2017. Standard deviation is a measure of how returns over time have varied from the mean and is one of the most common measures of absolute volatility. A lower number signifies lower volatility.
†The Vanguard 500 Index Fund has no up-front sales charge
Actively managed funds typically have higher turnover than index funds, which may have tax implications. Portfolio turnover is a measure of how frequently assets within a fund are bought and sold within a 12-month period. The lower the percentage, the less buying and selling took place. 
Expense ratios are as of each fund’s prospectus. 











Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses. Expense ratios are as of each fund’s prospectus available at time of publication.

American Funds Have Two Important Traits 



 
 










When you compare mutual funds, it’s not surprising that funds from investment managers who “eat their own cooking” — investing more of their own money in the funds they oversee — have tended to outpace the market index more frequently than their peers. It’s also logical that funds with lower expense ratios have tended to outpace the index more frequently. Combining these two traits — high manager ownership and low expense ratios — can help you identify a select group of funds with a track record of outpacing indexes over long periods.1









 Characteristics of Core Funds That Added Value  Two Screens Can Help Sharpen Your Search  





    





Source: Capital Group, based on Morningstar® data.1 






















 






Narrowing Your Search


















 
 










The sheer number of available funds can be overwhelming. We examined the large universe of equity funds in Morningstar’s U.S. and foreign large-cap categories over a 20-year period and looked for funds with two traits: those within the lowest 25% of expenses, and those within the highest 25% in manager ownership. We found that the funds with both characteristics (highest manager ownership and lowest expense ratios) meaningfully improved average outcomes for investors.







 Look for Funds That Meet Two Key Criteria  Large-Cap Equity Funds With Low Expense Ratios and High Manager Ownership  











Source: Capital Group, based on Morningstar data.2






















 






Boosting Success Rates





 
 










As shown in the chart below, not all funds are equal. Most, in fact, rarely outpace the index. However, funds with the lowest expenses have tended to do better than their peers. And funds with high manager ownership have done even better than that. Significantly, the group of funds that share both those characteristics have done better over five- and 10-year periods.
A portfolio of large-cap funds with lower expense ratios and higher manager ownership, on average, outpaced indexes more frequently than other funds. Since large-cap funds account for a big part of most portfolios, those higher success rates can result in substantial gains. 











 Two Steps Raised the Success Rate  Success Rates in Large-Cap Equities (Net of Fees)  





























Source: Capital Group, based on Morningstar data.1
































1 Source: Capital Group, based on Morningstar data. Based on monthly returns from January 1997 to December 2016. U.S. funds are those in the Morningstar Large Value, Large Blend and Large Growth categories. U.S. index is S&P 500. International funds are those in the Morningstar Foreign Large Value, Foreign Large Blend and Foreign Large Growth categories. International index is MSCI ACWI ex USA. The indexes are unmanaged and, therefore, have no expenses. Investors cannot invest directly in an index. Unless otherwise indicated, all distributions were reinvested. For more information about the screening process, see Methodology. 
2 Data as of December 31, 2016. Domestic funds are those in the Morningstar Large Value, Large Blend and Large Growth categories. International funds are those in the Morningstar Foreign Large Value, Foreign Large Blend and Foreign Large Growth categories. Size of quartiles varies because those funds in the Morningstar database that did not include an expense ratio or firm-level investment ownership were excluded from the analysis. For more information about the screening process, see Methodology.

















Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.

Select Funds Can Reduce Risk
Index funds fall as far as the market they track, but investors don’t have to. Over time they can gain more by losing less.





















  AUGUST 2016





Share




 
 















Gain by Losing Less
There are two ways to beat the index and fuel investment growth – earn more than the market or lose less than the market.
Losing less – the so-called low-downside capture approach – holds appeal for investors. Especially considering that 78% of them list protecting assets as their top investment priority but only about half are aware that index funds expose them to 100% of market downturns. 

Downside capture:
A fund’s downside capture ratio is an indication of whether a fund has lost more or less than the market during periods of market weakness. For example, if over the course of a downturn a fund fell only 96% as far as the market, its downside capture ratio is 96%. If it fell 5% more than the market, its downside capture ratio is 105%. 














  See how American Funds delivered index-beating returns by losing less  







    






                A closer look at the power of low “downside capture” shows how our U.S. stock focused goods have tended to beat the index even as they trailed the market during the good times.  
              

























Why It Matters
Consistently losing less during downturns can be instrumental in producing larger balances and superior outcomes for long-term investors. Funds that limit downside risk tend to also provide a smoother ride, making it easier for those with long-term objectives to stay the course during turbulent markets.




















The Arithmetic of Loss
The ability to achieve superior outcomes by losing less is an example of what’s known as the arithmetic of loss. Consider the following:
If a $1,000 investment loses 50%, its value drops to $500. In order for the investment to return to the $1,000 level, that $500 must do more than gain 50% (which would only bring it to $750); it needs to double.
Digging out of a hole is never easy, but the shallower the hole, the shorter the climb.










Better Positioned by Losing Less
The farther an investment falls, the longer the path back to break even. Some funds offer the potential to hold on to more of one’s investment during market declines which leaves investors better positioned for a rebound.








































To Mitigate Risk, Seek Funds That Have Held Up Better During Declines
Looking at a fund’s downside capture ratio — a comparison of how far it has fallen relative to its index during downturns — is one way to evaluate its riskiness.
When we added downside capture to two other screening criteria — low expenses and high levels of manager investment — we uncovered a group of funds that has, on average, delivered index-beating results.









Finding Funds That Can Mitigate Risk
Within the universe of Large Cap U.S. funds, screening for funds with downside resilience — funds that capture less of a market decline than the index — results in a lower risk group that, on average, outpaced its peers as well as the S&P 500 Index.
Further narrowing the low-downside group using low expenses and high manager ownership as additional screening criteria increased the advantage over the index and reduced risk further. The chart shown here is based on data for rolling five-year periods for the 20 years ended December 31, 2015.




















See methodology.























Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
