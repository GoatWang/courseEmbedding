Capabilities
Technologies and Resources to Provide a Competitive Advantage















Blown and Cast Films
Gain performance and meet cost objectives with Bemis film coextrusion capabilities. Films can be extruded in multiple layers to deliver targeted attributes.


		Blown films use an annular (circular) die and are slow-air quenched, delivering more crystallinity and better barrier.

		Cast films use a flat die and are extruded in a flat sheet. They are quickly quenched and exhibit high clarity.






Extrusion, Adhesive and Thermal Lamination
Get strong, heat-resistant laminated films engineered for desired barrier, weight and performance characteristics. Laminated films allow for reverse printing, which protects the ink and provides superior gloss and scuff resistance.


		Adhesive Lamination: Structure is bonded with adhesive

		Extrusion Lamination: Structure is bonded with molten resin

		Thermal Lamination: Structure is bonded with heat






Custom-Manufactured Film Packaging 
Find single-source resources and expertise to develop proprietary materials engineered for your specialized products, performance targets, packaging methods or downgauging initiatives.

Bemis to cut 300 jobs, close 2 facilities
Bemis Co. Inc.  said it will cut 300 jobs as part of a restructuring plan aimed at saving about $55 million to $60 million a year. The job cuts will be made over the next three years. The job cuts represent about 5% of the global administrative workforce, and about 1.7% of the total workforce. The plastic packaging supplier said it will close two manufacturing facilities, with one closure beginning this year and the other in 2018. The employees of those facilities will be transferred to other locations. "During April, we began a review to align our U.S. manufacturing and administrative cost structures with the demands of our customer base to better position the Company in the current environment and for its long-term success," said Chief Executive William Austen. "Given the challenges in the Brazilian economic environment, we also expanded the scope of our review to include our entire global business." The stock, which was still inactive in premarket trade, has lost 1.8% year to date while the S&P 500  has gained 8.1%.

History[edit]
Bemis Inc. was founded by Judson Moss Bemis in 1858 in St. Louis, Missouri, as a manufacturer of printed cotton bags for food products. Its first location was on the second floor of a machine shop, which provided steam to operate the printing presses and readily available maintenance personnel for machine repairs.
Two key innovations Bemis' company originally pioneered were the printing and machine-sewing of bags. (Traditionally, bags were stenciled and hand-sewn.) Bemis' first order was for 200 half-barrel sacks. To allay worries that machine-sewn bags were inferior to traditional hand-sewn bags, Judson Bemis unconditionally guaranteed every bag his company manufactured.
In 1867, Judson Bemis' brother, Stephen A. Bemis, returned from the gold rush and joined Judson in the bag manufacturing business. Bemis Bro. Bag Co. opened its second plant in 1880 in Minneapolis, followed by a third in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1888. These plants were followed by others in New Orleans, Superior (WI), San Francisco, Indianapolis, Memphis, Kansas City, Seattle, and Winnipeg. In the early 1900s, Bemis opened its first paper bag manufacturing plant.
On July 25, 2003, Bemis Company, Inc. and UPM-Kymmene (NYSE:UPM) agreed to terminate their agreement to sell Bemis' Pressure Sensitive Materials Business to UPM-Kymmene. On April 15, 2003, the Department of Justice was granted an injunction to block the transaction.[4]
In 2011, the company had net sales of $5.3 billion, operating 78 facilities in 12 countries. Over two-thirds of Bemis packaging is used in the food industry, with the balance used in markets including medical, pharmaceutical, chemical and agribusiness. Bemis' pressure-sensitive products are used in industries including graphic arts, digital imaging, assembly engineering, communications and medical.[5] In July 2012 Bemis company announced a strategic partnership with Norwegian printed electronics company Thin Film Electronics ASA to bring printed electronics to existing Bemis packaging lines.[6] In 2013 the company acquired a China-Based film platform.[7] In 2014, Bemis Sold its Paper Packaging Division to Hood Packaging Corporation.
