Who We Are
Alignment, Redefined

Alignvest was created with the founding principle of increasing alignment between asset managers and their clients.
Alignvest’s clients include leading pension plans, foundations and ultra-high net worth family offices. Alignvest’s founding partners have committed to invest over $230 million of their personal capital into funds managed by Alignvest on a fully discretionary basis, with the capital subject to an investment period to 2024 and subject to full recyclability (including all gains) over the investment period. We believe this long term, discretionary and aligned pool of capital provides the firm with a strong and differentiated foundation.
A significant portion of the partners’ capital is contributed to each investment resulting in direct and explicit alignment between the firm and its clients.
Alignvest seeks to recruit and partner only with best in class investors. Our portfolio managers and investment partners are seasoned investment professionals with proven success investing large sums of capital in markets that offer disproportionately attractive risk-adjusted returns.
Alignvest currently offers four investment platforms: Alignvest Capital Management, for its public market strategies, Alignvest Private Capital and Alignvest Acquisition Corporation, for its private market strategies and Alignvest Investment Management, which provides institutional quality, total portfolio management capabilities to asset owners.


What We Do
We Build Businesses

Alignvest partners with best in class managers across a variety of private and public market investment strategies. 
Alignvest looks for five key characteristics when making investment decisions:

Exceptional Risk Adjusted Returns

First screen: “Would Alignvest partners make the investment with their own capital?”
Differentiated product that offers investors access to strong risk-adjusted returns, with fee structures that match the source of returns
Focus on LP returns; GP returns a by-product. Structure fosters investor alignment



Market Discontinuity

Market discontinuities are caused by rapid growth or change that challenges resources and incumbent systems, including: regulatory changes, structural shifts in demographics, geographies, economies, and technology
Alignvest uses creativity and in-depth analysis to identify opportunities



World Class Talent

Alignvest’s partners have proven track records bringing a breadth of complimentary talent and expertise to the firm
“A” talent attracts “A” talent – each hire is screened on whether they are first-class talent and able to be a valuable contributor



Ability to Leverage Alignvest Expertise


Can Alignvest create outsized value through its ownership and involvement?
Relevant business-building expertise to launch and support growth
Unique capital base and access to shared resources best position an investment to succeed




Scalability

Understand the difference between an investment and a trade. Prioritize platforms that have the ability to leverage the team and infrastructure to meaningfully expand
Relevant business-building expertise to launch and support growth
Will take advantage of opportunities that have attractive risk-adjusted returns as a result of a lack of capital or expertise

Public market vehicle for leading private companies.


Alignvest Acquisition II Corporation (TSX:AQY) (“AQY”) is a Special Purpose Acquisition Corporation (“SPAC”) that raised over $400 million from leading institutional investors in its initial public offering. In addition to this, AQY raised $113 million by entering into Forward Purchase Agreements with certain institutional and accredited investors and certain directors of AQY. An affiliate of our Sponsor and our Founders are committing 50% of this permanent (non-redeemable) capital, which further aligns their interests with those of AQY’s shareholders. This enhanced structure, whereby approximately 22% of our total capital of approximately $515 million is permanent (not subject to redemption), improves upon the structure of a traditional SPAC by having certainty on a significant portion of available cash at the time of a qualifying acquisition. We believe that this structure will not only reduce the chances of not completing an acquisition, but that it will also serve to increase the calibre of potential targets given the heightened certainty of capital.
AQY intends to focus on acquiring companies with an estimated enterprise value between $500 million and $2.5 billion, which we believe has the potential to deliver an attractive risk-adjusted return to our shareholders. We intend to focus on businesses that have some or all of the following characteristics:

are led by strong, experienced, and well-aligned founders and management teams, with a proven track record of equity value creation who want to continue to build their businesses;
are known to Alignvest Management Corporation (“AMC”) through a proprietary (non-auctioned) relationship;
operate in an industry in which we have expertise;
have the potential to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns on invested capital;
and/or provide the opportunity to execute synergistic follow-on acquisitions.

AQY’s management team, board of directors, and advisory board have extensive experience in identifying such businesses, executing on these transactions, and subsequently unlocking shareholder value. In addition, our and AMC’s team have significant experience working with private companies in preparing for, and executing, an initial public offering, and serving as active owners and directors by working closely with these companies to create value in the public markets. Notably, AMC, as the sponsor of Alignvest Acquisition Corporation (“AQX”), has experience executing a SPAC transaction, having successfully completed a qualifying acquisition with Trilogy International Partners LLC (“Trilogy”) in February 2017.
AQY’s management team, board of directors, and advisory board are comprised of a group of individuals that have founded businesses, have worked as senior investment professionals at leading private equity firms, lead or led publicly-traded companies on the TSX or the NYSE, and sit on the boards of directors of industry-leading companies.
