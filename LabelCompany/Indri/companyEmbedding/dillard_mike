EVERGROW


The agricultural system is broken. Our food is covered in poison, and traditional farming methods are destroying the environment. Unfortunately, most people can’t afford to pay a premium for organic, pesticide-free food, so in 2014 I set out to build the world’s first, fully-automated hydroponic system for in-home food production.
Meet EverGrow… It reduces food costs by over 80%, water waste by 95%, and pesticide use by 100%. And the best part, is that it’s completely automated…

MEET MIKE DILLARD


I’ve always believed that the greatest achievement each of us can strive for in life is to have the ability to create the world around you, so that it matches the dreams in your mind.
This is how the most advanced city in the world sprung from the desert sands of Dubai in less than 10 years.
How Bugatti built the 253 mph Veyron. How Steve Jobs created the IPhone. And how Paul Allen And Burt Rutan built Spaceship 1.
Whatever that dream may be in your mind… Whether it’s unlimited time with your family, a new dress, the chance to work full-time for your favorite charity, to design your dream home, or change the future of mankind through your leadership…
Having the financial means and the courage to say, “yes, I can make this real if I want”, is the ultimate expression of freedom that each of us can experience.
I approach life with a core belief that anyone can accomplish anything. That not only can one man or woman make a difference, but that it’s one man or woman who always makes the difference.
Hi, my name is Mike Dillard and I’m grateful that that our paths have crossed. My mission, and my purpose is to empower those who want to change their life, and change the world for the better, with the knowledge and skills they need to do so.
If you’re an entrepreneur, or want to become one, I believe I have some insights and experiences that can help you make an incredible impact in the lives of others.
When I’m not working, I do my best to experience as much as I possibly can during the short window of time we all have here…
In 2008 I received my first taste of motorsports during an off road excursion trip driving through the magical place that is Baja Mexico. I was hooked. Six months later I found myself on the starting line of the longest, and most dangerous race in the world… The Baja 1000.
If you’re one of the few people on the planet who’s ever had the privilege of a steak dinner and a cold beer at Mike’s Sky Ranch, we’re clearly kindred spirits…
Today I spend my free time racing in the SCORE and HDRA off-road series, and with the construction of the new Circuit of The Americas racing facility here in Austin, I’ve started to transition my focus to road racing in an effort to follow in the footsteps of my friend Patrick Dempsey.
When I’m not flying down a track at 160 MPH, you’ll find me at my ranch in the Texas hill country chasing chickens, feeding goats, tending to the organic greenhouse, or pinging steel with some 7.62.
And when I’m not in Texas, you’ll find me waving a stick at some trout in the mountains of Colorado, or traveling the world in search of the best food and fun that it has to offer.
Thank you for taking the time connect, and the best way to stay in touch is to subscribe to my email newsletter list.
– Mike








Mike and The Elevation Group were named the “Outstanding Company of The Year” by the
Make-A-Wish Foundation for adopting the wishes of 14 local Austin children.

 "How To Build A Large Audience
And Email List For Any Business…"  One of the biggest secrets to my business success over the past ten years, is an awareness of the business I’m actually in…
And what kind of business is that exactly?
Well some people might say that it’s an information publishing business because all of my products have been books and courses on topics that range from personal development, to online marketing, to investing.
But in reality, I’m actually in the business of building tribes of people who share a common problem or passion.
I am in the leadership business, and my email list of 400,000+ tribe members is my business’ virtual distribution channel.
The result is the single greatest lifestyle business that you can ever build for yourself.
In fact, here’s WHY you want to build a large list, and a following as soon as possible…
When you have a list, you basically have a business that is based around your biggest passion in life, and your primary job is to simply engage with, and help other people from around the world who share that same passion.
You can run this kind of business without any employees, or an office, and you can do it from anywhere in the world.
When you have a list, you can literally make income on demand by sending a single email.
And as your list continues to grow, that income potential becomes absolutely incredible.
And when you have a list, everything you do in business in the future becomes incredibly easy because you have a built-in following of fans, customers, and supporters.
For example, when I started the Self Made Man podcast recently, it became the #1 show in ITunes in the Health and Self Help categories within 48 hours. How?
Simple… I just emailed my list and told them about it.
Having a large list and a tribe of supporters is the ultimate advantage in business.
BUT… in order to enjoy the benefits that this kind of business can provide, you have to build your tribe and build your list.
I started building my first list 2005 when I was in my mid-20’s teaching entrepreneurs how to use attraction marketing strategies to build their businesses.
Within 18 months I was able to go from dead-broke and waiting tables, to making my first million dollars by the age of 27
Within the next two years, that list would grow to more than 200,000 people, which generated an average monthly revenue stream of more than $500,000 per month or $6 Million per year.
In 2010 I my passion had turned towards finance and investing. I didn’t know much about the subject, but it’s all that I ever talked about, so I started a new business in that niche.
Thanks to my existing tribe and list, that business acquired over 8,600 new customers, made over $3.2 million it it’s first 7 days, without spending a single dime on advertising.
By the end of the first year, we’d made over $10,000,000 and my list had grown to more than 400,000 people.
And over the past 10 years, my lists, (and the incredibly relationship I’ve built with my readers) have produced more than $50,000,000 in revenue.
Obviously it goes without saying that having that level of financial success has been great, but what’s really mattered most, is the lifestyle that this kind of business can provide you with, which is a life of complete freedom.
There are some really big moments in my highlight reel that I’m incredibly grateful for, like spending two weeks on Necker Island with Richard Branson, or racing in the Mint 400 with Patrick Dempsey, or having the freedom to live in Aspen for two months every summer…
But what this business has provided that I’m most grateful for over the years, has been the little things…
Like having the freedom to wake up every morning whenever I want, or buying food and clothes without ever having to look at the price tag, or having the ability to provide substantial support to causes that I care about like the Make A Wish Foundation, and Charity: Water.
So if there is a blessing that I could pass on to others in my life, it would how to create the life and lifestyle of your dreams, using this amazing type of business model.
If you’re interested in learning how to turn your biggest passion into a simple, profitable business that you can run from anywhere in the world, you’ll want to participate in my List-Grow training course.
List-Grow is a click-by-click implementation program where you’ll sit over my shoulder as I walk you through the entire list-building process.
If you’d like complete details about the program, I’d encourage you to register for my free training webinar which will break-down my entire list-building process for you, using one of my recent businesses as a real-world example.
In this particular case-study, I started a brand new business from scratch, and built it up to more than $85,000 in monthly passive income within 90 days, while building my list by 100’s of optin subscribers per day.
You can see exactly how it was done on this free training webinar.
If you’re ready to join List-Grow now, you can do so here.
List-Grow comes with a 30 Day money back guarantee.

Is it a Mike Dillard scam? Or is Mike Dillard a legit dude who puts out REAL products and services that live up to what they say they are going to do? I don’t know about you, but I HATE throwing away money for products and services that are total BS and don’t live up to their claims.
You’re NOT going to want to buy any of Mike Dillard’s products before reading this blog post. On this page I’ll answer the question of if it’s a “Mike Dillard scam” and I’ll give you my experience with his products. I’ll also go into the Elevation Group and whether that’s something you should pursue or avoid.

Is Mike Dillard A Fraud? – Mike Dillard Scam
Mike Dillard Scam
From my research, and my experience with Mike Dillard’s products, I can honestly say that it’s not a Mike Dillard scam and he is not a fraud or anything else crazy like that. There have been two products in particular that I have bought and personally used that Mike Dillard put together. Both of them did EXACTLY what they said they were going to do and gave me some pretty dramatic results.
One of the products, Black Belt Recruiting really had a profound impact on my network marketing business. I even had an “AHA” moment as a result of going through the course that literally helped to change the course of my business. It took me from an amateur network marketer to a professional. Following the techniques inside of Black Belt Recruiting I went from struggling to sponsor people into my network marketing business, to sponsoring 10 reps in only 2 weeks.
The other product by Mike Dillard that I have used and have had success with (which shows me it’s not a Mike Dillard scam), is his Magnetic Sponsoring course. This course revolves around the use of a technique called attraction marketing to enable a network marketer to attract new reps into their network marketing business versus chasing family, friends, co-workers, etc. If you’re new to the network marketing industry then this is a must have book since it teaches you a concept that most network marketing companies aren’t teaching their distributors. Attraction marketing works, plain and simple and Mike Dillard’s book does a great job explaining it and breaking it down.
So again, from my experience I can say without a doubt that it’s not a Mike Dillard scam, he’s not a fraud, and he does put out legitimate products and services. If that’s the case, then why are there still people out there who say it’s a “Mike Dillard scam” or asking, “Is Mike Dillard a Fraud?” Let me explain…
Why People Say It’s A Mike Dillard Scam
The biggest reasons why people jump the gun and say it’s a Mike Dillard scam is usually because of the hype surrounding his products, the upsells, and from not reading the terms and conditions or understanding what they are signing up for.
Like every entrepreneur, Mike Dillard uses marketing and affiliates to get as many eyeballs as possible in front of his products in hopes that people will pull the trigger and make a purchase. To market these products he’ll obviously hype them up as much as he legally can to get people to buy. He’ll make claims about the products and a lot of time people will assume that it’s too good to be true and therefore it’s a Mike Dillard scam. Again, from what I’ve seen and my experience with his products, they do in fact work and live up to the claims.
The Upsells – Mike Dillard Scam
If you buy a product from Mike Dillard you need to expect to be offered additional products or “upsells” immediately after you finalize your order. Why does he do that, and does that make it a Mike Dillard scam? Absolutely not, but a lot of people make that assumption after seeing the upsells.
By offering upsells he’s just being a good marketer so he can maximize what he makes just like every good retailer does. Just think about how many times you’ve been at the check out counter at a clothing store (or any other store) and the cashier has offered you to buy Y because you bought X. Or think about all of the stuff that surrounds the cash register or the shelves of products you stand by as you’re waiting in line to check out? These are all upsells and an effort by the retailer to get you to buy more stuff. Does that make the retailer a scam and makes it a Mike Dillard scam? No, they are just trying to maximize their profits like any entrepreneur should do.
Not Reading The Terms & Conditions – Mike Dillard Scam
This is another big reason people automatically assume it’s a Mike Dillard scam. They skim through the sales page, they zoom right past the terms and conditions, and BAM they order the product. By doing that they failed to notice that the product is a subscription product where you get charged monthly to be a member. Then when their credit card gets charged again, they automatically assume it’s a Mike Dillard scam and point the fingers at him.
Take the time to carefully read what you’re buying. I do feel that if you’re signing up for a subscription based service that it clearly be stated, but you need to make sure you read the terms & conditions so you know what you’re signing up for. I personally have not seen instances where Mike Dillard has hidden the fact that it’s a monthly subscription (more specifically, the Elevation Group membership).
The Elevation Group Fraud? – Mike Dillard Scam
The Elevation Group Fraud?
The Elevation Group fraud? – I get a lot of people asking me that so I wanted to address that here too. I personally have NOT purchased a membership to the Elevation Group, but I do have a good buddy who is a member. He has stuck with the membership for quite some time now and from what he tells me it has been totally worth it. The Elevation Group is all about how to invest your money properly during these crazy economic times so that in the end you come out ahead.
If you personally have experience with the Elevation Group, then make sure to leave a comment below since I’d love to hear your thoughts on it. The Elevation Group Fraud? From what I’ve seen, it doesn’t appear so, but I’d love to hear your experience with it. If I do get the Elevation group membership I’ll update this section with my thoughts and experience.
You Need To Decide For Yourself – Mike Dillard Scam
I hope you see now that it’s NOT a Mike Dillard scam! From my experience with his products, they truly do provide a ton of value and they live up to what they are supposed to do. I know Mike Dillard stands behind all of his products and that he lives up to any money back guarantees that he offers. So my recommendation would be to pull the trigger so you can be the judge if it’s a Mike Dillard scam or not.
I hope you got some value out of this blog post; if you did, then make sure to leave a comment below and tell me your experience (good and bad) with Mike Dillard’s products.

I jouned the elevation group with the option of canceling in 30 days if I did not like it.I wanted to cvancel right away but neith od the two websites I tried work I called 512-686-8384 to cancel but they refered me to the non-functional website.I am anxious to get a cancelation confirmation soon.

                                   	                                   		                                   November 21, 2011	                                                                                                      
I’m sure they have some type of support email address. I recommend sending them an email telling them that you’d like to cancel. 
I had to contact support for a different product that Mike Dillard offered. They sent me a response within 48 hours (it might of even been 24 hours) so I was pretty happy with their response and support. So I’d recommend giving that a try. Hope that helps!

                                   	                                   		                                   January 5, 2012	                                                                                                      
this is the problem as you stated. Most people that sign up think thier going to get rich quick and don’t pay any attention to what’s being said. Mike in no uncertain terms says that he is not a finacial adviser. This is a documentry of his finacial education  in this economy. As well as giving those that want too the resources to follow and educate themselves in financial matters. To invest and protect those investments as the wealthy have for generations. So in short NO this is not a scam. You have 30 days to get your money back no questions ask.

Yep! You took the words right out of my mouth Bill. There’s a TON of people in our world that take NO personal responsibility whatsoever. Instead of looking at their own actions, then blame everyone else…Thanks for the comment buddy!

Hi Jonathan:
I wanted to ask you a question related to the Magnetic Sponsoring course: First off, I own this course since two months ago aprox. but I have an inquiry about the backoffice of this product: Is it possible for any people who have this product to brand themselves or not?
I’m asking this because I know all the people that I could bring to the MS sales funnel are going to “feed” Mike Dillard’s autoresponders with their names, not my own autoresponder. In these order of ideas, I wanted to know if at least I could import all my prospects names into my own autoresponder, because only in that way, I’m going to have much control over those prospects. That is my straightforward question.
Thanks in advance.

                                   	                                   		                                   October 24, 2012	                                                                                                      
I’m an Elevation Group member. It is not a Fraud or Scam! I’m fully satisfied with what I’m getting (although I live in Europe and not everything that works in the US works here, but I can utilize 80s percent), it is good value for money.
One thing everyone should note, you have to work hard to reach your goal, just becoming a member won’t make you rich! There is no secret spell that will make you rich… if that is what you are looking for, it is the wrong spot.

Thank you, Johnathan. It is a useful article. I know Mike Dillard’s works. I watched free videos of “black belt recruiting” and “magnetic sponsoring”. The only reason why I didn’t buy full products is because I am not sure if they give a lot of useful info.Can you tell me how much usefull information is in the bought products according to free video-corses?

I find Mike very interesting and what he states is not new and you would have to be a blind monkey to miss the signs of the up and coming callapse.
My question is, will the strategies work in the Australian market particulary around the tax releif and family banking , not sure if we have this here in Oz

I have a simple question.  What does the monthly fee cover? The sales page for MS states that I’ll receive literature and a disc… But what am I paying 40 per month for?  I did not purchase yet; that is why I ask.  Thanks!

MEET MIKE DILLARD


I’ve always believed that the greatest achievement each of us can strive for in life is to have the ability to create the world around you, so that it matches the dreams in your mind.
This is how the most advanced city in the world sprung from the desert sands of Dubai in less than 10 years.
How Bugatti built the 253 mph Veyron. How Steve Jobs created the IPhone. And how Paul Allen And Burt Rutan built Spaceship 1.
Whatever that dream may be in your mind… Whether it’s unlimited time with your family, a new dress, the chance to work full-time for your favorite charity, to design your dream home, or change the future of mankind through your leadership…
Having the financial means and the courage to say, “yes, I can make this real if I want”, is the ultimate expression of freedom that each of us can experience.
I approach life with a core belief that anyone can accomplish anything. That not only can one man or woman make a difference, but that it’s one man or woman who always makes the difference.
Hi, my name is Mike Dillard and I’m grateful that that our paths have crossed. My mission, and my purpose is to empower those who want to change their life, and change the world for the better, with the knowledge and skills they need to do so.
If you’re an entrepreneur, or want to become one, I believe I have some insights and experiences that can help you make an incredible impact in the lives of others.
When I’m not working, I do my best to experience as much as I possibly can during the short window of time we all have here…
In 2008 I received my first taste of motorsports during an off road excursion trip driving through the magical place that is Baja Mexico. I was hooked. Six months later I found myself on the starting line of the longest, and most dangerous race in the world… The Baja 1000.
If you’re one of the few people on the planet who’s ever had the privilege of a steak dinner and a cold beer at Mike’s Sky Ranch, we’re clearly kindred spirits…
Today I spend my free time racing in the SCORE and HDRA off-road series, and with the construction of the new Circuit of The Americas racing facility here in Austin, I’ve started to transition my focus to road racing in an effort to follow in the footsteps of my friend Patrick Dempsey.
When I’m not flying down a track at 160 MPH, you’ll find me at my ranch in the Texas hill country chasing chickens, feeding goats, tending to the organic greenhouse, or pinging steel with some 7.62.
And when I’m not in Texas, you’ll find me waving a stick at some trout in the mountains of Colorado, or traveling the world in search of the best food and fun that it has to offer.
Thank you for taking the time connect, and the best way to stay in touch is to subscribe to my email newsletter list.
– Mike








Mike and The Elevation Group were named the “Outstanding Company of The Year” by the
Make-A-Wish Foundation for adopting the wishes of 14 local Austin children.

The Secret Software Mike Dillard Used To Build His Online Empire… (It’s Free!)

Ok, as promised, I am going to reveal Mike Dillard’s secret weapon that he has used on a daily basis to achieve amazing results in his business.
It is a piece of software found on every computer that has helped him build his entire online empire brick-by-brick, day-by-day…
Mike Dillard’s Secret Weapon for Results
No, it’s not Dreamweaver or an auto-responder.
To begin… Mike makes it clear that there are two kinds of people in the network marketing industry… those that DO and those that Don’t.  I am referring to people that make things happen and those that sit around waiting for results.
Here’s what I mean… many people have noticed over the years that Mike has one particular trait that has enabled him to achieve great results. He says that he is no smarter than the next guy, has NOT had greater opportunities, or had more money to begin with (he was NOT born with a Silver Spoon in his mouth).
What makes Mike different from others?  We can borrow the slogan from Nike, ‘Just Do It’!  Every time Mike has an idea, he doesn’t sit around and think about it, he steps outside the box and just goes for it.  He says, “I just took it for granted that if you have a great idea, you freaking do it, right?”
The big difference is that most people, including myself, may have a little procrastination flowing through our veins.  We often come up with an amazing idea and think about putting it into action, but either talk ourselves out of it, or procrastinate to the point that it becomes a distant memory.  Days, weeks, months go by before we realize that we are still sitting in the same position we were a year ago.
Mike Doesn’t Think About It, He Just Does It!
When he has an idea, he begins executing it one baby-step at a time, each and every day until his project is complete.
Success is a Matter of Habitual Behaviors

Success is not a destination, it’s the result of a pattern of habitual behaviors.
True or False?  You can take someone who has a track record of success in one field and move them over to another with the expectation that success will be achieved again.  TRUE!
Why is this?  It’s not the job or the business opportunity.  It’s not that the marketing system is greater or the product is better at creating success.  It’s their daily habits… they are the “Do-ers”.
There are successful and unsuccessful people in every business – they are all using the same tools, the same websites and the same system… the difference is found in their daily habits.
So how can you transition from a “Thinker” to a “Do-er?”
Mike Dillard’s Secret Weapon Revealed
This little, easy to use, software has been crucial in creating Mike’s habitual patterns for getting things done, which has produced millions of dollars in revenue in the process.
Ever hear of ‘WordPad’?  Also known as NotePad or TextEdit for Mac users.  Here is a simple, easy to use, program that opens up with a blank white page as it stares at you waiting to be called into action.
All you do is type into this little unassuming simple program that doesn’t do anything but interpret your key strokes… it doesn’t even check your spelling.
Here is why Mike says this little un-evolved program is so valuable… it is your NEW Boss!
Every night before Mike goes to bed, he pulls up his WordPad file, which he says that he has saved as his “To-Do.txt” list, and he writes down 5 tasks that he must complete the following day, in order of importance.
In fact, here is his actual “To Do List” for today:
To Do List:

Write and send MS newsletter.
Update Adwords campaign.
Run new headline split-test.
Finish Chapter 4 in “Building On A Budget.”
Return prospect phone calls and emails.

Why Making a Written List is SO Magical
When you make a list the night before, you will subconsciously have all night to think about it.  When you awake, you are already on task.  You already know what your goals are for the day.  You are starting this day with focus and a purpose that is already laid out for you.  This allows you to ignore the onslaught of distractions that arise each new morning.
You will find that if you don’t have your To-Do list waiting for you at your desk in the morning, you will get sidetracked with the everyday hustle and bustle.  Life Happens… it gets in the way.
If you don’t take back control and focus, it will prevent you from accomplishing anything constructive.  This is a deadly trap that you must avoid at all costs; this happens to be the roadblock that is preventing you from achieving the results that you want.
The process of creating a To-Do list each and every night has allowed Mike to create his Magnetic Sponsoring empire.  His most sophisticated and effective marketing system in the industry was created one step at a time using his little known secret software program called WordPad.
Here’s my challenge to You…
Make a commitment to use Mike’s method for 30 days, starting tonight.  Before you head off to bed, create a To-Do list of 5 tasks that you MUST complete by the end of the following day.  They MUST be action ‘tasks,’ NOT goals.
If you do the tasks, your goals will automatically be heading in the direction of accomplishment.
Do not put…

Sponsor a new rep
Get a new customer
Read a book
Etc…

If sponsoring a new rep or new customer for your business is your goal, then focus on the tasks that will result in the goal like producing 10 new leads and contacting previous prospects.
Example To-Do list…

Send out a press release.
Send a newsletter to my list.
Write an article and submit to 5 article sites
Talk to at least 5 prospects.
Read Chapter 3 in “Review 3 Modules in Traffic Formula II”

If you follow this without fail for the next 30 days, you will be a different person.  You will have made more progress in one month than you will have in the past 12 months.
This is EXACTLY how you execute traffic building methods, revealed in courses like Magnetic Sponsoring, for maximum results.

I like your note pad habit. I’m retired and sell cruises as a Home Travel Agent for a host agency. I’m not getting as much business as I want, so I started looking around for a solution. I took the first step by purchasing Jason Hornung’s Facebook Ads Profit Maximizer Bootcamp 2. I just completed the course this week and am trying to determine how best to use it to get more leads for cruises. I also am interested in starting an online business, but don’t have a product yet. Knowing from my career experience that I needed a to-do list to make progress I purchased a new Franklin/Covey planner. It’s a big help for staying on task. Can you give me any advice to help me reach my goals? Being on a fixed income the cost of Jason’s course used all my expendable income for a while. I don’t want to spend so much taking course after course trying to find what’s right for me. I am pleased with what I learned from Jason and anxious to start using it. I didn’t know who you were until I started researching this subject, but after I saw you I realized that I have purchased some product from you in the last year or so. I also saw that you have worked with Jason, so right now I consider you a strong potential for discovering what’s next for me. Appreciate anything you can share with me. (put that on your note pad for tomorrow!!) Thanks

This is NOT a book for people who want to follow the herd, or get average results handing out samples, holding home parties, or buying leads. It is for the few who want to become leaders in this industry. Who want to walk across the stage, and who want to earn 7-figures.
It is for those who would rather be the hunted than the hunter. Who prefer to work smarter, instead of harder. Who want to build a life-long business, instead of an opportunity, and for those who value truth over hype.
If you’re tired of chasing your friends and family members, posting fliers on phone poles, cold calling leads, and handing out business cards, then Magnetic Sponsoring is exactly what you’ve been looking for.

 Here’s what you’ll learn…

Chapter 1: How to Become the Hunted, Instead of the Hunter
Chapter 2: “You Inc.” – How to Create a Real Business with Zero Competition
Chapter 3: The Business Model I’ve Used to Make Over $50 Million
Chapter 4: How to Generate Endless Leads for Free
Chapter 5: How To Find The Best Prospects For Your Business
Chapter 6: How to Create a Marketing Machine That Recruits for You
Chapter 7: The Million-Dollar Skill and How to Get It
Chapter 8: Becoming a Professional
Chapter 9: Core Values for Long-Term Success

 Elevation Prophets >> Salty Droid  ... you can’t make money online block ads! © 2009-2017 :: rights reserved ... powered by jekyll ... built & maintained by /jarvis Salty Droid >> bleep bloop  Elevation Prophets  06 Jul 2012  :: by sd :: Comments Mike Dillard is always the shortest “man” in the room :: which is why he’s going miss his hair more than other early aging narcissistic wind bags {quite an accomplishment} … you can’t hide your bald spots when everyone is looking down on you.My inbox was introduced to Mike Dillard in 2009 :: his being one of the first scammy mailing lists I signed up for after deciding to become a fake robotic vigilante for justice …My little company will do over $10,000,000 in revenue in 2009. That’s 8-figures and we still don’t have an office.Now I don’t mention all of this to brag… I know you don’t give a damn.But, I want you to understand who I am, and why you should give me your attention, because what I’m going to teach you is EXACTLY what I did to achieve these results.Well maybe not EXACTLY exactly :: but there was this one great tip … I spend over $30,000/Yr on books and courses like Magnetic Sponsoring because school is never out for a pro. This is the biggest secret to my success.Spend $30k on e-frauducts.??Profit!Mike Dillard has always been all about MLM :: other Internet Marketers like to talk shit about MLM … because “those guys are the ones who are the real scammers” … but tiny little Mike Dillard has always embraced it. Yeah :: it’s a pyramid … you got a problem with that?Mikey D-bag was upline of one of this blogs original dirtbag targets … Jimmy Davis. I tried to pressure Jimmy out of the game by pressuring Dillard about Jimmy’s shenanigans. It worked :: too easily … and Jimmy Davis evaporated from the IM scene. But that trick only works if you’re trying to get rid of a B-team nobody like Jimmy Davis. Trying the same thing with an A-teamer like Perry Belcher didn’t work at all. A-teamers are usually obligated to stick together no matter how much they hate each other.Here’s Mike defending convicted felon Perry Belcher in 2008 …I’ve known Perry for 3 years, I know the entire legal story behind that article, and there’s another side to it. (I even toured Selmedica’s factory). Perry is 100% legit, has never scammed anyone, and is one of the most caring and honest people you’ll meet.Nope :: Perry was 0% legit.The variation in reactions to my attacks on Davis versus my attacks on Belcher :: helped learnify me about the cartels … and about how the only thing that really matters is one’s position inside of those cartels.Mike Dillard’s actions :: and bullshits … got him permanently positioned on my shit list during those early days. But there’s lots of peeps on that ever growing list :: and I never really got around to him … maybe because he’s too short to see.Here’s a way old school pic of Yanik Silver’s “mastermind” :: featuring A-teamers Perry Belcher and Michael N. Dillard … best boyfriends forever.During 2009 and 2010 Dillard primarily promoted his wicked horrible MLM scam flopportunity … Wealth Masters International. WMI was an opportunity to attend the secret-code-word seminars M1 :: M2 :: and M3 … for five figure sums. At the M1:2:3 you learn about how rich you could be if you devoted more time to selling others on the M1:2:3.I’ve heard many sad personal stories about Wealth Masters International destroying people’s lives. Five figure losses are hard to swallow … especially if you’re already struggling. In 2011 the SEC opened an investigation into the dubious activities of WMI … founded by Kip Herriage and Karl Bessey … and whose top producer was Mikey D-bag. Here’s a bit from a crazytown exchange between Karl Bessey and a top staffer who was leaving WMI …Kip is giving it to you UP THE ASS Karl.He steals from you Karl! But its your fault, because you let him!Quit being such a damn pansy, you own 40%! Act like it.Priceless.Hearing Kip tell the WMI community that “…we are a debt free company..” Holy hell, we haven’t been debt free for almost 2 years now.Because it’s okay to lie as long as you really need the money for blow … or whatevers. So maybe the Wealth Masters haven’t quite mastered the wealths yet.In 2011 Mike Dillard switched his focus to a new venture he’d founded :: The Elevation Group … a fear porn investment “diary” promising to reveal the investing tricks of the ultra rich for the regular internet joe.Lesson 1 :: give it to Karl … UP THE ASS!Here’s boiler room beefcake Russell Brunson telling me about it …My friend Mike Dillard (who’s made around $20,000,000 by the age of 33), is holding a webinar just for us that you NEED to attend if you’re into preserving, or growing your wealth. He’s going to teach you how he’s been able to predict the financial future, making a 400% ROI since 2008…Eben Pagan …As you know, we are in a… well… very WEIRD financial period of history right now.Most of us (me included) are worried about what is going to happen to the value of literally everything… even the value of our money.Jonathan Budd …“When the world seemingly began to “Fall Apart” back in 2008… and our confidence & belief in our financial system was shattered to it’s CORE as millions of people lost 40% of their life savings in a few months…… Mike Dillard was showing me how to make a TON of money while it was all happening & truly PROTECT myself against the onslaught that pulverized everyone else.”Everyone promotes this crap :: because that’s what everyone does … and a fake financial expert is born. The world economy is crumbling :: the banks are sticking it to us … only Mike Dillard and The Elevation Group can save us. Mike starts pretending to be an Atlas Shrugged character … ads for The Elevation Group are run during Glenn Beck’s radio show.When you sign up for The Elevation Group email list :: Mike tells you …“We’re living through the greatest wealth transfer in the history of mankind. It will cause unprecedented destruction for most, and unprecedented opportunity for a few.”The only factor that will determine which group you’re in, is knowledge… Do you know what’s happening, and do you know how to turn it into opportunity?The Elevation Group was created in order to provide you with the education, contacts, and resources you need to take advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.It was the worst of times … it was the best of times.Mike Dillard isn’t qualified :: in any fucking way :: to give you financial advice … but he’s gonna anyway … and he’s gonna charge you for it … natch. It’s totally okay though because he calls it a “diary” … so how could that be anything other than innocent?In the beginning :: the main super secret secret of the ultra rich revealed was … wait for it … buying silver. The world is going to collapse :: so buy silver … easy breezy. But then silver started to tank :: some EVG group members started to freak … and after reminding them that they should only blame themselves …If you join “investment newsletters”, follow their stock picks, and then cross your fingers… You’re ***. Seriously.And you deserve it because that kind of decision is no different than going to Vegas and throwing your chips down on the roulette table. Without the proper financial education to back up your decision, you’re literally just placing a “bet”.… Mike went on to drop these financial wizdumb turds …I’ve studied the currency market, global debt, and precious metals for three years. I know exactly why I have 90% of my assets in silver…And I know exactly what to look for before I even THINK about selling…The bottom line is that until the US has two options… They can default and declare bankruptcy, or they can print their way out of debt, which will lead to hyperinflation.Until one of those two things happen, I’m going to continue to buy more gold and silver.Here’s a chart comparing the US Dollar to silver since these elevating words were spoken in May 2011 :: the dollar is up 8% … silver is down 41%.… and you can too!!90% crack makes more sense to me than 90% silver {people always need crack during a crisis} … but maybe I just don’t know because my financial advisor is a financial advisor instead of an Internet Marketer.In February 2012 :: Mike Dillard and The Elevation Group began Lesson 19 … giving it to Karl up the ass and 90% silver weren’t good enough anymore. It was time to start placing Vegas style “bets” :: it was time for the expert forex trading of the ultra-rich under the advisement of world class financial expert Senen Pousa.Financial expert Senen Pousa is exactly as qualified to give financial advice as PF Chang’s waiter Mike Dillard :: which is to say … not. His {since removed} Investment Intelligence Corporation website offered charts and words to “prove” his Madoff beating performance over the past several years :: all totally laughable fucking bullshit …“Investment Intelligence Corporation holds the world’s highest ranking for investment recommendations performance over the last 5 years. When compared with 15,137 MorningStar Funds and 195 investment newsletter recommendation services monitored by MarketWatch, Investment Intelligence Corporation’s Passive ProphetMax service ranks #1.”In spite of the obvious ridiculousness :: Mike Dillard promoted Senen Pousa to his credulous customers … and hard. The promotion was open to Elevation Group members and outsiders alike. Here’s an example of how the opportunity was promoted inside the membership area …2501% :: impressive … I guess that’s why he’s #1 in the fake rankings.The Verge’s Joe Flatley was at Yanik Silver’s Underground 8 seminar that same February :: where Robert Hirsch gave a keynote pitch for The Elevation Group … cause masterminders gots to stick together. A few stupid bits made it into the Scamworld movie :: including Hirsch reading Dillard’s “greatest wealth transfer” sales copy … and a shot of Lesson 19 on the big screen.PhaseOne of Lesson 19 was purchasing Senen Pousa’s e-frauduct membership site :: ProphetMax … for $2000. Once you’d paid to play :: PhaseTwo was depositing money with a broker of Senen’s choosing … an incredibly dubious looking broker called IB Capital FX whose recent appearance out of sulfuric thin air seems likely to be tied to Pousa. Victims were compelled to sign non-disclosure agreements :: their access to necessary information was severely limited … and they were told that if they contacted the broker directly they may forfeit their funds.OMG so dubious!But when Elevation Group members raised their concerns about the situation :: they were deleted by Mike Dillard … and rebuked in classic cult dissent repression style …If you do not feel comfortable investing with his team, don’t. Period. We’ve done an incredible amount of research on our end, and I trust the man with my life. That’s all I have to say on the matter, and will not address this thread further.Someone started a thread about Senen Pousa on the Trade2Win forums :: and within a couple of hours forum member @shewolf had the whole thing called …THIS LOOKS LIKE A MASSIVE SCAM TO GET LOTS OF MANAGED FUNDS BY SAYING THAT HE IS GETTING “UNBELIEVABLY” HIGH RETURNS.He also says in his second video that you MUST sign a confidentiality agreement and agree to NEVER contact the bank where your funds are being sent to. If you do, then you forfeit ALL your funds.BEWARE OF THIS SENSA POUSA and his INVESTMENT INTELLIGENCE CORPORATIONComplete and total B#LLSh1T.Anyone who send ANY money to these guys DESERVES TO LOSE EVERY CENT.Yup! … except for that last bit of course. The T2W thread {which mushroomed into hundreds of pages} :: much like our happy home … had just the right combination of snarky skeptics and coagulating victims. The agressive truth seeking and discussion had an obvious impact on events as they unfolded … so a shout out from our regulars to theirs. There was lots of :: “I can’t believe people are this idiotic” type shit … and I’m hoping I can sort that out with one word …IndoctrinationThese people aren’t idiots {mostly} … and they don’t deserve to lose any cents. They’ve just been intentionally lied to and manipulated for so long that they are no longer capable of recognizing the truth. It’s fucking sad :: and very disturbing … and it’s not hard to accomplish.Mike Dillard :: on the other hand … has no such excuses. In a recent conversation Mr. Dillard told me …In January, I flew out to Brisbane to look him in the eye and feel him out. Everything went fine and he appeared to be someone we could trust, so we decided to do a promo for ProphetMax in February which was approved by our legal team before hand.Mike Dillard’s “legal team” must consist mostly of root vegetables with fake mustaches :: because only a lawyer on 90% crack would fail to recognize Senen Pousa as completely illegitimate … in spite of his #1 world ranking. But Mike Dillard promoted the shit out him :: says victim @sofree on the T2W thread …Mike said on the live webinar that he was recieving a small commssion of $20 - $30k from Senen, just enough ot cover the cost of running the show. I have that documented. When I posted it on EVG FB page (as same question arose) it was deleted.Well that’s strange :: because Mike Dillard told the fake robot this week that he collected $750,000 in commissions … and that his take was 30% per ProphetMax sale. That’s significantly more than he previously reported … but I still don’t believe it. Maybe that’s what Senen ended up actually forking over :: but I see NO REASON for an A-teamer like Dillard to accept the standard affiliate rate offered by a B-teamer like Senen Pousa … in fact I’ve never seen that happen. But assuming that the paper trail shows 70 - 30 … then that means approx. 1250 victims paid for the opportunity to participate in the trading portion of the scam.Oh and about that trading portion :: on May 16th … everyone Mike Dillard sold to Senen Pousa lost 65% of their funds. Accounts had a five figure minimum :: and all of the victims I’ve talked to lost scary big sums that most could in no way afford. How does Mike Dillard respond to his whole flock being sheared bare on the back of his unicornian advice? Like a total psychopathic asshole :: natch …And yet here I am sitting at dinner last night talking to Tom, and hear that a few of you have decided to, “go all in, and put it all on black.”If you’re one of these people, I’ll make these very plain and simple for you to understand… You’re a **ing idiot.You’ve make me second guess the viability of what we’re trying to do to change the world.NOW I finally understand why the rich don’t tell the poor or middle class what they’re doing with their money.Now I understand why most people hand their money over to an advisor, only to get willingly screwed in the ass by most of them… It’s because you’d do even worse if you were left to your own devices.You’re reckless.You’re emotional.You’re desperate.You don’t take responsibility for your actions.And you’re jeopardizing an incredible thing for those who ARE ready for this kind of information.Well that’s touchingly sympathetic :: I guess it’s much easier to blow off a 65% loss when it comes on the back of a $750,000 gain … that’s something the rich never tell the idiots in the middle class. Because if everyone knew about it … everyone would form a cartel of liars and start doing it for themselves.Here’s what one of those emotional :: reckless … desperate **ing idiots said to me …“This is the biggest financial mistake of my life. Only people who suffer through an event such as this can understand. A victim of this scam told me his little daughter keeps asking him why “Mommy cries all the time”. The pain is almost more than one can bear.”Ouch.Senen Pousa :: totally James Arthur Ray style … actually blamed the victims’ negative attitudes for the losses. When that only fueled the rage :: he had the fucking balls to bring the supposed trader on his weekly webinar to explain that he’d accidentally entered 200 instead of 20 … as if.As the shit refused to stop hitting the fan {thanks mostly to T2W hosting an actual dialog} :: and while continuing to censor dissent … weasel fuck Mike Dillard was forced to soften his “you dirty poor people are ruining my world changing with your crying” position. He started bad mouthing Pousa … and attempting to frame himself as the victim. He said he was hiring lawyers to get to the bottom of the mess :: and even forced them to write a bizarre “yeah he actually hired lawyers” type letter. Mike Dillard :: he’s your friend … he’ll help you out. Except no :: because it turned out to be Utah lawyer Brent Baker … who is a white collar criminal attorney specializing in people who have problems with federal regulators … which Mike Dillard is most def about to have.On June 22 :: swift as an elderly turtle … Mike Dillard claimed he’d filed a class action lawsuit. Tooting of own horn commenced immediately …As previously stated, I am bearing 100% of the legal costs, (which have already exceeded over $100,000 in the first 30 days), and 100% of any money recovered will be distributed to the EVG members who were victimized by Senen Pousa, Investment Intelligence Corporation, IB Capital, Global Forex Management, etc…Why am I doing this?Very simple…It’s the right thing to do. Period.All similarly situated victims are encouraged to participate :: “similarly situated” meaning you received $750,000 in commissions for promoting the scam … and were privy to all the pertinent details before hand … just like Mike Dillard.B-teamers are always the fall guys … but the only thing that really matters is stopping the A-teamers. Mike Dillard is the one who needs to be sued. Mike Dillard is the one who can pay up if sued. Mike Dillard is the one who needs to take responsibility for his actions. Mike Dillard is the one who needs to be stopped. Mike Dillard is the one who needs to be arrested.Period.>> bleep bloop Older Newercategories: big ones :: lawyers :: Mike Dillard :: MLM :: Perry Belcher :: Robert Hirsch :: scams :: turtles :: scamworld :: Senen Pousa :: Utah :: Wealth Masters International :: Yanik Silver :: James Arthur Ray :: Jimmy Davis :: Jonathan Budd :: Russell Brunson :: psychopaths :related  On Six Jan 10, 2014   Rippln Ripple Rippln Rip May 8, 2013   Suits vs Prophets Sep 26, 2012   Ocean Breathes Salty Aug 27, 2015   RadioActive SaltyDroid Jul 18, 2012 comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. ↑ Back to top
