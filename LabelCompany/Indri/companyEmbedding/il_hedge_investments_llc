About Us

OakBrook Investments is a research oriented firm driven by a group of professionals with advanced degrees in economics and finance. We have managed money since 1983, and previously worked as part of a team for one of the pioneers in index fund management and quantitative techniques.
History
OakBrook Investments was launched in February 1998 by Janna Sampson, Peter Jankovskis, and Neil Wright. They were joined in March 1998 by Giri Cherukuri. The four had previously served together for several years managing portfolios at   Northern Trust Quantitative Advisors and its predecessor, ANB Investment   Management & Trust Company. OakBrook's registration as an Investment Adviser   became effective March 27, 1998, and the firm began managing tax-exempt assets   as of June 8, 1998.
From its initial launch with the Select Equity Strategy and a single  Quantitative strategy benchmarked to the S&P 500, OakBrook has greatly expanded its product line-up. Janna and Peter led efforts to add additional benchmarks to the  Quantitative family and to develop a market neutral strategy utilizing enhanced index techniques. They became the co-Chief Investment Officers of OakBrook following the retirement of Neil Wright in September, 2007.
OakBrook Investments, LLC is 100% owned by employees.
