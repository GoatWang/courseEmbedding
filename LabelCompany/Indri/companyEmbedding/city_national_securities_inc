Past performance is no guarantee of future performance.

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

City National Bank Creates ``City National Securities Inc.,'' Announces Online Brokerage Services

 LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 12, 2000-- Expansion of Online Financial Services Cements City National Bank's Leadership Among Mid-Sized Banks for "High Touch, High Tech" Capabilities City National Bank (NYSE:CYN) today announced it has formed City National Securities Inc., a discount brokerage company, and unveiled Online Brokerage services - the latest additions to its City National eLink(SM) system of online financial services and products. City National Securities is a wholly owned subsidiary of City National Bank.  City National Bank, the premier business and private bank headquartered in California, is rapidly deploying innovative technology to provide clients convenient and powerful Web-based access points for all their banking and investment needs. By creating City National Securities, the bank continues its tradition of providing entrepreneurs, businesses and affluent individuals a one-source, high-touch and experienced financial services center.  "City National Securities, combined with our new online services and our decades of experience in providing first-class trust and investment services, enables us to enhance our relationships with our clients and empower them with the latest tools to manage their finances," said Vernon Kozlen, Executive Vice President and Manager of City National Investments (CNI), the trust and investment division of City National Bank. Today, sophisticated investors who may have their financial relationships spread among multiple institutions, are looking for the convenience and time savings of having their investments, checking accounts, trust accounts, mortgages, retirement plans and business investments located in a single, trusted organization, Kozlen added. At City National, clients today can buy and sell stocks, review their bank account balances or investment portfolios, seek modifications to their 401(k) plan, pay their bills and review their retirement plans from their home or office computer.  "Certainly, online trading and online banking are available from many institutions. The difference at City National is that we are using the latest technologies while continuing to provide our well-known, highly personalized relationship management with our clients," Kozlen said. "City National Investments is seeing its assets and client base expand because of our superior service and expertise, as well as our demonstrated commitment to expand our products and services."  Recently, City National Investments added more research capabilities, enhanced its financial planning service and created its own family of mutual funds called "CNI Charter Funds." CNI was also one of the first bank-run investment divisions in California to offer Individually Directed Accounts (IDAs), which offer customers the flexibility to integrate unique securities and investments assets from outside of their company plan, into their retirement plan.  City National Securities, a separate entity under City National Bank, enables clients to trade stocks, index options and equity options either online or over the phone. Real-time quotations are offered online at no additional charge. Individuals can call 800/750-5471 to set up an online account.  Jim Gleason, a Senior Vice President with more than 30 years of experience in brokerage and financial services, will manage the brokerage company. In addition, City National has hired several key management and supervisory personnel to be part of the brokerage team.  For answers to other questions about City National Securities Inc. and the new online services, clients and prospective clients are encouraged to visit City National's Web site at "cnb.com," or contact an Investment Representative at 800/750-5471.  With a focus on enhancing after-tax returns on client portfolios, City National Investments is well regarded for its long-term relationships and commitment to service and expertise. City National Investments administers nearly $15 billion in assets, including assets under management. Assisting successful entrepreneurs, businesses, foundations, municipal agencies and families for more than 30 years, City National Investment's staff of more than 200 professionals provides a broad range of expertise in investment and wealth management, employee benefit programs, estate and financial planning, securities sales and trading.  City National eLink is designed as a strong Internet complement to City National Bank's successful relationship banking model that offers efficient, specialized, high-value products and outstanding services to its private and business banking and investment clients.  Utilizing state-of-the-art technology, the City National eLink network debuted last November initially with online banking and online retirement services functions: - Online Banking: Allows clients to view personal account and  loan balances in real time, obtain account transaction history, process fund transfers, and perform online bill payment. Customers can also manage this information by exporting account details to personal financial management software. - Retirement Accounts: Gives employees of companies that have chosen City National for their employees' retirement planning needs access to their 401(k) accounts through the City National eLink "personal retirement" service. Once clients log on, they can review their accounts, make changes in their investment portfolios, review investment prices and performance, request forms and more. City National recently announced the addition of "inside@cnb," a highly personalized and information-rich Internet platform exclusively for select private and business banking clients of City National Bank. City National Bank will announce other components to its eLink system during the remainder of 2000. These include cash management services, international import and export letters of credit, and the ability to make foreign exchange payments electronically.

Securities Class Action Lawsuits, Stock Lawsuits, Securities Fraud Lawsuits

Securities fraud lawsuits and stock lawsuits have been filed against numerous financial firms, stockbrokers, financial advisers and companies alleging fraud or other misconduct. These allegations include claims that the issuers of securities have misled investors regarding the value of their investments, that stockbrokers or financial advisers acted improperly in managing clients' accounts or that companies that offer employee stock options or benefits plans failed to act in the best interests of plan participants. In some cases, investors can file securities class action lawsuits; in other cases, investors must file an arbitration if they hope to recover their losses.

FREE CASE EVALUATION

			Send your securities claim to a Lawyer who will review your claim at NO COST or obligation.


Securities and Stock Fraud
Stock fraud occurs when the issuer of the security makes false statements about the company's status or fails to disclose important facts that may affect stock value, causing investors to buy or sell stocks under false pretenses. Claims can be brought against the issuer of the security, i.e. the public company, the company's officers, directors or others involved in the violation, including stockbrokers, underwriter or auditors.

Exchange Traded Funds

Companies that issued Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) face lawsuits alleging that they did not adequately disclose the risks associated with those ETFs in their prospectus and registration filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In June, 2009, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) issued a regulatory warning regarding leveraged and inverse ETFs, noting that the ETFs are typically not suitable for retail investors who planned to hold them for more than one trading session.

Auction Rate Securities

Investors who put their money in Auction Rate Securities (ARS) have filed lawsuits alleging that they were told the securities were a safe, liquid investment. However, when the ARS market was frozen, many investors found they could not sell their Auction Rate Securities. Some companies have settled claims with clients and agreed to purchase back the Auction Rate Securities.  

Stockbroker Fraud and Stockbroker Arbitration
There are a number of ways a Stockbroker or Financial Advisor can break laws surrounding investment practices. Stockbroker fraud or negligence can include misrepresenting stocks or the risks associated with those investments, recommending unsuitable stocks, charging excessive transaction fees or failing to diversify an investor's portfolio. It is a stockbroker's responsibility to consider his client's best interest in all investment transactions.

Clients who believe their stockbroker has acted improperly may be able to file an arbitration against the broker and, possibly, the financial firm the broker works for. 

Stock Options and ERISA Complaints
ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act) regulates employee benefit and pension plans, both of which can be tied into stock options. Employees and retired employees can file a lawsuit against a company and/or its officers for breaching fiduciary responsibilities and putting stock options and pension plans at risk.

Issues involved in ERISA include wrongfully canceling or breaching employee stock options, denying an employee rights granted by a Stock Option Agreement, misrepresenting the value of the stock, failing to act in the best interests of stock option plans, failing to act prudently in conducting and managing investments or lying about the number of options employees will be given. Furthermore, it is a violation of ERISA for an employer to take deductions from an employee's paycheck for benefits but then not make those payments into the benefits plan.

Under ERISA, it is illegal for an employer to "discharge, fine, suspend, expel, discipline, or discriminate against a participant or beneficiary for exercising any right to which he is entitled under the provisions of an employee benefit plan…" Claims have been made alleging that employees were terminated or discriminated against when the employer suspected that the employee was about to make a claim under a benefits plan. In such situations, the employee must prove that the action taken against him was done so primarily to prevent him from accessing benefits and not that the loss of benefits was simply a consequence of the action taken.

Companies that have had ERISA complaints filed against them include YRC Worldwide Inc (concerning the Yellow Freight Pension Plan), Motorola and Sterling Financial Corporation.
