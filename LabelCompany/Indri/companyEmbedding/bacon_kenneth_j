Fannie Mae Retiree led Fannie Mae’s Katrina Response and Low-Income Financing for Millions
Kenneth J. Bacon
Executive Vice President, Multifamily Mortgage Business, Fannie Mae
Headquarters: Washington, D.C.
Website: www.fanniemae.com
Primary Business: Financial services
Education: BA, Stanford University; MS, London School of Economics; MBA, Harvard Business School
What I’m Reading: Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson
Interests: Golfing, hunting, wine, education
Fannie Mae Retiree led Fannie Mae’s Katrina Response and Low-Income Financing for Millions
Over the past 11 years, Fannie Mae’s Multifamily Mortgage Business has financed 7.6 million units of rental housing under the seasoned leadership of Kenneth J. Bacon, executive vice president of the division.
Today, Fannie Mae is the largest single source of financing for rental housing in the country, ensuring that funds are available to build and maintain the quality rental housing that American families depend on.
Bacon will retire in March, concluding a 19-year tenure at Fannie Mae, which also included responsibility for management and marketing of Fannie Mae’s portfolio of multifamily loans and investments, and roles serving single-family housing and directing investments in community development.
Ken is from Houston and resides in Washington, D.C. A distinguished scholar, he has earned an MBA from the Harvard Business School, an MS in international relations from the London School of Economics (where he studied as a Marshall Scholar,) and a Bachelor of Arts degree from Stanford University. Bacon is also on the board of directors for Comcast.
Bacon has guided the multifamily business to a profitable niche serving the workforce rental market. Almost 90 percent of the units Fannie Mae financed in 2011 were affordable to low- and middle-income families.
“Fannie Mae has a terrific mission, to finance rental housing for millions of Americans,” says Bacon. “Keeping capital flowing to the market for affordable rental housing provides stability for our communities and the nation.”
Under his leadership, the multifamily business has provided a total of $289 billion in liquidity to the rental market. He also led Fannie Mae’s response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when 300,000 homes were severely damaged or destroyed along the Gulf Coast. Fannie Mae has worked with nonprofits, government agencies, and business partners and invested nearly $5 billion in debt and equity to finance multifamily apartments and support housing recovery after the devastating storm.
“Fannie Mae’s job is to support housing in all markets and at all times,” Bacon says. “That includes the national market as it grapples with the current housing crisis and also local and regional housing markets when they are affected by a natural disaster or an economic downturn.”
Bacon attributes the success of Fannie Mae’s multifamily organization to the strength of his team. “I take a lot of pride in what we’ve accomplished, and I do mean ‘we,’ he says. “Our employees bring years of experience, expertise, and energy to this business. They understand their customers and know the products backward and forward. These are folks who get things done. But more importantly, they enjoy the process of getting there.”
“Fannie Mae’s mission has never been more critical than it is right now. Fannie Mae is committed to building a sustainable housing market and stable communities for the future,” adds Bacon. “I am proud of the legacy I leave behind and feel confident Fannie Mae is poised for continued success serving America’s rental housing needs.”
What is your most rewarding career accomplishment? Establishing the Securitization Program while working for the Resolution Trust Corporation. The savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s had significant effects on the US economy, particularly on commercial real estate. The program that I established had never been done previously and was critical to settling this segment of the market.
What’s the worst mistake a leader can make? Remaining in a single position of power for too long and having a certain level of comfort. It is paramount that all of us, including those who lead, understand progression is necessary for continued growth, for ourselves and for our future leaders.
What was the best advice you ever received? My mother once told me that I was too old and too black to expect life to be fair. While it was difficult to comprehend initially, as I matured I understood that regardless of our best efforts, there are some things that will not go as we expect, and that some of these things will not seem to be just or rational.

Early life and career[edit]
Bacon was born in Bronxville, New York.[1] He attended Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire, for high school, graduating in 1962; the school honored him in 2007 with its John Phillips Award, which recognizes graduates for their contributions to society.[2] He earned his undergraduate degree at Amherst College, where his father was a dean[3] and also taught political science. After Amherst, Bacon received post-graduate education at Columbia University, where he earned simultaneous master's degrees in business and journalism.[1]
Bacon served in the U.S. Army Reserve from 1968 to 1974. After two years working in the office of U.S. Senator Thomas J. McIntyre (D–NH) as a legislative assistant, he was hired by The Wall Street Journal as a reporter (1965).[3] He was assigned to the paper's bureau in Washington, D.C., working his way up to become a columnist and editor.[1]
Spokesman at Defense Department[edit]




Bacon and Secretary of Defense William Perry during a flight to Europe, 1995


William Perry, who had served as US Undersecretary of Defense in the 1970s and had become familiar with WSJ reporter Bacon while in that capacity, was named to serve as Secretary of Defense in the Clinton Administration in 1994. He invited Bacon to serve as Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, serving as the public face of the Defense Department.[1][4]
In 1997 Bacon was retained in his post[3] by Perry's successor at the Defense Department, William Cohen. As part of NATO's involvement in the Kosovo War, Bacon represented the Defense Department on a visit to the Balkans in 1999 with Cohen, where they had the opportunity to visit a refugee camp. Bacon had never before realized "the sheer magnitude of one million people leaving their homes and needing food, shelter and medical care" and then returning to their homes after the cessation of hostilities and wondered if all those worldwide who had provided support and assistance to Kosovar refugees could "give the same attention to the refugees in the Congo, Afghanistan and Sudan".[1]
Linda Tripp incident[edit]
See also: Lewinsky scandal
In March 1998, Bacon released details of employee Linda Tripp's personnel file to a reporter, disclosing that Tripp had omitted on her employment application an incident that occurred when she was arrested for theft when she was 19 years old. Tripp, a Defense Department employee, had been a friend of Monica Lewinsky, who had herself worked as an assistant in Bacon's office in 1996 and 1997 (having been hired on the recommendation of the White House).[3] Bacon was criticized for violating privacy laws and harming Tripp's reputation. In response to a Defense Department Inspector General's report in 2000 that concluded that Bacon had not followed authorized procedures, William Cohen published a letter that had been sent to Bacon in which Bacon's actions were called "hasty and ill-conceived".[5] Bacon issued a statement that the information he released was driven by "a desire to be responsive to an urgent media inquiry" and that the Inspector General's two-year investigation did not find any connection to the White House.[6] In a 2003 settlement, following a lawsuit which claimed that the revelations violated the Privacy Act of 1974, Tripp received a payment of $595,000, retroactive promotion and salary increases for the years 1998 to 2000 and the right to reapply for government employment.[7]
Refugees International[edit]
Main article: Refugees International
Bacon recognized that becoming a refugee was a matter of circumstance that could affect anyone, noting that his own "blue-blooded WASP" ancestors were refugees themselves, who "came over from England in 1630, fleeing debts for all I know".[1]
After leaving his government post in 2001, Bacon became president of Refugees International, which compels the world's leaders to assist the millions worldwide who have fled their homes due to violence or persecution. The organization regularly assists and provides guidance to government and UN agencies, including peacekeeping bodies, on ways to serve the needs of refugees.[1][5][8] Bacon focused much of his work on advocating for additional protection and assistance to displaced people from Sudan's Darfur region and Iraq. He was also active in drawing international attention to displaced people in Afghanistan, Burma, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Colombia and Thailand. During Bacon's tenure as president of Refugees International, the organization doubled in size.[9]
In the weeks before the start of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Bacon suggested such methods as selection of bombing targets outside of densely populated areas as a means to reduce the number of refugees. In September 2003, Bacon encouraged French participation in the peacekeeping forces in Iraq, based on that nation's prior experience in such circumstances.[1] Emphasizing that "the US cannot afford to win the military battle and lose the humanitarian campaign" in Iraq, Bacon advocated for increased numbers of Iraqi refugees to be allowed to enter the United States and for greater American financial assistance to refugees from violence in Iraq, with funding from the State Department rising from $43 million in 2006 to $398 in 2008.[5]
Five days before his death (August 10), Refugees International announced that Bacon had endowed a new program to focus on people displaced by climate change.[3]
Personal life[edit]
Bacon wrote an essay about health care reform from his own perspective as a cancer patient, a "matter of life and death" for him, that was published in The Washington Post 25 days before his death. He offered prevention and online efficiencies among his recommendations, with his own example of melanoma that could have been treatable if caught earlier given a family history of the condition. He described his difficulties in getting approval for payment of radiation therapy for cancer that had spread to his brain, which his insurer had deemed "not medically necessary" and expressed his frustration with the amount of time he and his physician had to spend in dealing with paperwork.[10]
He served as chairman of the Folger Shakespeare Library and was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the International Institute for Strategic Studies.[5]
Death[edit]
A resident of Washington, D.C., Bacon died at age 64 of complications related to melanoma, at his second home on Block Island, Rhode Island. He was survived by his two daughters and his wife of 43 years, the former Darcy Wheeler.[1][5]

In 1997 Bacon was retained in his post[3] by Perry's successor at the Defense Department, William Cohen. As part of NATO's involvement in the Kosovo War, Bacon represented the Defense Department on a visit to the Balkans in 1999 with Cohen, where they had the opportunity to visit a refugee camp. Bacon had never before realized "the sheer magnitude of one million people leaving their homes and needing food, shelter and medical care" and then returning to their homes after the cessation of hostilities and wondered if all those worldwide who had provided support and assistance to Kosovar refugees could "give the same attention to the refugees in the Congo, Afghanistan and Sudan".[1]
Linda Tripp incident[edit]
See also: Lewinsky scandal
In March 1998, Bacon released details of employee Linda Tripp's personnel file to a reporter, disclosing that Tripp had omitted on her employment application an incident that occurred when she was arrested for theft when she was 19 years old. Tripp, a Defense Department employee, had been a friend of Monica Lewinsky, who had herself worked as an assistant in Bacon's office in 1996 and 1997 (having been hired on the recommendation of the White House).[3] Bacon was criticized for violating privacy laws and harming Tripp's reputation. In response to a Defense Department Inspector General's report in 2000 that concluded that Bacon had not followed authorized procedures, William Cohen published a letter that had been sent to Bacon in which Bacon's actions were called "hasty and ill-conceived".[5] Bacon issued a statement that the information he released was driven by "a desire to be responsive to an urgent media inquiry" and that the Inspector General's two-year investigation did not find any connection to the White House.[6] In a 2003 settlement, following a lawsuit which claimed that the revelations violated the Privacy Act of 1974, Tripp received a payment of $595,000, retroactive promotion and salary increases for the years 1998 to 2000 and the right to reapply for government employment.[7]
Refugees International[edit]
Main article: Refugees International
Bacon recognized that becoming a refugee was a matter of circumstance that could affect anyone, noting that his own "blue-blooded WASP" ancestors were refugees themselves, who "came over from England in 1630, fleeing debts for all I know".[1]
After leaving his government post in 2001, Bacon became president of Refugees International, which compels the world's leaders to assist the millions worldwide who have fled their homes due to violence or persecution. The organization regularly assists and provides guidance to government and UN agencies, including peacekeeping bodies, on ways to serve the needs of refugees.[1][5][8] Bacon focused much of his work on advocating for additional protection and assistance to displaced people from Sudan's Darfur region and Iraq. He was also active in drawing international attention to displaced people in Afghanistan, Burma, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Colombia and Thailand. During Bacon's tenure as president of Refugees International, the organization doubled in size.[9]
In the weeks before the start of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Bacon suggested such methods as selection of bombing targets outside of densely populated areas as a means to reduce the number of refugees. In September 2003, Bacon encouraged French participation in the peacekeeping forces in Iraq, based on that nation's prior experience in such circumstances.[1] Emphasizing that "the US cannot afford to win the military battle and lose the humanitarian campaign" in Iraq, Bacon advocated for increased numbers of Iraqi refugees to be allowed to enter the United States and for greater American financial assistance to refugees from violence in Iraq, with funding from the State Department rising from $43 million in 2006 to $398 in 2008.[5]
Five days before his death (August 10), Refugees International announced that Bacon had endowed a new program to focus on people displaced by climate change.[3]
Personal life[edit]
Bacon wrote an essay about health care reform from his own perspective as a cancer patient, a "matter of life and death" for him, that was published in The Washington Post 25 days before his death. He offered prevention and online efficiencies among his recommendations, with his own example of melanoma that could have been treatable if caught earlier given a family history of the condition. He described his difficulties in getting approval for payment of radiation therapy for cancer that had spread to his brain, which his insurer had deemed "not medically necessary" and expressed his frustration with the amount of time he and his physician had to spend in dealing with paperwork.[10]
He served as chairman of the Folger Shakespeare Library and was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the International Institute for Strategic Studies.[5]
Death[edit]
A resident of Washington, D.C., Bacon died at age 64 of complications related to melanoma, at his second home on Block Island, Rhode Island. He was survived by his two daughters and his wife of 43 years, the former Darcy Wheeler.[1][5]

Early life and career[edit]
Bacon was born in Bronxville, New York.[1] He attended Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire, for high school, graduating in 1962; the school honored him in 2007 with its John Phillips Award, which recognizes graduates for their contributions to society.[2] He earned his undergraduate degree at Amherst College, where his father was a dean[3] and also taught political science. After Amherst, Bacon received post-graduate education at Columbia University, where he earned simultaneous master's degrees in business and journalism.[1]
Bacon served in the U.S. Army Reserve from 1968 to 1974. After two years working in the office of U.S. Senator Thomas J. McIntyre (D–NH) as a legislative assistant, he was hired by The Wall Street Journal as a reporter (1965).[3] He was assigned to the paper's bureau in Washington, D.C., working his way up to become a columnist and editor.[1]
Spokesman at Defense Department[edit]

                            Firm profile submitted by Shook, Hardy & Bacon LLP

Shook, Hardy & Bacon has long been recognized as one of the premier litigation defense firms in the country. Shook has represented companies in the science, health, technology, and consumer goods sectors in their most substantial national and international product liability, mass tort and complex litigation matters for more than 125 years. Shook’s success in these areas has captured the attention of many in the industry, including The American Lawyer, which recognized the firm as its Product Liability Litigation Department of the Year in 2012 and 2008, as well as a finalist in its 2010 and 2016 contests. For 12 consecutive years, Shook has also been named the Product Liability Defense Law Firm of the Year by Who’s Who Legal: The International Who’s Who of Business Lawyers; and Shook was named one of Law360’s Product Liability Groups of the Year in 2015 and 2016. The firm has repeatedly been named to the IP Law & Business rankings ‘Who Protects Innovation in America?’ and ‘Top Guardian of the IP Nest.’Chair: Madeleine McDonough 
        Managing Partners: Todd Jacobs (Chicago), Phil Goldberg (Washington, DC), Kirk Ingebretsen (Denver), James Shepherd (Houston), William Geraghty (Miami), Eva Weiler (Orange County), Sean Wajert (Philadelphia), Amir Nassihi (San Francisco), Bart Eppenauer (Seattle), Daniel Molony (Tampa), Gregory Fowler (London) 
        Number of partners & counsel: 298 Number of attorneys: 483
    









Shook is known for its abilities and expertise in litigation—more than 90 percent of its attorneys are litigators, and many have advanced degrees in health and sciences fields. The firm has represented leading international companies in a variety of industries, including tobacco, pharmaceutical and medical devices, technology, chemicals and automotive. In the past three years alone, Shook lawyers have tried more than 30 cases to verdict in state and federal courts, successfully defending clients against claims involving product liability, environmental and toxic tort, patent infringement, labor and employment and other claims. Shook has represented the industry’s leading pharmaceutical manufacturers for more than 40 years. The firm has also represented US cigarette manufacturers in product liability litigation continuously since 1957, and currently represents the largest US tobacco company as lead trial counsel in its pending litigation. In recent years, the firm has leveraged its complex product liability litigation expertise to build substantial national practices in intellectual property, environmental and toxic tort litigation, data security and privacy, employment litigation, commercial litigation, regulatory counseling, and public policy. While product liability remains a core strength and a growth area for the firm, practice diversification has allowed Shook to offer a variety of innovative solutions to regulatory and compliance challenges as well.
                        

Value Champions:Some 35 to 40 percent of the firm’s work is covered by alternative fee arrangements. Shook was named a Value Champion by the Association of Corporate Counsel—the only firm to be so recognized by ACC three times—in 2012, 2013 and 2015 for working with clients on innovative, collaborative and savings-driven approaches. The firm has achieved this recognition by continually focusing on creating close partnerships and tailoring its service offerings to align with the client’s definition of value for a particular engagement.
                        

Clients: 
        Shook has represented nearly three-quarters of the Fortune 100. The firm’s clients include global industry leaders who demand proven legal strategies. As a result, the firm has developed long-standing relationships with many of its clients. ‘There is no short list for national counsel of a major pharmaceutical company that doesn’t include Shook’, said the former General Counsel of one of the nation’s leading pharmaceutical companies in an article on Shook. Another client added that Shook attorneys litigate like they’re going to trial, but not unnecessarily. ‘If a matter does end up going to trial, they’ll be in the best possible position to defend it’, the Shook client told the ABA Journal.
