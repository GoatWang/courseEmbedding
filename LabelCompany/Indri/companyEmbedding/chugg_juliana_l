Cheap College Books for Sale or Rent

College textbook sales by university book stores is an estimated billion-dollar-plus industry. Chegg is turning that world upside down by creating over 1.5 billion dollars in student savings on college textbooks since 2013 through revolutionizing the “old” system. Colleges and universities reap huge profits from the sale of new and used textbooks at their institutional bookstores which consistently feature heavily marked-up prices for even the most basic of textbooks. And with the increasing costs of attending an institution of higher learning and earning a degree, students are looking for ways to cut costs any way they can. Therefore, it’s no shock that year after year, more and more students are deciding to save big bucks on their college textbooks from Chegg, rather than continue to fund their school bookstore’s profits. Chegg is a true leader in helping students save money on their college textbooks by offering a wide selection of used college textbooks to rent or purchase. Because Chegg operates primarily in the used textbook space, they are able to offer significant discounts for your required reading materials not found anywhere else in the market. Compared to the receipts at your local college store, you could potentially save up to 90%* using Chegg’s textbook rental service. That’s a significant savings you won’t find shopping your traditional retailers of college books and why Chegg delivered over 5.7 million college textbooks in 2016 alone.


In addition to college textbooks, students love our online tutoring services as well. Chegg boasts a selection of subject matter experts from around the world with experience in all high school and college courses. Available 24 hours a day, a Chegg online tutor is the perfect accompaniment for the modern day student looking for the extra help to master their class.

Textbook Rental Saves Students Money on Books

Chegg textbook rental is a game changer for college students. Just last year, Chegg supplied students with over 5.7 million textbooks at substantial savings. Textbook rental made up a huge part of that number as other college expenses continued to increase. From the rising costs of a university education and living expenses, students need to find savings where they can. As a partner for students, Chegg has the answer with textbook rental and free return shipping. Offering savings up to 90%* over the same new books at your local campus bookstore, renting textbooks from Chegg is affordable, efficient and easy. When you rent textbooks from Chegg, you are renting the exact editions required in your courses, not out of date printings or other versions. Input your courses’ booklist titles or ISBNs above to see the selection and savings. Since 2013, Chegg has saved students over 1.5 billion dollars on college books because of our up to date inventory and competitive pricing. Join your fellow budget-minded students online and rent textbooks from Chegg to say goodbye to overpaying for three months of use of a textbook from your local campus bookstore.  


Chegg has also taken tutoring to the next level by offering students the opportunity to engage with subject matter experts any time of day, from the comfort of their own homes. Find an available online tutor 24/7 in any high school or college level subject for the added help you need in mastering your coursework. Utilizing the latest in whiteboard and video chat technology, Chegg makes the world of tutoring convenient and efficient for the modern day student.

What We're About
As a student in today's world, you're used to doing things your own way. They said you'll need this textbook; you said I'll find it cheaper online. They gave you strict class times; you said I'll make my own course hours. They said we can't help you financially; you said I'll earn it elsewhere. They play by yesterday's rules; you're today's student.
If this sounds right to you, we think you'll like it here. Because at Chegg we're all about removing the obstacles that stand in the way of the education YOU want and deserve. Search free scholarships, browse course reviews, get 24/7 study help and rent textbooks for a fraction of the cost of your bookstore - all in one big education-redefining student hub.
Chegg. Helping students save time, save money and get smarter.

Textbook Rental Saves Students Money on Books

Chegg textbook rental is a game changer for college students. Just last year, Chegg supplied students with over 5.7 million textbooks at substantial savings. Textbook rental made up a huge part of that number as other college expenses continued to increase. From the rising costs of a university education and living expenses, students need to find savings where they can. As a partner for students, Chegg has the answer with textbook rental and free return shipping. Offering savings up to 90%* over the same new books at your local campus bookstore, renting textbooks from Chegg is affordable, efficient and easy. When you rent textbooks from Chegg, you are renting the exact editions required in your courses, not out of date printings or other versions. Input your courses’ booklist titles or ISBNs above to see the selection and savings. Since 2013, Chegg has saved students over 1.5 billion dollars on college books because of our up to date inventory and competitive pricing. Join your fellow budget-minded students online and rent textbooks from Chegg to say goodbye to overpaying for three months of use of a textbook from your local campus bookstore.  


Chegg has also taken tutoring to the next level by offering students the opportunity to engage with subject matter experts any time of day, from the comfort of their own homes. Find an available online tutor 24/7 in any high school or college level subject for the added help you need in mastering your coursework.

Cheap College Books for Sale or Rent

College textbook sales by university book stores is an estimated billion-dollar-plus industry. Chegg is turning that world upside down by creating over 1.5 billion dollars in student savings on college textbooks since 2013 through revolutionizing the “old” system. Colleges and universities reap huge profits from the sale of new and used textbooks at their institutional bookstores which consistently feature heavily marked-up prices for even the most basic of textbooks. And with the increasing costs of attending an institution of higher learning and earning a degree, students are looking for ways to cut costs any way they can. Therefore, it’s no shock that year after year, more and more students are deciding to save big bucks on their college textbooks from Chegg, rather than continue to fund their school bookstore’s profits. Chegg is a true leader in helping students save money on their college textbooks by offering a wide selection of used college textbooks to rent or purchase. Because Chegg operates primarily in the used textbook space, they are able to offer significant discounts for your required reading materials not found anywhere else in the market. Compared to the receipts at your local college store, you could potentially save up to 90%* using Chegg’s textbook rental service. That’s a significant savings you won’t find shopping your traditional retailers of college books and why Chegg delivered over 5.7 million college textbooks in 2016 alone.


In addition to college textbooks, students love our online tutoring services as well. Chegg boasts a selection of subject matter experts from around the world with experience in all high school and college courses. Available 24 hours a day, a Chegg online tutor is the perfect accompaniment for the modern day student looking for the extra help to master their class.
