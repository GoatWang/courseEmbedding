Solidly profitable investment returns for our clients with a minimum of risk.










For over 36 years, through a stock crash, the Great Recession, a number of contractions, a real estate depression, and too many investment manias to recall, we have provided solidly profitable investment returns for our clients with a minimum of risk. We manage stocks, bonds and cash for a wide variety of clients in America and abroad including individuals, pension funds, corporations, and trusts.

Our firm was not named with marketing impact in mind.  Typically, our principals have personal relationships with clients. Our focus is to provide a great deal of service and attention to a limited number of clients.  So the fellow you hire today will be the man looking after your money years from now.  In a bait and switch world, where investment committees come and go and clients often get lost in the shuffle, we are proud of our continuity.
