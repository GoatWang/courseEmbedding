SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or for an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/​search/​search.htm or by calling (202) 551-8090.
Applicants' Representations
1. The Fund is a Delaware corporation organized as a closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under Section 54(a) of the Act.[2] 
           The Fund's Objectives and Strategies [3] 
           are to generate consistent absolute returns through cash coupons, fees and when available equity co-investments, while minimizing the risk of loss and to generate consistent absolute returns. The Fund invests in senior secured debt second lien loans mezzanine loans, senior secured stretch and unitranche facilities as well as, to a lesser extent, equity co-investments. The board of directors of the Fund (the “Board”) is comprised of 4 directors, 3 of whom are not “interested persons,” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act (the “Independent Directors”), of the Fund.
2. The BDC Adviser is a Delaware limited liability company which will be registered with the Commission as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”) prior to commencement of operations of the Fund. The BDC Adviser serves as investment adviser to the Fund and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Existing Affiliated Adviser.
3. Each Existing Affiliated Fund is an entity that would be an investment company but for section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Act. The Existing Affiliated Funds pursue strategies focused on investing in a variety of fixed income and credit investments.Start Printed Page 28914

4. The Existing Affiliated Adviser is a Delaware limited partnership and is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. The Existing Affiliated Adviser serves as investment adviser to each of the Existing Affiliated Funds.
5. Applicants seek an order (“Order”) to permit a Regulated Fund [4] 
           and one or more Regulated Funds and/or one or more Affiliated Funds [5] 
           to co-invest with each other in securities issued by issuers in private placement transactions in which the Adviser to the Regulated Fund negotiates terms in addition to price; [6] 
           and (b) make additional investments in securities of such issuers, including through the exercise of warrants, conversion privileges, and other rights to purchase securities of the issuers (“Follow-On Investments”) through a proposed co-investment program (the “Co-Investment Program”) where such participation would otherwise be prohibited under section 57(a)(4) and rule 17d-1 and the rules under the 1940 Act. The term “Co-Investment Transaction” means any transaction in which a Regulated Fund (or its Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary, as defined below) participate together with one or more other Regulated Funds and/or one or more Affiliated Funds in reliance on the requested Order. Potential Co-Investment Transaction” means any investment opportunity in which a Regulated Fund (or its Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary, as defined below) could not participate together with one or more other Regulated Funds and/or one or more other Affiliated Funds without obtaining and relying on the Order.[7] 

6. Applicants state that a Regulated Fund may, from time to time, form a Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary.[8] 
           Such a subsidiary would be prohibited from investing in a Co-Investment Transaction with any other Regulated Fund or Affiliated Fund because it would be a company controlled by its parent Regulated Fund for purposes of section 57(a)(4) and rule 17d-1. Applicants request that each Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary be permitted to participate in Co-Investment Transactions in lieu of its parent Regulated Fund and that the Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary's participation in any such transaction be treated, for purposes of the requested Order, as though the parent Regulated Fund were participating directly. Applicants represent that this treatment is justified because a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub would have no purpose other than serving as a holding vehicle for the Regulated Fund's investments and, therefore, no conflicts of interest could arise between the Regulated Fund and the Wholly-Owned Investment Sub. The Regulated Fund's Board would make all relevant determinations under the conditions with regard to a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub's participation in a Co-Investment Transaction, and the Regulated Fund's Board would be informed of, and take into consideration, any proposed use of a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub in the Regulated Fund's place. If the Regulated Fund proposes to participate in the same Co-Investment Transaction with any of its Wholly-Owned Investment Subs, the Board will also be informed of, and take into consideration, the relative participation of the Regulated Fund and the Wholly-Owned Investment Sub.
7. When considering Potential Co-Investment Transactions for any Regulated Fund, the Adviser will consider only the Objectives and Strategies, investment policies, investment positions, capital available for investment, and other pertinent factors applicable to that Regulated Fund. The Adviser expects that any portfolio company that is an appropriate investment for a Regulated Fund should also be an appropriate investment for one or more other Regulated Funds and/or one or more Affiliated Funds, with certain exceptions based on available capital or diversification.[9] 

8. Other than pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments as provided in conditions 7 and 8, and after making the determinations required in conditions 1 and 2(a), the Adviser will present each Potential Co-Investment Transaction and the proposed allocation to the directors of the Board eligible to vote under section 57(o) of the Act (“Eligible Directors”), and the “required majority,” as defined in section 57(o) of the Act (“Required Majority”) [10] 
           will approve each Co-Investment Transaction prior to any investment by the participating Regulated Fund.
9. With respect to the pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments provided in conditions 7 and 8, a Regulated Fund may participate in a pro rata disposition or Follow-On Investment without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if, among other things: (i) The proposed participation of each Regulated Fund and Affiliated Fund in such disposition is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition or Follow-On Investment, as the case may be; and (ii) the Board of the Regulated Fund has approved that Regulated Fund's participation in pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments as being in the best interests of the Regulated Fund. If the Board does not so approve, any such disposition or Follow-On Investment will be submitted to the Regulated Fund's Eligible Directors. The Board of any Regulated Fund may at any time rescind, suspend or qualify its approval of pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments with the result that all dispositions and/or Follow-On Investments must be submitted to the Eligible Directors.
10. No Independent Director of a Regulated Fund will have a direct or indirect financial interest in any Co-Investment Transaction, other than indirectly through share ownership in one of the Regulated Funds.
11. Applicants also represent that if the Advisers or its principal owners (“Principals”) or any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Advisers or the Principals, and Start Printed Page 28915the Affiliated Funds (collectively, the “Holders”) own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the outstanding voting securities of a Regulated Fund (“Shares”), then the Holders will vote such Shares as required under Condition 14. Applicants believe that this condition will ensure that the Independent Directors will act independently in evaluating the Co-Investment Program, because the ability of the Advisers or the Principals to influence the Independent Directors by a suggestion, explicit or implied, that the Independent Directors can be removed will be limited significantly. Applicants represent that the Non-Interested Directors will evaluate and approve any such independent party, taking into account its qualifications, reputation for independence, cost to the shareholders, and other factors that they deem relevant.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 57(a)(4) of the Act prohibits certain affiliated persons of a BDC from participating in joint transactions with the BDC or a company controlled by a BDC in contravention of rules as prescribed by the Commission. Under section 57(b)(2) of the Act, any person who is directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with a BDC is subject to section 57(a)(4). Applicants submit that each of the Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds be deemed to be a person related to each Regulated Fund in a manner described by section 57(b) by virtue of being under common control. Section 57(i) of the Act provides that, until the Commission prescribes rules under section 57(a)(4), the Commission's rules under section 17(d) of the Act applicable to registered closed-end investment companies will be deemed to apply to transactions subject to section 57(a)(4). Because the Commission has not adopted any rules under section 57(a)(4), rule 17d-1 also applies to joint transactions with Regulated Funds that are BDCs. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act are applicable to Regulated Funds that are registered closed-end investment companies.
2. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act prohibit affiliated persons of a registered investment company from participating in joint transactions with the company unless the Commission has granted an order permitting such transactions. In passing upon applications under rule 17d-1, the Commission considers whether the company's participation in the joint transaction is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
3. Applicants state that in the absence of the requested relief, the Regulated Funds would be, in some circumstances, limited in their ability to participate in attractive and appropriate investment opportunities. Applicants believe that the proposed terms and conditions will ensure that the Co-Investment Transactions are consistent with the protection of each Regulated Fund's shareholders and with the purposes intended by the policies and provisions of the Act. Applicants state that the Regulated Funds' participation in the Co-Investment Transactions will be consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act and on a basis that is not different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
Applicants' Conditions
Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
1. Each time an Adviser considers a Potential Co-Investment Transaction for an Affiliated Fund or another Regulated Fund that falls within a Regulated Fund's then-current Objectives and Strategies, the Regulated Fund's Adviser will make an independent determination of the appropriateness of the investment for such Regulated Fund in light of the Regulated Fund's then-current circumstances.
2. (a) If the Adviser deems a Regulated Fund's participation in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction to be appropriate for the Regulated Fund, it will then determine an appropriate level of investment for the Regulated Fund.
(b) If the aggregate amount recommended by the applicable Adviser to be invested by the applicable Regulated Fund in the Potential Co-Investment Transaction, together with the amount proposed to be invested by the other participating Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds, collectively, in the same transaction, exceeds the amount of the investment opportunity, the investment opportunity will be allocated among them pro rata based on each participant's capital available for investment in the asset class being allocated, up to the amount proposed to be invested by each. The applicable Adviser will provide the Eligible Directors of each participating Regulated Fund with information concerning each participating party's available capital to assist the Eligible Directors with their review of the Regulated Fund's investments for compliance with these allocation procedures.
(c) After making the determinations required in conditions 1 and 2(a), the applicable Adviser will distribute written information concerning the Potential Co-Investment Transaction (including the amount proposed to be invested by each participating Regulated Fund and Affiliated Fund) to the Eligible Directors of each participating Regulated Fund for their consideration. A Regulated Fund will co-invest with one or more other Regulated Funds and/or one or more Affiliated Funds only if, prior to the Regulated Fund's participation in the Potential Co-Investment Transaction, a Required Majority concludes that:
(i) The terms of the Potential Co-Investment Transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Regulated Fund and its shareholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of the Regulated Fund or its shareholders on the part of any person concerned;
(ii) the Potential Co-Investment Transaction is consistent with:
(A) The interests of the shareholders of the Regulated Fund; and
(B) the Regulated Fund's then-current Objectives and Strategies;
(iii) the investment by any other Regulated Funds or Affiliated Funds would not disadvantage the Regulated Fund, and participation by the Regulated Fund would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other Regulated Funds or Affiliated Funds; provided that, if any other Regulated Fund or Affiliated Fund, but not the Regulated Fund itself, gains the right to nominate a director for election to a portfolio company's board of directors or the right to have a board observer or any similar right to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company, such event shall not be interpreted to prohibit the Required Majority from reaching the conclusions required by this condition 2(c)(iii), if:
(A) The Eligible Directors will have the right to ratify the selection of such director or board observer, if any;
(B) the applicable Adviser agrees to, and does, provide periodic reports to the Regulated Fund's Board with respect to the actions of such director or the information received by such board observer or obtained through the exercise of any similar right to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company; and
(C) any fees or other compensation that any Affiliated Fund or any Regulated Fund or any affiliated person Start Printed Page 28916of any Affiliated Fund or any Regulated Fund receives in connection with the right of an Affiliated Fund or a Regulated Fund to nominate a director or appoint a board observer or otherwise to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company will be shared proportionately among the participating Affiliated Funds (who each may, in turn, share its portion with its affiliated persons) and the participating Regulated Funds in accordance with the amount of each party's investment; and
(iv) the proposed investment by the Regulated Fund will not benefit the Advisers, the Affiliated Funds or the other Regulated Funds or any affiliated person of any of them (other than the parties to the Co-Investment Transaction), except (A) to the extent permitted by condition 13, (B) to the extent permitted by sections 17(e) or 57(k) of the Act, as applicable, (C) indirectly, as a result of an interest in the securities issued by one of the parties to the Co-Investment Transaction, or (D) in the case of fees or other compensation described in condition 2(c)(iii)(C).
3. Each Regulated Fund has the right to decline to participate in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction or to invest less than the amount proposed.
4. The applicable Adviser will present to the Board of each Regulated Fund, on a quarterly basis, a record of all investments in Potential Co-Investment Transactions made by any of the other Regulated Funds or Affiliated Funds during the preceding quarter that fell within the Regulated Fund's then-current Objectives and Strategies that were not made available to the Regulated Fund, and an explanation of why the investment opportunities were not offered to the Regulated Fund. All information presented to the Board pursuant to this condition will be kept for the life of the Regulated Fund and at least two years thereafter, and will be subject to examination by the Commission and its staff.
5. Except for Follow-On Investments made in accordance with condition 8,[11] 
           a Regulated Fund will not invest in reliance on the Order in any issuer in which another Regulated Fund, Affiliated Fund, or any affiliated person of another Regulated Fund or Affiliated Fund is an existing investor.
6. A Regulated Fund will not participate in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction unless the terms, conditions, price, class of securities to be purchased, settlement date, and registration rights will be the same for each participating Regulated Fund and Affiliated Fund. The grant to an Affiliated Fund or another Regulated Fund, but not the Regulated Fund, of the right to nominate a director for election to a portfolio company's board of directors, the right to have an observer on the board of directors or similar rights to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company will not be interpreted so as to violate this condition 6, if conditions 2(c)(iii)(A), (B) and (C) are met.
7. (a) If any Affiliated Fund or any Regulated Fund elects to sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of an interest in a security that was acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction, the applicable Advisers will:
(i) Notify each Regulated Fund that participated in the Co-Investment Transaction of the proposed disposition at the earliest practical time; and
(ii) formulate a recommendation as to participation by each Regulated Fund in the disposition.
(b) Each Regulated Fund will have the right to participate in such disposition on a proportionate basis, at the same price and on the same terms and conditions as those applicable to the participating Affiliated Funds and any other Regulated Fund.
(c) A Regulated Fund may participate in such disposition without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if: (i) The proposed participation of each Regulated Fund and each Affiliated Fund in such disposition is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition; (ii) the Board of the Regulated Fund has approved as being in the best interests of the Regulated Fund the ability to participate in such dispositions on a pro rata basis (as described in greater detail in the application); and (iii) the Board of the Regulated Fund is provided on a quarterly basis with a list of all dispositions made in accordance with this condition. In all other cases, the Adviser will provide its written recommendation as to the Regulated Fund's participation to the Eligible Directors, and the Regulated Fund will participate in such disposition solely to the extent that a Required Majority determines that it is in the Regulated Fund's best interests.
(d) Each Affiliated Fund and each Regulated Fund will bear its own expenses in connection with any such disposition.
8. (a) If any Affiliated Fund or any Regulated Fund desires to make a Follow-On Investment in a portfolio company whose securities were acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction, the applicable Advisers will:
(i) Notify each Regulated Fund that participated in the Co-Investment Transaction of the proposed transaction at the earliest practical time; and
(ii) formulate a recommendation as to the proposed participation, including the amount of the proposed Follow-On Investment, by each Regulated Fund.
(b) A Regulated Fund may participate in such Follow-On Investment without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if: (i) The proposed participation of each Regulated Fund and each Affiliated Fund in such investment is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the Follow-On Investment; and (ii) the Board of the Regulated Fund has approved as being in the best interests of the Regulated Fund the ability to participate in Follow-On Investments on a pro rata basis (as described in greater detail in the application). In all other cases, the Adviser will provide its written recommendation as to the Regulated Fund's participation to the Eligible Directors, and the Regulated Fund will participate in such Follow-On Investment solely to the extent that a Required Majority determines that it is in the Regulated Fund's best interests.
(c) If, with respect to any Follow-On Investment:
(i) The amount of the opportunity is not based on the Regulated Funds' and the Affiliated Funds' outstanding investments immediately preceding the Follow-On Investment; and
(ii) the aggregate amount recommended by the Adviser to be invested by each Regulated Fund in the Follow-On Investment, together with the amount proposed to be invested by the participating Affiliated Funds in the same transaction, exceeds the amount of the opportunity; then the amount invested by each such party will be allocated among them pro rata based on each participant's capital available for investment in the asset class being allocated, up to the amount proposed to be invested by each.
(d) The acquisition of Follow-On Investments as permitted by this condition will be considered a Co-Investment Transaction for all purposes and subject to the other conditions set forth in the application.
9. The Non-Interested Directors of each Regulated Fund will be provided quarterly for review all information Start Printed Page 28917concerning Potential Co-Investment Transactions and Co-Investment Transactions, including investments made by other Regulated Funds or Affiliated Funds that the Regulated Fund considered but declined to participate in, so that the Non-Interested Directors may determine whether all investments made during the preceding quarter, including those investments that the Regulated Fund considered but declined to participate in, comply with the conditions of the Order. In addition, the Non-Interested Directors will consider at least annually the continued appropriateness for the Regulated Fund of participating in new and existing Co-Investment Transactions.
10. Each Regulated Fund will maintain the records required by section 57(f)(3) of the Act as if each of the Regulated Funds were a BDC and each of the investments permitted under these conditions were approved by the Required Majority under section 57(f) of the Act.
11. No Non-Interested Director of a Regulated Fund will also be a director, general partner, managing member or principal, or otherwise an “affiliated person” (as defined in the Act), of an Affiliated Fund.
12. The expenses, if any, associated with acquiring, holding or disposing of any securities acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction (including, without limitation, the expenses of the distribution of any such securities registered for sale under the Securities Act) will, to the extent not payable by the Advisers under their respective investment advisory agreements with Affiliated Funds and the Regulated Funds, be shared by the Regulated Funds and the Affiliated Funds in proportion to the relative amounts of the securities held or to be acquired or disposed of, as the case may be.
13. Any transaction fee [12] 
           (including break-up or commitment fees but excluding broker's fees contemplated by section 17(e) or 57(k) of the Act, as applicable) received in connection with a Co-Investment Transaction will be distributed to the participating Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds on a pro rata basis based on the amounts they invested or committed, as the case may be, in such Co-Investment Transaction. If any transaction fee is to be held by an Adviser pending consummation of the transaction, the fee will be deposited into an account maintained by such Adviser at a bank or banks having the qualifications prescribed in section 26(a)(1) of the Act, and the account will earn a competitive rate of interest that will also be divided pro rata among the participating Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds based on the amounts they invest in such Co-Investment Transaction. None of the Affiliated Funds, the Advisers, the other Regulated Funds or any affiliated person of the Regulated Funds or Affiliated Funds will receive additional compensation or remuneration of any kind as a result of or in connection with a Co-Investment Transaction (other than (a) in the case of the Regulated Funds and the Affiliated Funds, the pro rata transaction fees described above and fees or other compensation described in condition 2(c)(iii)(C); and (b) in the case of an Adviser, investment advisory fees paid in accordance with the agreement between the Adviser and the Regulated Fund or Affiliated Fund.
14. If the Holders own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the Shares of a Regulated Fund, then the Holders will vote such Shares as directed by an independent third party when voting on (1) the election of directors; (2) the removal of one or more directors; or (3) any other matter under either the Act or applicable State law affecting the Board's composition, size or manner of election.

disqualifying events before September
23, 2013. Of those 19,908 respondents,
we estimate that 220 respondents with
disqualifying events will spend ten
hours to prepare a disclosure statement
describing the matters that would have
triggered disqualification under
506(d)(1) of Regulation D, except that
these disqualifying events occurred
before September 23, 2013, the effective
date of the Rule 506 amendments. An
estimated 2,200 burden hours are
attributed to the 220 respondents with
disqualifying events in addition to the
19,908 burden hours associated with the
one-hour factual inquiry. In sum, the
total annual increase in paperwork
burden for all affected respondents to
comply with the Rule 506(e) disclosure
statement is estimated to be
approximately 22,108 hours of company
personnel time.

be regulated as a BDC under Section
54(a) of the Act.2 The Fund’s Objectives
and Strategies 3 are to generate
consistent absolute returns through cash
coupons, fees and when available equity
co-investments, while minimizing the
risk of loss and to generate consistent
absolute returns. The Fund invests in
senior secured debt second lien loans

The board of directors of the Fund (the
‘‘Board’’) is comprised of 4 directors, 3

Affiliated Funds pursue strategies
focused on investing in a variety of
fixed income and credit investments.
2 Section 2(a)(48) defines a BDC to be any closedend investment company that operates for the
purpose of making investments in securities
described in sections 55(a)(1) through 55(a)(3) of the
Act and makes available significant managerial
assistance with respect to the issuers of such
securities.

Fund’s investment objectives and strategies, as
described in the Regulated Fund’s registration
statement on Form N–2, other filings the Regulated

4. The Existing Affiliated Adviser is a
Delaware limited partnership and is
registered as an investment adviser
under the Advisers Act. The Existing
Affiliated Adviser serves as investment
adviser to each of the Existing Affiliated
Funds.
5. Applicants seek an order (‘‘Order’’)
to permit a Regulated Fund 4 and one or
more Regulated Funds and/or one or
more Affiliated Funds 5 to co-invest
with each other in securities issued by
issuers in private placement
transactions in which the Adviser to the
Regulated Fund negotiates terms in
addition to price; 6 and (b) make
additional investments in securities of
such issuers, including through the
exercise of warrants, conversion
privileges, and other rights to purchase
securities of the issuers (‘‘Follow-On
Investments’’) through a proposed coinvestment program (the ‘‘CoInvestment Program’’) where such
participation would otherwise be
prohibited under section 57(a)(4) and
rule 17d–1 and the rules under the 1940
Act. The term ‘‘Co-Investment
Transaction’’ means any transaction in
which a Regulated Fund (or its WhollyOwned Investment Subsidiary, as
defined below) participate together with
one or more other Regulated Funds and/
or one or more Affiliated Funds in
reliance on the requested Order.
Potential Co-Investment Transaction’’
means any investment opportunity in
which a Regulated Fund (or its WhollyOwned Investment Subsidiary, as
defined below) could not participate
together with one or more other
Regulated Funds and/or one or more
other Affiliated Funds without
obtaining and relying on the Order.7
4 The term ‘‘Regulated Fund’’ means the Fund
and any Future Regulated Fund. ‘‘Future Regulated
Fund’’ means any closed-end management
investment company (a) that is registered under the
Act or has elected to be regulated as a BDC, (b)
whose investment adviser is an Adviser, and (c)
that intends to participate in the Co-Investment
Program.
The term ‘‘Adviser’’ means the BDC Adviser, the
Existing Affiliated Adviser and any future
investment adviser that (i) controls, is controlled
by, or is under common control with the Existing
Affiliated Adviser and (ii) is registered as an
investment adviser under the Advisers Act.
5 ‘‘Affiliated Fund’’ means the Existing Affiliated
Funds and any entity (a) whose investment adviser
is an Adviser, (b) that would be an investment
company but for Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the
1940 Act, and (c) that intends to participate in the
Co-Investment Program.
6 The term ‘‘private placement transactions’’
means transactions in which the offer and sale of
securities by the issuer are exempt from registration

6. Applicants state that a Regulated
Fund may, from time to time, form a
Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary.8
Such a subsidiary would be prohibited
from investing in a Co-Investment
Transaction with any other Regulated
Fund or Affiliated Fund because it
would be a company controlled by its
parent Regulated Fund for purposes of
section 57(a)(4) and rule 17d–1.
Applicants request that each WhollyOwned Investment Subsidiary be
permitted to participate in CoInvestment Transactions in lieu of its
parent Regulated Fund and that the
Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary’s
participation in any such transaction be
treated, for purposes of the requested
Order, as though the parent Regulated
Fund were participating directly.
Applicants represent that this treatment
is justified because a Wholly-Owned
Investment Sub would have no purpose
other than serving as a holding vehicle
for the Regulated Fund’s investments
and, therefore, no conflicts of interest
could arise between the Regulated Fund
and the Wholly-Owned Investment Sub.
The Regulated Fund’s Board would
make all relevant determinations under
the conditions with regard to a WhollyOwned Investment Sub’s participation
in a Co-Investment Transaction, and the
Regulated Fund’s Board would be
informed of, and take into
consideration, any proposed use of a
Wholly-Owned Investment Sub in the
Regulated Fund’s place. If the Regulated
Fund proposes to participate in the
same Co-Investment Transaction with
any of its Wholly-Owned Investment
Subs, the Board will also be informed
of, and take into consideration, the
relative participation of the Regulated
Fund and the Wholly-Owned
Investment Sub.
7. When considering Potential CoInvestment Transactions for any
Regulated Fund, the Adviser will
consider only the Objectives and
Strategies, investment policies,
investment positions, capital available
for investment, and other pertinent
factors applicable to that Regulated
Fund. The Adviser expects that any
portfolio company that is an appropriate
investment for a Regulated Fund should
8 The term ‘‘Wholly-Owned Investment Sub’’
means an entity (i) that is wholly-owned by a
Regulated Fund (with the Regulated Fund at all
times holding, beneficially and of record, 100% of
the voting and economic interests); (ii) whose sole
business purpose is to hold one or more
investments on behalf of the Regulated Fund; (iii)
with respect to which the Regulated Fund’s Board
has the sole authority to make all determinations
with respect to the entity’s participation under the
conditions of the Application; and (iv) that would
be an investment company but for section 3(c)(1) or
3(c)(7) of the Act.

also be an appropriate investment for
one or more other Regulated Funds and/
or one or more Affiliated Funds, with
certain exceptions based on available
capital or diversification.9
8. Other than pro rata dispositions
and Follow-On Investments as provided
in conditions 7 and 8, and after making
the determinations required in
conditions 1 and 2(a), the Adviser will
present each Potential Co-Investment
Transaction and the proposed allocation
to the directors of the Board eligible to
vote under section 57(o) of the Act
(‘‘Eligible Directors’’), and the ‘‘required
majority,’’ as defined in section 57(o) of
the Act (‘‘Required Majority’’) 10 will
approve each Co-Investment
Transaction prior to any investment by
the participating Regulated Fund.
9. With respect to the pro rata
dispositions and Follow-On Investments
provided in conditions 7 and 8, a
Regulated Fund may participate in a pro
rata disposition or Follow-On
Investment without obtaining prior
approval of the Required Majority if,
among other things: (i) The proposed
participation of each Regulated Fund
and Affiliated Fund in such disposition
is proportionate to its outstanding
investments in the issuer immediately
preceding the disposition or Follow-On
Investment, as the case may be; and (ii)
the Board of the Regulated Fund has
approved that Regulated Fund’s
participation in pro rata dispositions
and Follow-On Investments as being in
the best interests of the Regulated Fund.
If the Board does not so approve, any
such disposition or Follow-On
Investment will be submitted to the
Regulated Fund’s Eligible Directors. The
Board of any Regulated Fund may at any
time rescind, suspend or qualify its
approval of pro rata dispositions and
Follow-On Investments with the result
that all dispositions and/or Follow-On
Investments must be submitted to the
Eligible Directors.
10. No Independent Director of a
Regulated Fund will have a direct or
indirect financial interest in any CoInvestment Transaction, other than
indirectly through share ownership in
one of the Regulated Funds.
11. Applicants also represent that if
the Advisers or its principal owners
(‘‘Principals’’) or any person controlling,
controlled by, or under common control
with the Advisers or the Principals, and
9 The Regulated Funds, however, will not be
obligated to invest, or co-invest, when investment
opportunities are referred to them.
10 In the case of a Regulated Fund that is a

‘‘Holders’’) own in the aggregate more

Condition 14. Applicants believe that
this condition will ensure that the
Independent Directors will act
independently in evaluating the CoInvestment Program, because the ability
of the Advisers or the Principals to
influence the Independent Directors by
a suggestion, explicit or implied, that
the Independent Directors can be
removed will be limited significantly.
Applicants represent that the NonInterested Directors will evaluate and
approve any such independent party,
taking into account its qualifications,
reputation for independence, cost to the
shareholders, and other factors that they
deem relevant.

participation is on a basis different from
or less advantageous than that of other
participants.
3. Applicants state that in the absence
of the requested relief, the Regulated
Funds would be, in some
circumstances, limited in their ability to
participate in attractive and appropriate
investment opportunities. Applicants
believe that the proposed terms and
conditions will ensure that the CoInvestment Transactions are consistent
with the protection of each Regulated
Fund’s shareholders and with the
purposes intended by the policies and
provisions of the Act. Applicants state
that the Regulated Funds’ participation
in the Co-Investment Transactions will
be consistent with the provisions,
policies, and purposes of the Act and on
a basis that is not different from or less
advantageous than that of other
participants.

Applicants’ Legal Analysis
1. Section 57(a)(4) of the Act prohibits
certain affiliated persons of a BDC from
participating in joint transactions with
the BDC or a company controlled by a
BDC in contravention of rules as
prescribed by the Commission. Under
section 57(b)(2) of the Act, any person
who is directly or indirectly controlling,
controlled by, or under common control
with a BDC is subject to section 57(a)(4).
Applicants submit that each of the
Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds
be deemed to be a person related to each
Regulated Fund in a manner described
by section 57(b) by virtue of being under
common control. Section 57(i) of the
Act provides that, until the Commission
prescribes rules under section 57(a)(4),
the Commission’s rules under section
17(d) of the Act applicable to registered
closed-end investment companies will
be deemed to apply to transactions
subject to section 57(a)(4). Because the
Commission has not adopted any rules
under section 57(a)(4), rule 17d–1 also
applies to joint transactions with
Regulated Funds that are BDCs. Section
17(d) of the Act and rule 17d–1 under
the Act are applicable to Regulated
Funds that are registered closed-end
investment companies.
2. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule
17d–1 under the Act prohibit affiliated
persons of a registered investment
company from participating in joint
transactions with the company unless
the Commission has granted an order
permitting such transactions. In passing
upon applications under rule 17d–1, the
Commission considers whether the
company’s participation in the joint
transaction is consistent with the
provisions, policies, and purposes of the
Act and the extent to which such

Applicants agree that any order
granting the requested relief will be
subject to the following conditions:
1. Each time an Adviser considers a
Potential Co-Investment Transaction for
an Affiliated Fund or another Regulated
Fund that falls within a Regulated
Fund’s then-current Objectives and
Strategies, the Regulated Fund’s Adviser
will make an independent
determination of the appropriateness of
the investment for such Regulated Fund
in light of the Regulated Fund’s thencurrent circumstances.
2. (a) If the Adviser deems a Regulated
Fund’s participation in any Potential
Co-Investment Transaction to be
appropriate for the Regulated Fund, it
will then determine an appropriate level
of investment for the Regulated Fund.
(b) If the aggregate amount
recommended by the applicable Adviser
to be invested by the applicable
Regulated Fund in the Potential CoInvestment Transaction, together with
the amount proposed to be invested by
the other participating Regulated Funds
and Affiliated Funds, collectively, in the
same transaction, exceeds the amount of
the investment opportunity, the
investment opportunity will be
allocated among them pro rata based on
each participant’s capital available for
investment in the asset class being
allocated, up to the amount proposed to
be invested by each. The applicable
Adviser will provide the Eligible
Directors of each participating
Regulated Fund with information
concerning each participating party’s
available capital to assist the Eligible
Directors with their review of the
Regulated Fund’s investments for

compliance with these allocation
procedures.
(c) After making the determinations
required in conditions 1 and 2(a), the
applicable Adviser will distribute
written information concerning the
Potential Co-Investment Transaction
(including the amount proposed to be
invested by each participating Regulated
Fund and Affiliated Fund) to the
Eligible Directors of each participating
Regulated Fund for their consideration.
A Regulated Fund will co-invest with
one or more other Regulated Funds and/
or one or more Affiliated Funds only if,
prior to the Regulated Fund’s
participation in the Potential CoInvestment Transaction, a Required
Majority concludes that:
(i) The terms of the Potential CoInvestment Transaction, including the
consideration to be paid, are reasonable
and fair to the Regulated Fund and its
shareholders and do not involve
overreaching in respect of the Regulated
Fund or its shareholders on the part of
any person concerned;
(ii) the Potential Co-Investment
Transaction is consistent with:
(A) The interests of the shareholders
of the Regulated Fund; and
(B) the Regulated Fund’s then-current
Objectives and Strategies;
(iii) the investment by any other
Regulated Funds or Affiliated Funds
would not disadvantage the Regulated
Fund, and participation by the
Regulated Fund would not be on a basis
different from or less advantageous than
that of other Regulated Funds or
Affiliated Funds; provided that, if any
other Regulated Fund or Affiliated
Fund, but not the Regulated Fund itself,
gains the right to nominate a director for
election to a portfolio company’s board
of directors or the right to have a board
observer or any similar right to
participate in the governance or
management of the portfolio company,
such event shall not be interpreted to
prohibit the Required Majority from
reaching the conclusions required by
this condition 2(c)(iii), if:
(A) The Eligible Directors will have
the right to ratify the selection of such
director or board observer, if any;
(B) the applicable Adviser agrees to,
and does, provide periodic reports to
the Regulated Fund’s Board with respect
to the actions of such director or the
information received by such board
observer or obtained through the
exercise of any similar right to
participate in the governance or
management of the portfolio company;
and

Regulated Fund or any affiliated person

will be shared proportionately among
the participating Affiliated Funds (who
each may, in turn, share its portion with
its affiliated persons) and the
participating Regulated Funds in
accordance with the amount of each
party’s investment; and
(iv) the proposed investment by the
Regulated Fund will not benefit the
Advisers, the Affiliated Funds or the
other Regulated Funds or any affiliated
person of any of them (other than the
parties to the Co-Investment
Transaction), except (A) to the extent
permitted by condition 13, (B) to the
extent permitted by sections 17(e) or
57(k) of the Act, as applicable, (C)
indirectly, as a result of an interest in
the securities issued by one of the
parties to the Co-Investment
Transaction, or (D) in the case of fees or
other compensation described in
condition 2(c)(iii)(C).
3. Each Regulated Fund has the right
to decline to participate in any Potential
Co-Investment Transaction or to invest
less than the amount proposed.
4. The applicable Adviser will present
to the Board of each Regulated Fund, on
a quarterly basis, a record of all
investments in Potential Co-Investment
Transactions made by any of the other
Regulated Funds or Affiliated Funds
during the preceding quarter that fell
within the Regulated Fund’s thencurrent Objectives and Strategies that
were not made available to the
Regulated Fund, and an explanation of
why the investment opportunities were
not offered to the Regulated Fund. All
information presented to the Board
pursuant to this condition will be kept
for the life of the Regulated Fund and
at least two years thereafter, and will be
subject to examination by the
Commission and its staff.
5. Except for Follow-On Investments
made in accordance with condition 8,11
a Regulated Fund will not invest in
reliance on the Order in any issuer in
which another Regulated Fund,
Affiliated Fund, or any affiliated person
of another Regulated Fund or Affiliated

an Affiliated Fund or another Regulated
Fund, but not the Regulated Fund, of
the right to nominate a director for
election to a portfolio company’s board
of directors, the right to have an
observer on the board of directors or
similar rights to participate in the
governance or management of the
portfolio company will not be
interpreted so as to violate this
condition 6, if conditions 2(c)(iii)(A), (B)
and (C) are met.
7. (a) If any Affiliated Fund or any
Regulated Fund elects to sell, exchange
or otherwise dispose of an interest in a
security that was acquired in a CoInvestment Transaction, the applicable
Advisers will:

participated in the Co-Investment
Transaction of the proposed disposition
at the earliest practical time; and
(ii) formulate a recommendation as to
participation by each Regulated Fund in
the disposition.
(b) Each Regulated Fund will have the
right to participate in such disposition
on a proportionate basis, at the same
price and on the same terms and

participating Affiliated Funds and any
other Regulated Fund.

in such disposition without obtaining
prior approval of the Required Majority

Regulated Fund and each Affiliated
Fund in such disposition is
proportionate to its outstanding
investments in the issuer immediately
preceding the disposition; (ii) the Board
of the Regulated Fund has approved as
being in the best interests of the

in such dispositions on a pro rata basis
(as described in greater detail in the

Regulated Fund is provided on a
quarterly basis with a list of all
dispositions made in accordance with
this condition. In all other cases, the
Adviser will provide its written
recommendation as to the Regulated
Fund’s participation to the Eligible
Directors, and the Regulated Fund will
participate in such disposition solely to
the extent that a Required Majority
determines that it is in the Regulated
Fund’s best interests.

Regulated Fund will bear its own
expenses in connection with any such
disposition.

made by other Regulated Funds or
Affiliated Funds that the Regulated
Fund considered but declined to
participate in, so that the Non-Interested
Directors may determine whether all

quarter, including those investments
that the Regulated Fund considered but
declined to participate in, comply with
the conditions of the Order. In addition,
the Non-Interested Directors will
consider at least annually the continued
appropriateness for the Regulated Fund
of participating in new and existing CoInvestment Transactions.
10. Each Regulated Fund will
maintain the records required by section
57(f)(3) of the Act as if each of the
Regulated Funds were a BDC and each
of the investments permitted under
these conditions were approved by the
Required Majority under section 57(f) of
the Act.

Regulated Fund will also be a director,
general partner, managing member or
principal, or otherwise an ‘‘affiliated

Affiliated Fund.
12. The expenses, if any, associated
with acquiring, holding or disposing of
any securities acquired in a CoInvestment Transaction (including,
without limitation, the expenses of the
distribution of any such securities
registered for sale under the Securities
Act) will, to the extent not payable by
the Advisers under their respective
investment advisory agreements with
Affiliated Funds and the Regulated
Funds, be shared by the Regulated
Funds and the Affiliated Funds in
proportion to the relative amounts of the
securities held or to be acquired or
disposed of, as the case may be.

such Co-Investment Transaction. None
of the Affiliated Funds, the Advisers,
the other Regulated Funds or any
affiliated person of the Regulated Funds
or Affiliated Funds will receive
additional compensation or
remuneration of any kind as a result of

Applicants' Representations

    1. The Fund is a Delaware corporation organized as a closed-end 
management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC 
under Section 54(a) of the Act.\2\ The Fund's Objectives and Strategies 
\3\ are to generate consistent absolute returns through cash coupons, 
fees and when available equity co-investments, while minimizing the 
risk of loss and to generate consistent absolute returns. The Fund 
invests in senior secured debt second lien loans mezzanine loans, 
senior secured stretch and unitranche facilities as well as, to a 
lesser extent, equity co-investments. The board of directors of the 
Fund (the ``Board'') is comprised of 4 directors, 3 of whom are not 
``interested persons,'' within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the 
1940 Act (the ``Independent Directors''), of the Fund.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Section 2(a)(48) defines a BDC to be any closed-end 
investment company that operates for the purpose of making 
investments in securities described in sections 55(a)(1) through 
55(a)(3) of the Act and makes available significant managerial 
assistance with respect to the issuers of such securities.
    \3\ ``Objectives and Strategies'' means a Regulated Fund's 
investment objectives and strategies, as described in the Regulated 
Fund's registration statement on Form N-2, other filings the 
Regulated Fund has made with the Commission under the Securities Act 
of 1933 (the ``Securities Act''), or under the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 and the Regulated Fund's reports to shareholders.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2. The BDC Adviser is a Delaware limited liability company which 
will be registered with the Commission as an investment adviser under 
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the ``Advisers Act'') prior to 
commencement of operations of the Fund. The BDC Adviser serves as 
investment adviser to the Fund and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the 
Existing Affiliated Adviser.
    3. Each Existing Affiliated Fund is an entity that would be an 
investment company but for section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Act. The 
Existing Affiliated Funds pursue strategies focused on investing in a 
variety of fixed income and credit investments.

[[Page 28914]]

    4. The Existing Affiliated Adviser is a Delaware limited 
partnership and is registered as an investment adviser under the 
Advisers Act. The Existing Affiliated Adviser serves as investment 
adviser to each of the Existing Affiliated Funds.
    5. Applicants seek an order (``Order'') to permit a Regulated Fund 
\4\ and one or more Regulated Funds and/or one or more Affiliated Funds 
\5\ to co-invest with each other in securities issued by issuers in 
private placement transactions in which the Adviser to the Regulated 
Fund negotiates terms in addition to price; \6\ and (b) make additional 
investments in securities of such issuers, including through the 
exercise of warrants, conversion privileges, and other rights to 
purchase securities of the issuers (``Follow-On Investments'') through 
a proposed co-investment program (the ``Co-Investment Program'') where 
such participation would otherwise be prohibited under section 57(a)(4) 
and rule 17d-1 and the rules under the 1940 Act. The term ``Co-
Investment Transaction'' means any transaction in which a Regulated 
Fund (or its Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary, as defined below) 
participate together with one or more other Regulated Funds and/or one 
or more Affiliated Funds in reliance on the requested Order. Potential 
Co-Investment Transaction'' means any investment opportunity in which a 
Regulated Fund (or its Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary, as defined 
below) could not participate together with one or more other Regulated 
Funds and/or one or more other Affiliated Funds without obtaining and 
relying on the Order.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ The term ``Regulated Fund'' means the Fund and any Future 
Regulated Fund. ``Future Regulated Fund'' means any closed-end 
management investment company (a) that is registered under the Act 
or has elected to be regulated as a BDC, (b) whose investment 
adviser is an Adviser, and (c) that intends to participate in the 
Co-Investment Program.
    The term ``Adviser'' means the BDC Adviser, the Existing 
Affiliated Adviser and any future investment adviser that (i) 
controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the 
Existing Affiliated Adviser and (ii) is registered as an investment 
adviser under the Advisers Act.
    \5\ ``Affiliated Fund'' means the Existing Affiliated Funds and 
any entity (a) whose investment adviser is an Adviser, (b) that 
would be an investment company but for Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of 
the 1940 Act, and (c) that intends to participate in the Co-
Investment Program.
    \6\ The term ``private placement transactions'' means 
transactions in which the offer and sale of securities by the issuer 
are exempt from registration under the Securities Act.
    \7\ All existing entities that currently intend to rely upon the 
requested Order have been named as applicants. Any other existing or 
future entity that subsequently relies on the Order will comply with 
the terms and conditions of the application.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    6. Applicants state that a Regulated Fund may, from time to time, 
form a Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary.\8\ Such a subsidiary would 
be prohibited from investing in a Co-Investment Transaction with any 
other Regulated Fund or Affiliated Fund because it would be a company 
controlled by its parent Regulated Fund for purposes of section 
57(a)(4) and rule 17d-1. Applicants request that each Wholly-Owned 
Investment Subsidiary be permitted to participate in Co-Investment 
Transactions in lieu of its parent Regulated Fund and that the Wholly-
Owned Investment Subsidiary's participation in any such transaction be 
treated, for purposes of the requested Order, as though the parent 
Regulated Fund were participating directly. Applicants represent that 
this treatment is justified because a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub would 
have no purpose other than serving as a holding vehicle for the 
Regulated Fund's investments and, therefore, no conflicts of interest 
could arise between the Regulated Fund and the Wholly-Owned Investment 
Sub. The Regulated Fund's Board would make all relevant determinations 
under the conditions with regard to a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub's 
participation in a Co-Investment Transaction, and the Regulated Fund's 
Board would be informed of, and take into consideration, any proposed 
use of a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub in the Regulated Fund's place. If 
the Regulated Fund proposes to participate in the same Co-Investment 
Transaction with any of its Wholly-Owned Investment Subs, the Board 
will also be informed of, and take into consideration, the relative 
participation of the Regulated Fund and the Wholly-Owned Investment 
Sub.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ The term ``Wholly-Owned Investment Sub'' means an entity (i) 
that is wholly-owned by a Regulated Fund (with the Regulated Fund at 
all times holding, beneficially and of record, 100% of the voting 
and economic interests); (ii) whose sole business purpose is to hold 
one or more investments on behalf of the Regulated Fund; (iii) with 
respect to which the Regulated Fund's Board has the sole authority 
to make all determinations with respect to the entity's 
participation under the conditions of the Application; and (iv) that 
would be an investment company but for section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of 
the Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    7. When considering Potential Co-Investment Transactions for any 
Regulated Fund, the Adviser will consider only the Objectives and 
Strategies, investment policies, investment positions, capital 
available for investment, and other pertinent factors applicable to 
that Regulated Fund. The Adviser expects that any portfolio company 
that is an appropriate investment for a Regulated Fund should also be 
an appropriate investment for one or more other Regulated Funds and/or 
one or more Affiliated Funds, with certain exceptions based on 
available capital or diversification.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ The Regulated Funds, however, will not be obligated to 
invest, or co-invest, when investment opportunities are referred to 
them.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    8. Other than pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments as 
provided in conditions 7 and 8, and after making the determinations 
required in conditions 1 and 2(a), the Adviser will present each 
Potential Co-Investment Transaction and the proposed allocation to the 
directors of the Board eligible to vote under section 57(o) of the Act 
(``Eligible Directors''), and the ``required majority,'' as defined in 
section 57(o) of the Act (``Required Majority'') \10\ will approve each 
Co-Investment Transaction prior to any investment by the participating 
Regulated Fund.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ In the case of a Regulated Fund that is a registered 
closed-end fund, the Board members that make up the Required 
Majority will be determined as if the Regulated Fund were a BDC 
subject to Section 57(o).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    9. With respect to the pro rata dispositions and Follow-On 
Investments provided in conditions 7 and 8, a Regulated Fund may 
participate in a pro rata disposition or Follow-On Investment without 
obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if, among other 
things: (i) The proposed participation of each Regulated Fund and 
Affiliated Fund in such disposition is proportionate to its outstanding 
investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition or 
Follow-On Investment, as the case may be; and (ii) the Board of the 
Regulated Fund has approved that Regulated Fund's participation in pro 
rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments as being in the best 
interests of the Regulated Fund. If the Board does not so approve, any 
such disposition or Follow-On Investment will be submitted to the 
Regulated Fund's Eligible Directors. The Board of any Regulated Fund 
may at any time rescind, suspend or qualify its approval of pro rata 
dispositions and Follow-On Investments with the result that all 
dispositions and/or Follow-On Investments must be submitted to the 
Eligible Directors.
    10. No Independent Director of a Regulated Fund will have a direct 
or indirect financial interest in any Co-Investment Transaction, other 
than indirectly through share ownership in one of the Regulated Funds.
    11. Applicants also represent that if the Advisers or its principal 
owners (``Principals'') or any person controlling, controlled by, or 
under common control with the Advisers or the Principals, and

[[Page 28915]]

the Affiliated Funds (collectively, the ``Holders'') own in the 
aggregate more than 25 percent of the outstanding voting securities of 
a Regulated Fund (``Shares''), then the Holders will vote such Shares 
as required under Condition 14. Applicants believe that this condition 
will ensure that the Independent Directors will act independently in 
evaluating the Co-Investment Program, because the ability of the 
Advisers or the Principals to influence the Independent Directors by a 
suggestion, explicit or implied, that the Independent Directors can be 
removed will be limited significantly. Applicants represent that the 
Non-Interested Directors will evaluate and approve any such independent 
party, taking into account its qualifications, reputation for 
independence, cost to the shareholders, and other factors that they 
deem relevant.

Applicants' Legal Analysis

    1. Section 57(a)(4) of the Act prohibits certain affiliated persons 
of a BDC from participating in joint transactions with the BDC or a 
company controlled by a BDC in contravention of rules as prescribed by 
the Commission. Under section 57(b)(2) of the Act, any person who is 
directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common 
control with a BDC is subject to section 57(a)(4). Applicants submit 
that each of the Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds be deemed to be a 
person related to each Regulated Fund in a manner described by section 
57(b) by virtue of being under common control. Section 57(i) of the Act 
provides that, until the Commission prescribes rules under section 
57(a)(4), the Commission's rules under section 17(d) of the Act 
applicable to registered closed-end investment companies will be deemed 
to apply to transactions subject to section 57(a)(4). Because the 
Commission has not adopted any rules under section 57(a)(4), rule 17d-1 
also applies to joint transactions with Regulated Funds that are BDCs. 
Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act are applicable to 
Regulated Funds that are registered closed-end investment companies.
    2. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act prohibit 
affiliated persons of a registered investment company from 
participating in joint transactions with the company unless the 
Commission has granted an order permitting such transactions. In 
passing upon applications under rule 17d-1, the Commission considers 
whether the company's participation in the joint transaction is 
consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act and 
the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or 
less advantageous than that of other participants.
    3. Applicants state that in the absence of the requested relief, 
the Regulated Funds would be, in some circumstances, limited in their 
ability to participate in attractive and appropriate investment 
opportunities. Applicants believe that the proposed terms and 
conditions will ensure that the Co-Investment Transactions are 
consistent with the protection of each Regulated Fund's shareholders 
and with the purposes intended by the policies and provisions of the 
Act. Applicants state that the Regulated Funds' participation in the 
Co-Investment Transactions will be consistent with the provisions, 
policies, and purposes of the Act and on a basis that is not different 
from or less advantageous than that of other participants.

Applicants' Conditions

    Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will 
be subject to the following conditions:
    1. Each time an Adviser considers a Potential Co-Investment 
Transaction for an Affiliated Fund or another Regulated Fund that falls 
within a Regulated Fund's then-current Objectives and Strategies, the 
Regulated Fund's Adviser will make an independent determination of the 
appropriateness of the investment for such Regulated Fund in light of 
the Regulated Fund's then-current circumstances.
    2. (a) If the Adviser deems a Regulated Fund's participation in any 
Potential Co-Investment Transaction to be appropriate for the Regulated 
Fund, it will then determine an appropriate level of investment for the 
Regulated Fund.
    (b) If the aggregate amount recommended by the applicable Adviser 
to be invested by the applicable Regulated Fund in the Potential Co-
Investment Transaction, together with the amount proposed to be 
invested by the other participating Regulated Funds and Affiliated 
Funds, collectively, in the same transaction, exceeds the amount of the 
investment opportunity, the investment opportunity will be allocated 
among them pro rata based on each participant's capital available for 
investment in the asset class being allocated, up to the amount 
proposed to be invested by each. The applicable Adviser will provide 
the Eligible Directors of each participating Regulated Fund with 
information concerning each participating party's available capital to 
assist the Eligible Directors with their review of the Regulated Fund's 
investments for compliance with these allocation procedures.
    (c) After making the determinations required in conditions 1 and 
2(a), the applicable Adviser will distribute written information 
concerning the Potential Co-Investment Transaction (including the 
amount proposed to be invested by each participating Regulated Fund and 
Affiliated Fund) to the Eligible Directors of each participating 
Regulated Fund for their consideration. A Regulated Fund will co-invest 
with one or more other Regulated Funds and/or one or more Affiliated 
Funds only if, prior to the Regulated Fund's participation in the 
Potential Co-Investment Transaction, a Required Majority concludes 
that:
    (i) The terms of the Potential Co-Investment Transaction, including 
the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Regulated 
Fund and its shareholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of 
the Regulated Fund or its shareholders on the part of any person 
concerned;
    (ii) the Potential Co-Investment Transaction is consistent with:
    (A) The interests of the shareholders of the Regulated Fund; and
    (B) the Regulated Fund's then-current Objectives and Strategies;
    (iii) the investment by any other Regulated Funds or Affiliated 
Funds would not disadvantage the Regulated Fund, and participation by 
the Regulated Fund would not be on a basis different from or less 
advantageous than that of other Regulated Funds or Affiliated Funds; 
provided that, if any other Regulated Fund or Affiliated Fund, but not 
the Regulated Fund itself, gains the right to nominate a director for 
election to a portfolio company's board of directors or the right to 
have a board observer or any similar right to participate in the 
governance or management of the portfolio company, such event shall not 
be interpreted to prohibit the Required Majority from reaching the 
conclusions required by this condition 2(c)(iii), if:
    (A) The Eligible Directors will have the right to ratify the 
selection of such director or board observer, if any;
    (B) the applicable Adviser agrees to, and does, provide periodic 
reports to the Regulated Fund's Board with respect to the actions of 
such director or the information received by such board observer or 
obtained through the exercise of any similar right to participate in 
the governance or management of the portfolio company; and
    (C) any fees or other compensation that any Affiliated Fund or any 
Regulated Fund or any affiliated person

[[Page 28916]]

of any Affiliated Fund or any Regulated Fund receives in connection 
with the right of an Affiliated Fund or a Regulated Fund to nominate a 
director or appoint a board observer or otherwise to participate in the 
governance or management of the portfolio company will be shared 
proportionately among the participating Affiliated Funds (who each may, 
in turn, share its portion with its affiliated persons) and the 
participating Regulated Funds in accordance with the amount of each 
party's investment; and
    (iv) the proposed investment by the Regulated Fund will not benefit 
the Advisers, the Affiliated Funds or the other Regulated Funds or any 
affiliated person of any of them (other than the parties to the Co-
Investment Transaction), except (A) to the extent permitted by 
condition 13, (B) to the extent permitted by sections 17(e) or 57(k) of 
the Act, as applicable, (C) indirectly, as a result of an interest in 
the securities issued by one of the parties to the Co-Investment 
Transaction, or (D) in the case of fees or other compensation described 
in condition 2(c)(iii)(C).
    3. Each Regulated Fund has the right to decline to participate in 
any Potential Co-Investment Transaction or to invest less than the 
amount proposed.
    4. The applicable Adviser will present to the Board of each 
Regulated Fund, on a quarterly basis, a record of all investments in 
Potential Co-Investment Transactions made by any of the other Regulated 
Funds or Affiliated Funds during the preceding quarter that fell within 
the Regulated Fund's then-current Objectives and Strategies that were 
not made available to the Regulated Fund, and an explanation of why the 
investment opportunities were not offered to the Regulated Fund. All 
information presented to the Board pursuant to this condition will be 
kept for the life of the Regulated Fund and at least two years 
thereafter, and will be subject to examination by the Commission and 
its staff.
    5. Except for Follow-On Investments made in accordance with 
condition 8,\11\ a Regulated Fund will not invest in reliance on the 
Order in any issuer in which another Regulated Fund, Affiliated Fund, 
or any affiliated person of another Regulated Fund or Affiliated Fund 
is an existing investor.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ This exception applies only to Follow-On Investments by a 
Regulated Fund in issuers in which that Regulated Fund already holds 
investments.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    6. A Regulated Fund will not participate in any Potential Co-
Investment Transaction unless the terms, conditions, price, class of 
securities to be purchased, settlement date, and registration rights 
will be the same for each participating Regulated Fund and Affiliated 
Fund. The grant to an Affiliated Fund or another Regulated Fund, but 
not the Regulated Fund, of the right to nominate a director for 
election to a portfolio company's board of directors, the right to have 
an observer on the board of directors or similar rights to participate 
in the governance or management of the portfolio company will not be 
interpreted so as to violate this condition 6, if conditions 
2(c)(iii)(A), (B) and (C) are met.
    7. (a) If any Affiliated Fund or any Regulated Fund elects to sell, 
exchange or otherwise dispose of an interest in a security that was 
acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction, the applicable Advisers will:
    (i) Notify each Regulated Fund that participated in the Co-
Investment Transaction of the proposed disposition at the earliest 
practical time; and
    (ii) formulate a recommendation as to participation by each 
Regulated Fund in the disposition.
    (b) Each Regulated Fund will have the right to participate in such 
disposition on a proportionate basis, at the same price and on the same 
terms and conditions as those applicable to the participating 
Affiliated Funds and any other Regulated Fund.
    (c) A Regulated Fund may participate in such disposition without 
obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if: (i) The proposed 
participation of each Regulated Fund and each Affiliated Fund in such 
disposition is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the 
issuer immediately preceding the disposition; (ii) the Board of the 
Regulated Fund has approved as being in the best interests of the 
Regulated Fund the ability to participate in such dispositions on a pro 
rata basis (as described in greater detail in the application); and 
(iii) the Board of the Regulated Fund is provided on a quarterly basis 
with a list of all dispositions made in accordance with this condition. 
In all other cases, the Adviser will provide its written recommendation 
as to the Regulated Fund's participation to the Eligible Directors, and 
the Regulated Fund will participate in such disposition solely to the 
extent that a Required Majority determines that it is in the Regulated 
Fund's best interests.
    (d) Each Affiliated Fund and each Regulated Fund will bear its own 
expenses in connection with any such disposition.
    8. (a) If any Affiliated Fund or any Regulated Fund desires to make 
a Follow-On Investment in a portfolio company whose securities were 
acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction, the applicable Advisers will:
    (i) Notify each Regulated Fund that participated in the Co-
Investment Transaction of the proposed transaction at the earliest 
practical time; and
    (ii) formulate a recommendation as to the proposed participation, 
including the amount of the proposed Follow-On Investment, by each 
Regulated Fund.
    (b) A Regulated Fund may participate in such Follow-On Investment 
without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if: (i) The 
proposed participation of each Regulated Fund and each Affiliated Fund 
in such investment is proportionate to its outstanding investments in 
the issuer immediately preceding the Follow-On Investment; and (ii) the 
Board of the Regulated Fund has approved as being in the best interests 
of the Regulated Fund the ability to participate in Follow-On 
Investments on a pro rata basis (as described in greater detail in the 
application). In all other cases, the Adviser will provide its written 
recommendation as to the Regulated Fund's participation to the Eligible 
Directors, and the Regulated Fund will participate in such Follow-On 
Investment solely to the extent that a Required Majority determines 
that it is in the Regulated Fund's best interests.
    (c) If, with respect to any Follow-On Investment:
    (i) The amount of the opportunity is not based on the Regulated 
Funds' and the Affiliated Funds' outstanding investments immediately 
preceding the Follow-On Investment; and
    (ii) the aggregate amount recommended by the Adviser to be invested 
by each Regulated Fund in the Follow-On Investment, together with the 
amount proposed to be invested by the participating Affiliated Funds in 
the same transaction, exceeds the amount of the opportunity; then the 
amount invested by each such party will be allocated among them pro 
rata based on each participant's capital available for investment in 
the asset class being allocated, up to the amount proposed to be 
invested by each.
    (d) The acquisition of Follow-On Investments as permitted by this 
condition will be considered a Co-Investment Transaction for all 
purposes and subject to the other conditions set forth in the 
application.
    9. The Non-Interested Directors of each Regulated Fund will be 
provided quarterly for review all information

[[Page 28917]]

concerning Potential Co-Investment Transactions and Co-Investment 
Transactions, including investments made by other Regulated Funds or 
Affiliated Funds that the Regulated Fund considered but declined to 
participate in, so that the Non-Interested Directors may determine 
whether all investments made during the preceding quarter, including 
those investments that the Regulated Fund considered but declined to 
participate in, comply with the conditions of the Order. In addition, 
the Non-Interested Directors will consider at least annually the 
continued appropriateness for the Regulated Fund of participating in 
new and existing Co-Investment Transactions.
    10. Each Regulated Fund will maintain the records required by 
section 57(f)(3) of the Act as if each of the Regulated Funds were a 
BDC and each of the investments permitted under these conditions were 
approved by the Required Majority under section 57(f) of the Act.
    11. No Non-Interested Director of a Regulated Fund will also be a 
director, general partner, managing member or principal, or otherwise 
an ``affiliated person'' (as defined in the Act), of an Affiliated 
Fund.
    12. The expenses, if any, associated with acquiring, holding or 
disposing of any securities acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction 
(including, without limitation, the expenses of the distribution of any 
such securities registered for sale under the Securities Act) will, to 
the extent not payable by the Advisers under their respective 
investment advisory agreements with Affiliated Funds and the Regulated 
Funds, be shared by the Regulated Funds and the Affiliated Funds in 
proportion to the relative amounts of the securities held or to be 
acquired or disposed of, as the case may be.
    13. Any transaction fee \12\ (including break-up or commitment fees 
but excluding broker's fees contemplated by section 17(e) or 57(k) of 
the Act, as applicable) received in connection with a Co-Investment 
Transaction will be distributed to the participating Regulated Funds 
and Affiliated Funds on a pro rata basis based on the amounts they 
invested or committed, as the case may be, in such Co-Investment 
Transaction. If any transaction fee is to be held by an Adviser pending 
consummation of the transaction, the fee will be deposited into an 
account maintained by such Adviser at a bank or banks having the 
qualifications prescribed in section 26(a)(1) of the Act, and the 
account will earn a competitive rate of interest that will also be 
divided pro rata among the participating Regulated Funds and Affiliated 
Funds based on the amounts they invest in such Co-Investment 
Transaction. None of the Affiliated Funds, the Advisers, the other 
Regulated Funds or any affiliated person of the Regulated Funds or 
Affiliated Funds will receive additional compensation or remuneration 
of any kind as a result of or in connection with a Co-Investment 
Transaction (other than (a) in the case of the Regulated Funds and the 
Affiliated Funds, the pro rata transaction fees described above and 
fees or other compensation described in condition 2(c)(iii)(C); and (b) 
in the case of an Adviser, investment advisory fees paid in accordance 
with the agreement between the Adviser and the Regulated Fund or 
Affiliated Fund.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ Applicants are not requesting and the staff is not 
providing any relief for transaction fees received in connection 
with any Co-Investment Transaction.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    14. If the Holders own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the 
Shares of a Regulated Fund, then the Holders will vote such Shares as 
directed by an independent third party when voting on (1) the election 
of directors; (2) the removal of one or more directors; or (3) any 
other matter under either the Act or applicable State law affecting the 
Board's composition, size or manner of election.

    For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, 
under delegated authority.
Eduardo A. Aleman,
Assistant Secretary.
