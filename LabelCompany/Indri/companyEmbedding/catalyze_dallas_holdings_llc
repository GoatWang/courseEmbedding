JurisdictionType
Texas Secretary of StateTexas Franchise Tax Registration. Taxpayer ID = 32055468238 

What is this? This shows where the company has registered for sales tax. Sales tax registration is complex since the rules vary by each state in the USA and even by town. Registration may be required because the company is selling certain types of products such as alcohol or cigarettes or it may be a general requirement for any sales including internet sales.  The information shows that the company has enough sales in this location to warrant registration.

Outgoings

Business Rates/Property Tax
                        No properties were found where CATALYZE DALLAS HOLDINGS, LLC is liable for the business rates / property tax. This could be for a number of reasons. The council hasnt published the data We havent found or been able to process the councils data The company is part of a group of companies and another company in the group is liable for business rates The registered office may be a residential address which does not have a commercial designation. If the business is run from home then it won't be a commercial property and hence won't be liable for business rates. Serviced offices are increasingly popular and therefore a business may not be paying business rates directly - the building owner is and this is incorporated in the office rental charge.
