Fred Ebrahimi



Not skill alone, but total involvement of its engineers is what the dominant software company is looking for, Fred Ebrahimi, President and CEO, Quark, tells Roopinder Singh

QUARK has dominated           the publishing software market for long. Founded in 1981, in Denver,           Colorado, USA, the company set up a software development centre in           India in November, 1998. Farhad F. (Fred) Ebrahimi, President and CEO,           Quark Incorporated, has a slightly rumpled and casual look that           bespeaks more of an academic rather a businessman. He was in           Chandigarh recently and the following are excerpts from an exclusive           interview:
How did Quark manage           to get the massive market share that it has of the publishing world?           Was it the typographical precision?
Because we have the           best product. Quark has 90 per cent of the share in publishing and           that’s reasonable (laugh). Reliability, ease of use and a very           strong architecture so that it is flexible and can be changed, and the           extensions. I have people coming to me and saying that when they use           the competitor’s products, they spend double the time. And time is           quite valuable.
I think that it is           because we have spent tremendous amount of time and energy trying to           understand what makes a customer happy when he uses it. You are           correct also that we have tremendous precision. We supported very           strong typographical features way earlier than anybody else. It is not           just the features, it feels better. 
How did you all come up         with the idea of having something like Quark?
The company was started         by a partner of mine (Tim Gill, see box), who is no longer a shareholder         He came from the computer side and I came from the computer and         publishing background. When we got involved, both of us wanted to         democratise publishing. In those days, because of the expensive cost of         pre-press processes, very few people could publish. It took millions of         dollars to start a publication.
We thought that it         would be a good contribution to the world if we provided tools so that         people with modest means could publish. So we used our skills as         engineers and when we shipped QuarkXPress 1.0 there were only eight of         us. Five were engineers and the rest administrative, accounting staff,         etc. It took us nine months to ship QuarkXPress 1.0. It was a labour of         love.





What is Quark?
Software engineer               Tim Gill founded Quark in 1981, producing the first word processor               for the Apple II computer. Gill named the company Quark after the               subatomic particle proposed as a building block for all matter.
Fred Ebrahimi, Quark’s               president and CEO, came on board in 1986. A year later the company               released QuarkXPress 1.0, sparking a publishing revolution. During               the next few years, Quark focused on perfecting the features, such               as typography, hyphenation, multilanguage capabilities, and               professional output features that have made QuarkXPress the most               popular publishing software among designers, publishers and               printers around the world. By the early 1990s, QuarkXPress had               solidified its position as the industry leader in the electronic               publishing market.




When did you start?
We started in June,1986         and we shipped in March, 1987.
By that time you had         other products for desktop publishing?
Not desktop publishing,         but word processing. We had a product called Word Juggler for Apple II.
Page Maker was,         however, there.
Yes. Page Maker had an         extensive market share. There were 50 other products, including Ready         Set Go. It’s not that we didn’t have any competition.
You did well till         QuarkXPress 4, which did not quite turn out to be as it was expected.
We made a mistake with         Quark 4.0. I have apologised publicly. We didn’t test it enough. We         had great new features. What we didn’t do is test it as strongly as we         should have and Quark 4.1, subsequently, solved those problems and we         have made a commitment that Quark 5.0 will not ship till our customers         say “ship.”
What is the direction         that 5.0 will be going in?
Well, the most         significant issue of 5.0 is we are producing a tool that would enable         you to go to print and, with the same person and same resources, be able         to create a Web page with it conveniently.
The HTML output from         5.0 is very powerful, from which you could produce, for example, e-books         (in Microsoft Reader), Flash or SVG. There is one thing that is very         important to understand about this strategy—we all know that         publishers are losing money on the Web. There is no substantial revenue         there, but they have to do it anyway. They have to have a Web site, they         can’t say, “I don’t have a Web site.” And right now they have         all the additional cost without the revenue to compensate. So it is a         losing proposition. We think that we are making a major contribution         there. You could do what you make money at — namely, print         publications, and at the same time put things on the Web without an         additional cost. That’s the strategy. Obviously we have added many         features, like tables, layers, but those are not as important as this         fundamental issue.
So, in effect, Quark is         moving from print publishing to conversion.
You are absolutely         correct.
And in this you are         supporting the industry standard in HTML, compatible with the World Wide         Web Consortium (W3)?
Absolutely. Actually         the vehicle we use is XML. Quark is a senior member of W3 and we use         very clean, standard HTML output. None of the crazy derivatives that you         have problems with later on. In fact, you could take the HTML that we         produce and take it to a product like Dreamweaver and additionally         modify it if you wish.
Our commitment first is         to our installed base. They are the ones who have stuck with us, good or         bad; they have paid us, they have given us great ideas, and criticised         us. We love publishing and we are not going to abandon it, as other         companies are doing. We are committed to publishing. I have it in my         blood. I love publishing and a lot of our staff is from publishing         background and we are doing everything we can to help publishing.
What are the other         Quark products?
A very good example is         Quark Digital Media System, or DMS, and quite a bit of work on it is         being done in this very building (Chandigarh). The same is the case with         QuarkXPress 5.0.
The whole thing about         DMS is the ability to store the content and deploy it, whether for print         or Internet or whatever you want it for. It seamlessly integrates with         QuarkXPress to allow you to easily reuse individual elements from         QuarkXPress pages in a variety of publications.
We have to admit that         we are pleasantly surprised that not only the publishing industry likes         it, like the Independent newspaper in South Africa, but we also have         customers like mail order catalogue firms, banks, and financial         institutions like Barclay using it. It is a very powerful product for us         and it is generating very good revenue.
It has a very tight         integration with QuarkXpress, though we also support other programs like         PhotoShop and Microsoft Word.
Quark Wrapture is for         very sophisticated packaging design; you can look at it three         dimensionally and so on. We have not tried to market it in India, but         basically in the USA and Japan.
Most of the work on         Mirim (data analysis and decision support tools for examining historical         and real-time sales data from the Internet and print promotions) is         being done here (in Chandigarh). It is about seeing how effective a         marketing campaign is, because a lot of times people spend tremendous         amount of money in marketing and retail campaigns for certain         merchandise but don’t know how effective it is, who buys it, why he         buys it and so on. Mirim combines date from existing order management         systems, digital images from catalogues and web pages and data from         e-commerce systems, resulting in a single solution for direct marketing         professionals.
Why did you come to         India in the first place? What has your Indian experience been like?
I am an explorer. Being         an Iranian, this is like a second home to me. I feel comfortable. My         wife loved it, my children love it. There is an affinity.
I have to admit that         from a business point of view, it wasn’t a number one priority at         first. It was a personal issue and we have enjoyed it here. There are         difficulties, I don’t want to in any form or shape disregard those,         but it is worth it.
What is it that makes         it worth it?
In a very modest way,         we feel that we have made a difference here. That means a lot to me.
What exactly is the         kind of work that you are doing here?
This is what makes us         significantly different from other companies. We do truly original work         We treat our engineers exactly the same way as we do in the USA and they         are treated exactly the same way as they would be in the USA or Germany,         and get the same respect as they would in the USA. We have people here         who are working on QuarkXPress 5.0, which is obviously very important to         us, it is a $100 million-a-year revenue product, they are working on DMS,         on Mirim.
We are doing something         that not too many companies are trying to do. Most other IT activities         are contract work here, year Y2K and so on, and that’s not the most         interesting work. It’s one time. You do the work and it’s for a         third party, which you don’t even know. What we are developing is a         product that many companies use so you get a different kind of         satisfaction out of that.
Has the economic         slowdown in the USA affected Quark?
Yes. If any company         says that the economic slowdown hasn’t affected it, it’s lying.
Have you laid off         anybody?
No. No way. We are,         actually, in a hiring mode. First of all we predicted this slowdown.         When everyone else was hiring, we cancelled projects in some cases. We         ended up with a lower level of staff in the USA, which was a part of our         strategy. We were very well prepared. We are also very liquid. We have         zero debt. We are lenders to banks, not borrowers from banks. We have a         very strong economic situation, so we can take advantage of this         slowdown and expand.
We are in the expansion         mode all over the world, especially in India. However, let me be very         honest with you. What we are doing is that we are raising the bar of         expectation. Don’t be surprised if you hear that I have let someone         go. Non-productive engineers are everywhere, even in this building. We         weren’t right with every engineer that we hired. But please don’t         misunderstand and think that we are lowering the staff. We are going to         hire over 500 engineers in Chandigarh, as soon as we find ones who are         good. Whether it takes two months, or two years.
What we are not going         to do is just fill the position regardless of the qualifications. We are         going to be much more demanding. So Quark will be a hard place to get         in.
During the bubble time,         a lot of expectation was built, a lot of people were given positions         that they should not have been given in every company, including Quark,         and corrections are needed. We are lucky in that we are prepared for         this and we can go up, but a lot of companies have to cut. We are not         cutting a single position because of lack of money. If we do any         cutting; it is because the person is not qualified.
What kind of skills is         Quark looking for?
There is something more         important than skill. You are talking to me at a very special moment. I         think that before skill, we have come to the conclusion we want to look         for a certain character. A lot of people were inducted in the IT         business worldwide, including India, but they don’t have the         intellectual capacity and emotional commitment to be in the software         business. People shouldn’t become software developers unless they         really love this and they have a tremendous caring. Frankly, I compare         it to good journalism. A great journalist loves what he does. He doesn’t         do it for the money or for any other reason than searching for the         truth.
In software you want to         please the customer. What you should be doing is developing absolutely         the best you can for the customer. That orientation is not strong         outside the USA. Even in the USA, it’s not all that common, though         there is a little better understanding of how to find out what the         customer wants. In India or Germany, they are accustomed to somebody         giving the specifications, because they have done contract work, and         then preparing the coding according to the specifications. They have a         rigid process. It is not interactive, it is not creative. So a lot of         people in India are not trying to work in such an interactive, flexible         way. In fact they have been trying to be rigid. So we want a person who         is creative, is open to new ideas, and is also a good engineer. But         believe me, being a good engineer is secondary.
Somebody who pushes the         bubble just that little bit extra when needed?
And cares. In fact, I         am very seriously considering hiring non-engineers to do IT work because         they bring a human side. Look, I am an engineer and I feel comfortable         criticising my own kind. We are not trained to have a sense of history,         of art, of humanity and so on. Very few of us read poetry.
We deal with formulas         and questions. We see the world differently. We need those skills, but         they are not hard to come by. We need to be human first.
You are well known for         your attempts to help disadvantaged children.
I think that it’s         important to have education available to disadvantaged children. I don’t         want them to learn about technology alone, because I think that it’s         even more important that they learn about humanity. So a blend of         technological education and humanities is needed. So I am more than         happy to do what I can reasonably do to help.
What are the projects         that you are working on in Chandigarh?
We have started with a         programme for scholarships as an experiment. Forty scholarships, I         believe, and they have chosen the candidates. We want to run it as an         experiment and, if it is successful, I want to expand it.
A large number of         children are doing IT courses in India. What kinds of skill sets have a         future? What languages have a future?
This is another problem         in India, not just in this country, but more severely here. I think that         the language, etc, are not important. But the image here is that someone         heard that his or her friend is a Java programmer and is earning double         the salary. Therefore, they study Java. They have no understanding of         Java; they have no love of that. The language used to develop the         software is number five in our list of priorities. Engineers again think         that’s that most important issue. That’s not true.
Actually we have some         serious questions about Java. Java applications have not been as         efficient. The fact of the matter is that I don’t know of a single,         real successful Java application that has sold a lot. I am not saying         that there is anything wrong with Java, we are using Java, as are         millions of companies, but in some areas it is very appropriate to use C         because it is much more efficient.
To some young kids and         pundits, it becomes a religion and it’s “my religion is better         than your religion,” which is nonsense, which is garbage. You         should use the right tool for doing the work and sometimes it is Java,         or C++ or, at times, C. One thing is emerging as very important, that we         fully support in QuarkXpress 5.0, is XML. You have got to have a way in         which you can communicate all the work that you have done with something         else, a way that’s language independent.
We will have all kinds of languages. In         my lifetime in computer sciences I have seen over 700 languages. I used         to code myself in PL1 (Programming Language 1, used by IBM on         mainframes). It’s like saying that a pen is more important than the         poem.

Macworld/iWorld Highlights: Creative workflows























Quark, developer of the desktop publishing software QuarkXPress, has been acquired by Platinum Equity, a Los Angeles merger and acquisition company, for an undisclosed sum.
Quark, which is privately held, was previously owned by the Ebrahimi family, which bought it from founder Tim Gill in 2000. On August 1, the children of Farhad (Fred) Ebrahimi, who retired in 2005, completed a transaction in which they sold all of their Quark shares for cash, and handed over control of the company to Platinum Equity.Quark said the purpose of this transaction is to strengthen the company and give it the flexibility and financial facility to fulfill its goal of becoming a category leader in the realm of dynamic and digital publishing."Our interest is to have financial backers that can...help us focus on our core markets, and more specifically, to create an acquisition strategy that's focused on helping us expand the breadth and depth of our product capabilities and our geographic coverage," said Quark President and CEO Raymond Schiavone. "Being family-owned, there are certain constraints, so we sought to find a partner that could help us execute our strategy. We found a fantastic partner [that is] expert in mergers and acquisitions and operations, so this gives us some capabilities that we didn't have with the prior ownership."This transaction is good news for Quark, according to Thad McIlroy, an electronic publishing consultant, analyst and author, and principal of The Future of Publishing, based in Vancouver, British Columbia. "I knew that the [Quark executives] were highly skilled and capable of taking Quark in a new direction, and yet Quark did not move in a new direction. The product developed in interesting ways, but they weren't being very aggressive in the marketplace...so they decided to start shopping the company around to get some new blood and new financing, and they succeeded at doing that. That's a major coup these days—to sell a publishing tools company. It's not the hottest sector in the universe."Platinum EquityFounded in 1995, Platinum Equity has closed over 115 acquisitions and has over $30 billion in combined annual revenue across acquisitions at the point of acquisition, according to its website. Its portfolio includes a diverse array of companies, acquired via corporate divestitures, public-to-private transactions, and transactions with private sellers. It is now involved with companies spanning the entertainment, industrial, IT services and software, manufacturing, media and telecommunications, and logistics and distribution categories.“Quark is a legendary brand that helped create the desktop publishing market and is now helping organizations transform how they publish content both to print and digital media,” said Brian Wall, partner at Platinum, in a statement. “Quark is committed to its loyal and dedicated user base and we are enthusiastic about the company’s new products, which are gaining traction and generating positive reviews. We believe that with their expertise and innovative software, Quark has the potential to revolutionize publishing again.”With this transaction, Quark is positioning itself to offer what it calls an end-to-end solution in dynamic publishing—from content creation to delivery to syndication. It sees Platinum Equity as a means to help it acquire the right mix of technologies in strategic acquisitions to make that happen. "The dynamic publishing market is fragmented today," said Schiavone. "There's a number of companies that do very specific things. We want to be the company that can provide the end-to-end solution and be the market leader." From the point of view of the industry as a whole, the Platinum Equity buyout makes sense, says McIlroy. "This is agnostic capital—money in search of an opportunity, so it is a great endorsement of Quark and its approach, and of Quark's future plans and longevity. This says to us that Quark's going to be around for some time, that they're going to be a player in the publishing tools space."What about Adobe?The elephant in the room is Quark's arch-rival, Adobe. From Quark's perspective, however, Adobe is tangential to its current publishing ambitions. Unlike Adobe, Quark does not have its eye on other creation tools or Web analytics, specialties that Adobe has been developing over time. Instead, Quark plans to concentrate on traditional markets such as newspapers and magazines, as well as financial services, life sciences, government, and manufacturing to provide those customers with the capability to automate their publishing processes."We do compete with Adobe, but there are some differences," said Schiavone. "All we do is publishing...We want to solve the publishing problem both for traditional publishers as well as large enterprises. So we want to provide graphic designers and the folks creating print content today with the tools to participate in the digital age. There's spots that will overlap [with Adobe], but we'll be expanding into places that Adobe is not deeply into."Thad McIllroy agrees. "The good news is that Quark is wonderfully positioned between the consumer publishing market and the high-end publishing market. They understand the consumer and cross media publishing space...and inasmuch as opportunities become available, Quark is well positioned to take advantage of them."Digital publishing strategyAs part of its digital publishing 2.0 strategy, Quark seeks to compete not only in the realm of print and online publishing, but also in digital publishing of rich, interactive content to a variety of mobile devices in multiple formats.Earlier this year, Quark released QuarkXPress 9, which updated the company's desktop publishing package and introduced a mobile component for the iOS and other platforms. Integration of the new App Studio into the package, which will be available soon with the release of QuarkXPress 9.1, will allow designers to publish directly to digital devices, notably the iPad and eventually other tablets, as well as to e-readers, smart phones, and other cross-media systems.In choosing Platinum Equity as a partner, Quark seeks to maintain its independence and to eliminate questions about its customer relations and its ability to make decisions. "We continue to operate exactly as we did before the acquisition, continue to support our clients, and we're a separate standalone business just as we were before—same people, same name," Schiavone said.
