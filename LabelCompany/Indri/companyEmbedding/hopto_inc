Overview
We are developers of application software which includes application virtualization software and cloud computing software for multiple computer operating systems including Windows, UNIX, and several Linux-based variants.  Our application publishing software solutions are sold under the brand name GO-Global, which is our sole revenue source at this time.  GO-Global is an application access solution for use and/or resale by independent software vendors ("ISVs"), corporate enterprises, governmental and educational institutions, and others who wish to take advantage of cross-platform remote access and Web-enabled access to their existing software applications, as well as those who are deploying secure, private cloud environments.
Since 2012, we have also been developing several products in the field of software productivity for mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones, which have been marketed under the hopTo brand.
The hopTo products were originally marketed to consumers and were later also marketed to small and medium sized businesses and enterprise level customers under the name hopTo Work.  hopTo Work allows customers to instantly transform their legacy applications to become touch friendly on modern mobile devices.  During 2015 and 2016 we also worked to integrated hopTo Work with certain software products offered by Citrix Systems.
Over the years, we have also made significant investments in intellectual property ("IP").  We have filed many patents designed to protect the new technologies embedded in hopTo.

 hopTo Inc. (OTCMKTS:HPTO) Files An 8-K Regulation FD Disclosure

Item 7.01




Regulation FD Disclosure.




As previously stated in its May 23, 2017 earnings release, hopTo
Inc. is providing the following answers to questions submitted to
its [email protected] email address regarding the
Companys business, finances and operations. These questions and
answers will also be posted on the Companys website at
investors.hopto.com. These answers are subject to the forward
looking statement disclaimer following the last question and
answer below. The following questions and answers do not purport
to be indicative of the Companys overall current business,
finances, operations or prospects; rather, the answers reflect
the Companys responses solely to the questions submitted.


Question: How many individuals are still on the Board of
Directors?


hopTo Answer:


There have been no changes to the hopTo Board of Directors. The
board is comprised of five independent members and the Company
Chief Executive Officer all of whom were included on our Form 10K
filed on April 7, 2017 with the SEC. The board is not currently
receiving fees from the Company.


Question: On the Aqua Licensing Website it states that all bids
were to be in by 3/20/2017 and the winning bid would be announced
on 4/7/2017. Is the company currently in Subsequent rounds of
bidding with multiple potential buyers?


hopTo Answer:


As we stated in our Form 8K filed with the SEC on April 20, 2017,
the hopTo IP sale process is still ongoing. We cannot currently
discuss any specifics as discussions are still underway with
potential buyers.


This question and answer set contains statements that are forward
looking. These statements include statements regarding potential
strategic transactions and negotiations, financing and cost
cutting initiatives, such as subletting our office lease. These
statements are based on managements current expectations and are
subject to a number of uncertainties and risks that could cause
actual results to differ significantly from those described in
the forward looking statements. Factors that may cause such a
difference include the following: our lack of cash resources
makes it extremely difficult to execute on our efforts to extract
value from our hopTo and Go-Global assets, and creates risks that
we may be unable to realize full value for such assets; we may be
unable to manage our expenses to a degree to preserve our
opportunities to extract value from our assets, and may be forced
to sell them at unfavorable prices; there is no assurance that
any transaction will be achieved for any hopTo assets in a timely
manner, on reasonable terms, or at all; and other factors,
including those set forth under Item 1A, Risk Factors in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016
and in other documents we have filed with the SEC. We assume no
obligation to update the above question and answer set, which
speaks only as of the date of this Form 8-K in which these
questions and answers first appear.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
