 Supporting Families
 We are committed to finding and investing in programs that enhance the lives of the children and families in our communities.
     
 At Capital One, we aim to help make our communities dynamic places where families can live, work, grow and realize their dreams. Our approach involves making investments and bringing together resources to transform not only the physical environment, but also the economic opportunity available for residents and businesses alike. And, when our communities thrive, businesses within that community, including our own, can thrive.
Capital One/UNO Charter School Center
Capital One and the University of New Orleans (UNO) partner to support the UNO Charter School Center, a network of public schools that provides high quality public education to neighborhoods damaged by Hurricane Katrina - Lakeview, Gentilly, and Pontchartrain Park. This partnership is part of our multi-faceted long-term commitment to revitalize and rebuild the Gulf region and to return quality education to the areas devastated by Hurricane Katrina.
The Heart of America Foundation READesignSM
We believe that being able to read is a key skill for our children. A love of reading exposes them to a world beyond the one in which they live each day, encouraging them to dream new dreams for themselves. We partner with The Heart of America Foundation to put books into the hands of children in low-income communities and to create safe, inviting libraries in their schools.
Over the last three years, The Heart of America Foundation and Capital One have donated 500,000 books to nearly 300,000 children. Capital One associates also spent an average of 4,000 hours each year donating and distributing books, reading to children, and leading story-writing contests, read-a-thons, and book fairs.
Through The Heart of America Foundation READesignSM program, our philanthropic dollars and associate volunteers transform school libraries into areas that engage children’s imagination and encourage them to read. Dull, uninviting spaces become vibrant with paint, murals, or original paintings by a Disney artist; new furniture; and 1,000 new books, including books that promote financial literacy.
During Literacy Month each March, our associates donate books and make financial contributions to The Heart of America Foundation, furthering our effort to foster a love of reading in our children that will last a lifetime.
Safe Horizon – Hope Shining
Through our partnership with Safe Horizon, an organization that provides support to and promotes justice for victims of abuse and crime, Capital One actively works to raise awareness of signs of child abuse and the resources available to those impacted. Our support also helped to launch Hope Shining, a nationwide initiative to increase awareness, prevention, and support services for children, families, and communities impacted by violence and abuse.
Community Corps Boards
We believe in getting to know the residents of our local communities and understanding both their business and social needs.  In each of our local markets, we have established Community Corps Boards, teams of associates who volunteer their time to organize and implement associate volunteer activities designed to meet specific social needs in their communities.   Through the work of the CCBs, we are able to engage our associates in volunteer activities that have immediate impact on the lives of neighborhood residents.
Holiday Outreach
During the holiday season, we increase our outreach to residents in need in our communities. Each year between November and December, our associates participate in a variety of human service activities including donating gifts to needy families, hosting children’s holiday parties, contributing to food and coat drives, and volunteering at local shelters.
Literacy Celebration
We believe that being able to read is a key skill for our children. A love of reading exposes them to a world beyond the one in which they live each day, encouraging them to dream new dreams for themselves. Each March, Capital One and The Heart of America Foundation join forces to encourage a love of reading among young people in our communities.  Our associates donate books, read to students, and partner with local schools to distribute books to classrooms.

 Capital One® helps improve the communities in which we live and work.  We finance the creation and rehabilitation of safe, affordable housing for low-income and special-needs populations. We also seek to develop, enhance and strengthen low-income neighborhoods by financing projects that support community stabilization and revitalization efforts. In addition, we have a very strong commitment to supporting small businesses.
Affordable Housing
Providing safe, secure, and affordable housing is the foundation for building strong communities. We've increased our annual financing of affordable housing from $50 million to $570 million over the several years since we acquired Hibernia Bank and North Fork Bank. Our newly developed Community Development Finance team extended more than $570 million in 2008 for the development of affordable housing, an increase of 73% from 2007. This team focuses on the development of affordable rental and homeownership opportunities for low- and moderate-income families. Our Multifamily Housing Team also finances affordable housing and extended $181 million in 2008, an increase of $69 million from 2007.
Small Business Development
Capital One wants to help preserve and strengthen communities by supporting small business development and job creation. We regularly host and deliver community-based workshops on topics that are critical to the success of small business owners.

In Texas, we partner with Accion Texas and SCORE; both nationally-known organizations that engage in supporting small businesses.
In New Orleans, we have partnered with Delgado Community College, the largest community college in Louisiana, to offer a 10-course series entitled The Successful Business Practices for Entrepreneurs Seminar Series.
In the New York/New Jersey market, we have developed the Capital One Bank Small Business Basics curriculum and delivered it in connection with numerous nonprofits.  In 2008 in the NY metro area, we held nearly 75 seminars attended by nearly 1500 small businesses.
Through our $econd Look program, Capital One refers declined small business applicants to non-profit partners that provide technical assistance and loans to pre-bankable businesses. Almost a dozen non-profits, such as ACCION, have helped over 500 businesses through this referral program.
Capital One also has a Community Development Corporation (CDC) that is dedicated to community development lending which includes providing small loans to these nonprofits to support their lending activities.

Community Stabilization and Revitalization
Capital One seeks out and finances other activities that serve to stabilize or revitalize lower-income neighborhoods in our local communities. For example, Capital One:

Invested in Walnut Square, an apartment complex located in eastern New Orleans, LA, which suffered substantial damage from Hurricane Katrina and was demolished in 2006. Through an equity investment in Low Income Housing Tax credits, Capital One invested in rebuilding the 209 affordable-housing units. In addition to providing much needed housing, this rebuilding project brought jobs and other businesses back to the area.
Worked with our nonprofit partner, Cypress Hills Local Development Corporation in Brooklyn, NY, to provide the construction loan for the development of Glenmore Grove, a 12-unit "green" condo development that will offer affordable homeownership.

Important Disclosures and Requirements
+ Show All

 1 APR is the Annual Percentage Rate. Advertised rates depend on the individual's credit and key financing characteristics, including but not limited to the Amount Financed, term, a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of less than or equal to 80%, and other vehicle characteristics. A representative example of payment terms are as follows: an Amount Financed of $25,000 with an APR of 7.50% and a term of 60 months would have a monthly payment of $500.95. APRs shown are current as of April 20, 2017. Advertised rates are subject to change without notice.
Advertised 3.24% APR is offered depending on the individual’s excellent and substantial credit, and key financing characteristics, including but not limited to the amount financed, a term less than or equal to 60 months, a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of less than or equal to 80% and a new vehicle. Your actual APR will be based on your specific situation.
2 Yearly Payment reduction claim is based on average payment reduction our customers experience over a year with their new loan (same or a longer term) compared to their prior yearly loan payments. Yearly payment reduction may result from a lower interest rate, a longer term or both. Your actual savings may be different.

Capital One has an impressive track record in the US credit card category, and is among the largest issuers, despite its highly specialised business model and lack of a national branch network. Nevertheless, more investment is needed and, among other things, a greater geographic spread and less focus on credit cards. The company is operating in an increasingly complex environment, with tougher regulation of banks and low interest rates.

Capital One’s history: From credit cards to a diversified bank


By Saul Perez

Capital One’s history
Capital One’s (COF) history is shorter than other banks. It was formed in 1994. This was when Signet Financial Corp. spun off its credit card business into a separate subsidiary named Capital One. The new company was led by Richard Fairbank.
Capital One was a monoline credit card company in the early 1990s. A company is called “monoline” when nearly all of the revenue comes from a single product. Capital One built a strong credit card business. This strategy paid off during good times. However, in bad times it can lead to sharp losses.
Banks such as Wells Fargo (WFC), U.S. Bank (USB), and PNC Bank (PNC) are well diversified banks. These banks de-risk their revenue streams by being in different business lines. All of these banks are a part of the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF).

Diversification into retail banking
Capital One diversified into retail banking in in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It aimed to reduce the risk from a monoline business. It also helped the bank enter into attractive businesses that it understood. Capital One was one of the pioneers in using data analytics to build a customer profile for its credit card business. It used its knowledge and customer database insights to enter into auto financing.



Over years, the bank also focused on inorganic growth. Its first big acquisition was Hibernia National Bank in 2005. Capital One later acquired North Fork Bank to strengthen its New York metropolitan area operations. It acquired Chevy Chase to increase its market share in the Washington DC metropolitan area.
In last of its big acquisitions, it acquired ING Direct to boost its online banking. ING Direct was a pioneer in online banking in the US. Acquisitions aligned to business strategy helped in diversification. It took the bank to where it is today.

Capital One Financial Corporation is a bank holding company specializing in credit cards, home loans, auto loans, banking and savings products headquartered in McLean, Virginia.[2]
Capital One is the eighth-largest commercial bank in the United States when ranked by assets and deposits.[4] and is ranked 9th on the list of largest banks in the United States by total assets. The bank has 755 branches[4] including 18 café style locations[5] and 2,000 ATMs. It is ranked #100 on the Fortune 500,[6] #17 on Fortune's 100 Best Companies to work for list,[7] and conducts business in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.[2] The company helped pioneer the mass marketing of credit cards in the 1990s, and it is one of the largest customers of the United States Postal Service due to its direct mail credit card solicitations.[8] In 2015, it was the 5th largest credit card issuer by purchase volume, after American Express, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup.[9]

History[edit]
Monoline credit card company (1994-2004)[edit]




Capital One retail footprint


On July 27, 1994, Richmond, Virginia-based Signet Financial Corp (now part of Wells Fargo) announced the corporate spin-off of its credit card division, OakStone Financial, naming Richard Fairbank as CEO[13] Signet renamed the subsidiary Capital One in October 1994.[14] The spinoff was concluded February 28, 1995, making Capital One fully independent.[15]
At that time, Capital One was a monoline bank, meaning that all of its revenue came from a single product, in this case, credit cards.[16] This strategy is risky in that it can lead to losses during bad times.[16] Capital One attributed its relative success as a monoline to its use of data collection to build demographic profiles, allowing it to target personalized offers of credit direct to consumers.[17]
Capital One commenced operations in Canada in 1996.
Expansion into auto loans (1998-present)[edit]
In July 1998, Capital One acquired auto financing company Summit Acceptance Corporation.[18]
In 1999, Capital One was looking to expand beyond credit cards. CEO Richard Fairbank announced moves to use Capital One's experience with collecting consumer data to offer loans, insurance, and phone service.[19]
In October 2001, PeopleFirst Finance LLC was acquired by Capital One.[20]
The companies were combined and rebranded as Capital One Auto Finance Corporation in 2003.[21]
In late 2002, Capital One and the United States Postal Service proposed a negotiated services agreement for bulk discount in mailing services.[22] The resulting three-year agreement[23] was extended in 2006.[24] In June 2008, however, Capital One had filed a complaint[25] with the USPS regarding the terms of the next agreement,[26] citing the terms of the NSA of Capital One's competitor, Bank of America. Capital One subsequently withdrew its complaint to the Postal Regulatory Commission following a settlement with the USPS.[27]
Onyx Acceptance Corporation was acquired by Capital One in September 2004.
Expansion into retail banking (2005-present)[edit]
While many other monolines were acquired by larger, diverse banks, Capital One expanded into retail banking with a focus on subprime customers.
Capital One acquired New Orleans, Louisiana-based Hibernia National Bank for $4.9 billion in cash and stock in 2005[28] and acquired Melville, New York-based North Fork Bank for $13.2 billion in cash and stock in 2006,[29] which reduced its dependency on credit cards from 90% to 55%.[30]
In 2007, Capital One acquired NetSpend, a marketer of prepaid debit cards, for $700 million.[31]
During the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis, Capital One closed its mortgage platform, GreenPoint Mortgage, due in part to investor pressures.[32][33][34]
In 2008, Capital One received an investment of US$3.56 billion from the United States Treasury as a result of the Troubled Asset Relief Program.[35][36] On June 17, 2009, Capital One completed the repurchase of the stock the company issued to the U.S. Treasury paying a total of US$3.67 billion, resulting in a profit of over $100 million to the U.S. Treasury.[37]
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission criticized Capital One's conduct during the crisis, claiming that the understated auto loan losses during the financial crisis of 2007-2008. In 2013, Capital One paid $3.5 million to settle the case, but was not required to directly address the allegations of wrongdoing.[38]
In February 2009, Capital One acquired Chevy Chase Bank for $520 million in cash and stock.[39][40][41][42]
In June 2011, ING Group announced the sale of its ING Direct division to Capital One for US$9 billion in cash and stock.[43] On August 26, 2011, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors announced it would hold public hearings on the Capital One acquisition of ING Direct, and extend to October 12, 2011, the public comment period that had been scheduled to end August 22.[44] The move came amidst rising scrutiny of the deal on systemic risk, or "Too-Big-to-Fail," performance under the Community Reinvestment Act, and pending legal challenges. A coalition of national civil rights and consumer groups, led by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, were joined by Rep. Barney Frank to challenge immediate approval of the deal. The groups have argued that the acquisition is a test of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, under which systemically risky firms must demonstrate a public benefit that outweighs new risk before they are allowed to grow. Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank head Thomas M. Hoenig was also skeptical of the deal.[45][46] In February 2012, the acquisition was approved by regulators and Capital One completed its acquisition of ING Direct.[47] Capital One received permission to merge ING into its business in October 2012,[48] and rebranded ING Direct as Capital One 360 in November 2012.[49]
In August 2011, Capital One reached a deal with HSBC to acquire its U.S. credit card operations.[50] Capital One paid US$31.3 billion in exchange for US$28.2 billion in loans and $600 million in other assets. The acquisition was completed by May 2012.[51]
On February 26, 2012, along with several other banks, Capital One announced support for the Isis Mobile Wallet payment system.[52] However, in September 2013, Capital One dropped support for the venture.[53]
In 2012, Capital One closed 41 branch locations.[54]
In 2015, Capital One closed 186 branch locations.[55]
On February 19, 2014, Capital One became a 25% owner in ClearXchange, a P2P (person to person) money transfer service designed to make money transfers to customers within the same bank and other financial institutions via mobile phone number or email address.[56] ClearXchange was sold to Early Warning in 2016.[57]
In January 2015, Capital One acquired Level Money, a budgeting app for consumers.[58]
On July 8, 2015, Capital announced that it has acquired Monsoon, a design studio, development shop, marketing house and strategic consultancy.[59]
In 2015, Capital One acquired General Electric's Healthcare Financial Services unit, which included $8.5 billion in loans made to businesses in the healthcare industry, for $9-billion.[60]
In October 2016, Capital One acquired Paribus, a price tracking service, for an undisclosed amount.[61][62]
Sports marketing[edit]
Since 2001, Capital One has been the principal sponsor of the college football Florida Citrus Bowl, which has been called the Capital One Bowl since 2003. It sponsors a mascot challenge every year, announcing the winner on the day of the Capital One Bowl. Capital One is one of the top three sponsors of the NCAA, paying an estimated $35 million annually in exchange for advertising and access to consumer data.[63][64] Capital One also sponsored the EFL Cup, an English Soccer Competition, from 2012 to 2016. The company sponsored Sheffield United F.C. from 2006 to 2008.
Corporate citizenship[edit]
Capital One operates some charitable programs, such as the "No Hassle Giving" web portal, in which Capital One covers the transaction fees on customer and non-customer donations made through the site.[65] The accountability organization National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy has been highly critical of Capital One's relatively low rate of giving, stating that "Capital One's philanthropic track record is dismal".[66] The organization pointed out that Capital One's donations of 0.024% of revenue were much less than the industry median of 0.11% of revenue.[66] Capital One has disputed the groups figures, saying that "... In 2011 alone, our giving totals are more than 6 times greater ($30 million) than the number given by the NCRP".[67]
Criticism and legal actions[edit]
Fines for misleading customers to pay extra for services[edit]
In July 2012, Capital One was fined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for misleading millions of its customers, such as paying extra for payment protection or credit monitoring when they took out a card.[68] The company agreed to pay $210 million to settle the legal action and to refund two million customers.[69] This was the CFPB's first public enforcement action.[70]
Automated dialing to customers' phones[edit]
In August 2014, Capital One and three collection agencies entered into an agreement to pay $75.5 million to end a consolidated class action lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that the companies used an automated dialer to call customers’ cellphones without consent, which is a violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991.[71] It is notable that this legal action involved informational telephone calls, which are not subject to the "prior express written consent" requirements which have been in place for telemarketing calls since October 2013.[72]
2014 amendment to terms of use to allow personal visits[edit]
In 2014, Capital One amended its terms of use to allow it to "contact you in any manner we choose", including a "personal visit . . . at your home and at your place of employment." It also asserted its right to "modify or suppress caller ID and similar services and identify ourselves on these services in any manner we choose."[73] Los Angeles Times writer David Lazarus commented that "Cap One has made deliberate decisions that seem intended to overreach and intimidate, confirming in the eyes of many the company's thoughtlessness and occasional ruthlessness".[74] Emily Rusch, the executive director of the California Public Interest Research Group, found the company's assertion of a right to "spoof" Caller ID particularly disturbing, saying "Now more than ever, consumers need to be able to trust companies".[73]
Capital One spokeswoman Pam Girardo responded that the company would not actually make personal visits to customers except "As a last resort, . . . if it becomes necessary to repossess [a] sports vehicle".[73] Capital One also attributed its assertion of a right to "spoof" as necessary because "sometimes the number is 'displayed differently' by 'some local phone exchanges,' something that is 'beyond our control'".[75]
Girardo told the New York Times that the company was "reviewing" the language involved. David Lazarus noted that "now that a little sunlight has been applied, the company is not as comfortable as it previously was with behaving like a total maniac. In the meantime, cardholders can make up their own minds. Do they want to believe the non-binding explanations of a company representative or the legally enforceable language that's currently in their written contracts?"[73]

Capital One Financial Corporation is a bank holding company specializing in credit cards, home loans, auto loans, banking and savings products headquartered in McLean, Virginia.[2]
Capital One is the eighth-largest commercial bank in the United States when ranked by assets and deposits.[4] and is ranked 9th on the list of largest banks in the United States by total assets. The bank has 755 branches[4] including 18 café style locations[5] and 2,000 ATMs. It is ranked #100 on the Fortune 500,[6] #17 on Fortune's 100 Best Companies to work for list,[7] and conducts business in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.[2] The company helped pioneer the mass marketing of credit cards in the 1990s, and it is one of the largest customers of the United States Postal Service due to its direct mail credit card solicitations.[8] In 2015, it was the 5th largest credit card issuer by purchase volume, after American Express, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup.[9]
Capital One is also the 4th largest bank auto lender, with a market share of 4.2% in 2016.[10]

History[edit]
Monoline credit card company (1994-2004)[edit]




Capital One retail footprint


On July 27, 1994, Richmond, Virginia-based Signet Financial Corp (now part of Wells Fargo) announced the corporate spin-off of its credit card division, OakStone Financial, naming Richard Fairbank as CEO[13] Signet renamed the subsidiary Capital One in October 1994.[14] The spinoff was concluded February 28, 1995, making Capital One fully independent.[15]
At that time, Capital One was a monoline bank, meaning that all of its revenue came from a single product, in this case, credit cards.[16] This strategy is risky in that it can lead to losses during bad times.[16] Capital One attributed its relative success as a monoline to its use of data collection to build demographic profiles, allowing it to target personalized offers of credit direct to consumers.[17]
Capital One commenced operations in Canada in 1996.
Expansion into auto loans (1998-present)[edit]
In July 1998, Capital One acquired auto financing company Summit Acceptance Corporation.[18]
In 1999, Capital One was looking to expand beyond credit cards. CEO Richard Fairbank announced moves to use Capital One's experience with collecting consumer data to offer loans, insurance, and phone service.[19]
In October 2001, PeopleFirst Finance LLC was acquired by Capital One.[20]
The companies were combined and rebranded as Capital One Auto Finance Corporation in 2003.[21]
In late 2002, Capital One and the United States Postal Service proposed a negotiated services agreement for bulk discount in mailing services.[22] The resulting three-year agreement[23] was extended in 2006.[24] In June 2008, however, Capital One had filed a complaint[25] with the USPS regarding the terms of the next agreement,[26] citing the terms of the NSA of Capital One's competitor, Bank of America. Capital One subsequently withdrew its complaint to the Postal Regulatory Commission following a settlement with the USPS.[27]
Onyx Acceptance Corporation was acquired by Capital One in September 2004.
Expansion into retail banking (2005-present)[edit]
While many other monolines were acquired by larger, diverse banks, Capital One expanded into retail banking with a focus on subprime customers.
Capital One acquired New Orleans, Louisiana-based Hibernia National Bank for $4.9 billion in cash and stock in 2005[28] and acquired Melville, New York-based North Fork Bank for $13.2 billion in cash and stock in 2006,[29] which reduced its dependency on credit cards from 90% to 55%.[30]
In 2007, Capital One acquired NetSpend, a marketer of prepaid debit cards, for $700 million.[31]
During the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis, Capital One closed its mortgage platform, GreenPoint Mortgage, due in part to investor pressures.[32][33][34]
In 2008, Capital One received an investment of US$3.56 billion from the United States Treasury as a result of the Troubled Asset Relief Program.[35][36] On June 17, 2009, Capital One completed the repurchase of the stock the company issued to the U.S. Treasury paying a total of US$3.67 billion, resulting in a profit of over $100 million to the U.S. Treasury.[37]
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission criticized Capital One's conduct during the crisis, claiming that the understated auto loan losses during the financial crisis of 2007-2008. In 2013, Capital One paid $3.5 million to settle the case, but was not required to directly address the allegations of wrongdoing.[38]
In February 2009, Capital One acquired Chevy Chase Bank for $520 million in cash and stock.[39][40][41][42]
In June 2011, ING Group announced the sale of its ING Direct division to Capital One for US$9 billion in cash and stock.[43] On August 26, 2011, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors announced it would hold public hearings on the Capital One acquisition of ING Direct, and extend to October 12, 2011, the public comment period that had been scheduled to end August 22.[44] The move came amidst rising scrutiny of the deal on systemic risk, or "Too-Big-to-Fail," performance under the Community Reinvestment Act, and pending legal challenges. A coalition of national civil rights and consumer groups, led by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, were joined by Rep. Barney Frank to challenge immediate approval of the deal. The groups have argued that the acquisition is a test of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, under which systemically risky firms must demonstrate a public benefit that outweighs new risk before they are allowed to grow. Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank head Thomas M. Hoenig was also skeptical of the deal.[45][46] In February 2012, the acquisition was approved by regulators and Capital One completed its acquisition of ING Direct.[47] Capital One received permission to merge ING into its business in October 2012,[48] and rebranded ING Direct as Capital One 360 in November 2012.[49]
In August 2011, Capital One reached a deal with HSBC to acquire its U.S. credit card operations.[50] Capital One paid US$31.3 billion in exchange for US$28.2 billion in loans and $600 million in other assets. The acquisition was completed by May 2012.[51]
On February 26, 2012, along with several other banks, Capital One announced support for the Isis Mobile Wallet payment system.[52] However, in September 2013, Capital One dropped support for the venture.[53]
In 2012, Capital One closed 41 branch locations.[54]
In 2015, Capital One closed 186 branch locations.[55]
On February 19, 2014, Capital One became a 25% owner in ClearXchange, a P2P (person to person) money transfer service designed to make money transfers to customers within the same bank and other financial institutions via mobile phone number or email address.[56] ClearXchange was sold to Early Warning in 2016.[57]
In January 2015, Capital One acquired Level Money, a budgeting app for consumers.[58]
On July 8, 2015, Capital announced that it has acquired Monsoon, a design studio, development shop, marketing house and strategic consultancy.[59]
In 2015, Capital One acquired General Electric's Healthcare Financial Services unit, which included $8.5 billion in loans made to businesses in the healthcare industry, for $9-billion.[60]
In October 2016, Capital One acquired Paribus, a price tracking service, for an undisclosed amount.[61][62]
Sports marketing[edit]
Since 2001, Capital One has been the principal sponsor of the college football Florida Citrus Bowl, which has been called the Capital One Bowl since 2003. It sponsors a mascot challenge every year, announcing the winner on the day of the Capital One Bowl. Capital One is one of the top three sponsors of the NCAA, paying an estimated $35 million annually in exchange for advertising and access to consumer data.[63][64] Capital One also sponsored the EFL Cup, an English Soccer Competition, from 2012 to 2016. The company sponsored Sheffield United F.C. from 2006 to 2008.
Corporate citizenship[edit]
Capital One operates some charitable programs, such as the "No Hassle Giving" web portal, in which Capital One covers the transaction fees on customer and non-customer donations made through the site.[65] The accountability organization National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy has been highly critical of Capital One's relatively low rate of giving, stating that "Capital One's philanthropic track record is dismal".[66] The organization pointed out that Capital One's donations of 0.024% of revenue were much less than the industry median of 0.11% of revenue.[66] Capital One has disputed the groups figures, saying that "... In 2011 alone, our giving totals are more than 6 times greater ($30 million) than the number given by the NCRP".[67]
Criticism and legal actions[edit]
Fines for misleading customers to pay extra for services[edit]
In July 2012, Capital One was fined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for misleading millions of its customers, such as paying extra for payment protection or credit monitoring when they took out a card.[68] The company agreed to pay $210 million to settle the legal action and to refund two million customers.[69] This was the CFPB's first public enforcement action.[70]
Automated dialing to customers' phones[edit]
In August 2014, Capital One and three collection agencies entered into an agreement to pay $75.5 million to end a consolidated class action lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that the companies used an automated dialer to call customers’ cellphones without consent, which is a violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991.[71] It is notable that this legal action involved informational telephone calls, which are not subject to the "prior express written consent" requirements which have been in place for telemarketing calls since October 2013.[72]
2014 amendment to terms of use to allow personal visits[edit]
In 2014, Capital One amended its terms of use to allow it to "contact you in any manner we choose", including a "personal visit . . . at your home and at your place of employment." It also asserted its right to "modify or suppress caller ID and similar services and identify ourselves on these services in any manner we choose."[73] Los Angeles Times writer David Lazarus commented that "Cap One has made deliberate decisions that seem intended to overreach and intimidate, confirming in the eyes of many the company's thoughtlessness and occasional ruthlessness".[74] Emily Rusch, the executive director of the California Public Interest Research Group, found the company's assertion of a right to "spoof" Caller ID particularly disturbing, saying "Now more than ever, consumers need to be able to trust companies".[73]
Capital One spokeswoman Pam Girardo responded that the company would not actually make personal visits to customers except "As a last resort, . . . if it becomes necessary to repossess [a] sports vehicle".[73] Capital One also attributed its assertion of a right to "spoof" as necessary because "sometimes the number is 'displayed differently' by 'some local phone exchanges,' something that is 'beyond our control'".[75]
Girardo told the New York Times that the company was "reviewing" the language involved. David Lazarus noted that "now that a little sunlight has been applied, the company is not as comfortable as it previously was with behaving like a total maniac. In the meantime, cardholders can make up their own minds. Do they want to believe the non-binding explanations of a company representative or the legally enforceable language that's currently in their written contracts?"[73]

Capital One Bank in Wake Village, Texas


Capital One Financial Corporation is a bank holding company specializing in credit cards, home loans, auto loans, banking and savings products headquartered in McLean, Virginia.[2]
Capital One is the eighth-largest commercial bank in the United States when ranked by assets and deposits.[4] and is ranked 9th on the list of largest banks in the United States by total assets. The bank has 755 branches[4] including 18 café style locations[5] and 2,000 ATMs. It is ranked #100 on the Fortune 500,[6] #17 on Fortune's 100 Best Companies to work for list,[7] and conducts business in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.[2] The company helped pioneer the mass marketing of credit cards in the 1990s, and it is one of the largest customers of the United States Postal Service due to its direct mail credit card solicitations.[8] In 2015, it was the 5th largest credit card issuer by purchase volume, after American Express, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup.[9]
Capital One is also the 4th largest bank auto lender, with a market share of 4.2% in 2016.[10]
In 2016, 62% of the company's revenues were from credit cards, 26% was from consumer banking, 11% was from commercial banking, and 1% was from other.[2]

As of December 31, 2016, after JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, Capital One was the 3rd largest credit card issuer, with an outstanding receivables balance of $91 billion, representing 12.1% of the total outstanding credit card receivable balance in the United States.[11] As of December 31, 2016, Capital One had a total of $97 billion in credit card loans outstanding in the United States and $8 billion of credit card loans outstanding in Canada and the United Kingdom.[2]

History[edit]
Monoline credit card company (1994-2004)[edit]




Capital One retail footprint


On July 27, 1994, Richmond, Virginia-based Signet Financial Corp (now part of Wells Fargo) announced the corporate spin-off of its credit card division, OakStone Financial, naming Richard Fairbank as CEO[13] Signet renamed the subsidiary Capital One in October 1994.[14] The spinoff was concluded February 28, 1995, making Capital One fully independent.[15]
At that time, Capital One was a monoline bank, meaning that all of its revenue came from a single product, in this case, credit cards.[16] This strategy is risky in that it can lead to losses during bad times.[16] Capital One attributed its relative success as a monoline to its use of data collection to build demographic profiles, allowing it to target personalized offers of credit direct to consumers.[17]
Capital One commenced operations in Canada in 1996.
Expansion into auto loans (1998-present)[edit]
In July 1998, Capital One acquired auto financing company Summit Acceptance Corporation.[18]
In 1999, Capital One was looking to expand beyond credit cards. CEO Richard Fairbank announced moves to use Capital One's experience with collecting consumer data to offer loans, insurance, and phone service.[19]
In October 2001, PeopleFirst Finance LLC was acquired by Capital One.[20]
The companies were combined and rebranded as Capital One Auto Finance Corporation in 2003.[21]
In late 2002, Capital One and the United States Postal Service proposed a negotiated services agreement for bulk discount in mailing services.[22] The resulting three-year agreement[23] was extended in 2006.[24] In June 2008, however, Capital One had filed a complaint[25] with the USPS regarding the terms of the next agreement,[26] citing the terms of the NSA of Capital One's competitor, Bank of America. Capital One subsequently withdrew its complaint to the Postal Regulatory Commission following a settlement with the USPS.[27]
Onyx Acceptance Corporation was acquired by Capital One in September 2004.
Expansion into retail banking (2005-present)[edit]
While many other monolines were acquired by larger, diverse banks, Capital One expanded into retail banking with a focus on subprime customers.
Capital One acquired New Orleans, Louisiana-based Hibernia National Bank for $4.9 billion in cash and stock in 2005[28] and acquired Melville, New York-based North Fork Bank for $13.2 billion in cash and stock in 2006,[29] which reduced its dependency on credit cards from 90% to 55%.[30]
In 2007, Capital One acquired NetSpend, a marketer of prepaid debit cards, for $700 million.[31]
During the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis, Capital One closed its mortgage platform, GreenPoint Mortgage, due in part to investor pressures.[32][33][34]
In 2008, Capital One received an investment of US$3.56 billion from the United States Treasury as a result of the Troubled Asset Relief Program.[35][36] On June 17, 2009, Capital One completed the repurchase of the stock the company issued to the U.S. Treasury paying a total of US$3.67 billion, resulting in a profit of over $100 million to the U.S. Treasury.[37]
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission criticized Capital One's conduct during the crisis, claiming that the understated auto loan losses during the financial crisis of 2007-2008. In 2013, Capital One paid $3.5 million to settle the case, but was not required to directly address the allegations of wrongdoing.[38]
In February 2009, Capital One acquired Chevy Chase Bank for $520 million in cash and stock.[39][40][41][42]
In June 2011, ING Group announced the sale of its ING Direct division to Capital One for US$9 billion in cash and stock.[43] On August 26, 2011, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors announced it would hold public hearings on the Capital One acquisition of ING Direct, and extend to October 12, 2011, the public comment period that had been scheduled to end August 22.[44] The move came amidst rising scrutiny of the deal on systemic risk, or "Too-Big-to-Fail," performance under the Community Reinvestment Act, and pending legal challenges. A coalition of national civil rights and consumer groups, led by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, were joined by Rep. Barney Frank to challenge immediate approval of the deal. The groups have argued that the acquisition is a test of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, under which systemically risky firms must demonstrate a public benefit that outweighs new risk before they are allowed to grow. Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank head Thomas M. Hoenig was also skeptical of the deal.[45][46] In February 2012, the acquisition was approved by regulators and Capital One completed its acquisition of ING Direct.[47] Capital One received permission to merge ING into its business in October 2012,[48] and rebranded ING Direct as Capital One 360 in November 2012.[49]
In August 2011, Capital One reached a deal with HSBC to acquire its U.S. credit card operations.[50] Capital One paid US$31.3 billion in exchange for US$28.2 billion in loans and $600 million in other assets. The acquisition was completed by May 2012.[51]
On February 26, 2012, along with several other banks, Capital One announced support for the Isis Mobile Wallet payment system.[52] However, in September 2013, Capital One dropped support for the venture.[53]
In 2012, Capital One closed 41 branch locations.[54]
In 2015, Capital One closed 186 branch locations.[55]
On February 19, 2014, Capital One became a 25% owner in ClearXchange, a P2P (person to person) money transfer service designed to make money transfers to customers within the same bank and other financial institutions via mobile phone number or email address.[56] ClearXchange was sold to Early Warning in 2016.[57]
In January 2015, Capital One acquired Level Money, a budgeting app for consumers.[58]
On July 8, 2015, Capital announced that it has acquired Monsoon, a design studio, development shop, marketing house and strategic consultancy.[59]
In 2015, Capital One acquired General Electric's Healthcare Financial Services unit, which included $8.5 billion in loans made to businesses in the healthcare industry, for $9-billion.[60]
In October 2016, Capital One acquired Paribus, a price tracking service, for an undisclosed amount.[61][62]
Sports marketing[edit]
Since 2001, Capital One has been the principal sponsor of the college football Florida Citrus Bowl, which has been called the Capital One Bowl since 2003. It sponsors a mascot challenge every year, announcing the winner on the day of the Capital One Bowl. Capital One is one of the top three sponsors of the NCAA, paying an estimated $35 million annually in exchange for advertising and access to consumer data.[63][64] Capital One also sponsored the EFL Cup, an English Soccer Competition, from 2012 to 2016. The company sponsored Sheffield United F.C. from 2006 to 2008.
Corporate citizenship[edit]
Capital One operates some charitable programs, such as the "No Hassle Giving" web portal, in which Capital One covers the transaction fees on customer and non-customer donations made through the site.[65] The accountability organization National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy has been highly critical of Capital One's relatively low rate of giving, stating that "Capital One's philanthropic track record is dismal".[66] The organization pointed out that Capital One's donations of 0.024% of revenue were much less than the industry median of 0.11% of revenue.[66] Capital One has disputed the groups figures, saying that "... In 2011 alone, our giving totals are more than 6 times greater ($30 million) than the number given by the NCRP".[67]
Criticism and legal actions[edit]
Fines for misleading customers to pay extra for services[edit]
In July 2012, Capital One was fined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for misleading millions of its customers, such as paying extra for payment protection or credit monitoring when they took out a card.[68] The company agreed to pay $210 million to settle the legal action and to refund two million customers.[69] This was the CFPB's first public enforcement action.[70]
Automated dialing to customers' phones[edit]
In August 2014, Capital One and three collection agencies entered into an agreement to pay $75.5 million to end a consolidated class action lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that the companies used an automated dialer to call customers’ cellphones without consent, which is a violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991.[71] It is notable that this legal action involved informational telephone calls, which are not subject to the "prior express written consent" requirements which have been in place for telemarketing calls since October 2013.[72]
2014 amendment to terms of use to allow personal visits[edit]
In 2014, Capital One amended its terms of use to allow it to "contact you in any manner we choose", including a "personal visit . . . at your home and at your place of employment." It also asserted its right to "modify or suppress caller ID and similar services and identify ourselves on these services in any manner we choose."[73] Los Angeles Times writer David Lazarus commented that "Cap One has made deliberate decisions that seem intended to overreach and intimidate, confirming in the eyes of many the company's thoughtlessness and occasional ruthlessness".[74] Emily Rusch, the executive director of the California Public Interest Research Group, found the company's assertion of a right to "spoof" Caller ID particularly disturbing, saying "Now more than ever, consumers need to be able to trust companies".[73]
Capital One spokeswoman Pam Girardo responded that the company would not actually make personal visits to customers except "As a last resort, . . . if it becomes necessary to repossess [a] sports vehicle".[73] Capital One also attributed its assertion of a right to "spoof" as necessary because "sometimes the number is 'displayed differently' by 'some local phone exchanges,' something that is 'beyond our control'".[75]
Girardo told the New York Times that the company was "reviewing" the language involved. David Lazarus noted that "now that a little sunlight has been applied, the company is not as comfortable as it previously was with behaving like a total maniac. In the meantime, cardholders can make up their own minds. Do they want to believe the non-binding explanations of a company representative or the legally enforceable language that's currently in their written contracts?"[73]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
