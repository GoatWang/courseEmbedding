Robert W. "Bob" Agnew


Obituary
Condolences


































 Agnew, Robert W. "Bob"  Born December 18th, 1931 in Boston Mass, longtime resident of Garden Grove, CA passed away peacefully on February 5, 2011 from pneumonia. He leaves a very close and loving family, his two stepsons Gary Mucha and Robert Mucha and his wife Michelle Mucha, his four grand-daughters, Heidi, Kristina, Terra and her husband, Mike Carrillo and Brittany Mucha. He also leaves behind three great grand-children, Jackson, Carter, and Emma. "Bob" reunites with his wife, Judy Agnew who passed away before him. Bob was a retired Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant who served his country for 29 years and through two wars. The Marine Corps was his heart and soul and he truly lived the code of Semper Fidelis. After his retirement from the Marine Corps he embraced civilian life and retired with the Fountain Valley School district. He also worked many years at the Anaheim Stadium with his wife Judy Agnew. Bob was dearly loved by all his family and friends and will remain in our hearts and memory forever. Services: Viewing: 10am -11am Thursday February 10th, 2011 at Shannon-Bryan Mortuary 137 E. Maple Orange, CA 92866 Chapels Services immediately after at Shannon Bryan Mortuary Internment to follow services at Magnolia Memorial Park 12241 Magnolia Street Garden Grove, CA 92841.
