Glastonbury: A Pilgrim's Companion




View larger image (+)


                            By Baldwin, David (Author)
$6.95 AUD

Glastonbury is the oldest Marian Shrine north of the Alps. It is a place of myth, mystique, legend, tradition and faith, which, for many reasons, has a high profile in Britain and abroad and to where many head, seeking truth. Arguably, after Walsingham, it is the second most prominent Marian shrine in England and Wales.
This handy booklet provides the perfect companion for pilgrims and seekers whether heading for Glastonbury, or just curious about his intriguing place. It gives a thorough account of the ‘Glastonbury story’ from earliest days, along with its great Abbey, the current Shrine, the landmark Tor, and other places of interest. Accompanying these is the narrative for each place, and at the heart of the booklet are suitable prayers and meditations.
About the author
David Baldwin, a retired Royal Marines officer, lives in the south of England and has written several CTS pilgrims’ companions.

Baldwin Hardware Manufacturing FactsBaldwin's superior quality is derived from a fusion of quality materials and expert craftsmanship. See below for facts about the materials and process followed to manufacture a single piece of Baldwin hardware. 100,000 lbs of brass is received at the Baldwin manufacturing facility from local foundries per weekBrass billets are heated to 1300 degrees before forging.200 tons of force forms brass billets into Baldwin hardware.30 people will work on a single Baldwin piece on average.All heavy gauge steel lock mechanisms are coated with a rust resistant compound.

Baldwin Brass ManufacturingBaldwin uses brass for its door hardware due to its durability, strength, and appearance. You only need to hold a solid brass Baldwin product to feel the quality and durability. Brass is heavier, stronger, and provides smoother operation compared to steel or aluminum door hardware. Baldwin is forged, not cast, so it is denser and heavier. Solid brass arrives at the Baldwin manufacturing facility in bars where it is super heated and forged by expert craftsman into its final shape. It is then trimmed and polished with extreme detail. Resulting in a very high quality piece of hardware. Baldwin is committed to providing quality door hardware, thus brass will be their material for as long as they are around.








Baldwin Luxurious FinishesBaldwin hardwares product line is extensive and now offers up to 22 unique finishes. This kind of selection allows customers to pick the exact style they are looking for, from contemporary and modern to rustic and classic. Each finish has its own manufacturer technique, of which Baldwin has nearly perfected. Chrome, Nickel, and Bronze are created with up to 30 layers of metal plating over solid brass for maximum durability.Living Finishes are aged 6 to 12 months and will continually change over time to reveal a classic vintage feel.

	For the most reliable and long lasting finish, choose a piece with Baldwin's Lifetime PVD finish. PVD stands for physical vapor deposition, which offers a superior quality, especially in coastal areas. The creation process includes adding a formula of layered nickel alloys to protect against aging and to provide high levels of resistance to corrosion from air with high salt. Baldwin pioneered the Lifetime PVD finishes for decorative hardware. Baldwin is the only manufacturer that has lifetime finishes in Satin and Polished Nickel.

Handing



X

Handing is a term used to describe which way a door handle turns. To
    determine the handing of a door, stand on the outside of the room you are
    going to enter. For example, if you are entering your house, stand outside
    the house entirely; if you are considering your bathroom door, stand in the
    room that connects to the bathroom. Face the door. Notice which side the
    hinges are on.

Left handing - The hinges are on the left
Right handing - The hinges are on the right

Door Thickness

Door Thickness




Most interior doors are 1-3/8 inches
            thick, while most exterior doors measure 1-3/4 inches. If your door
            is thicker than this, you may need an
            additional component known as a 'thick door kit.'

Backset

Backset




The backset describes the length of
            the latch itself. To determine this, start at the edge of the door
            and measure out to the center of the borehole drilled in your
            door.

Center to Center
Center to Center is the measurement from the center of the top bore hole to the center of the bottom bore hole. Most commonly this measurement is 5-1/2". If your door has an uncommon center to center, consider a Sectional Handleset which will work on any Center to Center.

Handing



X
Handing

Handing is a term used to describe which way a door handle turns. To
    determine the handing of a door, stand on the outside of the room you are
    going to enter. For example, if you are entering your house, stand outside
    the house entirely; if you are considering your bathroom door, stand in the
    room that connects to the bathroom. Face the door. Notice which side the
    hinges are on.


Door Swings Inward

Left handing - The hinges are on the left
Right handing - The hinges are on the right




Door Swings Outward

Left hand reverse - The hinges are on the left
Right hand reverse - The hinges are on the right

Solid Construction



X
Solid Construction


Solid Construction is used to describe products composed entirely from a premium material like brass, stainless steel or bronze, and manufactured as one solid piece, with no hollow spaces or interior gaps. Representing a significant increase in quality, these products are typically more expensive than both their hollow counterparts and those that use lesser metals like zinc or aluminum. Heavier, more durable, and often times naturally corrosion resistant, they are made to last a lifetime and the difference is noticeable.

28 Degree Latch



X
28 Degree Latch
A 28 Degree Latch requires less rotation than a standard latch, fully retracting at 28 degrees. This provides smoother operation and a more ergonomic feel when turning the handle.








										28 Degree Latch

Concealed Screws



X
Concealed Screws
On many knobs and levers, the screws that mount the hardware on the door are visible on the interior. Concealed Screws means that these screws are hidden behind the rosette, providing a cleaner more decorative look to your door hardware.

Solid Construction



X
Solid Construction


Solid Construction is used to describe products composed entirely from a premium material like brass, stainless steel or bronze, and manufactured as one solid piece, with no hollow spaces or interior gaps. Representing a significant increase in quality, these products are typically more expensive than both their hollow counterparts and those that use lesser metals like zinc or aluminum. Heavier, more durable, and often times naturally corrosion resistant, they are made to last a lifetime and the difference is noticeable.

Concealed Screws

Concealed Screws
On many knobs and levers, the screws that mount the hardware on the door are visible on the interior. Concealed Screws means that these screws are hidden behind the rosette, providing a cleaner more decorative look to your door hardware.

28 Degree Latch



X
28 Degree Latch
A 28 Degree Latch requires less rotation than a standard latch, fully retracting at 28 degrees. This provides smoother operation and a more ergonomic feel when turning the handle.

Door Thickness

Door Thickness




Most interior doors are 1-3/8 inches
            thick, while most exterior doors measure 1-3/4 inches. If your door
            is thicker than this, you may need an
            additional component known as a 'thick door kit.'

Backset




The backset describes the length of
            the latch itself. To determine this, start at the edge of the door
            and measure out to the center of the borehole drilled in your
            door.
