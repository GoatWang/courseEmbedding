Company Overview

Considering peers, relative underperformance over the last year and the last month suggest a lagging position.


Icahn Enterprises L.P. trades at a lower Price/Book multiple (0.94) than its peer median (3.95).


IEP-US looks challenged given its below median EBITDA-based returns and the market’s low expectations of its growth.


IEP-US‘s relatively low net margins and poor asset turns suggest a problematic operating strategy.


Compared with its chosen peers, the company’s annual revenues and earnings change at a slower rate, implying a lack of strategic focus and/or lack of execution success.


IEP-US‘s return on assets currently and over the past five years has trailed the peer median and suggests the company might be operationally challenged relative to its peers.


The company’s relatively low gross and pre-tax margins suggest a non-differentiated product portfolio and not much control on operating costs relative to peers.


IEP-US‘s revenues have grown more slowly than the peer median over the last few years, which combined with the stock price’s relatively low Price/EBITDA ratio suggests substandard growth expectations relative to peers.


The company seems to be over-investing in a business with median returns.


IEP-US seems too levered to raise additional debt.

Leverage & Liquidity
IEP-US would seem to have a hard time raising additional debt.

With debt at a relatively high 96.56% of its enterprise value compared to an overall benchmark of 25% (Note: The peer median is currently 16.63%), and relatively tight interest coverage level of 0.61x, IEP-US would have a hard time raising much additional debt. The company has a Constrained profile in terms of its ability to take on further debt.


All 4 peers for the company have an outstanding debt balance.

IEP-US has maintained its Limited Flexibility profile from the recent year-end.

IEP-US‘s interest coverage is its lowest relative to the last five years and compares to a high of 5.77x in 2011.


Compared to 2015, interest coverage has remained relatively stable for both the company (0.61x) and the peer median (13.25x).


IEP-US‘s debt-EV has declined 60.21 percentage points from last year’s high but remains above its five-year average debt-EV of 42.24.


While its debt-EV decreased to 96.56% from 156.77% (in 2015), its peer median increased during this period to 16.63% from 10.97%.


Relative to peers, debt-EV fell 65.86 percentage points. Unlike the peer median, it is also above the 25% leverage benchmark.
