FRANKLIN LAKES, N.J., Mar 14, 2003 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE:BDX) has announced the appointment of Vincent A. Forlenza, 49, to the position of President, BD Biosciences, effective immediately. Mr. Forlenza, who joined BD in 1980, had served most recently as the Company's Senior Vice President, Technology, Strategy and Development. He will succeed Deborah J. Neff, who is leaving BD to pursue other career opportunities. 

"Vince Forlenza is unquestionably one of this Company's most innovative, productive and accomplished leaders," said Edward J. Ludwig, BD Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "These qualities have been best reflected in his recent work in the development of the Company's corporate strategy, as well as the role he played in enhancing the capabilities and performance at our R&D organization, BD Technologies. Both have been critical in terms of improving the Company's current and longer-term performance." 


BD Biosciences is one of the Company's three business segments. With worldwide reported revenues of $645 million in fiscal 2002, BD Biosciences is one of the world's largest businesses serving the life sciences. In his new position, Mr. Forlenza will lead an organization that provides a comprehensive portfolio of tools, reagents and services that are used by clinicians and researchers in the fields of genomics, proteomics, drug discovery and development, oncology and immune function. 


Since joining BD, Mr. Forlenza has held various positions of increasing responsibility in the United States and Europe. Of note, he served four years as President of BD Diagnostic Systems, a worldwide business focused on developing and marketing infectious disease diagnostic platforms. During this assignment Mr. Forlenza was instrumental in the early development of two significant new infectious disease diagnostics systems, BD ProbeTec™ ET and BD Phoenix™. In addition to his new responsibilities with BD Biosciences, Mr. Forlenza will continue to lead BD Technologies. 


Mr. Forlenza holds a BS in Chemical Engineering from Lehigh University and a MBA from the Wharton Graduate School, University of Pennsylvania. 


BD is a medical technology company that serves healthcare institutions, life science researchers, clinical laboratories, industry and the general public. BD manufactures and sells a broad range of medical supplies, devices, laboratory equipment and diagnostic products. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002, BD reported total revenues of $4.033 billion. 


This press release may contain certain forward-looking statements (as defined under Federal securities laws) regarding BD's performance, including future revenues, products and income, or events or developments that BD expects to occur or anticipates occurring in the future. All such statements are based upon current expectations of BD and involve a number of business risks and uncertainties. Actual results could vary materially from anticipated results described, implied or projected in any forward-looking statement. Factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from any forward-looking statement include, but are not limited to: competitive factors; pricing and market share pressures; uncertainties of litigation; BD's ability to achieve sales and earnings forecasts, which are based on sales volume and product mix assumptions, to achieve its cost savings objectives, and to achieve anticipated synergies and other cost savings in connection with acquisitions; changes in regional, national or foreign economic conditions; increases in energy costs; fluctuations in costs and availability of raw materials and in BD's ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships; changes in interest or foreign currency exchange rates; delays in product introductions; and changes in health care or other governmental regulation, as well as other factors discussed in this press release and in BD's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not intend to update any forward-looking statements.

Ellen and Vincent A. Forlenza, Jr. 1975












  
  
  









Vincent and Ellen Forlenza fundamentally believe that support for research and educational innovation is a critical success factor for Lehigh. This style of forward thinking inspired them to establish the Ellen and Vincent A. Forlenza ’75 Endowed Fund for research, faculty and programs within the health and healthcare initiative at the P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Science (RCEAS).
The Forlenza’s also support many Lehigh initiatives within RCEAS and have contributed to other important projects including the construction of the STEPS facility. They are members of the Asa Packer Society and the Tower Society, Lehigh’s leadership giving societies.
Vincent’s leadership extends beyond his philanthropy. He is a member of Lehigh’s Board of Trustees where he serves on the Campus Planning and Operations and the Global Affairs committees. Additionally, he served as a member of the P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Science Dean’s Advisory Council for nine years.
Vincent is Chairman, CEO and President of Becton Dickinson and Co. (BD), a leading global medical device, diagnostics and life science research products company.   Vince joined BD in 1980.  He has served in multiple business and functional leadership roles during his career, including several years living in France.  Vincent also serves as Chairman of AdvaMed, the industry association representing manufacturers of medical devices and diagnostic tests.
Vincent earned his bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering from Lehigh in 1975 and his master’s degree from The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1980. While at Lehigh, he was a member of the men’s basketball team, the Newman Association, Delta Chi, and the American Institute for Chemical Engineers.
Ellen is a graduate of Skidmore College where she studied business. She is highly involved with the Quest Foundation, an organization that provides opportunities for young adults with autism.
The Forlenza’s live in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, and have two daughters, Joy and Corie.

Vincent "The Jew" Forlenza is a fictional character in Mario Puzo's novel The Godfather and Mark Winegardner's sequel The Godfather Returns.[1]
In The Godfather[edit]
Forlenza is the Mafia boss of Cleveland. The Godfather establishes that the Forlenza crime family has many high-ranking Jewish associates, something rare in Mafia families — hence the Don's derisive nickname. His organization is the most powerful of strictly gambling-based crime families in the U.S.
In The Godfather Returns[edit]
Vincent Forlenza is a minor character in The Godfather, but one of the main antagonists of The Godfather Returns. The latter novel established his backstory; he is an immigrant from Sicily who establishes himself in the underworld by running numbers for other gangsters, and then killing them and assuming their territories. By the 1940s he is a force to be reckoned with, quietly expanding his empire throughout Ohio until no one stands in his way.
At around this time he employs Fausto Geraci, Sr. as a driver/associate and becomes godfather to his son, Nick.
In 1957, he conspires with Nick Geraci to kill Sal Narducci, Michael Corleone and Hyman Roth, thereby weakening the Corleone family's gambling operation in Cuba, and strengthening the Chicago mob. Geraci personally executes Narducci while he is in hiding in Rome.
In 1961, Michael learns of Forlenza's plan and devises one of his own to kill him. As part of a sweeping revenge, when Forlenza has a heart attack at his home, Michael sends a fake ambulance to pick him up. The ambulance then drives him to the Cleveland docks, where Michael's men chain Forlenza to an old tugboat boat and sink it to the bottom of Lake Erie.
Forlenza is succeeded by his former caporegime, Frank "The Greek" Greco.
