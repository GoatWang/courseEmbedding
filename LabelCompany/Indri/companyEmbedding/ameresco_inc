George P. Sakellaris, P.E. - Ameresco























































 
LinkedinYoutube 






George P. Sakellaris, P.E.
President and Chief Executive Officer

Mr. Sakellaris is the President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Ameresco, Inc. (NYSE:AMRC), a leading energy efficiency and renewable energy company headquartered in Framingham, MA.
A visionary and entrepreneur, Mr. Sakellaris founded Ameresco in April 2000. He aspired to build an entirely product-neutral and supplier-independent energy company that had the skills, capabilities and foresight to create independent energy solutions that went beyond just conservation; one that addressed a customer’s entire energy stream including supply and demand, energy efficiency and renewable energy.
Early in his career, Mr. Sakellaris worked at the utility New England Electric System (NEES), where he welcomed the challenge to establish NEES Energy, a company that would promote energy efficiency, thereby avoiding the need to build new power generation plants. Mr. Sakellaris then purchased the business known as NEES Energy in 1991 and renamed it NORESCO. He built NORESCO into an industry-leading independent energy services company before selling it to Equitable Resources in 1997, where he continued to lead NORESCO and was also appointed as a Senior Vice President of Equitable Resources (NYSE:EQT), a Fortune 500 Energy Company.
Today, Mr. Sakellaris leads Ameresco, a public company, employing over 1,000. Ameresco continues to grow and thrive, and currently supports more than 70 local offices throughout North America and the United Kingdom.
For more than 30 years Mr. Sakellaris has persevered in the energy industry, working to eliminate regulatory barriers to investing private capital into energy efficiency and renewable initiatives. Mr. Sakellaris’ dedication and influence in promoting energy efficiency dates back to his involvement with the Electrical Power Research Institute (EPRI) where he championed the development of demand side management (DSM) programs that were widely implemented across the country. Additionally, he was a founding member of the National Association of Energy Service Companies (NAESCO) where he served as the first president and advocated for the new industry. He remains an active NAESCO member today.
Mr. Sakellaris earned both M.B.A and M.S.E.E. degrees from Northeastern University and a B.S.E.E. degree from the University of Maine – Orono. In May 2012, the University of Maine granted him an Honorary Doctorate for his lifetime of achievements, recognizing his dedication and exemplary leadership in the field of energy efficiency and renewable energy. In May 2017, the University of Maine honored Mr. Sakellaris with his induction as a Hall of Fame Member of the Francis Crowe Society.
In 2016, CIO Review recognized Mr. Sakellaris with the selection of Ameresco as one of the 20 Most Promising Energy Technology Solutions Providers. Mr. Sakellaris was the recipient of the 2015 Finance Monthly CEO Award, Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year 2011 New England, Energy, Cleantech & Natural Resources Award. In 2012, he was named the Worcester Business Journal’s Business Leader of the Year for large businesses and honored by The Boston Globe for Ameresco’s Globe-100 Top-performing Public Companies #29 ranking. The Boston Business Journal ranked Ameresco #31 in the Area’s Fastest Growing Public Companies and #49 in Massachusetts’ 150 Top Public Companies. In 2011, Ameresco was honored on the Forbes 100 list as one of America’s Best Small Companies and in 2010, as the New England Clean Energy Council Employer of the Year.

Budget Neutral Energy Infrastructure Upgrades | Ameresco



















































 
LinkedinYoutube 







Budget-Neutral Infrastructure Upgrades

Budget-neutral infrastructure upgrades provided by Ameresco’s energy services specialists answer the question of how to manage aging facility and municipal energy systems when political or financial pressures put capital out of reach. Newer energy systems are more efficient, which means the budget currently allocated for utility payments can be used to replace or retrofit existing infrastructure. Lower annual energy costs provide the budget for the energy retrofit.

Ameresco’s comprehensive energy solutions range from boiler and chiller replacements to full facility development. Phased energy efficient retrofits do not interfere with daily operations during the facility upgrade. Our experienced team of engineers has helped business customers achieve savings of 10% to 35% at the facility level, and up to 65% at the process level. We also offer the solutions and personnel training needed to help commercial and government customers comply with zero net energy initiatives.

The Zero Net Energy Future
Combining energy efficiency with on-site power generation, zero net energy buildings produce as much energy as they consume. These buildings can operate off the energy grid, and they generate enough of their own power to offset carbon emissions used in energy production.
Buildings consume 40% of the energy used in the United States annually. Several states, most notably California, have adopted strict new commercial building guidelines that make zero net energy construction and energy efficient retrofits not just desirable, but necessary.
Incentives are available to offset development costs, through state and federal grants and through utility rebate programs and demand-based reimbursements. As a recognized leader in energy retrofits, Ameresco has the experience and expertise to develop enterprise-wide zero net energy solutions and uncover additional sources of revenue to finance building and infrastructure development.
Case Studies


Community College of Rhode Island
As part of a budget-neutral series of efficiency improvements, Ameresco helped CCRI capture $500,000 in utility rebates.




City of Englewood
A Solar PPA was part of a program that allowed Englewood, Colorado to improve infrastructure at four city-owned facilities.




City of Lowell
Reductions in energy costs funded through an ESPC provided enough budget for the city to hire a new City Manager.

Our experienced team of engineers has helped business customers achieve savings of 10% to 35% at the facility level, and up to 65% at the process level. We also offer the solutions and personnel training needed to help commercial and government customers comply with zero net energy initiatives.

The Zero Net Energy Future
Combining energy efficiency with on-site power generation, zero net energy buildings produce as much energy as they consume. These buildings can operate off the energy grid, and they generate enough of their own power to offset carbon emissions used in energy production.
Buildings consume 40% of the energy used in the United States annually. Several states, most notably California, have adopted strict new commercial building guidelines that make zero net energy construction and energy efficient retrofits not just desirable, but necessary.
Incentives are available to offset development costs, through state and federal grants and through utility rebate programs and demand-based reimbursements. As a recognized leader in energy retrofits, Ameresco has the experience and expertise to develop enterprise-wide zero net energy solutions and uncover additional sources of revenue to finance building and infrastructure development.
Case Studies


Community College of Rhode Island
As part of a budget-neutral series of efficiency improvements, Ameresco helped CCRI capture $500,000 in utility rebates.




City of Englewood
A Solar PPA was part of a program that allowed Englewood, Colorado to improve infrastructure at four city-owned facilities.




City of Lowell
Reductions in energy costs funded through an ESPC provided enough budget for the city to hire a new City Manager.

State and Municipal LED Street and Area Lighting | Ameresco



















































 
LinkedinYoutube 








LED Street and Area Lighting

LED technology is revolutionizing street and area lighting, offering energy savings of 50%-60% or more, extremely long life and reduced maintenance costs, and, most important: improved lighting.  Municipalities, state transportation departments, ports, prisons and others are turning to LED technology for street, roadway, parking lot, high mast, bridge, tunnel and general area lighting.

“The increased efficiency and decreased long-term operating cost that LED technology provides allows the City the ability to improve service while keeping costs in line. With the help of Ameresco, we’re putting together a project that will pay dividends well into the future.”
–Yakima Public Affairs Director Randy Beehler

Key Benefits

LED Lighting offers energy savings of 50% to 60%
LED Lighting Reduces Maintenance Costs
LED Lighting Provides Better Illumination


LED Lighting Uses 50-60% Less Energy
LED, or light-emitting diode, is a highly efficient, solid-state lighting (SSL) technology in which nearly all the energy used produces light rather than waste heat.  In addition to being inherently more efficient than high pressure sodium (HPS) and other traditional light sources, LED technology has characteristics that enable higher wattage HPS fixtures to be replaced with lower wattage LED fixtures. For example:
Optical Control: LED lighting provides uniform light distribution, while traditional light sources direct most of their light output to a small area directly under the fixture.
Lumen Depreciation: LED lighting sustains light output for most of its long life, while the rapid depreciation of light output from traditional light sources necessitates the use of higher wattage fixtures to maintain minimum light levels over their useful life.
Adaptability: LED lighting can be field adjusted for different applications, in contrast to HPS lighting which is offered only in fixed wattages, and LED lighting can be easily controlled (dimmed) to save additional energy.
Converting existing street and area lighting to LED reduces energy use by 50%-60% or more, depending on the application, and additional savings can be achieved by dimming during times of day when traffic volume or other factors justify lower light levels. In parking garages LED lights can be combined with controls and motion sensors so that they dim automatically at times of day when activity is low, then instantly return to full illumination when activity is detected.
LED Lighting Reduces Maintenance Costs
In contrast to LED lighting, HPS and other traditional types of area lighting require ongoing maintenance to replace failed lamps and ballasts (HPS lamps last 4-5 years, ballasts 8-10 years).  The associated maintenance costs are substantial, with 20% or more of the lights in a traditional streetlight system requiring a visit from a bucket truck crew each year.  Most LED street lights carry a 10-year warranty and will need little or no maintenance for much longer.

Case Studies


Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport
Solar installations created a positive annual cash flow of $170,000.




City of Henderson
Electrical savings totaled more than $840,000 annually and maintenance savings totaled more than $87,000 annually with the use of LED street lights.




City of West Richland
LED street lighting and wireless controls installed through a budget-neutral project are expected to reduce annual energy consumption by 61%.

George P. Sakellaris, P.E.
President and Chief Executive Officer

Mr. Sakellaris is the President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Ameresco, Inc. (NYSE:AMRC), a leading energy efficiency and renewable energy company headquartered in Framingham, MA.
A visionary and entrepreneur, Mr. Sakellaris founded Ameresco in April 2000. He aspired to build an entirely product-neutral and supplier-independent energy company that had the skills, capabilities and foresight to create independent energy solutions that went beyond just conservation; one that addressed a customer’s entire energy stream including supply and demand, energy efficiency and renewable energy.
Early in his career, Mr. Sakellaris worked at the utility New England Electric System (NEES), where he welcomed the challenge to establish NEES Energy, a company that would promote energy efficiency, thereby avoiding the need to build new power generation plants. Mr. Sakellaris then purchased the business known as NEES Energy in 1991 and renamed it NORESCO. He built NORESCO into an industry-leading independent energy services company before selling it to Equitable Resources in 1997, where he continued to lead NORESCO and was also appointed as a Senior Vice President of Equitable Resources (NYSE:EQT), a Fortune 500 Energy Company.
Today, Mr. Sakellaris leads Ameresco, a public company, employing over 1,000. Ameresco continues to grow and thrive, and currently supports more than 70 local offices throughout North America and the United Kingdom.
For more than 30 years Mr. Sakellaris has persevered in the energy industry, working to eliminate regulatory barriers to investing private capital into energy efficiency and renewable initiatives. Mr. Sakellaris’ dedication and influence in promoting energy efficiency dates back to his involvement with the Electrical Power Research Institute (EPRI) where he championed the development of demand side management (DSM) programs that were widely implemented across the country. Additionally, he was a founding member of the National Association of Energy Service Companies (NAESCO) where he served as the first president and advocated for the new industry. He remains an active NAESCO member today.
Mr. Sakellaris earned both M.B.A and M.S.E.E. degrees from Northeastern University and a B.S.E.E. degree from the University of Maine – Orono. In May 2012, the University of Maine granted him an Honorary Doctorate for his lifetime of achievements, recognizing his dedication and exemplary leadership in the field of energy efficiency and renewable energy. In May 2017, the University of Maine honored Mr. Sakellaris with his induction as a Hall of Fame Member of the Francis Crowe Society.
In 2016, CIO Review recognized Mr. Sakellaris with the selection of Ameresco as one of the 20 Most Promising Energy Technology Solutions Providers. Mr. Sakellaris was the recipient of the 2015 Finance Monthly CEO Award, Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year 2011 New England, Energy, Cleantech & Natural Resources Award. In 2012, he was named the Worcester Business Journal’s Business Leader of the Year for large businesses and honored by The Boston Globe for Ameresco’s Globe-100 Top-performing Public Companies #29 ranking. The Boston Business Journal ranked Ameresco #31 in the Area’s Fastest Growing Public Companies and #49 in Massachusetts’ 150 Top Public Companies. In 2011, Ameresco was honored on the Forbes 100 list as one of America’s Best Small Companies and in 2010, as the New England Clean Energy Council Employer of the Year.

Ameresco Inc Profits Shrink, but Backlog Grows
The energy efficiency services specialist reported an unexpected loss in the first quarter, but a record backlog -- both contracted and awarded -- could lead to better days ahead. 











                Jason Hall
            

                (TMFVelvetHammer)



            
            May 3, 2017 at 2:36PM
            
            





When Ameresco Inc (NYSE:AMRC) released its first-quarter results on May 2, most close followers of the company were anticipating a small profit, leaving the market surprised when it reported a small $600,000 loss to start 2017, even though revenue was up year over year. But the company's first quarter tends to be its worst performing because of the timing of contract activity from the industries Ameresco serves, and accelerated investment into operating assets also played a role in the net loss the company reported. 
At the same time, Ameresco reported strong growth in its construction backlog, with more than $500 million in fully contracted work, and another $1.14 billion in awarded projects awaiting final contracts. Combined, this gives the company $1.64 billion in awarded projects, the most in its history.

Let's take a closer look at Ameresco's quarterly results, as well as what management says to expect going forward.

Two things played the biggest role in Ameresco delivering a small profit one year ago but a loss this quarter. On the earnings call, CFO John Granara said the company amended a contract with a major customer last year that negatively affected gross margin percent and revenue. He also said the company is intentionally spending more on operations to drive growth in both its project backlog and the portfolio of operating assets the company is building. 
There's evidence that the increased operations expense is paying off. Year over year, the total backlog is up $250 million, with both contracted and awarded projects up. Sequentially, contracted backlog fell from $534 million to $505 million, but awarded projects increased $180 million to $1.14 billion. On the earnings call, Founder and CEO George Sakellaris said the company is also seeing more bid and award activity as well, both at the state and local level, as well as from federal agencies on the government side.
Ameresco announced a number of large contract awards, including a $150 million smart lighting project with the city of Chicago, to replace the city's streetlights with LED lights and implement an intelligent management and control system, which is expected to reduce power consumption by the city's streetlights by 50% to 75%. Sakellaris also described a major contract win with the New York City Housing Authority, worth $56 million, as well as a second phase project worth another $100 million. 
The company was also one of 21 companies approved by the Department of Energy to participate in its new $55 billion IDIQ contract. The kinds of projects Ameresco will do through this DOE contract are exactly the sorts of "public-private partnerships" the Trump administration has touted as being an important part of its infrastructure improvement plans. And since Ameresco's ESPC -- energy service performance contracts -- don't require capital outlay and pay for themselves with cost savings, there's significant potential for the company in this new program. 
Ameresco is also spending more to develop operating assets that will generate recurring revenues. The company had $207 million in assets in development at quarter end, down from $228 million sequentially, as the company brought a significant portion of those projects online during the first quarter. At the end of the quarter, the company had 172 megawatt equivalents of power-producing assets operating, and another 95 MWe under development. Of this total, about half is already under construction. On the balance sheet, project assets increased $20 million to $340 million. This is a combination of completed assets and those in some stage of construction with capital investments already committed. 
Balance sheet in solid shape
Ameresco ended the quarter with $199 million in current assets, down $27 million from the end of the year. But its current liabilities -- that is, money it owes within the next 12 months -- decreased by more than $40 million. Combined, the company's working capital situation actually improved in the quarter. Its total balance sheet, which includes all assets and liabilities, improved by about $1 million, with improved working capital more than offsetting the $32 million increase in long-term debt. 





Looking ahead
Ameresco's first quarter wasn't exactly something to crow about, at least on the top  and bottom lines. But beneath the surface, management is steadfastly investing in expanding its operating assets portfolio (which should help reduce the seasonal lulls common at the start of the year), while also making sure the company is participating in every opportunity for new contract awards as possible. The growth in both its backlog and owned operating assets indicate that this is paying off. 
Management said the first quarter's results were inline with their internal projections, and it reaffirmed its full-year guidance of $665 million to $700 million in revenue and earnings per share of $0.37-$0.43, with the caveat that the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings of SunEdison, and some internal restructuring, could affect the results on a GAAP basis. 
If the recent uptick in bid activity and contract awards continues, 2017 could be a great year for Ameresco and its investors.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in California:













Does Ameresco, Inc carry a valid contracting license?



In California, any remodeling or construction project that exceeds $500 (labor and materials), requires a contractor to have an active license with the California Contractor State License Board (CSLB).
Ameresco, Inc currently holds license 817191 (Electrical, General Building Contractor, General Engineering Contractor, Solar), which was Active when we last checked.











How important is contractor licensing in California?



The CSLB is one of the highest rated licensing boards in the US. Applicants are required to pass a written board exam and prove at least four years of prior, relevant work experience. In addition, the CSLB requires all license holders to maintain at least $2,500 in operating capital and provides you with a range of other consumer protections.











Your liability risk when hiring Ameresco, Inc



Contractors in California are required to carry workers' compensation insurance if they have employees and proof of liability insurance with the cumulative limit of $1 million for licensees with five or fewer persons, and an additional 100,000 for each additional member over five, not to exceed $5 million total.











Financial recourse when hiring Ameresco, Inc



All licensed contractors in California are required to maintain a bond, which provides you with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations. If you feel as though you have been taken advantage of, you should leave feedback on the contractor's BuildZoom profile and file a complaint with the CSLB.
Ameresco, Inc has a $12,500 bond with St Paul Fire And Marine Insurance Company. 











What else should I know before hiring Ameresco, Inc



California contractors are required to submit their fingerprints to the board, which are then checked against criminal records held by the California Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to obtaining a valid contracting license.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The California State License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
