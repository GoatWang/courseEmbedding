Early life[edit]
Forsee was born in Kansas City, Missouri and received a B.S. from the Missouri University of Science and Technology in 1972. While there he became a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity, and in, 2009, he received the "Man of the Year Award" from Kappa Sigma, in recognition of his exemplary leadership.[1]
Sprint and Sprint Nextel[edit]
Gary Forsee succeeded William Esrey as CEO of Sprint in 2004. During his first year, he led a dramatic rise in Sprint's performance and stock price and negotiated the Sprint Nextel merger, earning him the honor of being named one of the "Best Managers" of 2004 by Business Week magazine.[2] Together with Nextel Communications' CEO, Tim Donahue, Forsee merged the two companies in 2005 and spun off its land line business to Embarq in 2006.
The merger was intended to bring together two strong brands, Sprint in consumer cellular and Nextel in business cellular, but the so-called "synergies" expected from the merger never materialized. Instead, the diverse cultures of the two companies led to internal clashes between former Sprint and Nextel employees and the resulting internal conflict led to serious customer service issues. Combined with network troubles plaguing the company from both legacy networks, Sprint Nextel soon found itself bleeding subscribers and facing ever-lowering monthly subscriber revenue (a.k.a. "ARPU," or average revenue per unit.)[3]
In 2007 Sprint took considerable heat after it terminated contracts of 1,000 of its 53 million customers who it said were making 40 to 50 calls a month complaining about the service,[4] while customers exited both of Sprint Nextel's wireless networks in droves.
Forsee was ousted after Sprint lost 337,000 customers in the third quarter of 2007,[5] and a little over six months later the company wrote off $31 billion related to the merger—essentially writing off three quarters of $42 billion Nextel's market capitalization value as of the time of the merger.[6] In a significant reversal of market perception of his performance, the former "Best Manager" was named one of the "Worst CEOs" in 2009 by Fortune Magazine based on the disastrous outcome of the Sprint Nextel merger.[citation needed]
Despite Gary Forsee's widely reported poor management performance throughout the Sprint Nextel merger and afterwards, he was awarded a severance package that ChiefExecutive.net described as "exceptional:"[7] Foresee's severance package added up to over $40 million, including a $1.5 million salary through 2009, $5 million in bonuses, stock options and restricted shares worth $23 million and an $84,000-a-month pension for life.[8]
University of Missouri[edit]
After resigning from Sprint Nextel, Forsee accepted a position as the 22nd president of the four-campus University of Missouri System on December 20, 2007.[9] He succeeded Gordon H. Lamb, who had served in the position since April 2007. Forsee began his duties Feb. 18, 2008. After taking an extended leave beginning in December 2010 to care for his wife, Sherry, who was diagnosed with cancer, Forsee announced his immediate resignation to the UM board of curators on January 7, 2011.[10]

Gary D. Forsee

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Gary . Forsee (born 1950) was the chairman and chief executive officer of Sprint Nextel Corporation (2003–2007) and served as president of the University of Missouri System from 2007-2011. Forsee resides in Columbia, Missouri, the headquarters of the UM System.

Early life[edit]
Forsee was born in Kansas City, Missouri and received a B.S. from the Missouri University of Science and Technology in 1972. While there he became a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity, and in, 2009, he received the "Man of the Year Award" from Kappa Sigma, in recognition of his exemplary leadership.[1]
Sprint and Sprint Nextel[edit]
Gary Forsee succeeded William Esrey as CEO of Sprint in 2004. During his first year, he led a dramatic rise in Sprint's performance and stock price and negotiated the Sprint Nextel merger, earning him the honor of being named one of the "Best Managers" of 2004 by Business Week magazine.[2] Together with Nextel Communications' CEO, Tim Donahue, Forsee merged the two companies in 2005 and spun off its land line business to Embarq in 2006.
The merger was intended to bring together two strong brands, Sprint in consumer cellular and Nextel in business cellular, but the so-called "synergies" expected from the merger never materialized. Instead, the diverse cultures of the two companies led to internal clashes between former Sprint and Nextel employees and the resulting internal conflict led to serious customer service issues. Combined with network troubles plaguing the company from both legacy networks, Sprint Nextel soon found itself bleeding subscribers and facing ever-lowering monthly subscriber revenue (a.k.a. "ARPU," or average revenue per unit.)[3]
In 2007 Sprint took considerable heat after it terminated contracts of 1,000 of its 53 million customers who it said were making 40 to 50 calls a month complaining about the service,[4] while customers exited both of Sprint Nextel's wireless networks in droves.
Forsee was ousted after Sprint lost 337,000 customers in the third quarter of 2007,[5] and a little over six months later the company wrote off $31 billion related to the merger—essentially writing off three quarters of $42 billion Nextel's market capitalization value as of the time of the merger.[6] In a significant reversal of market perception of his performance, the former "Best Manager" was named one of the "Worst CEOs" in 2009 by Fortune Magazine based on the disastrous outcome of the Sprint Nextel merger.[citation needed]
Despite Gary Forsee's widely reported poor management performance throughout the Sprint Nextel merger and afterwards, he was awarded a severance package that ChiefExecutive.net described as "exceptional:"[7] Foresee's severance package added up to over $40 million, including a $1.5 million salary through 2009, $5 million in bonuses, stock options and restricted shares worth $23 million and an $84,000-a-month pension for life.[8]
University of Missouri[edit]
After resigning from Sprint Nextel, Forsee accepted a position as the 22nd president of the four-campus University of Missouri System on December 20, 2007.[9] He succeeded Gordon H. Lamb, who had served in the position since April 2007. Forsee began his duties Feb. 18, 2008. After taking an extended leave beginning in December 2010 to care for his wife, Sherry, who was diagnosed with cancer, Forsee announced his immediate resignation to the UM board of curators on January 7, 2011.[10]

Gary D. Forsee


chairman & ceo, spring corporation





Gary D. Forsee, Chairman & CEO of Sprint, addressses the Boston College Chief Executives' Club of Boston at the Wharf Room at the Boston Harbor Hotel. 
Sprint CEO predicts wireless-Net link 
Sprint Corp. chief executive Gary D. Forsee predicted that next year will see the first "combo phones" come to market in the United States, linking conventional wireless service and low-priced Internet calling.
And given the likelihood cable television companies such as Comcast Corp. and Time Warner Inc. will be among the first to roll them out, the phones will probably include movie trailers and television clips delivered to the wireless handset, Forsee said at the Boston College Chief Executives Club. "That really is the promise of convergence," he said.
Top industry leaders including Forsee and AT&T Corp. chief executive David Dorman have predicted that hybrid phones combining Internet phone service at subscribers' homes or workplaces with cellular coverage outside could be explosively popular with consumers and business people. 

Peter Lynch (Vice-Chairman & Trustee, Fidelity Management and Research), Cathy Minehan (President, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston), and Gary Forsee chat before lunch. 
Companies including Motorola Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc. have developed prototypes, which are essentially standard cell phones that become cordless phones for super-cheap Internet-based phone service once they are in the range of a "WiFi" wireless fidelity transmitter. Two key issues still being worked out are how to ensure callers can move without interruption between the two modes, and, more important, whether cellular carriers will reject the technology as a threat to their profits because it lets customers switch from wireless minutes to cheap, unlimited Internet calling.
Time Warner this week confirmed it is using Sprint to provide a trial wireless service bundled with cable TV, high-speed Internet, and home phone service in the metropolitan Kansas City market. As phone and wireless companies including Verizon Communications Inc. build new TV-capable networks that enable them to offer a so-called quadruple play- phone, wireless, TV, and broadband- cable companies are looking to Sprint and other carriers to add wireless to their service arsenal. This week, Sprint confirmed it is serving more than 250,000 cable phone customers already.
Because the two biggest wireless companies, Cingular and Verizon, are both owned by Baby Bell phone companies that are archrivals of cable, cable companies are expected to look chiefly to Sprint for wireless and landline telecom services. Comcast and Cox Communications Inc. were also key financial backers of Sprint in the 1990s. Sprint hopes late this year to close a $36 billion merger with Nextel Communications Inc. that will solidify its place as a close number three to Cingular and Verizon, with more than 40 million customers.

Edmund Kelly (Chairman, Liberty Mutual), Thomas May (Chairman, NSTAR), Paul La Camera (President, WCVB-TV Channel 5), Patrick Purcell (President, Herald Media), Fr. William Leahy, S.J. (President, Boston College), Peter Lynch (Vice-Chairman & Trustee, Fidelity Management and Research), Dr. James Mongan (President, Partners HealthCare System), Patrick McGovern (Chairman, International Data Group), Cathy Minehan (President, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston), and William Swanson (Chairman, Raytheon) listen while Gary Forsee addresses his audience.
But Forsee said Sprint continues to negotiate terms with cable companies. "Each company is different, and each company will pursue how they offer service differently," Forsee said.
Among other issues, cable companies have different views on whether to use the Sprint brand, market wireless under their own brand, or take a hybrid approach of "brought to you by or powered by" Sprint.
Comcast spokeswoman Jennifer L. Khoury said last night the company "is in discussions with wireless carriers" but has no service launch plans to disclose. Comcast has periodically offered subscribers promotional discounts to WiFi "hotspot" access from T-Mobile USA Inc. at coffee shops, bookstores, airports, and other locations.
In other comments, Forsee said Sprint Nextel will begin transferring Nextel customers to the existing Sprint network in 2007-2008, but has no plans to shut down Nextel's hybrid cellular/walkie-talkie "integrated digital enhanced network" service any time soon. "I think there is a pretty high likelihood that the IDEN network will live into the future," said Forsee, but in "a rebranded sense" focusing only on push-to-talk services for markets such as public safety, homeland security, and delivery and trades workers, with Sprint handling telephone calls.

                        Forsee
 Episode 504
CAPTURING THE CHECKERED FLAG: Winning Customers Through Savvy Sports Marketing

Featured Guest:

Gary D. Forsee
Chairman & CEO, Sprint Nextel Corp.


  Gary D. Forsee is chairman and chief executive officer of Sprint Nextel Corporation,
  a leading provider of wireless and wireline communications services that brings
  the freedom of mobility to consumers, businesses and government users.

  Within his first year as CEO of Sprint Nextel, major strategic milestones have
  been achieved that repositioned the company into one that is mobility-focused.
  Under Forsee's leadership, Sprint Nextel struck a landmark joint venture
  with the largest cable companies to provide wireless and wireline services,
  completed the spin-off of its Local telephone operations and initiated a first-of-its-kind
  partnership to deploy WiMAX technology as the next-generation platform for
  mobility in the United States. This repositioning enables Sprint Nextel to
  converge its unique wireless and Internet wireline assets to create an entirely
  new suite of mobility and IP-based products and services for customers.

  As Sprint Nextel chairman and CEO, Forsee has worked to establish a corporate
  culture of innovation and performance integrated with corporate social responsibility.
  In 2006, FORTUNE Magazine named Sprint Nextel the leading innovator in the
  telecom category and the second most admired company in the same category.
  Sprint Nextel was also named the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce's 2006 "Corporation
  of the Year" and has been on DiversityInc's "Top 50 Companies for
  Diversity" list since 2004. 

  Forsee has also been recognized by BusinessWeek magazine which named him one
  of the best business leaders in America in 2004 and 2005 and, one of the best
  managers of 2004. Additionally, Forbes listed Sprint Nextel as one of 26 Best
  Managed Companies for 2005.

  Prior to assuming his current role at Sprint Nextel in 2005, Forsee served
  as chief executive officer and chairman of Sprint since 2003. Before joining
  Sprint, Forsee served as vice chairman of BellSouth Corporation where he was
  responsible for all of BellSouth's domestic operations and chaired the Cingular
  Wireless joint venture. 

  Forsee's more than 35 years in the telecommunications industry also includes
  various leadership positions with Sprint, Global One, AT&T and Southwestern
  Bell.

  Forsee holds a bachelor's degree in engineering from the University of Missouri
  at Rolla. In May 2005, the university awarded Forsee with an honorary Doctor
  of Engineering degree. Forsee presently serves on the university's Board of
  Trustees. He presently serves on the University of Missouri-Rolla Board of
  Trustees and is a member of The Business Roundtable and The Business Council.

  In December 2006, President George W. Bush appointed Forsee as the next chairman
  of the President's National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee.
  Forsee has served on this committee since May 2004. Forsee also serves on the
  National Executive Board of the Boy Scouts of America and was a previous chairman
  of the National Board of Trustees of the March of Dimes.

      ■ Until 1989 Gary D. Forsee was an obscure figure, a civil engineer
      by training, who had worked his way up the corporate ladder at
      Southwestern Bell and its parent company, American Telephone and Telegraph
      (AT&T). In 1989 he accepted a job at Sprint that precipitated the
      first of the court cases that may represent Forsee's broadest and
      longest-lasting influence on American businesses, influencing the way
      millions of employment contracts would be written and interpreted. His
      shift from Global One to BellSouth in 1999 set further

      precedents, and his spectacular move from BellSouth back to Sprint had a
      broad effect on the relationships between contractual employees and their
      companies.
    

      During the 1990s Forsee established a reputation as a solid leader who
      could navigate businesses through thorny alliances. He became one of the
      most sought-after executives in the telecommunications industry because he
      had experience in every facet of the business and understood the
      relationships among wireless and wire-line communications, data-driven
      communications such as the Internet and voice-driven communication, and
      video and audio technologies. Further, he was sharp-minded, with superb
      skills for dealing with people. The combination of Forsee's
      wide-ranging knowledge and management skills made him the object of
      battles between giant corporations, with billions of dollars at stake. In
      2003 these circumstances resulted in Forsee's being in a position
      to engineer a
       radical restructuring of Sprint, perhaps creating a new corporate model
      for 21st-century service industries.
    

      CORPORATE FIRES
    

      When Forsee graduated from college with a degree in civil engineering in
      1972, he joined Southwestern Bell, part of AT&T. He worked in
      various offices of AT&T, mostly in New Jersey and Washington, D.C.
      Records of his early years at AT&T are scant, but possibly it was
      while working in New Jersey and Washington that he began to develop the
      homesickness for Kansas City that would later affect some of the most
      important decisions of his career.
    

      In 1987 Forsee was appointed vice president for service operations for
      AT&T, where his steady personality and extensive knowledge of
      telecommunications operations could help AT&T develop a good
      reputation for serving customers. When the U.S. government decided to
      reorganize all of its communications systems to prepare the country for
      21st-century technology, AT&T was one of the winning bidders on the
      lucrative contract, with Sprint being the other: The two companies were
      expected to work together on the project, dubbed FTS 2000.
    

      THE BITTERNESS OF JOINING SPRINT, PART 1
    

      Sprint had its headquarters in Overland Park, Kansas, near Kansas City,
      Missouri, and a desire to return to his hometown may have motivated Forsee
      to take a job in December 1989 directing Sprint's half of the FTS
      2000 program; he was named general manager and vice president of
      Sprint's government systems division. AT&T sued Forsee and
      Sprint, claiming that Forsee had proprietary information belonging to
      AT&T and citing a "noncompete" clause in
      Forsee's contract with AT&T that forbade his working for a
      competitor of the company.
    

      Michael Schlanger of the King & Spalding law firm represented
      Forsee in a state court in Alexandria, Virginia. It was obvious that what
      Forsee knew about AT&T's work on FTS 2000 would be applied
      to his work on Sprint's FTS 2000, but this appeared to benefit both
      AT&T and Sprint because he would be in a position to help the
      companies coordinate their efforts. Noncompete clauses were common in
      employee contracts, especially in the telecommunications industry, where a
      competitive edge could mean millions of dollars in revenue. Yet Schlanger
      and Forsee successfully argued that the noncompete wording in
      Forsee's contract was too restrictive, and in 1990 the court
      allowed Forsee to join Sprint. The ruling was a blow to the noncompete
      clause tradition in corporate law.
    

      From February 1991 to February 1993 Forsee served as president of both the
      government systems division and the business services division of Sprint.
      In March 1995 he was named president and chief operating officer of
      Sprint's long-distance services. (Also that year he was appointed
      to the board of trustees of the March of Dimes, a volunteer position.) As
      chief operating officer of long-distance services, Forsee revealed a flair
      for creativity as well as for making canny decisions. From 1995 to 1998
      Sprint's long-distance services' revenues grew 23 percent to
      $1.1 billion, thanks partly to marketing and pricing strategies such as
      the Fridays Free program for business customers.
    

      GLOBAL ONE
    

      In February 1998 Forsee was named president and chief executive officer of
      Global One, a joint venture of Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom, and
      Sprint. The companies had founded Global One in January 1996, with each
      owning one-third of the joint venture. The object of Global One was to
      offer companies doing international business a unified source for all of
      their communications needs, simplifying customers' international
      communications and saving them money.
    

      In 1997 Global One had $1.1 billion in revenues but lost money. It fell
      behind its earning schedule, making Sprint, in particular, impatient. When
      the projection for Global One's making a profit was moved back by
      two years, Forsee was chosen in 1998 to replace the former president and
      CEO. Forsee was responsible for both finances and operations for a venture
      that had 30,000 business customers and 3,900 employees scattered through
      numerous outlets in 65 countries. Deutsche Telekom tried to buy Italy
      Telecom, which miffed France Telecom, whose management perhaps thought
      Deutsche Telekom was breaking the trust of the partners in Global One by
      trying to offer international services on its own. The two
      companies' bickering placed Forsee in the difficult situation of
      keeping the disagreement from breaking up Global One while he tried to
      meet Sprint's demands that the young venture start making profits
      soon. Further, he seemed to have been unhappy with working in Brussels,
      Belgium, where Global One had its headquarters. In July 1999 he resigned
      from Global One.
    

      BELLSOUTH
    

      In September 1999 BellSouth Corporation hired Forsee as executive vice
      president and chief staff officer. BellSouth, headquartered in Atlanta,
      was a company on the rise. Its ambitious chairman of the board, Duane
      Ackerman, was expanding operations throughout the world. Forsee had the
      demanding responsibilities for all employee governance and for
      Bell-South's domestic operations. His contract with Sprint
      contained a noncompete clause, but Sprint took the high road and agreed to
      release him when BellSouth promised that Forsee would not, at least at
      first, work in BellSouth's long-distance
       operations. Even so, it seems to have been understood by all parties that
      Forsee would eventually help BellSouth with its broadband and
      long-distance operations.
    

      Forsee impressed his coworkers with his quick mind and his careful
      managing of people, and he was very well liked. He worked on wire-line and
      wireless communications, on cable television, digital television, the
      Internet, other data-transmission services, marketing, and the Yellow
      Pages. In 1999 BellSouth tried to buy Sprint, only to have WorldCom
      intrude near the end of negotiations with a higher bid, killing what would
      have been a $129-billion merger. In 2000 government antitrust regulators
      disallowed WorldCom's purchase of Sprint.
    

      In September 2000 BellSouth made Forsee president of BellSouth
      International. At the time, BellSouth had 34 million customers in 19
      countries and was forming ambitious alliances with regional companies,
      especially in Latin America, where business was burgeoning. In May 2001
      BellSouth allied with Central America's StarMedia to expand
      wireless communications in Latin America; the number of wireless users in
      the region was growing by 28 percent per year. In November 2001 BellSouth
      restructured its organization to put wholesale and retail operations into
      domestic operations under Forsee, who became vice chairman of the board
      for BellSouth on January 1, 2002, after the previous vice chairman, Jere
      Drummond, retired on December 31, 2001.
    

      Therein may have been the seeds of the great corporate struggle that was
      played out on a world stage in early 2003. When Forsee became vice
      chairman, outsiders assumed it meant that he was Ackerman's heir,
      to become chairman of the board when Ackerman retired. Certainly
      Forsee's responsibilities showed a great deal of trust on the part
      of Ackerman and the board of directors, who gave Forsee not only
      Drummond's responsibilities but also those of the retiring
      president of network services, Charlie Coe. However, Forsee had the
      example before him of the vice chairman Drummond, another heir apparent
      who never got the chairmanship. Moreoever, Ackerman's contract ran
      to at least 2006 (perhaps 2007). The position of vice chairman could have
      been as far up BellSouth's corporate ladder as Forsee would go.
    

      Forsee had plenty of work to do. He dealt with government regulations,
      marketing, BellSouth's wire-line and wireless networks, external
      affairs, and the Yellow Pages. In 2002 Bell-South had 600,000 digital
      subscriber line (DSL) customers, and 70 percent of its lines were ready
      for DSL, but this percentage had to improve. The company had 65,000
      employees and $20 billion in revenue. Forsee coordinated the demands of
      DSL and other new technologies, the employees, and the revenues. He was
      well compensated for this, earning $7.3 million in salary, bonuses, and
      stock benefits for the year.
    

      Then, in December 2002, Sprint offered its positions of CEO and chairman
      of the board to Forsee. On the one hand, Forsee had been given a great
      deal of trust at BellSouth, where he was admired. On the other, Sprint
      offered him its top two jobs now rather than later, and he would return to
      his home-town of Kansas City if he rejoined Sprint, where he knew most of
      the management. He asserted in court documents that his principal reason
      for wishing to rejoin Sprint was that he would be going home, and there is
      no reason not to believe that this was, in fact, his foremost motivation.
      The press found out about the job offer before Ackerman did; Forsee did
      not tell Ackerman of the offer until January 29, 2003. On January 30
      Ackerman and BellSouth's board of directors offered Forsee more
      money and more responsibility if he would remain with BellSouth. On
      January 31, with Forsee trying to call Ackerman throughout the day but not
      reaching him, BellSouth obtained a restraining order, probably after 5
      p.m., against Forsee. Cingular, a wireless joint venture between BellSouth
      and SBC, soon joined a lawsuit against Forsee and Sprint. On February 3,
      2003, a restraining order was issued against Forsee and Sprint.
    

      THE BITTERNESS OF JOINING SPRINT, PART 2
    

      Sprint was in a difficult situation in late 2002. Its ambitions for
      expansion into world markets had crashed; it laid off 17,000 employees
      worldwide from October 2001 to February 2003. In December 2002 alone it
      cut 1,200 jobs, 3 percent of its remaining workforce. On February 5, 2002,
      the 
      
        Wall Street Journal
      
       reported tax troubles for the company's CEO and chairman of the
      board, William T. Esrey, and its president and chief operating officer,
      Ronald LeMay. Although they had both set up tax shelters recommended by
      Sprint's auditors, Ernst & Young, the Internal Revenue
      Service was auditing the 1999 and 2000 tax returns for both men.
      Ordinarily, the company and its officers would have weathered the bad
      news, taking no action until the government declared its conclusions, but
      recent scandals at Enron and other corporations made Sprint wary of how
      the news would affect its customers. It was a public relations nightmare
      even if the IRS exonerated Esrey and LeMay. Further, Esrey had lymphatic
      cancer and was undergoing treatment.
    

      Forsee may have looked like a godsend to Sprint's board of
      directors. He was regarded as thoroughly ethical, he knew most of
      Sprint's operations, and he had a reputation for making good
      decisions, getting even the most trying ones right. His patience with
      people would be valuable in a corporation stressed by falling sales and
      job losses. Sprint also held attractions for Forsee besides returning to
      his home, working with people he knew and liked, and holding the top
      positions at a telecommunications giant. Sprint, with 26 million customers
      in 70 countries and $27 billion in revenue for 2002, offered him a great
      challenge and considerable power.
    

      In its lawsuit BellSouth cited a "restrictive covenant" in
      its contract with Forsee, meaning a noncompete clause that forbade
       him to take a position with a competitor for 18 months after leaving
      BellSouth's employment. BellSouth also cited a confidentiality
      clause, the Georgia Trade Secrets Act, and the doctrine of
      "inevitable disclosure," which meant that Forsee would
      inevitably use BellSouth's trade secrets if he worked for Sprint,
      because the two had very similar markets. "It would be like the CEO
      of Coca-Cola defecting to PepsiCo, taking with him the company's
      marketing strategies and secret product formula," asserted
      BellSouth's February 2003 filing with the court (
      
        Law.com
      
      , March 7, 2003). It was BellSouth's contention that Forsee knew
      all of BellSouth's plans for the next three years and could damage
      the company by taking advantage of this knowledge on behalf of Sprint.
      During the period of restraining orders and court appearances, BellSouth
      continued to pay Forsee's high salary and may even have hoped he
      would continue to work for the company.
    

      King & Spalding, which had represented Forsee in 1989–1990
      when AT&T sued him, had drafted Forsee's Bell-South
      contract. In January 2003 King & Spalding joined with the
      Sonnenschein law firm to represent Forsee, with Michael Schlanger as
      Forsee's lead lawyer. BellSouth's lawyers tried to have both
      Schlanger and King & Spalding barred from the case because of a
      conflict of interest, but their efforts were denied. By then the case was
      being covered in media around the world, and in America it had broad
      implications for employment contracts. Could employers insist that
      employees restrict their job options? Cases for lesser lights had
      generally gone in favor of employers and the noncompete clauses.
    

      The case was argued in Fulton County (Georgia) Superior Court before Judge
      Stephanie B. Manis. Sprint's senior vice president, Liane
      Pelletier, filed an affidavit with the court, arguing that government
      regulation of the telecommunications industry was so great, requiring so
      much disclosure, that there really were few actual trade secrets. Although
      it was a thin argument, it touched on an aspect of BellSouth's
      claims that seemed to backfire: the "inevitable disclosure"
      doctrine. Georgia's constitution forbade restraint of trade;
      indeed, Geogia's right-to-work laws were second in strength only to
      California's. If the disclosure was inevitable, then the
      confidentiality aspect of BellSouth's argument equated to
      preventing Forsee from practicing his trade with any company, meaning he
      could not find work. Forsee's lawyers contended that
      BellSouth's arguments meant he could not work in at least 34 states
      and 14 foreign countries.
    

      More telling was the argument against the noncompete clause preventing
      Forsee to work for any competitor of Bell-South's for 18 months.
      The clause was too broad and too vague, insisted Forsee's lawyers.
      On February 11, 2003, Judge Manis struck down the noncompete restrictions
      in Forsee's BellSouth contract. She called the geographical
      restrictions unenforceable, said that other restrictions were unreasonable
      because they prevented Forsee from pursuing too wide a range of types of
      jobs, and declared the noncompete clause too restrictive, too broad, too
      vague, and void. Thus, in 1990 and 2003 Forsee dealt two telling blows to
      employment restrictions in contracts. The implications extended far beyond
      Virginia and Georgia: noncompete clauses could be too restrictive, broad,
      and vague and could prove to be unenforceable anywhere in the United
      States. A standard clause that was routinely used to intimidate employees
      became of dubious legality because of the awareness to its unfairness
      brought by Forsee's cases.
    

      Judge Manis ordered Forsee and BellSouth to go to arbitration for no more
      than 30 days on aspects of the confidentiality issues. BellSouth appealed
      Judge Manis's ruling to the Georgia Supreme Court, but the appeal
      was rejected. In March 2003 an arbitration hearing was held before Judge
      William H. Webster, former head of the FBI and the CIA. The court order
      allowed Webster to consider only the confidentiality and trade-secrets
      clauses of the contract. On March 18, 2003, Judge Webster made his
      decision, declaring that from March 19, 2003, to March 19, 2004, Forsee
      could not lobby for Sprint in areas where BellSouth had business, could
      not participate in decisions about marketing that competed with BellSouth
      and Cingular, and could not participate in acquisition and merger
      discussions. Sprint's board of directors was required by Judge
      Webster to acknowledge the restrictions placed on Forsee for the one-year
      period. Apparently Forsee abided by the spirit as well as the letter of
      Webster's decision, and it seems that he never gave away
      BellSouth's confidences.
    

      On March 19, 2003, Forsee became CEO of Sprint and joined its board of
      directors; he did not attend board meetings when restricted subjects were
      discussed. Esrey and LeMay remained with Sprint to help with the
      transition of authority, leaving on May 14, 2003, when Forsee became
      chairman of the board. He created a national strategy for Sprint that
      emphasized "bundling" all of Sprint's resources into
      packages customers could purchase, with bundles tailored to suit specific
      kinds of customers, and he directed the simplifying of the process by
      which customers ordered services. In September 2003 International Business
      Machines Corporation and Sprint formed an alliance to consolidate customer
      service, saving Sprint hundreds of millions of dollars per year, and
      Forsee reorganized Sprint into two groups: business customers and general
      consumers. In January 2004 Sprint allied with Samsung, Sanyo, Toshiba, and
      RealNetworks to offer 3-D games on cell phones, enable customers to
      download television clips, and provide both voice and data services over
      multiple platforms. In April 2004 Sprint combined its FON and PCS
      (wireless) stocks, exchanging one-half FON stock for one PCS stock, in an
      effort to make Sprint stock easier to understand.

Gary D. Forsee - Wikipedia





















 






Gary D. Forsee

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Gary . Forsee (born 1950) was the chairman and chief executive officer of Sprint Nextel Corporation (2003–2007) and served as president of the University of Missouri System from 2007-2011. Forsee resides in Columbia, Missouri, the headquarters of the UM System.

Early life[edit]
Forsee was born in Kansas City, Missouri and received a B.S. from the Missouri University of Science and Technology in 1972. While there he became a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity, and in, 2009, he received the "Man of the Year Award" from Kappa Sigma, in recognition of his exemplary leadership.[1]
Sprint and Sprint Nextel[edit]
Gary Forsee succeeded William Esrey as CEO of Sprint in 2004. During his first year, he led a dramatic rise in Sprint's performance and stock price and negotiated the Sprint Nextel merger, earning him the honor of being named one of the "Best Managers" of 2004 by Business Week magazine.[2] Together with Nextel Communications' CEO, Tim Donahue, Forsee merged the two companies in 2005 and spun off its land line business to Embarq in 2006.
The merger was intended to bring together two strong brands, Sprint in consumer cellular and Nextel in business cellular, but the so-called "synergies" expected from the merger never materialized. Instead, the diverse cultures of the two companies led to internal clashes between former Sprint and Nextel employees and the resulting internal conflict led to serious customer service issues. Combined with network troubles plaguing the company from both legacy networks, Sprint Nextel soon found itself bleeding subscribers and facing ever-lowering monthly subscriber revenue (a.k.a. "ARPU," or average revenue per unit.)[3]
In 2007 Sprint took considerable heat after it terminated contracts of 1,000 of its 53 million customers who it said were making 40 to 50 calls a month complaining about the service,[4] while customers exited both of Sprint Nextel's wireless networks in droves.
Forsee was ousted after Sprint lost 337,000 customers in the third quarter of 2007,[5] and a little over six months later the company wrote off $31 billion related to the merger—essentially writing off three quarters of $42 billion Nextel's market capitalization value as of the time of the merger.[6] In a significant reversal of market perception of his performance, the former "Best Manager" was named one of the "Worst CEOs" in 2009 by Fortune Magazine based on the disastrous outcome of the Sprint Nextel merger.[citation needed]
Despite Gary Forsee's widely reported poor management performance throughout the Sprint Nextel merger and afterwards, he was awarded a severance package that ChiefExecutive.net described as "exceptional:"[7] Foresee's severance package added up to over $40 million, including a $1.5 million salary through 2009, $5 million in bonuses, stock options and restricted shares worth $23 million and an $84,000-a-month pension for life.[8]
University of Missouri[edit]
After resigning from Sprint Nextel, Forsee accepted a position as the 22nd president of the four-campus University of Missouri System on December 20, 2007.[9] He succeeded Gordon H. Lamb, who had served in the position since April 2007. Forsee began his duties Feb. 18, 2008. After taking an extended leave beginning in December 2010 to care for his wife, Sherry, who was diagnosed with cancer, Forsee announced his immediate resignation to the UM board of curators on January 7, 2011.[10]

Gary D. Forsee

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Gary . Forsee (born 1950) was the chairman and chief executive officer of Sprint Nextel Corporation (2003–2007) and served as president of the University of Missouri System from 2007-2011. Forsee resides in Columbia, Missouri, the headquarters of the UM System.

Early life[edit]
Forsee was born in Kansas City, Missouri and received a B.S. from the Missouri University of Science and Technology in 1972. While there he became a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity, and in, 2009, he received the "Man of the Year Award" from Kappa Sigma, in recognition of his exemplary leadership.[1]
Sprint and Sprint Nextel[edit]
Gary Forsee succeeded William Esrey as CEO of Sprint in 2004. During his first year, he led a dramatic rise in Sprint's performance and stock price and negotiated the Sprint Nextel merger, earning him the honor of being named one of the "Best Managers" of 2004 by Business Week magazine.[2] Together with Nextel Communications' CEO, Tim Donahue, Forsee merged the two companies in 2005 and spun off its land line business to Embarq in 2006.
The merger was intended to bring together two strong brands, Sprint in consumer cellular and Nextel in business cellular, but the so-called "synergies" expected from the merger never materialized. Instead, the diverse cultures of the two companies led to internal clashes between former Sprint and Nextel employees and the resulting internal conflict led to serious customer service issues. Combined with network troubles plaguing the company from both legacy networks, Sprint Nextel soon found itself bleeding subscribers and facing ever-lowering monthly subscriber revenue (a.k.a. "ARPU," or average revenue per unit.)[3]
In 2007 Sprint took considerable heat after it terminated contracts of 1,000 of its 53 million customers who it said were making 40 to 50 calls a month complaining about the service,[4] while customers exited both of Sprint Nextel's wireless networks in droves.
Forsee was ousted after Sprint lost 337,000 customers in the third quarter of 2007,[5] and a little over six months later the company wrote off $31 billion related to the merger—essentially writing off three quarters of $42 billion Nextel's market capitalization value as of the time of the merger.[6] In a significant reversal of market perception of his performance, the former "Best Manager" was named one of the "Worst CEOs" in 2009 by Fortune Magazine based on the disastrous outcome of the Sprint Nextel merger.[citation needed]
Despite Gary Forsee's widely reported poor management performance throughout the Sprint Nextel merger and afterwards, he was awarded a severance package that ChiefExecutive.net described as "exceptional:"[7] Foresee's severance package added up to over $40 million, including a $1.5 million salary through 2009, $5 million in bonuses, stock options and restricted shares worth $23 million and an $84,000-a-month pension for life.[8]
University of Missouri[edit]
After resigning from Sprint Nextel, Forsee accepted a position as the 22nd president of the four-campus University of Missouri System on December 20, 2007.[9] He succeeded Gordon H. Lamb, who had served in the position since April 2007. Forsee began his duties Feb. 18, 2008. After taking an extended leave beginning in December 2010 to care for his wife, Sherry, who was diagnosed with cancer, Forsee announced his immediate resignation to the UM board of curators on January 7, 2011.[10]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
