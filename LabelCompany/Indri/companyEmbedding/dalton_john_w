College of Technology



A Day in the Life of John W. Dalton, Sr.September 15, 2011Have you wondered how a College of Technology degree could help 
one break new ground and make an impact on the global market?  John 
Dalton shares his story and answers questions offering valuable insight 
into leveraging your strengths, embracing industry with academia, and 
serving as a leader to build a challenging, and profitable career.
John W. Dalton, Sr. is Executive Vice President of Mustang. He 
has 37 years of experience in the engineering and construction industry 
and has held executive staff and operations management positions in all 
aspects of engineering, procurement, and construction. See more about 
Mustang at www.mustangeng.com
What degree did you earn, and when did you graduate?
B.S. in Technology from the University of Houston, 1977.  
What was your first job after graduation from UH?
I completed my degree in seven years, attending night school while working in the Engineering and Construction Industry. 
How did you progress to your current position?
Approximately 25 years of my career was spent with Bechtel 
Corporation, where I held a number of senior management positions, 
including Bechtel Group Vice President.  Throughout my career, I have 
worked in various project functions including construction, project 
controls, materials management and project management. I spent a number 
of years in business development and business management, but spent the 
majority of my career working on international projects.  
In 2003, Mustang engaged me to assist with its growth strategy as it 
looked to expand its markets and service offerings (specifically 
construction) and grow internationally. At that time, I was presented 
with the opportunity to be part of Mustang’s management team and made 
the decision to join Mustang at that time. 
What are the primary responsibilities of your current position?
As Executive Vice President at Mustang, my main responsibility is 
operations oversight for global engineering, project services, 
information technology, construction operations; for the Process Plants 
& Industrial business unit; and for two regions - Europe/North 
Africa/Middle East/India and Latin/South America.  
Mustang has grown globally with six international offices around the world and employing more than 5,000 people.
What is a typical workday for you?
A typical work day for me is usually full of meetings where I work 
with my team to make decisions regarding project-focused issues and 
international office operations. I spend time with our clients 
developing relationships and making sure we are meeting their 
expectations. Many days are spent travelling to our project offices or 
jobsites around the world.  
What do you like best about your job?
I like knowing I can make a difference in project delivery and 
construction techniques. I also like working with people that are always
 looking to be change agents in their respective fields.  Also, I 
believe we all have a responsibility to give back and mentor the next 
generation, and I enjoy that part of my job.
What advice would you give to students considering a career in your field?
I would advise students to be involved in industry organizations 
where they can work with peers as well as experienced professionals to 
gain knowledge. Have a sense of humor and don’t let the stresses of your
 responsibilities get to you.  Also, always look for ways to influence 
change for the better. 
The College of Technology offers undergraduate and graduate 
degree programs in a variety of majors suited to students wishing to 
become entrepreneurs in the field of their choice. For information about
 academic programs, contact the Academic Service Center at 713-743-4100 
or visit online at tech.uh.edu/college/academic-services-center. To be featured in a future Day in the Life article, contact Lisa Burns at lcburns@uh.edu and advise your degree and major for consideration.
