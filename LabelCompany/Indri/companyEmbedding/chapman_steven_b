Description


Atlanta-based group Casting Crowns has crafted their driving pop-rock style for more than three years as worship band for their home church. The seven-member band's self-titled debut was produced by multiple Dove Award winner Steven Curtis Chapman, and the result is a rich-sounding, edgy-pop record that refuses to shy away from the sometimes hard-to-hear truths presented in lead singer Mark Hall's lyrics.
