What does it mean to update a profile?





Owler is a community of business professionals working together to build a database of company information. One contribution reaches thousands of members across the Owler community.
When you contribute on Owler you're shaping the database for all people consuming Owler data. Your updates will flow through to company profiles, competitive intelligence reports, daily snapshots and more. All verified members of the Owler community can update Owler profiles.  Members help the community by sharing data, such as a company's headquarters, and also by weighing-in on sentiment-based questions, such as CEO rating.
Community members make this all happen. That being said, each data update is reviewed by at least one other person to ensure accuracy. All updates are kept anonymous. Happy updating!

Horrible experience at Andersen & Martini


                Horrible experience at Andersen & Martini. Do you like wasting time and been treated like crap, go to Andersen & Martini Taastrup. I am writing about the bad experience I had at Taastrup showroom, Sunday, the 5th of March 2017, with a  salesman and soon after with his supervisor.I’ve booked a test drive for a second hand Opel Astra, Sunday, the 5th of March and after I’ve tested it, I informed the salesman  I’m interested  in buying the car on the spot since it was a gift for my wife.After the negotiation, the salesman printed the contract and handed it to me. Reading the contract I realized the car had an accident, accident which nobody told me about before. I asked him about it and he couldn’t tell me anything, so he went to find out more information. After waiting around 15 minutes, we agreed that he will send me the information about the accident and the contract by email to be signed since I was traveling the week after. Later that day, he wrote to me telling that the car had indeed an accident resulting in a “major wheel alignment problem which may not be fixable” therefore the car had to be serviced before I purchased it.Monday morning I called him and asked about the car and now he told me the car had “major frame damage” and it cannot be sold to a private customer, but only as spare parts. He also told me the car had the accident back in 2013. How come a totally damaged car could been driven approximately 50000km after the major accident? According to the car service manual, it has passed several auto checkups in 2014 and 2015. I guess I was lied.Is Andersen and Martini selling damaged cars which can jeopardize innocent lives? Who knows?Why the salesman started lying and backed out of the contract we negotiated and shook hands on?After complaining to his supervisor, he told me he will try to find out what was the problem with the car and get back to me, while in the meantime he’s going to search for a car with similar options.  After waiting almost a week for an answer and a new offer, I decided to call to find out about the status of my complaint. The answer was: his salesman was in holiday for the upcoming weeks and he couldn’t find more info about the car. I informed him that I found that the car has been registered Tuesday, the 7th of March (two days after my visit at your dealership) with the following number plates: BK87908. Over the phone he also told me he doesn’t have any offers for me. Customer service is non-existing at Andersen and Martini since I wrote 2 other complaints directed to Sales Operation Manager and Andersen Martini CEO. Both complaints have not been answered to this day.A very disappointed and disrespected customer,Gelu Laurentiu

                    Dear Mr. Motorga LaurentiuWe are sorry about the situation which basically is very simple.We acknowledge the fact that you wanted to buy the particular car in question; however you never confirmed neither did you sign the sales contract.According to our policy, a car is not sold until the contract has been signed and since another customer wanted to buy and sign, the car was sold to the latter.Unfortunately, our salesman did not tell you the true reason why you could not buy the car; namely that the car was sold to another customer. A full legitimate reason as to why he could not sell the car to you.Notwithstanding that, our branch manager offered you to find a simelar car; however, I understand you and he did not come to terms.May we suggest you come to our shop again and we shall offer you a good deal for another car.Best RegardsPeter HansenAndersen & Martini

Good and professional experience


                I went through the process of leasing the car in Andersen & Martini. I was under the time presure. I had a pleasure to experience swift repllies, timely updates, can-do attitude and professional help. Even though I am a foreigner speaking no Danish I didn't feel the difference - aFully recomended experience!

Andersen & Martini A/S – Toolpack kundecase

Andersen & Martini is a honorary crown name on the Zealand automotive market. Since the mid-1930s, the company, started by Percy Martini and Harald Andersen, has marketed, sold and serviced new and used vehicles. Today, Andersen & Martini for the import of Cadillac, as well as from seven departments in the Copenhagen area, distributes and servicing brands such as Opel, SAAB, KIA, FIAT, Corvette and Cadillac. Revenue is almost 800 million. The 260 employees make sure that customer satisfaction is all the best.
Martin Ørbæk Nielsen, Chief Financial Officer of Andersen & Martini could maximally push a summary quarterly account to the budget managers if he were to continue the manual reporting processes that the company used when joining. With the implementation of Toolpack, the financial manager can now service the individual budget managers each month with detailed and clear financial reports. At the same time, he gets more time for the business.
 Better management required 
Just like many new cars today equipped with GPS systems, there was Andersen & Martini’s budget managers also needed a system that included more frequent and detailed information on how the business developed in relation to the budgets. Andersen & Martini has a lot of product lines, which means that there is often a need to measure on the individual product line so that you can quickly intervene if the reality differs from the plan.
The company uses an ERP system, which is specifically aimed at the automotive industry. A solid tool for managing daily transactions. But, like many other ERP systems, it’s almost as hard for budgeting and management reporting.
 From quarterly reporting to monthly reporting 
The solution to the reporting task became Toolpack. “The decision to acquire Toolpack did not take long,” says economist Martin Ørbæk Nielsen, and continues: “The product had the facilities we requested, and Toolpack consultants appeared professional and competent. They were ready to make a 100 percent integration of Toolpack with our ERP system. The latter was a crucial condition because we did not want to make manual data transfers with all the errors and the time it causes. ”
In less time than previously it was time to prepare the summary quarterly report, Martin Ørbæk Nielsen can now, using Toolpack, service all budget managers with detailed monthly financial reports. Budgets and realized numbers are gathered in Toolpack, and the individual budget manager can even extract the reports directly in Excel.
 We all know Excel 
The budget managers at Andersen & Martini is excited that Toolpack is based on Excel. “We all know Excel in advance, so we only needed time to get to know the new Toolpack features,” says Martin Ørbæk Nielsen. “At first, I was a bit concerned about whether Excel could handle the large amounts of data, but it did not prove to be a problem,” continues the chief financial officer. “By using Excel, we also benefit from all the new features that Microsoft develops. In addition, all new employees we employ in sales and administration, already acquainted with Excel. It’s the big advantage of Toolpack. ”
 A solution for financial managers 
Martin Ørbæk Nielsen may notice that the people behind Toolpack have a financial background. “Toolpack has been designed and developed by finance managers for finance managers – it is clearly visible,” says Martin Ørbæk Nielsen, saying: “The entire way you work with the product exactly matches the way an economist is thinking.”
