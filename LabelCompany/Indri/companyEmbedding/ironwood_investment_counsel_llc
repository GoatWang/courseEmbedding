Ironwood Investment Management























Ironwood Investment Management, LLC� is an independent, investment firm that specializes in small company stock investing. The firm was formed in 1997 by a group of experienced investment professionals that have been successful in assembling investment talent, building well-known investment firms and effectively managing small cap products for a wide array of clients nationwide.

Our two senior investment professionals have approximately 50 years of combined investment industry experience. Together, Portfolio Managers Warren Isabelle and Donald Collins have forged a consistent and disciplined investment approach to uncovering and investing in small company stocks that are selling at discount to the underlying company's true economic value. This "real world approach" that brings together original, un-biased research with a fundamentals-driven value philosophy is the basis for all of our small cap investment strategies. 

Ironwood Investment Management, LLC� manages assets for many well-known institutional clients such as public mutual funds, university endowments & foundations, municipal and state retirement plans, corporate pension plans and individual investors in the following strategies:

�	Small Cap Core Strategy
�	Concentrated Small Company Strategy
�	Small Company Stock Strategy 
�	Micro-Cap Strategy 

�	VIP Small Cap Value Strategy 
�	VIP SMID Cap Strategy 
�	Large Cap Growth Strategy 

As a leading small company investment firm, Ironwood Investment Management, LLC� strives to provide clients with an independent perspective, quality investment performance, personalized service and the highest ethical standards possible.

Ironwood Investment Management, LLC� offers clients:

An experienced investment team - our two senior investment professionals have over 50 years of combined investment industry experience, backed by two experienced analysts and two traders.

A well defined product - portfolios are typically fully invested in domestic securities with market capitalization of less than $2 billion, exhibiting strong value characteristics - market timing, market capitalization "creep" are not an issue for our clients.

An accessible and responsive client service and investment team - our team is comprised of experienced professionals that have worked effectively with numerous institutional clients over the past 20+ years.

Capacity for new assets and new clients - Our current size is an advantage as most small cap investment managers lose their strategic advantage once assets exceed their capabilities.
