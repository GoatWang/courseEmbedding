What Others Are Saying About Us



Transitioning from a physical textbook to Acrobatiq instantly provided numerous benefits for our students.  Acrobatiq is more accessible, affordable and engaging for our students, and it provides individualized feedback that lets them know where their strengths and weaknesses lie.  A great bonus is that it reduces the grading for Instructors and keep tracks of student performance for us.  It’s a win-win!
Dr. Stephen HobbsDepartment of Integrative Psychology, University of Colorado - Boulder
Acrobatiq’s courseware has changed the way I teach Introduction to Psychology.  The system automatically provides me with the information I need to better understand how my students are performing, making me a more efficient and effective professor.
Dr. Erik W. Moody, Ph.D.Marist College
What sets Acrobatiq apart … is the Learning Dashboard. My students engage with the material and the Dashboard shows me meaningful summaries of their work. I can then use that information to make wise decisions about class time, and use it to amplify and clarify points where students tended to struggle the most. …It’s not always what I would predict. But it’s far more gratifying to know what they did not understand before I administer an exam.
Dr. Lawrence Rudiger, Ph.DDepartment of Psychological Science, University of Vermont
At SAGE, our goal is to provide high quality, digital course solutions that enhance the value of the trusted, expert content we develop in partnership with our academic authors.  Acrobatiq’s evidence-based approach for course design aligns well with our mission  of driving successful student outcomes. SAGE is delighted to partner with Acrobatiq and is confident that features such as the learning analytic dashboard, targeted feedback, and adaptive practice will enhance the educational experience for instructors and students.

About Acrobatiq
 




Request More Information



Based on Leading Edge Cognitive Science From Carnegie Mellon University’s Acclaimed Open Learning Initiative


1  Research-Backed Course Design
Proven to Enhance Student Learning
Acrobatiq’s Smart Courseware is based on 10 years of cognitive and learning science research from Carnegie Mellon University’s Open Learning Initiative. Students using courseware developed from this methodology demonstrated greater learning gains, often in less time and with improved rates of retention and recall than peers in control groups.










2  Outcomes-Based Architecture
Design Framework for Connecting Activities to Learning Goals
Acrobatiq Skill Graphs identify what students should know and be able to do by the end of a course. Skill Graphs ensure tight alignment of course content, activities, and assessment to clearly defined learning outcomes so students have ample practice opportunities to master the component skills tied to learning objectives. Acrobatiq Skill Graphs form the architectural framework of Acrobatiq courseware and provide the basis for measuring and modeling student learning within a course.



Personalize Learning with Goal-Directed Practice  and Targeted Feedback


3 Goal-Directed Practice Critical to Learning
Help at the Point of Need
Research shows that students learn best and retain more knowledge when supported with goal-directed practice, coupled with targeted, timely, and personalized feedback. Acrobatiq’s Smart Courseware provides personalized feedback through abundant formative activities and assessments using a variety of interactive activities, with multiple levels of hints and feedback aimed at specific mistakes or misconceptions.














4Adaptive Practice Personalized to Each Student
Based on Individual Learning Estimates
Our Smart Courseware individualizes practice questions for students based on real-time learning estimates. Students with low learning mastery are given more opportunities to practice, while students with high levels of learning mastery are given less, enabling faster progression through the activities, and more focused study time. See it in action »







5 Real-World Activities to Apply Knowledge
Master Core Concepts in Less Time
Acrobatiq courseware includes online labs, simulations, case studies and other interactive exercises for students to conduct experiments, collect and analyze data, and evaluate their hypotheses. These dynamic activities help students apply new knowledge and achieve concept mastery.







Monitor Learning in Real Time with Diagnostic and Summative Assessments





6  Assessments to Evaluate Learning
Monitor Mastery of Concepts
Smart Courseware includes diagnostic and summative assessments for students to successfully demonstrate concept mastery. Pre-assessments can help identify whether a student is ready to begin a learning module and enable custom recommendations. Pre-assessments can also identify and support students with critical pre-requisite skill gaps, triggering “just-in-time” remediation modules.



Generate Actionable Insights with Dynamic Learning Dashboards


7  Show Learning Progress in Real-Time
Enable Faster and More Directed Interventions
The Learning Dashboard collects, stores, and analyzes learning data generated while students engage with learning activities. Dashboards are organized around common questions educators have about student performance and are used to identify skills and concepts students are finding difficult to master, pinpoint at-risk students, and provide targeted interventions as needed.
Student Dashboards and Recommendations guide and motivate learners by presenting clear goals, and indicating their progress and performance against those goals. Recommendations help students to build effective learning strategies and metacognition.







Use Acrobatiq Smart Author™ to Customize Your Courseware


8 Full-Featured Courseware Authoring Application
Powerful and Easy to Use Customization Tools
Use Acrobatiq Smart Author™ to customize and deliver beautiful, interactive and adaptive lessons with text, images, video, multimedia, formative assessment, summative assessment, adaptive elements, and more. Smart Author™ lets you customize Acrobatiq’s Smart Courseware based on your individual teaching and learning goals. You can change the courseware name; delete, add or change the order of modules and units; choose how assessments are delivered, graded, or timed; and integrate video or other media right from your desktop.
Use A/B split testing tools to quickly deploy new content to sample student cohorts and assess the impact on learning outcomes using built-in learning curve analysis tools.
Add new lesson pages with pre-formatted templates and prompts. Custom authored content is amended to the Skill Graph, enabling the capture and reporting of learning analytics.










9 Mobile Access & Interoperability
Connecting Systems and Devices
Acrobatiq’s Smart Courseware uses modern web design to support student access and learning on mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. It conforms to best-in-class web interoperability standards including learning tools interoperability (LTI). Grades generated by Acrobatiq courseware can be seamlessly reported to many leading third-party learning management systems (LMS) such as Blackboard 9.1, Canvas, Desire2Learn, Moodle 2.2, and Sakai CLE.




10 Customer Support Team

As part of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Next Generation Courseware Challenge, we’re looking to partner with institutions  that are interested in piloting adaptive learning courseware and providing implementation feedback.

As part of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Next Generation Courseware Challenge, Acrobatiq has been awarded a Grant to produce adaptive courseware. The goal of this initiative is to leverage the best of what is known about the learning sciences, education research, and technology-enabled learning to create next generation digital courseware that helps target and tailor learning for students based on their existing knowledge and learning gaps so they can successfully complete required general education “gateway” undergraduate courses.


Participating institutions will receive the following services:

Planning call with selected faculty and administrators to define goals and outcomes for the courseware pilot implementation.
Live and web-based training for faculty, instructional design teams, centers for teaching and learning and/or other individuals on campus who will play a role in successful implementation.
Courseware hosting and single-sign in implementation with an institutional LMS such as Blackboard,  Moodle or Canvas.
Technical and customer support to both faculty and students for the duration of the pilot to ensure teaching and learning goals are successfully met.
Post-pilot analysis for key stakeholders with suggested strategies for how to organize instruction and student support services around data-driven adaptive courseware.
Participating students will receive a discount on the cost of the courseware in 2017.  Students will also have access to the courseware for up to five years after the pilot program ends.



Benefits of Participating as a Courseware Challenge Pilot Site

In addition to providing valuable implementation feedback, participating as a courseware pilot site enables low-risk and easy instructional and pedagogical evaluation of Acrobatiq courseware and learning data to inform strategic planning decisions related to:

Developing or enhancing online courses or programs using adaptive, data–driven courseware
Improving course completions by integrating technology-enhanced learning resources
Improving course retention rates by personalizing student learning experiences
Generating predictive learning data to more cost effectively apply student wrap-around services such as tutoring and course mentoring
Improving student-learning outcomes through evidence-based adaptive learning features
Launching new competency-based degree programs

Acrobatiq will work closely with faculty and administrative leaders to customize a pilot program that will generate meaningful data to aid in decision-making. Pilot programs can consist of one or more sections of a course and typically include benchmarks to measure pre and post-courseware impact on cognitive (e.g. ability to solve problems and apply concepts) and affective (e.g. attitude toward math, self-efficacy) learning outcomes.
Near the end of the term, Acrobatiq will conduct a short course evaluation comparing student learning outcomes for students using Acrobatiq courseware and students using other learning resources across sections of the same course.
Supported Courseware: 



Anatomy & Physiology


Introduction to Biology


Introduction to Psychology


IT Fundamentals


Statistics (Probability & Statistics / Statistical Reasoning)


Survey of World History

	Acrobatiq is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform that combines courseware authoring, content and analytics tools for educators and instructional design teams to develop adaptive courseware. Acrobatiq's Smart Author is a platform application that includes pre-built page layout templates, support for team-based workflows, content creation tools, predictive analytics capabilities, and a detailed analytics dashboard showing student learning performance. Instructors use lessons created in Smart Author when teaching in blended or fully online formats. In addition, Acrobatiq offers a library of pre-made courseware.


	Acrobatiq’s adaptive functionality considers factors such as performance on questions, mastery of prior learning objectives, student hint requests and partial attempts at questions. Instructors can add content from outside the courseware, override the grading policies, set the sequence of learning objectives, schedule assignments and fix the number of attempts a student can make to achieve a particular score.

What Others Are Saying About Us



Transitioning from a physical textbook to Acrobatiq instantly provided numerous benefits for our students.  Acrobatiq is more accessible, affordable and engaging for our students, and it provides individualized feedback that lets them know where their strengths and weaknesses lie.  A great bonus is that it reduces the grading for Instructors and keep tracks of student performance for us.  It’s a win-win!
Dr. Stephen HobbsDepartment of Integrative Psychology, University of Colorado - Boulder
Acrobatiq’s courseware has changed the way I teach Introduction to Psychology.  The system automatically provides me with the information I need to better understand how my students are performing, making me a more efficient and effective professor.
Dr. Erik W. Moody, Ph.D.Marist College
What sets Acrobatiq apart … is the Learning Dashboard. My students engage with the material and the Dashboard shows me meaningful summaries of their work. I can then use that information to make wise decisions about class time, and use it to amplify and clarify points where students tended to struggle the most. …It’s not always what I would predict. But it’s far more gratifying to know what they did not understand before I administer an exam.
Dr. Lawrence Rudiger, Ph.DDepartment of Psychological Science, University of Vermont
At SAGE, our goal is to provide high quality, digital course solutions that enhance the value of the trusted, expert content we develop in partnership with our academic authors.  Acrobatiq’s evidence-based approach for course design aligns well with our mission  of driving successful student outcomes. SAGE is delighted to partner with Acrobatiq and is confident that features such as the learning analytic dashboard, targeted feedback, and adaptive practice will enhance the educational experience for instructors and students.
