Acute Radiation Syndrome




 



Acute Radiation Syndrome
During recent years, the threat of nuclear detonation on U.S. soil has increased.  The lack of effective post-exposure treatments for victims experiencing Acute Radiation Syndrome (“ARS”) presents a serious problem for public health planners.
Acute Radiation Syndrome is characterized by a series sub-syndromes affecting different organs and systems in the body.
Acute Syndromes – H-ARS
Radiation exposure kills rapidly dividing cells very effectively.  The human body’s hematopoietic system is comprised of several different types of rapidly dividing cells that make up the immune system.  After exposure to high-dose radiation, the numbers of these different cells drop quickly due to radiation-induced cell death.  This is known as the hematopoietic sub-syndrome or H-ARS.  The rapid decline in immune system cell counts leaves the patient open to severe infection.  The onset of the syndrome is rapid, usually within 24-48 hours after exposure and death can occur within 7-10 days.
H-ARS is currently treatable using a class of drugs called granulocyte colony stimulating factors or G-CSFs.  G-CSFs increase the production of new cells in the bone marrow allowing the immune system to be replenished.  Studies performed by NIAID have demonstrated a significant increase in survival at high doses of radiation after the administration of G-CSFs.  
Neupogentm (Amgen) is currently being stockpiled by BARDA in the Strategic National Stockpile under a vendor-managed supply agreement.  In addition, BARDA is funding the advanced development of Leukinetm (Sanofi) as an alternative for procurement in this class of drugs.
Acute Radiation Syndrome – GI-ARS
At higher doses of radiation, a second sub-syndrome develops in the gastrointestinal (“GI”) tract.  The mucosal layer that lines the gut dies and is sloughed off, reducing the body’s ability to absorb nutrients from food.  In addition, important stem cells in the GI tract are often damaged, reducing the ability of the body to replenish the lining of the gut and restore normal function.  Onset of the syndrome is rapid, usually within the first 2-24 hours and death can occur in 3-10 days.
There are no treatments for GI-ARS.  The current standard of care is limited to supportive measures such as fluids and antibiotics. There are other compounds under development for this sub-syndrome with various mechanisms of action. Because GI-ARS is a complex syndrome, it is likely that multiple drugs will be required to treat.
Acute Radiation Syndrome – Lung-ARS
Experience with nuclear accident victims has demonstrated that patients can survive H-ARS and GI-ARS with the administration of G-CSFs and supportive care.  Unfortunately, those patients often succumbed to respiratory failure caused by inflammation and then scarring of the lung.  This is the lung sub-syndrome or Lung-ARS and its effects are not apparent until two to three months after exposure.
Lung-ARS is characterized by a delayed onset of inflammation in the lungs called pneumonitits.  This inflammation leads to the development of scar tissue called fibrosis.  The combination of inflammation and scarring reduces lung function and leads to death.
The goal of BARDA in developing medical countermeasures for radiation is healthy, long-term survival for as many citizens as possible.  While treatment with Neupogentm and supportive care can help victims survive the short-term syndromes, H-ARS and GI-ARS, long-term survival is dependent on effective treatment for Lung-ARS. 
There are no current treatments for Lung-ARS.  AEOL-10150 is the only drug under advanced development by the U.S. Government for this syndrome.  We are not aware of any compounds under development that have shown efficacy in Lung-ARS when administered after exposure to acute, high dose radiation.

Clinical Data




 



Clinical Data
AEOL 10150 has already performed well in animal safety studies, been well-tolerated in two human clinical trials, demonstrated efficacy in two species in acute radiation syndrome (ARS) studies and demonstrated statistically significant survival efficacy in an acute radiation-induced lung injury model. AEOL 10150 has also demonstrated efficacy in validated animal models for GI-ARS, chlorine gas exposure, and sulfur mustard gas exposure.
Efficacy has been demonstrated in Lung-ARS in both rodent and non-human primate studies (“NHP”), with AEOL 10150 treated groups showing significantly reduced weight loss, inflammation, oxidative stress, lung damage, and most importantly, mortality.  Therapeutic efficacy was demonstrated when delivered after exposure to radiation (24 hours after exposure for mice in the GI-ARS study and NHPs in the Lung-ARS studies, and two hours after exposure for mice in the Lung-ARS studies).

Product Pipeline
AEOL 11114




 



AEOL 11114
AEOL 11114 was developed by Brian J. Day, PhD at National Jewish Health and Manisha Patel, PhD at the University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences in collaboration with Aeolus and under two research grants from the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s disease. Aeolus has obtained worldwide, exclusive licenses to develop the compounds from National Jewish Health and the University of Colorado.
Preclinical studies funded by the Michael J. Fox Foundation in two models of Parkinson’s disease demonstrated that AEOL 11114 reduced oxidative stress and damage, mitigated dopamine depletion, prevented loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, the most important neuropathological feature of Parkinson’s disease, and improved Parkinson’s disease-like motor deficits. Additional studies funded by the Fox Foundation have shown that AEOL 11114 exhibited drug-like characteristics with a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, oral bioavailability, metabolic stability and brain penetrance, and a safety profile amenable for long-term dosing.
Aeolus is currently working on optimization of the AEOL 11114 manufacturing process and formulation. Upon completion of this work, IND-enabling safety and toxicology studies are planned to begin in the third quarter of 2016. Aeolus plans to file an IND for the treatment of patients with Parkinson’s disease during the first half of 2017. The Company intends to pursue a partner with clinical development expertise in this indication to initiate clinical studies.
Parkinson's disease is a disorder of the central nervous system that results from the loss of cells in various parts of the brain, including the substantia nigra. The substantia nigra cells produce dopamine, which transmits signals within the brain that allow for coordination of movement. Loss of dopamine causes neurons to fire without normal control, reducing a patient’s control of their movement. It is estimated that more than one million people in the United States and five million people worldwide are affected by Parkinson’s disease.

About
Aeolus is developing a platform of novel compounds for use in biodefense, fibrosis, oncology, infectious disease and diseases of the central nervous system. 
Our first compound, AEOL 10150 is being developed as a medical countermeasure against the pulmonary effects of Acute Radiation Syndrome (“Lung-ARS”) and the delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (“DEARE”) under a contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (“BARDA”), a division of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”). The total value of the contract with all options is $118.4 million of which over $30 million has been expended to date.
The goal of the BARDA contract is FDA approval for AEOL 10150 as a treatment for Lung-ARS and DEARE.  Prior to FDA approval, however, the contract requires Aeolus to file a pre-Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) application with the FDA.  An EUA allows the use of unapproved drugs in cases of declared emergency.  To date, BARDA has made the majority of its purchases for the Strategic National Stockpile following the filing of a pre-Emergency Use Authorization application.
The development work funded under the BARDA contract also supports part of the development costs for AEOL 10150 as a treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (“IPF”).  This development program was created based upon lung protection data generated from animal studies in Lung-ARS and chemical gas lung exposure under the BARDA contract and a company-funded study in the bleomycin lung fibrosis model.   IPF is a chronic, progressive disease of the lungs characterized by increasing scarring (fibrosis) of the lung tissue. Median survival after diagnosis is 3 to 4 years and there is no cure.
The development work funded under the BARDA contract also supports part of the development costs for AEOL-10150 as a treatment for the side effects of radiation therapy for oncology.  We plan to leverage the U.S. government investment to develop AEOL-10150 concurrently for use in an oncology setting.
Aeolus also receives grant funding from the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) CounterACT program for development of the AEOL 10150 as a medical countermeasure against exposure to chemical gas and nerve agents.  Multiple animal studies in exposure to sulfur mustard and chlorine gas have demonstrated a significant survival advantage following administration of AEOL 10150.  Pilot studies in nerve gas exposure models have also demonstrated a survival advantage with AEOL 10150 when added to current standard of care.
AEOL 10150 has been tested in two Phase I clinical trials with no serious adverse events reported.  Data have already been published showing that AEOL 10150 does not interfere with the therapeutic benefit of radiation therapy in prostate and lung cancer preclinical studies.
The Company also has two pre-clinical development programs.
AEOL 11114 was developed from our library of compounds through a research program funded by the Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s disease.  Pre-clinical studies in mouse and rat models have demonstrated neuro-protective activity of AEOL 11114.  We are currently conducting IND-enabling work and plan to file an IND for AEOL 11114 in 2017.
AEOL 20415 was developed in collaboration with National Jewish Health for the treatment of infectious diseases.  The compound incorporates our platform technology into a novel approach to anti-microbial therapy.  We are currently conducting IND-enabling work and plan to file an IND for AEOL 20415 in 2017.  In addition, we plan to pursue potential U.S. government funding for the development of AEOL 20415 in the treatment of several biodefense threats.
