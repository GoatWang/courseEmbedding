Today’s biggest returns are going to early investors in private companies, especially high-growth technology companies that are changing nearly every aspect of life. Rather than wait for a company to go public, often at a high price, OurCrowd’s equity crowdfunding platform allows investors exclusive opportunities to buy stakes in private startup companies for as little as $10,000.

	The graph below shows how the days of seeing 600% returns in public technology companies are largely over, with such opportunities confined to private investments.

OurCrowd: Sparking the Next Wave of InnovationOurCrowd is the leading global equity crowdfunding platform for accredited investors. Managed by a team of seasoned investment professionals, OurCrowd vets and selects opportunities, invests its own capital, and brings companies to its accredited membership of global investors. OurCrowd provides post-investment support to its portfolio companies, assigns industry experts as mentors, and takes board seats. The OurCrowd community of almost 20,000 investors from over 112 countries has invested over $440M into 120 portfolio companies and funds.OurCrowd's role as a startup investing platform About Startup InvestingWhy invest in startups?By investing in startups, you are investing in an asset class that has the potential to provide substantial ROI, to access investment opportunities that were previously unavailable to the masses, to empower companies doing something meaningful to you, and to drive positive change in the world.What is equity crowdfunding?Crowdfunding uses the collective cooperation of the “crowd” to pool resources together in support of a specific project. Equity-based crowdfunding is where individual investors contribute funds to a business or project in exchange for equity.Why invest with equity crowdfunding?Equity crowdfunding allows you to tap into the investment opportunities once reserved for big players like venture capital firms. On equity crowdfunding platforms like OurCrowd, you can find exclusive opportunities to buy stakes in private startup companies, putting your money to work alongside experienced investors, and join the growing trend of getting in on the ground floor rather than waiting for a company to go public.Using OurCrowdHow do I join OurCrowd?It is simple to sign up: Register as an accredited investor; once your account is set up, you’ll have full access to information about the OurCrowd companies available for investment. Please note that there may be additional accreditation requirements that you must fulfill before making investments.Why is accreditation a requirement?Early stage, privately-held companies are high-risk investments, and many countries require individuals to meet certain financial criteria before being allowed to participate in these investments. Accreditation criteria vary country-by-country, but all address the following:Minimum level of income and/or net worth of investors.The investors must provide documents that proves that they meet these criteria.For example, the United States government requires that investors have an annual income of $200,000 ($300,000 if filing joint) for the last two years or a net worth, not including primary residence, of $1,000,000 in order to invest in early stage companies.*Accreditation criteria varies from country to country, for more information contact us.How do I make an investment?View the deals available to accredited investors in the “browse companies” section of the website. You will be provided with material about the company, including videos, presentation, analysis, deal terms, team backgrounds and more. You will also be able to participate in a webinar, call or meeting with company management as per request. Once you have decided to make an investment, you will indicate your amount on the Commit button. We will make allocations based on a process which combines both a first-come first-served and pro-rata calculation. We will send you deal documentation for signing and then transfer instructions.The deal documentation includes your signed certification that you meet your country’s income, asset, and/or experience criteria. In the US, you must have a licensed professional (broker, lawyer, accountant, investment adviser) sign a letter that certifies that you qualify. More details on our accreditation page.For further information browse the site, sign up, or contact us.Who is behind OurCrowd?Jon Medved, the co-founder and CEO of OurCrowd, is a leading Israeli venture capitalist and serial entrepreneur. He is the founder of Israel Seed, which has raised and managed $262M over four funds. He has made 100 investments (including both his angel and VC investment) in Israeli startup companies, 12 of which have reached an excess of $100M in value. Most recently, Jon founded and was the CEO of Vringo, publicly traded on NYSE MKT (VRNG).Steven Blumgart, the co-founder and Chairman of OurCrowd, is a leading investor and philanthropist. Steven was part of the senior management team at Glencore International (GLEN.LE) where he headed their aluminum business.Read more about Our Team

Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.







Past performance is no guarantee of future results.



Diversification and asset allocation do not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss.


          * Fidelity's goal is to make financial expertise broadly accessible and effective in helping people live the lives they want. With assets under administration of $5.6 trillion, including managed assets of $2.1 trillion as of September 30, 2016, we focus on meeting the unique needs of a diverse set of customers: helping more than 24 million people invest their own life savings, nearly 20,000 businesses manage employee benefit programs, as well as providing nearly 10,000 advisory firms with technology solutions to invest their own clients' money.
	
    

          1. Fidelity Management & Research Company and Fidelity Institutional Asset Management, as of 9/30/16. Data is unaudited. These figures reflect the resources of Fidelity Management & Research Company, a U.S. company, and its subsidiaries. Research professionals include portfolio managers, research analysts and research associates.
	
    

          2. Highly rated funds are defined as those funds that have a 4- or 5-Star Morningstar rating. For each fund, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar RatingTM metric each month by subtracting the return on a 90-day U.S. Treasury Bill from the fund's load-adjusted return for the same period, and then adjusting this excess return for risk. The top 10% of funds in each broad asset class receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) Although gathered from reliable sources, data completeness and accuracy cannot be guaranteed by Morningstar.
	
    

          3. You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time. Fidelity's government and U.S. Treasury money market funds will not impose a fee upon the sale of your shares, nor temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets because of market conditions or other factors.
	
    

          4. You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. The fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors.

          5. You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Because the share price of the fund will fluctuate, when you sell your shares they may be worth more or less than what you originally paid for them. The fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund's sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.


Because of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.


          Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.
	
    

The securities of smaller, less well known companies can be more volatile than those of larger companies.


Because of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.


In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible.



Indexes are unmanaged. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

ANGELLIST REVIEW
◙ ANGELLIST REVIEW SUMMARY
√ Raising Funds for Startups
√ Startups don’t pay for syndicate investments
√ Investors pay 0-25% deal carry to the syndicate lead, and 5% deal carry to AngelList
√ Invest in 100 Startups with one Investment

 
◙ SUPPORTED PROJECTS

Project Categories:
The are tens of startup categories. Most popular categories include IT Startups, Consumer Electronics, Media, Healthcare, Education and Finance.
Public Fundraising
Adding your startup or funding round to AngelList doesn't affect whether you are raising publicly or privately. Fundraising activity on AngelList is only visible to logged in, accredited investors. If you announce your raise publicly (for example, by social media or to your company's newsletter), you will need to collect evidence from all investors to verify their accredited investor status.
Accredited investors
An individual in the U.S. is said to be accredited if he has $200k or more in income for the past 2 years (or $300k with a spouse), with the expectation of similar earnings this year; or $1m in net assets (assets minus debts).
How are the investors on AngelList verified
All the investors have stated that they are accredited. You should verify that every investor you raise money from is accredited, whether or not you use AngelList. And you should treat each investor you meet on AngelList as if you just met them on the street.
Limits on AngelList investor account

Newer investors who can’t claim several confirmed startup investments or fund partnerships already may be capped at $25K per investment (and $150K in total).


 
◙ SUPPORTED COUNTRIES FOR SYNDICATED STARTUPS
These are the terms for US and Non-US startups.
 
--How can a Startup be syndicated on AngelList

(1) First, you must have a syndicate lead
(2) You must also be a US S corporation, C corporation or LLC corporation
(3) UK corporations also qualify

--Non-US companies can raise money publicly

Non-U.S. startups can take advantage of public fundraising, as long as they comply with their local regulations and US regulations

 

◙ WHO IS ANGELLIST
AngelList is a platform helping startups raising money online. It was found in Jan 2010 by Babak Nivi and Naval Ravikant. 
The Service is operated and provided by AngelList LLC based in the US, 16 Maiden Lane, San Francisco CA 94108. 
Angellist has made more than 7,500 introductions {between 800 start-ups and 1,200 investors}.

 
◙ ANGELLIST COST OF SERVICES
Startups don’t pay for syndicate investments. 
Investors pay 0-25% deal carry to the syndicate lead, and 5% deal carry to AngelList. 
Investors also pay the out-of-pocket costs for each investment—currently $8K in the US and £8,300 in the UK. These costs are paid to third parties such as state regulatory agencies, payment processors and accountants—AngelList does not profit from these fees.
The lead and AngelList do not receive carry until the syndicate investors’ investments and out-of-pocket costs are returned.

 
◙ ANGELIST TRENDING PROJECTS
How AngelList Trending Work
Trending is based on indications of interest from candidates and investors. In other words, when a lot of high-quality candidates or investors say they want to meet the startup, in a short period of time, this startup trends. The “quality” of the person that is indicating interest matters. Quality is measured by track record—the valuation of the startups a person has invested in, founded, worked at, etc.

 
◙ ANGELIST SYNDICATES -HOW IT WORKS?
A syndicate allows investors to participate in a lead investor's deals. In exchange, investors pay the lead carry. Investors get access to deals, leads get carry and startups get more capital with fewer meetings.

Investors get access to a lead's investments and benefit from her experience in picking and managing investments. Investors can also invest as little as $1K.
Leads get carry for their investments. They can invest 5–10x their typical investment amount, which gives them access to more deals and allows them to lead more deals. They may also get major investor rights. Finally, leads get access to syndicate investors who are often experts in the startup’s market.
Startups get more capital with fewer meetings. They get the attention of a lead who is making a large investment. They get access to the syndicate investors’ networks without putting each one on the cap table. And they can easily collect many small investments. 

Legal structure of a syndicate

Syndicate investors don't invest directly in a company. They invest in a special purpose fund that is created specifically for each investment. This fund then invests in the company. The corporate form of the fund is an LLC.
The fund is managed by Assure Fund Management and advised by AngelList Advisors, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AngelList. The lead also serves as a contractor of AngelList Advisors. 
The lead does not invest through the fund but is required to disclose to AngelList Advisors how she votes, or if she buys or sells shares. 
If there is a lead, the fund will usually vote with the lead unless she has a conflict of interest or there are other unusual circumstances. If there is no lead, the fund will usually vote with the majority of other shareholders
99-investor limit

Due to securities regulations, syndicates can only accept 99 investors in a deal.
A small number of investments support qualified purchasers who are exempt from this requirement. 
Qualified purchasers include individuals with $5M in investment assets and companies with $25M in investment assets. A syndicate deal can accept up to 2000 qualified purchasers at the same time as 99 accredited, but not qualified, investors.



 
◙ INVESTORS
Investors information rights

Syndicate investors receive less information than direct investors. An AngelList entity or the lead will distribute the following documents to investors when they invest in a syndicate deal:

Documents related to the fund’s formation such as its operating agreement, PPM and subscription agreement.
General terms of the investment, if the company permits. Templates of deal documents signed by the fund may also be made available to investors. 
Qualitative updates on the company status, if available. This is high-level information similar to the information VCs provide to their LPs. For example, it may include information about the company’s customers or financing. It will generally not include any figures.
Any information investors need for taxes, such as K-1s, is distributed annually.

How Investors receive their profits
You will receive your profits, if any, when the company is acquired or has an IPO. There may also be other opportunities for the syndicate to sell its shares.
When there is an exit opportunity, AngelList Advisors, in consultation with the lead, will advise the syndicate fund regarding the best time to sell the syndicates’ shares. The decision to sell the shares is then made by Assure Fund Management. This will generally happen soon after the shares become liquid. If there are any profits, they are distributed to the syndicate investors.
The syndicate fund, like all investors, is bound by restrictions with the company and can only sell shares in certain situations.
How investing in a syndicate differ from investing in a VC fund
Syndicates are intended to complement, not replace VC funds. Differences include:

Syndicate investors can opt out of any deal or stop investing any time
Syndicates have much lower minimums
Syndicates are available to the general (accredited) public
Leads typically personally invest more per deal than GPs
Syndicates use deal carry
Syndicates do not charge management fees


 
◙ INVESTOR'S FUNDING ACCOUNTS
Investor's Funding Information
Investor accounts are free
Funds are stored at Silicon Valley Bank, funds are FDIC-insured
Investors can increase or decrease their investment in a particular deal. Any change is subject to approval by the lead. Investors can also opt out of any deal.
An investor account only requires a minimum balance in the case of a syndicate. The minimum balance is equal to the largest backing amount.
 
Withdraw funds from investor's account to bank account takes 3-7 days.

Multiple Series Trusts


























Multiple Series Trusts
Reduce your funds launch time and lower start-up costs by utilizing our Multiple Series Trust comprehensive service solution and expertise.
We have the qualified professionals and complete service solution necessary to manage a Multiple Series Trust (MST). Advisers with limited assets under management, such as start-ups, often utilize adding a fund to an existing MST. However, these types of funds are becoming viable options for large managers launching mutual funds. Our MSTs allow advisers to capitalize on the strength of their investment strategies and stay focused on raising and managing assets.
Our turn-key solution reduces the legal work necessary by adding your fund to an existing trust, essentially lowering the costs compared to establishing an entirely new fund. Additionally, all MSTs at U.S. Bancorp Fund Services include a dedicated and qualified CCO who acts as a daily resource to the advisers’ CCOs and provides assessment, guidance, and consulting, further reducing your costs and time to market. By leveraging our team of experts, you can avoid the operational and regulatory complexities of starting a traditional mutual fund and continue to focus on growing your fund. Our goal is to ensure you are provided an operational structure with customized services, financial reporting, and complete support and industry guidance.








Multiple Series Trusts offer several advantages, including

Reduced time to market
Lower start-up costs due to the reduced amount of legal review
Governance and service expertise of an existing board
A dedicated CCO for all funds within the trust
Sarbanes-Oxley monitoring and certification for all fund financial reporting
Administrative efficiencies

Entoro Group acquires Offerboard, a platform for soliciting investments in private businesses

International startups: sign up for a country pavilion at Disrupt NY












Entoro Group today announced that it has acquired OfferBoard, a company that removes barriers from the process of raising capital.
OfferBoard isn’t AngelList nor FundersClub. It’s a platform designed to make crowdfunding work for growth capital. But instead of tech startups, the company supports general solicitation for multimillion dollar financing projects in spaces like real-estate and oil and gas. The acquisition is to bring the platform in-house so Entoro Group can support its own deals.
The reason OfferBoard can do this is Title II of the JOBS Act. When Title II went into effect in late September of 2013, it was largely ignored by the tech community, at least with respect to Naval Ravikant and Co.’s Title III which brought equity crowdfunding into the everyday Valley lexicon. But to Chris Tyrrell, Title II, aka the legalization of general solicitation, was where the real money was going to be made.
In the past it was illegal for private companies to publicly advertise that they were raising investment. But even after the laws changed, it was tough to actually raise money because more traditional industries lacked the software infrastructure to support solicitation. Though OfferBoard exists in different forms for each client and use case, it is that infrastructure in its simplest form.
James Row, managing director of the Entoro Group, gives the example of a private company looking to finance a drilling program to explain the synergies that OfferBoard will bring to Entoro. A business with 20k acres of leased property and the right to drill still needs money to build wells. At this level, that generally means raising 10s of millions of dollars. Said company would approach Entoro and they would run diligence and piece together a preferred equity deal to finance it.
“Energy is the ideal space because it has known deal flow,” asserted Row.  “There is a fragmented gap between buyers and sellers, we just need to be a better match maker.”
OfferBoard, originally launched out of stealth on the stage of TechCrunch Disrupt New York in 2014. Tyrrell was working for a family office at the time he thought of the idea, but the way he got into the startup ring was unorthodox. Rather than bootstrap in a garage in Menlo Park, he bought tickets to Australia and nabbed the license to a technology being developed by a public Australian company.



Between then and now, the company hosted over $150 million worth of deals across a variety of industries. But instead of building out a software platform company, Tyrrell decided to match his market entry strategy with an equally unorthodox way out, selling to a Houston-based investment bank in a wonky transaction that also involves the merging of Clearinghouse Securities and OFSCap LLC to form the aforementioned Entoro Group that is ultimately purchasing OfferBoard.
At the time of the sale, OfferBoard had hosted an estimated 50 deals at an average of $4 million in value. This brought the company about $8 million in total revenue roughly split across the last three years as $1 million, $3 million and $5 million.
“I came to a realization that companies with a niche were going to win the day,” said Tyrrell. “The winners will start now and win 4-6 years from now.”
But despite growth, Tyrrell insisted that the industry supporting equity as a whole is running 8-10 years behind debt platforms. The group has been slowly winding down its practice to slow growth and become profitable, streamlining by cutting its 10 person workforce in half. OfferBoard raised a total of $3.1 million from nine investors that largely consisted of high-net-worth individuals and family offices. Tyrrell will be joining the board of the Entoro Group but won’t be taking a formal role beyond that.

Today’s biggest returns are going to early investors in private companies, especially high-growth technology companies that are changing nearly every aspect of life. Rather than wait for a company to go public, often at a high price, OurCrowd’s equity crowdfunding platform allows investors exclusive opportunities to buy stakes in private startup companies for as little as $10,000.

	The graph below shows how the days of seeing 600% returns in public technology companies are largely over, with such opportunities confined to private investments.




Almost all the returns are now privateCreate bar charts

OurCrowd: Sparking the Next Wave of InnovationOurCrowd is the leading global equity crowdfunding platform for accredited investors. Managed by a team of seasoned investment professionals, OurCrowd vets and selects opportunities, invests its own capital, and brings companies to its accredited membership of global investors. OurCrowd provides post-investment support to its portfolio companies, assigns industry experts as mentors, and takes board seats. The OurCrowd community of almost 20,000 investors from over 112 countries has invested over $440M into 120 portfolio companies and funds.OurCrowd's role as a startup investing platform About Startup InvestingWhy invest in startups?By investing in startups, you are investing in an asset class that has the potential to provide substantial ROI, to access investment opportunities that were previously unavailable to the masses, to empower companies doing something meaningful to you, and to drive positive change in the world.What is equity crowdfunding?Crowdfunding uses the collective cooperation of the “crowd” to pool resources together in support of a specific project. Equity-based crowdfunding is where individual investors contribute funds to a business or project in exchange for equity.Why invest with equity crowdfunding?Equity crowdfunding allows you to tap into the investment opportunities once reserved for big players like venture capital firms. On equity crowdfunding platforms like OurCrowd, you can find exclusive opportunities to buy stakes in private startup companies, putting your money to work alongside experienced investors, and join the growing trend of getting in on the ground floor rather than waiting for a company to go public.Using OurCrowdHow do I join OurCrowd?It is simple to sign up: Register as an accredited investor; once your account is set up, you’ll have full access to information about the OurCrowd companies available for investment. Please note that there may be additional accreditation requirements that you must fulfill before making investments.Why is accreditation a requirement?Early stage, privately-held companies are high-risk investments, and many countries require individuals to meet certain financial criteria before being allowed to participate in these investments. Accreditation criteria vary country-by-country, but all address the following:Minimum level of income and/or net worth of investors.The investors must provide documents that proves that they meet these criteria.For example, the United States government requires that investors have an annual income of $200,000 ($300,000 if filing joint) for the last two years or a net worth, not including primary residence, of $1,000,000 in order to invest in early stage companies.*Accreditation criteria varies from country to country, for more information contact us.How do I make an investment?View the deals available to accredited investors in the “browse companies” section of the website. You will be provided with material about the company, including videos, presentation, analysis, deal terms, team backgrounds and more. You will also be able to participate in a webinar, call or meeting with company management as per request. Once you have decided to make an investment, you will indicate your amount on the Commit button. We will make allocations based on a process which combines both a first-come first-served and pro-rata calculation. We will send you deal documentation for signing and then transfer instructions.The deal documentation includes your signed certification that you meet your country’s income, asset, and/or experience criteria. In the US, you must have a licensed professional (broker, lawyer, accountant, investment adviser) sign a letter that certifies that you qualify. More details on our accreditation page.For further information browse the site, sign up, or contact us.Who is behind OurCrowd?Jon Medved, the co-founder and CEO of OurCrowd, is a leading Israeli venture capitalist and serial entrepreneur. He is the founder of Israel Seed, which has raised and managed $262M over four funds. He has made 100 investments (including both his angel and VC investment) in Israeli startup companies, 12 of which have reached an excess of $100M in value. Most recently, Jon founded and was the CEO of Vringo, publicly traded on NYSE MKT (VRNG).Steven Blumgart, the co-founder and Chairman of OurCrowd, is a leading investor and philanthropist. Steven was part of the senior management team at Glencore International (GLEN.LE) where he headed their aluminum business.Read more about Our Team

Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.







Past performance is no guarantee of future results.



Diversification and asset allocation do not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss.


          * Fidelity's goal is to make financial expertise broadly accessible and effective in helping people live the lives they want. With assets under administration of $5.6 trillion, including managed assets of $2.1 trillion as of September 30, 2016, we focus on meeting the unique needs of a diverse set of customers: helping more than 24 million people invest their own life savings, nearly 20,000 businesses manage employee benefit programs, as well as providing nearly 10,000 advisory firms with technology solutions to invest their own clients' money.
	
    

          1. Fidelity Management & Research Company and Fidelity Institutional Asset Management, as of 9/30/16. Data is unaudited. These figures reflect the resources of Fidelity Management & Research Company, a U.S. company, and its subsidiaries. Research professionals include portfolio managers, research analysts and research associates.
	
    

          2. Highly rated funds are defined as those funds that have a 4- or 5-Star Morningstar rating. For each fund, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar RatingTM metric each month by subtracting the return on a 90-day U.S. Treasury Bill from the fund's load-adjusted return for the same period, and then adjusting this excess return for risk. The top 10% of funds in each broad asset class receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) Although gathered from reliable sources, data completeness and accuracy cannot be guaranteed by Morningstar.
	
    

          3. You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time. Fidelity's government and U.S. Treasury money market funds will not impose a fee upon the sale of your shares, nor temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets because of market conditions or other factors.
	
    

          4. You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. The fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund's sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.


          5. You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Because the share price of the fund will fluctuate, when you sell your shares they may be worth more or less than what you originally paid for them. The fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund's sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.


Because of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.


          Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.
	
    

The securities of smaller, less well known companies can be more volatile than those of larger companies.


Because of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.


In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible.



Indexes are unmanaged. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.
