David Beitel’s decision to switch college majors from electrical engineering to computer science was a painful one.
“I got shocked pretty badly in one of our labs, and I thought (electrical engineering) might be more dangerous than writing software,” he said.

The safe choice proved to be the right choice for Beitel. After graduating from Cornell University with a master’s of engineering in computer science, he’s helped build two dynamic dot-coms as chief technology officer (CTO) at travel website Expedia and now Zillow — home of groundbreaking real estate valuation tools.
Beitel is passionate about making technology work for people in their everyday lives. He has been that way ever since he wrote his first program when he was 15. “It was a Christmas card database for my mom,” he said. That’s when he realized “computers are more than just playing games.”
Expedia, a travel website, and Zillow, a real estate website, deliver a range of content, tools and services that help consumers make smart decisions by putting oceans of information at their fingertips. Over the years, they’ve become the kings of their categories.
But that’s not the only thing Expedia, based in Bellevue, and Zillow, based in Seattle, have in common. They’ve both got Microsoft in their DNA — and so does Beitel.




Beitel landed in Redmond straight out of college as a software design engineer. He soon joined a team led by Lloyd Frink and Rich Barton that was developing a travel product — which turned out to be Expedia. When Microsoft spun off Expedia in 1999, Beitel rode out of Redmond with Frink and Barton and ultimately became CTO.
After 12 years at Expedia, Beitel accepted an offer from Frink and Barton to join them as CTO at a new company they were starting — Zillow. Besides being ready for a change, the Phoenix native was drawn by the opportunity to continue “working with people you like to work with who like each other and respect each other,” he said.

Zillow’s first incarnation — a site where people could buy and sell homes online — “flopped,” Beitel said. Zillow then reinvented itself as a site where people could obtain real estate information and services starting with estimated property values, which were dubbed Zestimates. When Zillow went live in 2006, it logged more than a million visitors in its first three days.
Building a system to collect data on millions of homes was “one of the most technically challenging things we’ve ever done,” Beitel said. “My role was to recruit the best engineers I could find to create Zestimates in an efficient way.”
Zillow wasn’t the first to develop an estimating tool, but it was the first to make it openly available to consumers, Beitel said. A stream of other innovations have followed. Zillow now offers Zestimates for rental properties and apps for mobile devices — with more than half of Zillow’s weekend traffic now coming from this channel.
The 43-year-old is on a restless quest to improve Zillow’s products and its business operations. Two or three times a year, he presides over weeklong hackathons of developers working intensively together on a project.




 


“A lot of neat ideas flow from that and people have fun doing it,” he said. Zillow also conducts frequent “A/B” tests in which it runs alternate versions of the website simultaneously to see which is faster. “We’re measuring things in milliseconds,” he said.
SEATTLE@BIZJOURNALS.COM | 206.876.5436
In his own words
 
David Beitel
Born: Phoenix, Ariz.
Raised: Conroe, Texas
First career job: My professional career started at Microsoft, where I joined the Pen Windows team after graduating from Cornell in 1992. I had interned at Microsoft the previous summer.
How you earned your first dollar: Mowing lawns and washing cars in the neighborhood in Texas where I grew up.
What inspired you to pursue a tech career: Initial programming on Apple IIc while in high school and then working with some of the developers on the Amiga OS in Germany during a summer internship at Commodore Computers after my high school graduation.
In your spare time you: Spend as much time as we can relaxing at our beach house on Vashon Island, play and watch sports — golf and basketball, primarily, drive my kids around the greater Seattle region for all their activities.
Guilty pleasure: Ice cream and movies
Favorite song: Most anything from Dave Matthews Band
Favorite movie: “Braveheart”
Favorite book: Most John Irving. I’m not a big reader, but one summer, I read most of Irving’s books and enjoyed many of them. “Cider House Rules” was one of my favorites.
Thing that would surprise people about you: I worked on a small cattle ranch in West Texas during the summers while growing up. I learned to drive (old Ford truck with stick shift on the column), shoot a .22 and lasso a calf. At $25 a day, it was not about the money. I have fond memories of the times on the ranch with the family that owned it.
Your next big personal thing: Celebrating my 20th wedding anniversary with my wife Joanna on a trip to Rome.

Learn more. Potential Listings Properties that may be coming to the market soon but are not yet found on a multiple listing service (MLS). They include pre-foreclosures, foreclosed homes and homes with a Make Me Move® price. Most of these properties are only found on Zillow. Foreclosed These properties are owned by a bank or a lender who took ownership through foreclosure proceedings. They may soon be listed for sale. These properties are not found on a multiple listing service (MLS). Pre-Foreclosure The lender initiated foreclosure proceedings on these properties because the owner(s) were in default on their loan obligations. Pre-foreclosures also include properties for which a foreclosure auction is scheduled. These properties are not found on a multiple listing service (MLS). Make Me Move Homes with a Make Me Move® price indicate the amount the owner(s) would be willing to sell for. They are exclusive to Zillow and a great way to learn about homes before they hit the market. For Rent  Recently Sold Open Houses only Include Pending listings A pending listing means a seller has accepted an offer from a buyer.

They are owned by a bank or a lender who took ownership through foreclosure proceedings. These are also known as bank-owned or real estate owned (REO). Coming Soon Coming Soon listings are homes that will soon be on the market. The listing agent for these homes has added a Coming Soon note to alert buyers in advance. Learn more. Potential Listings Properties that may be coming to the market soon but are not yet found on a multiple listing service (MLS). They include pre-foreclosures, foreclosed homes and homes with a Make Me Move® price. Most of these properties are only found on Zillow. Foreclosed These properties are owned by a bank or a lender who took ownership through foreclosure proceedings. They may soon be listed for sale. These properties are not found on a multiple listing service (MLS). Pre-Foreclosure The lender initiated foreclosure proceedings on these properties because the owner(s) were in default on their loan obligations. Pre-foreclosures also include properties for which a foreclosure auction is scheduled. These properties are not found on a multiple listing service (MLS). Make Me Move Homes with a Make Me Move® price indicate the amount the owner(s) would be willing to sell for. They are exclusive to Zillow and a great way to learn about homes before they hit the market. For Rent  Recently Sold Open Houses only Include Pending listings A pending listing means a seller has accepted an offer from a buyer. In some cases, the seller will accept backup offers.
