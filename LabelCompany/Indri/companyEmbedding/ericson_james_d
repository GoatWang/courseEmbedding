James D. Ericson
Retired Chairman,
Northwestern Mutual

James D. Ericson is Retired Chairman of Northwestern Mutual, Milwaukee, the nation’s largest seller of individual life insurance.  He retired from the company on July 31, 2001 but remained on the company’s Board of Trustees, the finance committee and the executive committee until 2006.  He was elected president, effective January 1, 1990.  He also served on the Board of Trustees of the company from 1989 until 2006.  Ericson joined the company in 1965 as an attorney and over the years served as assistant to the president, Director of Benefits, General Counsel, Executive Vice President – Investments, and Senior Executive Vice President. 
During each year of Ericson’s term the company was recognized by Fortune Magazine as the Most Admired Life Insurance Company in the United States and later in the World.  During his period the Company had very rapid sustained growth.  In 1996 the company became the largest seller of ordinary individual life insurance; in 1997 the largest payer of dividends to policy owners; in 1999 the sales force was rated number one in the entire country in any industry by Sales & Marketing Magazine (actually tied for number one with CISCO Systems). 
During his career he was active in state and federal issues concerning the industry and in 1999 became the Chairman of the American Council of Life Insurance and spoke at several international conferences.
 During his career he headed acquisition of Frank Russell Company (Russell Index), Mortgage Guarantee Insurance Corporation, and Robert W.
