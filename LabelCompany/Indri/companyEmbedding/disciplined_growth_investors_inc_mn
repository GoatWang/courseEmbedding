The Scrutiny To Act On Bold Ideas
Any new idea seems bold on its face. But with enough scrutiny, even the boldest idea can begin to seem apparent. Intense scrutiny creates the conviction to act on ideas. And in the end, an idea only seems bold to those without the conviction to act.

Insights












Ideas take curiosity, commitment and intellectual honesty to find, develop and nurture. At DGI, an idea must survive relentless scrutiny in order to grow into an actionable insight.


Ideas are built from other ideas and from collected experiences. That means the good as well as the bad. And because we learned from them, we prefer not to hide our mistakes.The following is a complete history of our published work (even a few based on insight we got completely wrong). These insights inform how we think about investing, and the world we have to do it in.

Philosophy







What we do isn’t magic, it’s work. It isn’t conceptually difficult to understand. It is, however, very difficult to execute.

















Investment Philosophy
There are three tenets that, together, drive Disciplined Growth Investors’ philosophy.The Power of Big Ideas – “Big ideas” are investments in companies that have a realistic probability of generating outsized returns for shareholders. Think appreciation of 10, 20 or even 50 times an initial investment. These companies often share certain key traits – a clarity of mission, huge addressable markets, management teams that balance the interests of all stakeholders and, most importantly, a sustainable competitive advantage. These businesses are admittedly rare, but the potential rewards are substantial.Disciplined Buyers – Finding a great business is only half the battle. Having the discipline to only purchase these companies at a price below their intrinsic value increases the likelihood of an attractive future return. And to be perfectly honest, we simply hate paying too much for a stock.Patience – We think in terms of years and decades, not months and days. Outsized financial returns do not happen overnight. Success is typically a tortuous path, one that requires ample patience.  We are willing to look foolish in the eyes of the market in the short-term, as long as the fundamentals of a company are sound. Experience has taught us that value creation will inevitably be rewarded. 

Investment Process
A sound investment philosophy requires a rigorous process to be successful.Idea Generation – There are no “magic” screens or filters that neatly isolate promising investment candidates. It requires looking under a great many rocks. Successful idea generation is the ability to recognize a great growth company when you see one. The knowledge gained from long holding periods, as well as a systematic examination of our winners, losers, misses and near misses has sharpened, and will continue to sharpen our ability to identify raw potential.Value Assessment – Our research process concentrates on one critical question, “What is this company really worth?” To answer it, we must first develop a comprehensive understanding of the business. We use that understanding to build a detailed financial model and to estimate normalized earnings today, as well as seven years in the future. Next we apply a time-tested valuation methodology, one derived from the teachings of Benjamin Graham, to make our assessment of intrinsic value.Portfolio Construction – When it comes to constructing portfolios, stock price volatility is the gift that keeps on giving. We exploit price volatility to purchase great businesses when they are temporarily “on sale” for reasons that we believe will have a minimal impact on the long-term value creating potential of the business. 

Risk Management
Our risk management process is designed to mitigate the risk most devastating to investors – a large, permanent loss of capital.Know What You Own – The Golden Rule of risk management is to know what you own. If we cannot develop a comprehensive understanding of the business and the industry in which it operates, we have no basis for owning that company. Period.Margin of Safety – We look to build a margin of safety into our purchase price. We start by using a reasonable set of assumptions in our financial projections. Then we bolster that margin of safety by employing a challenging hurdle rate—a relatively high expected return over time. A challenging hurdle rate reduces the initial purchase price, which hopefully results in an acceptable return, even if our growth assumptions prove faulty.Intelligent Allocation of Capital – The first two elements of our risk management process help to limit the number of mistakes that make their way into the portfolio. The intelligent allocation of capital is designed to avoid compounding potential mistakes. By allocating incremental capital toward positions that meet expectations and away from those that don’t, we essentially starve mistakes out of the portfolio.There are more detailed discussions about our investment philosophy and process in the “Insight” section of the website, as well as in our book, “Benjamin Graham and the Power of Growth Stocks.”

History







Disciplined Growth Investors was founded in Minneapolis in 1997 with a skeleton staff, a loyal client base, more than 700 million dollars in assets and the strong belief that there was a better way to manage money.


Despite some challenging economic periods and two of the worst bear markets of the past century, DGI’s meticulous investment methodology and strong culture enabled the firm to grow to over three billion dollars in assets under management.DGI’s success is the result of its desire to provide premium services at reasonable fees, its relentless focus on a single investment philosophy, its reliance on a lean, high-performance team, its willingness to subordinate its business objectives to its investment objectives, and the resoluteness of its loyal client base. 











12 B.C. 

A 12 year old Fred Martin buys his first shares of stock (a Roman column fabrication company). The stock did well for five centuries before collapsing in 476 during the fall of the Roman Empire. *For the lawyers: No, Fred Martin really isn’t (quite) that old, he never bought Roman column-fabricator stock and we have no idea how such stock might have performed.

Beliefs







It's so fundamental, it’s radical. Disciplined Growth Investors is an investment company that doesn’t fit the style box, normative category we compete in. You might say that we are old school. That we focus too heavily on fundamentals. We find it a little ironic that focusing on fundamentals is considered radical by so many. But we don’t mind.
Our job is to make money for our clients and ourselves. We do it by tearing companies apart, identifying critical insights, and then selecting positions that we can hold for years, not months.Investing this way requires us to own our decisions, the good and the bad. And it requires the tenacity to constantly scrutinize what we do and how we do it.

And it requires the tenacity to constantly scrutinize what we do and how we do it. 








A Prism Of Stewardship
We treat our clients’ money like it’s our own. Which is good, because nobody hates parting with a penny more than us. 

Humility Is Essential
How we handle success is as important as how we handle failure. When performance results are good, we strive to be quiet and humble. When results are not good, we strive to be assertive and clear. 

Culture Is The Foundation
Our people are everything. Everyone’s work is critical and important. We have no secretaries. Everyone has an office and every office is the same size. Except the corner office, which we use as a storage closet. 

Choosing Excellence
We strive for excellence in everything we do. Because there’s no perfection, we need the curiosity and intellectual honesty to continually reassess our efforts. If we focus on substance, everything else will take care of itself.

What our customers say ...








                                    We successfully raised investment after advertising our proposal on Angel Investment Network. We had over 10 interested parties, looking to help develop our UK retail websites selling designer watches online. Before selecting the right investor, which we have now signed a contract with, we have taken our watch sales to the next level. Thanks for all the help and keep up the good work :)                                







Daniel Richmond @ Tic Watches
 www.ticwatches.co.uk                                        








                                    Business advice, authentic and informative discussions, and inspiration for a new wave of new businesses were some of the benefits I observed. And the Investors? Well, they were a frank, no-frills bunch - professional, yet down-to-earth, with a wealth of wisdom on their side. Very professional, outstanding.

                                    Angel Investment Network were crucial in connecting us with top angel investors. AIN were very supportive and helpful throughout our fundraise, offering helpful advise, tips and importantly - contacts, along the way.
