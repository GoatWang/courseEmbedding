Flue Gas Treatment


                    Our products meet the latest emission standards for flue gas from metal smelters, steel mills, industrial boilers, cement kilns and power plants.
                
Incineration has long been used as an efficient and cost effective way to safely dispose of municipal and hazardous waste. However, in recent years, increasing environmental concerns have resulted in a more complete review and subsequent regulations for the emissions released in the resulting flue gas from waste to energy plants and also metal smelters, steel mills, industrial boilers, cement kilns and power plants.
Our engineers are experts in developing activated carbon specifically designed to efficiently remove flue gas contaminants. We work with you to understand your facility parameters, such as boiler type and combustion efficiency, fuel source, pollution control equipment configuration and flue gas temperature, to help you select the appropriate carbon, equipment and process packages for your needs.

We are the first manufacturer to introduce activated carbon products for flue gas treatment. The unique mesopore structure of our powdered activated carbon (PAC) provides superior adsorption properties. This means the highest removal efficiencies with the lowest dosing rates, reducing handling time and transportation costs. We are the preferred supplier in many flue gas industries due to our technology, reliability, supply assurance and innovation. As the worldwide market leader in PAC for flue gas purification, we provide high quality dosing installations and technical support.

Graphene-based additives & formulated solutions


                    We can deliver breakthrough performance with our best-in-class graphene-based products.
                
Graphene-based materials and graphenes are a family of industrial products produced using a variety of processes either from graphite or other precursors. These materials are typically a few-layered sheets of graphenes that are in the form of platelets and maintain some of the properties of pristine graphene (such as two-dimensional platelet shape, aspect ratio and graphitic bonding).
Leveraging our long history of experience with carbon materials, we are developing graphenes to create solutions that deliver breakthrough performance that can break trade-offs. Through in-house development and external collaborations, we have selected production routes that produce materials with unique morphologies and properties. We continue to develop and scale these capabilities in order to allow you to take full advantage of these performance benefits.

Applications

We are working with leading companies to solve some of their toughest problems with graphene nanoplatelet-containing compounds and masterbatches. In elastomers, we are finding that graphenes can increase modulus at a fraction of the loading of carbon black and thus can break important performance trade-offs offering our customers breakthrough product improvement and enable new applications. In plastics, graphene-oxide derived graphenes can deliver electrical conductivity at very low loadings and meet thermal stability, mechanical and cleanliness requirements.
Additionally, we are focused on the energy storage market, including Li-ion and Pb-acid batteries. We are working with several leading Li-ion battery producers to develop graphene-based dispersions that can deliver the long range conductivity that is needed to develop thicker electrodes with increased capacity. The morphology of graphenes allows for a formulation of low viscosity electrode pastes with good capacity. Our materials enable reductions in system costs for various applications in Pb-acid batteries.
Our conductive additive materials are valuable to many applications, such as:

Electrically conductive polymer compounds, composite materials, elastomers, coatings, battery electrodes and inks
Mechanically reinforced structural composites, elastomers and polymer compounds
Barrier films
Thermally conductive polymer compounds, composite materials, elastomers and coatings
Electromagnetic (EMI) shielding components


We are developing graphenes for a number of applications with selected collaborators and are interested in building a network of potential collaborators in both industry and academia to continue to advance our capabilities. If you are interested in using graphenes or are working in this area and would like to know more about our plans, please contact us.



”
Cabot has invested in the development of technologies for the production and use of graphenes by establishing a team that is focused on leveraging the company's experience in carbon materials to deliver graphene solutions that can break trade-offs for our customers and deliver unique performance.

History[edit]
Cabot Corporation was founded by Godfrey Lowell Cabot in 1882 when he applied for a patent for a "carbon black making apparatus".[citation needed] The company incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1960.[3][better source needed]
In 1993, a team of Cabot researchers developed a process for modifying the surface of carbon, allowing chemists and researchers to prepare surface modified carbon black products with properties never before associated with carbon materials.[4][better source needed] This breakthrough led to the development of new technologies and products including aqueous inkjet colorants,[5] for printer ink the basis of Cabot's Inkjet Colorants business unit, which was founded in 1996.
In 2003, Cabot developed a commercialized process that allows continuous production of aerogels under ambient conditions, which was the start of the company’s Aerogel business.[6][7] In 2009, Cabot completed construction of and began operating two additional rubber black production plants at its carbon black plant in Tianjin, China, increasing capacity to 150,000 metric tons.[2] In July 2012, Cabot purchased Norit NV, the largest producer of activated carbon, for $1.1 billion.[8]
Cabot sold its Supermetals business, which produced tantalum, niobium and related alloys, in 2011 to Global Advanced Metals Pty Ltd.[9]
Safety, health and environmental[edit]
Safety record[edit]
The company has reduced total recordable injuries by over 25% in the last five years.[10] However, the company experienced two fatalities in 2011. The severity of incidents has caused the company to look at all aspects of workplace safety.[11][better source needed]
Environmental record[edit]
Sam Bodman, CEO of Cabot during the coltan boom, was appointed in December 2004 to serve as President Bush’s Secretary of Energy. Under Bodman’s leadership from 1987 to 2000, according to Jason Leopold, Cabot was one of the U.S.’s largest polluters, accounting for 60,000 tons of airborne toxic emissions annually.[12]
Cabot reduced its Environmental Non-Conformance events (ENCs), from a high of over 80 incidences in 2008, to 17 in FY 2012.[13][better source needed] The company defines an environmental non-conformance event as a reportable spill or release, a Notice of Violation, a public complaint or certain permit deviations.
The company invested over $35 million in FY 2011 on environmentally-related capital projects to improve efficiency and maintain regulatory compliance. The company’s goal is a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emission intensity by 2020, using 2005 as the baseline year. One example of greenhouse gas reduction is a heat recovery advancement project to convert exhaust heat to steam at the company’s fumed metal oxides plant in Rheinfelden, Germany. The steam produced is used in the plant if needed or sold to a neighboring company. The project has the potential to reduce GHG emissions by 1,400 MTs each year.[14][better source needed]
Responsible care[edit]
In 2010 Cabot joined the American Chemistry Council,[15] and as such is obliged to implement the Council’s Responsible Care program as part of a global initiative.[16] Cabot is implementing RC 14001, which incorporates the requirements of both the ACC Responsible Care and the ISO 14001 Management Systems, for all its manufacturing facilities, beginning with those in North America.[17]
Sustainability[edit]
Cabot’s 2010/2011 sustainability report, titled "Sustainability Matters: Cabot Corporation’s 2010/2011 Sustainability Report," met all the informational requirements to receive an Application Level C certification from the Global Reporting Initiatives. Cabot’s adherence to GRI reporting standards affirms its commitment to more transparent and thorough reporting.[18]
Awards[edit]
In 2012, Cabot Corporation was selected as a Bronze Winner for the Ninth Annual Team Massachusetts Economic Impact Awards.[19] They were also selected as one of CR Magazine’s 100 Best Corporate Citizens for 2012.[20]
The American Chemistry Council honored Cabot with the Responsible Care Performance Award in April 2012 for helping the ACC meet industry-wide safety and product stewardship targets.[21] In April 2012, Cabot ranked forty-fourth among the top 100 leading companies that demonstrated superior management, mitigation and adaptation in the field of climate innovation.[22][23] Cabot was awarded a 2012 Leadership Award for the Massachusetts Excellence in Commuter Options Awards.[24]
Board of Directors[edit]
Cabot Corporation’s Board of Directors is chaired by non-executive John F. O'Brien, retired President and Chief Executive Officer Allmerica Financial Corp.[25][26]
Cabot Foundation[edit]
In 1953, the non-profit Cabot Corporation Foundation, Inc. was established, and the Foundation's charter was amended in 1992 to permit grants to qualified charitable organizations outside of the United States.[27][better source needed] Cabot has offered aid to earthquake victims in Japan,[28] and the Outward Bound organization.[29]

The company invested over $35 million in FY 2011 on environmentally-related capital projects to improve efficiency and maintain regulatory compliance. The company’s goal is a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emission intensity by 2020, using 2005 as the baseline year. One example of greenhouse gas reduction is a heat recovery advancement project to convert exhaust heat to steam at the company’s fumed metal oxides plant in Rheinfelden, Germany. The steam produced is used in the plant if needed or sold to a neighboring company. The project has the potential to reduce GHG emissions by 1,400 MTs each year.[14][better source needed]
Responsible care[edit]
In 2010 Cabot joined the American Chemistry Council,[15] and as such is obliged to implement the Council’s Responsible Care program as part of a global initiative.[16] Cabot is implementing RC 14001, which incorporates the requirements of both the ACC Responsible Care and the ISO 14001 Management Systems, for all its manufacturing facilities, beginning with those in North America.[17]
Sustainability[edit]
Cabot’s 2010/2011 sustainability report, titled "Sustainability Matters: Cabot Corporation’s 2010/2011 Sustainability Report," met all the informational requirements to receive an Application Level C certification from the Global Reporting Initiatives. Cabot’s adherence to GRI reporting standards affirms its commitment to more transparent and thorough reporting.[18]
Awards[edit]
In 2012, Cabot Corporation was selected as a Bronze Winner for the Ninth Annual Team Massachusetts Economic Impact Awards.[19] They were also selected as one of CR Magazine’s 100 Best Corporate Citizens for 2012.[20]
The American Chemistry Council honored Cabot with the Responsible Care Performance Award in April 2012 for helping the ACC meet industry-wide safety and product stewardship targets.[21] In April 2012, Cabot ranked forty-fourth among the top 100 leading companies that demonstrated superior management, mitigation and adaptation in the field of climate innovation.[22][23] Cabot was awarded a 2012 Leadership Award for the Massachusetts Excellence in Commuter Options Awards.[24]
Board of Directors[edit]
Cabot Corporation’s Board of Directors is chaired by non-executive John F. O'Brien, retired President and Chief Executive Officer Allmerica Financial Corp.[25][26]
Cabot Foundation[edit]
In 1953, the non-profit Cabot Corporation Foundation, Inc. was established, and the Foundation's charter was amended in 1992 to permit grants to qualified charitable organizations outside of the United States.[27][better source needed] Cabot has offered aid to earthquake victims in Japan,[28] and the Outward Bound organization.[29]

History[edit]
Cabot Corporation was founded by Godfrey Lowell Cabot in 1882 when he applied for a patent for a "carbon black making apparatus".[citation needed] The company incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1960.[3][better source needed]
In 1993, a team of Cabot researchers developed a process for modifying the surface of carbon, allowing chemists and researchers to prepare surface modified carbon black products with properties never before associated with carbon materials.[4][better source needed] This breakthrough led to the development of new technologies and products including aqueous inkjet colorants,[5] for printer ink the basis of Cabot's Inkjet Colorants business unit, which was founded in 1996.
In 2003, Cabot developed a commercialized process that allows continuous production of aerogels under ambient conditions, which was the start of the company’s Aerogel business.[6][7] In 2009, Cabot completed construction of and began operating two additional rubber black production plants at its carbon black plant in Tianjin, China, increasing capacity to 150,000 metric tons.[2] In July 2012, Cabot purchased Norit NV, the largest producer of activated carbon, for $1.1 billion.[8]
Cabot sold its Supermetals business, which produced tantalum, niobium and related alloys, in 2011 to Global Advanced Metals Pty Ltd.[9]
Safety, health and environmental[edit]
Safety record[edit]
The company has reduced total recordable injuries by over 25% in the last five years.[10] However, the company experienced two fatalities in 2011. The severity of incidents has caused the company to look at all aspects of workplace safety.[11][better source needed]
Environmental record[edit]
Sam Bodman, CEO of Cabot during the coltan boom, was appointed in December 2004 to serve as President Bush’s Secretary of Energy. Under Bodman’s leadership from 1987 to 2000, according to Jason Leopold, Cabot was one of the U.S.’s largest polluters, accounting for 60,000 tons of airborne toxic emissions annually.[12]
Cabot reduced its Environmental Non-Conformance events (ENCs), from a high of over 80 incidences in 2008, to 17 in FY 2012.[13][better source needed] The company defines an environmental non-conformance event as a reportable spill or release, a Notice of Violation, a public complaint or certain permit deviations.

History[edit]
Cabot Corporation was founded by Godfrey Lowell Cabot in 1882 when he applied for a patent for a "carbon black making apparatus".[citation needed] The company incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1960.[3][better source needed]
In 1993, a team of Cabot researchers developed a process for modifying the surface of carbon, allowing chemists and researchers to prepare surface modified carbon black products with properties never before associated with carbon materials.[4][better source needed] This breakthrough led to the development of new technologies and products including aqueous inkjet colorants,[5] for printer ink the basis of Cabot's Inkjet Colorants business unit, which was founded in 1996.
In 2003, Cabot developed a commercialized process that allows continuous production of aerogels under ambient conditions, which was the start of the company’s Aerogel business.[6][7] In 2009, Cabot completed construction of and began operating two additional rubber black production plants at its carbon black plant in Tianjin, China, increasing capacity to 150,000 metric tons.[2] In July 2012, Cabot purchased Norit NV, the largest producer of activated carbon, for $1.1 billion.[8]
Cabot sold its Supermetals business, which produced tantalum, niobium and related alloys, in 2011 to Global Advanced Metals Pty Ltd.[9]
Safety, health and environmental[edit]
Safety record[edit]
The company has reduced total recordable injuries by over 25% in the last five years.[10] However, the company experienced two fatalities in 2011. The severity of incidents has caused the company to look at all aspects of workplace safety.[11][better source needed]
Environmental record[edit]
Sam Bodman, CEO of Cabot during the coltan boom, was appointed in December 2004 to serve as President Bush’s Secretary of Energy. Under Bodman’s leadership from 1987 to 2000, according to Jason Leopold, Cabot was one of the U.S.’s largest polluters, accounting for 60,000 tons of airborne toxic emissions annually.[12]
Cabot reduced its Environmental Non-Conformance events (ENCs), from a high of over 80 incidences in 2008, to 17 in FY 2012.[13][better source needed] The company defines an environmental non-conformance event as a reportable spill or release, a Notice of Violation, a public complaint or certain permit deviations.
The company invested over $35 million in FY 2011 on environmentally-related capital projects to improve efficiency and maintain regulatory compliance. The company’s goal is a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emission intensity by 2020, using 2005 as the baseline year. One example of greenhouse gas reduction is a heat recovery advancement project to convert exhaust heat to steam at the company’s fumed metal oxides plant in Rheinfelden, Germany. The steam produced is used in the plant if needed or sold to a neighboring company. The project has the potential to reduce GHG emissions by 1,400 MTs each year.[14][better source needed]
Responsible care[edit]
In 2010 Cabot joined the American Chemistry Council,[15] and as such is obliged to implement the Council’s Responsible Care program as part of a global initiative.[16] Cabot is implementing RC 14001, which incorporates the requirements of both the ACC Responsible Care and the ISO 14001 Management Systems, for all its manufacturing facilities, beginning with those in North America.[17]
Sustainability[edit]
Cabot’s 2010/2011 sustainability report, titled "Sustainability Matters: Cabot Corporation’s 2010/2011 Sustainability Report," met all the informational requirements to receive an Application Level C certification from the Global Reporting Initiatives. Cabot’s adherence to GRI reporting standards affirms its commitment to more transparent and thorough reporting.[18]
Awards[edit]
In 2012, Cabot Corporation was selected as a Bronze Winner for the Ninth Annual Team Massachusetts Economic Impact Awards.[19] They were also selected as one of CR Magazine’s 100 Best Corporate Citizens for 2012.[20]
The American Chemistry Council honored Cabot with the Responsible Care Performance Award in April 2012 for helping the ACC meet industry-wide safety and product stewardship targets.[21] In April 2012, Cabot ranked forty-fourth among the top 100 leading companies that demonstrated superior management, mitigation and adaptation in the field of climate innovation.[22][23] Cabot was awarded a 2012 Leadership Award for the Massachusetts Excellence in Commuter Options Awards.[24]
Board of Directors[edit]
Cabot Corporation’s Board of Directors is chaired by non-executive John F. O'Brien, retired President and Chief Executive Officer Allmerica Financial Corp.[25][26]
Cabot Foundation[edit]
In 1953, the non-profit Cabot Corporation Foundation, Inc. was established, and the Foundation's charter was amended in 1992 to permit grants to qualified charitable organizations outside of the United States.[27][better source needed] Cabot has offered aid to earthquake victims in Japan,[28] and the Outward Bound organization.[29]

About Cabot Cheese
The farm families that own Cabot Creamery Co-operative love what they do. And they’ve been doing it for a long time—every single day since 1919. Almost 100 years later, we’re proud of our thriving farms, strong communities, and happy, healthy cows that produce the rich, buttery milk that we use to make Cabot’s award-winning cheese and dairy products. We like to think those awards mean we’re doing something right. Of course, you’re a big part of this too. If you love eating our cheese as much as we love making it, then we’ll get to keep doing what we do for generations to come. 
We’re in this together—and we’re grateful for your support.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Ask away.  We have answers.



Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
