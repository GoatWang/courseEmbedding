 Jose TMy wife and I were involved in a really bad auto collision. Of course it was Lloyd Baker who handled this case. Our vehicle was a total loss which caused us numerous injuries. We are extremely satisfied on how the case was handled and the final result. Long story short... our first Experience with this law firm was around 10 years ago. Relocating from Santa Barbara area in California to Las Vegas was not easy, but once the family was settled here I convinced my mother to move out here as well. Unfortunately a short time after she did, she was involved in a horrific car accident. Mother was T-boned at an intersection and she was severely injured.
It was a difficult time for the whole family and important decisions had to be made, like hiring a good and trustworthy attorney to handle the serious case. It was definitely a difficult decision due to the numerous Attorney advertisements. We called a few and visited a couple but we could not agree on one. We finally ended up in Mr. Lloyd Baker's office. After that first meeting we knew and agreed that he would be the attorney to handle mother's case. It was the best decision we made. The recovery was slow but successful and thorough the entire process they were there, 100%. We never felt like there was questions or doubts that they didn't have the answers to. Now in days, especially here in Las Vegas, TRUST is an extremely important matter. As a family man, Minister and local business owner, I am very careful where I put my word, but when it comes to these matters I do not hesitate for a second to Trust and recommend Lloyd Baker Law to Family and Friends.
Thank you Lloyd and all the Firm for exceeding our expectations.
Ooh, and as far as Mother's settlement... Let's just say, they took care of business.
Martin OI used Mr. Baker to help me with 2 car accident cases and a dispute with a business. I was very pleased with the helpful and professional way he took care of my situations. The outcome was very positive, I could tell he and his staff worked hard to make sure things were resolved in a timely manner.  He went above and beyond what I was expecting. I would recommend his services to anyone for experienced professional legal help.
Marla HMy daughter was in a bad accident and I am happy to say that Lloyd Baker and his associates took care of everything. They were professional and always took my phone calls - which is important but rare for attorneys. I was at ease throughout the whole process and am more than satisfied with the results. Lloyd Baker Attorneys is highly recommended.
Yolanda CI was referred to Lloyd Baker's office through a friend of mine after being injured in an auto accident. I was very pleased with the knowledge, attentiveness to my case and care that Lloyd Baker's staff provided me with during this process. I recommend anyone in need of a personal injury attorney to call Mr. Baker's office for a consult.
Brian RAt first i was just looking for some advice, but Lloyd Baker and his team assured me that I do have a case. His office will work with you on everything and you will be informed every step of the way. I hope I don't ever need his services ever again, as I do not want to ever be in any legal trouble, but if I do ever need an attorney again, Lloyd Baker is who I am calling!!
Vhari MWe were involved in two car accidents one month apart from each other. Both my husband and I were injured in both accidents and our cars were totaled. Our case was a complicated one, but Lloyd Baker and his team made everything so much easier and got us the compensation we deserved. They dealt with the insurance companies who were so difficult and so rude and caused us so many sleepless nights before our awesome attorney got involved. I highly recommend this office and I'm so pleased with the work they did for us.
Andie SGreat service! I've had other cases at other firms and this attorney's office was by far my best experience. The staff is knowledgeable, respectful, and they answer and return my calls. Do yourself a favor and use Lloyd Baker Attorneys for your personal injury case.
D. LivingstonI'm so thankful for Lloyd Baker and his team! I was referred to Lloyd's office several years ago to assist me with a traffic citation I received. The service his firm provided was free and they appeared in court on my behalf and my citation was reduced to a parking ticket. I was relieved! Unfortunately, last year I was involved in a motor vehicle accident. I didn't know what to do, but I remembered how his team helped me with my citation and I didn't think twice about calling him first after I started getting the run around from the insurance company.
During the process of treatment you become a little disconnected and set back. Lloyd's team is very professional, honest, compassionate and patient. My calls were always answered or returned right away, never rushed and I received excellent advice! Lloyd personally reached out to me on several occasions to see how I was doing. He reassured me that his team was doing everything possible to help me and he really wanted me to focus on getting better. I just wanted to say Thank you to all of you for your hard work and for finalizing my claim quickly! I'd feel very confident in referring your law firm to my family and friends!
Steve GI have been represented by Lloyd and his team for over two years following a head on collision. I would hate to be on the opposing end of his team. They are relentless and tenacious in their approach to anyone who attempts to hold back from their clients. I hope I never need Lloyd's services again or have to go through the pain, but if I or anyone I know is involved in an accident, Lloyd Baker Attorneys will be my first call.

Our case was a complicated one, but Lloyd Baker and his team made everything so much easier and got us the compensation we deserved. They dealt with the insurance companies who were so difficult and so rude and caused us so many sleepless nights before our awesome attorney got involved. I highly recommend this office and I'm so pleased with the work they did for us.
Andie SGreat service! I've had other cases at other firms and this attorney's office was by far my best experience. The staff is knowledgeable, respectful, and they answer and return my calls. Do yourself a favor and use Lloyd Baker Attorneys for your personal injury case.
D. LivingstonI'm so thankful for Lloyd Baker and his team! I was referred to Lloyd's office several years ago to assist me with a traffic citation I received. The service his firm provided was free and they appeared in court on my behalf and my citation was reduced to a parking ticket. I was relieved! Unfortunately, last year I was involved in a motor vehicle accident. I didn't know what to do, but I remembered how his team helped me with my citation and I didn't think twice about calling him first after I started getting the run around from the insurance company.
During the process of treatment you become a little disconnected and set back. Lloyd's team is very professional, honest, compassionate and patient. My calls were always answered or returned right away, never rushed and I received excellent advice! Lloyd personally reached out to me on several occasions to see how I was doing. He reassured me that his team was doing everything possible to help me and he really wanted me to focus on getting better. I just wanted to say Thank you to all of you for your hard work and for finalizing my claim quickly! I'd feel very confident in referring your law firm to my family and friends!
Steve GI have been represented by Lloyd and his team for over two years following a head on collision. I would hate to be on the opposing end of his team. They are relentless and tenacious in their approach to anyone who attempts to hold back from their clients. I hope I never need Lloyd's services again or have to go through the pain, but if I or anyone I know is involved in an accident, Lloyd Baker Attorneys will be my first call.

Lloyd W. Baker’s philosophy is that, “We treat our clients as our friends.” This ideal ensures that the Las Vegas, personal injury attorneys at Lloyd Baker will always do what is best for our clients, and that they will be satisfied with our results. In return, we always have plenty of clients and friends who refer us business, trusting us with their own friends and family.
Lloyd graduated with honors from California State University-Northridge with a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration and Finance. He received his Juris Doctorate from the Brigham Young University Law School, which is consistently ranked among the top 25 law schools in the nation.
After law school, Lloyd worked for one of Nevada’s largest insurance defense law firms, practicing in the areas of medical malpractice and insurance defense for large corporate insurance companies. After his two-year association with this firm, Lloyd established his own law office and for more than a decade has been aggressively representing accident victims against those insurance corporations who take advantage of innocent injured victims.
Lloyd feels an enormous sense of satisfaction in righting a wrong and helping innocent people get back on their feet. He has represented victims of motorcycle and car accidents, dog bites and animal attacks, wrongful death, severe injuries and insurance bad faith.
As a skilled negotiator and litigator, Lloyd is committed to his clients whether the case is large or small, or is settled or pursued in court. Each year, he recovers tens of millions of dollars for his clients. Lloyd believes that each client should receive the most fair and generous compensation in the most timely manner to allow victims, their families and their loved ones to move on with their lives after a tragedy.
Along with his work as an attorney, Lloyd enjoys weight training, running and the martial arts. He loves spending time with his three beautiful daughters, whether it’s wakeboarding in the summer or riding dirt bikes and four-wheelers in the cooler months. He always finds time for his family and friends, as relationships are extremely important to him in both his personal life and his professional life.

Consumers should be able to expect that the products they purchase are safe when used as intended and according to directions.
The reality, however, is that thousands of people each year suffer injuries or wrongful death as a result of defective products. If you are injured by a defective product, the Las Vegas product liability lawyers at Lloyd Baker Attorneys may be able to help you pursue financial compensation or refer you to a qualified consumer class action attorney depending on the circumstances of your case.
Product designers, manufacturers, distributors and retailers have a responsibility to provide consumers with products that are free of potentially dangerous defects and contain appropriate instructions and warnings. Yet a simple act of carelessness at any point between a product’s design and sale can put consumers at risk for injury.
In product liability cases, negligence often relates to:

Defects in the design or engineering of a product prior to production
Faulty manufacturing or product assembly
Product tampering or unintentional contamination that results in a risk to consumers
Marketing flaws such as inadequate safety warnings or incomplete instructions

Examples of defective products that are commonly the focus of product liability lawsuits include:

Motor vehicles including cars, trucks, motorcycles and all-terrain vehicles
Motor vehicle parts
Medical devices
Prescription drugs
Household appliances
Toys and recreational gear
