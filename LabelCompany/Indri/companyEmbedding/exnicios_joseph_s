Hancock Holding Co. said Wednesday that once its acquisition of Whitney Holding Corp. is complete, Joseph S. Exnicios will preside over the bank's operations in Louisiana and Texas. 
Exnicios has served as Whitney Bank's chief risk officer since 2008, a difficult position given that the New Orleans bank has struggled in recent years with problem loans that it made in Florida.
But Hancock President and CEO Carl Chaney said Wednesday that some of the best bankers in the industry are individuals who have come up through risk departments and helped financial institutions navigate challenging environments.
Once Hancock's takeover of Whitney is complete, banking sites in Alabama, Mississippi and Florida will operate under the Hancock Bank name, while locations in Louisiana and Texas will operate under the Whitney Bank name. Exnicios, who has a law degree from Loyola University and a bachelor's degree in business administration from Louisiana State University, will be President of Whitney Bank. He has been employed by Whitney since 1978.
Hancock also announced Wednesday that Suzanne C. Thomas will continue as Chief Credit Officer of Whitney Bank after the merger. Thomas has been with Whitney since 2000. 
John Hope, Whitney's current CEO, will retire once the merger is complete.
John Turner Jr., who currently serves as president of Whitney Bank, will work closely with Chaney and and John M. Hairston, who serves as dual chief executive officer for Hancock, on the transition even after the merger is complete.
"We need his background and his steady hand in the transition," Hairston said of Turner. 
Hairston also said Whitney's current leadership in commercial and consumer lending will remain intact, with those individuals overseeing the combined bank's lending operations in Louisiana.
Whitney Bank will be the larger of the two Hancock banking companies in terms of total assets, employees and other measures. In fact, of the $20 billion in assets the combined company will have, roughly $11 billion will be in Louisiana and controlled by Whitney Bank, according to Hairston. The Whitney Bank operations will be headquartered in New Orleans. Headquarters for Hancock Bank and for Hancock Holding will be in Gulfport, Miss.
The merger, which was announced Dec. 22, is subject to the approval of regulators and shareholders. Dates for the shareholders of Hancock and Whitney to meet and vote have not yet been set, Chaney said.
Once the deal is complete, current customers of Whitney may notice "expanded products as well as geographic locations," Chaney said.
While Whitney Bank has maintained a strong commercial banking focus, Hancock has traditionally focused on meeting the banking needs of consumers, Chaney said. The two banks also share similar cultures and business philosophies.
"We are very complementary. You end up with a very powerful" franchise when the two banks are combined, Chaney said.
"There's a whole lot more good that will come for clients rather than bad," Hairston said.
Chaney said that about two weeks after the merger was announced, he checked in with a Hancock-operated call center to see what questions operators were getting from customers about the deal.
The number one question, Chaney said, came from Hancock customers wondering if the deal would allow them to obtain checks and debit cards bearing the New Orleans Saints logo. Last year, Whitney announced a partnership with the Saints and rolled out a popular program that offers checks and debit cards bearing the NFL team's logo.
Chaney also said Whitney Bank, once it becomes a part of Hancock Holding, will continue to be involved as a sponsor in a range of community events.
"We fully intend to continue being a major corporate sponsor," he said.
Once the merger is complete, the combined company will have 305 branches, 390 ATMs and 5,000 employees in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida and Texas. It will be the 32nd largest bank holding company headquartered in the United States, according to Hancock.

2014 Alumnus of the Year
Mr. Joe S. Exnicios ’73
Longtime Whitney Bank executive and New Orleans community leader Joe Exnicios became Whitney Bank President in June 2011 upon completion of the Hancock Holding Company and Whitney Holding Company merger. A New Orleans native, Joe joined Whitney in 1978 and rose to become a Sr. Executive Vice-President and the Whitney’s Chief Risk Officer. Joe holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration from LSU (’77) and a Juris Doctorate from Loyola School of Law (’90). Joe also graduated from the prestigious Graduate School of Banking of the South, now the Graduate School of Banking at LSU (‘87).
Joe led Whitney’s Metro New Orleans Commercial Banking Division from 1999 through 2008 prior to becoming the company’s Chief Risk Officer. As Chief Risk Officer for Whitney, Joe led the company’s Credit Administration, Credit Review, Appraisal Review, Audit Services, Regulatory Compliance, Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering and Legal Department. During his term as Chief Risk Officer for Whitney, Joe established a formal bank wide Enterprise Risk Management Program, centralized the bank’s regulatory compliance function and reengineered Credit Review into a conventional risk-based credit review function. Joe has made numerous presentations to the investment community and dealt extensively with bank regulators in his role as Chief Risk Officer.
Long active in many local business and civic organizations, Joe is currently Chairman of the Board of the UNO Foundation and is a member of the UNO President’s Advisory Council. He serves on the Archbishop Hannan Community Appeal Executive Committee and chaired the 2005 and 2006 campaigns in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Joe is a past chairman of Catholic Charities, Archdiocese of New Orleans, the U.S. Navy League GNO Council, the Greater New Orleans Educational Television Board of Trustees WYES-TV12 and the Metropolitan Crime Commission. Other organizations that Joe has been involved with in the past include the Urban League of Greater New Orleans, The Catholic Foundation of the Archdiocese of New Orleans and the American Red Cross, Southeast Louisiana Council. Joe currently serves on the board of Junior Achievement of Greater New Orleans, the LSU Health Science Center Foundation, the United Way of Southeast Louisiana, Boy Scouts of America SELA Council and is a member of the Business Council of New Orleans. Joe is currently serving as the Chairman of the United Way’s 2013 Annual Campaign and serves on the I Will Give You Shepherds: the Campaign for Priestly Formation committee. Joe has also recently joined the Century Foundation Board.
A non-practicing Certified Public Accountant, Joe is a member of the Society of Louisiana CPAs, the AICPA and the Louisiana Bar Association. In 2006 Joe was awarded the Archdiocese of New Orleans Order of St. Louis Medal. Joe was recognized in 2008 by the Young Leadership Council as a Role Model and the Association of Fund Raising Professionals, Greater New Orleans Chapter as the 2008 Volunteer Fundraiser of the Year. In 2009 St. Elizabeth’s Guild recognized Joe as a Volunteer Community Leader and in 2011 Joe was recognized by Family Services of GNO as one of its Ten Outstanding People.
Joe and Debbie Exnicios were married in 1980 on Joe’s 25th birthday and they have a 22 year old daughter, Emily. In 2011 Joe and Debbie created the Joseph and Deborah Exnicios Family Fund with the Catholic Foundation of the Archdiocese of New Orleans. This fund was established to support efforts that are important to Debbie and Joe; their parish St. Pius X, the Archdiocese of New Orleans in general and the wider community. Through their fund Debbie and Joe have supported organizations and ministries including the Archbishop Hannan Community Appeal, St. Pius X, the Archdiocese campaign for the seminaries, I Will Give You Shepherds: The Campaign for Priestly Formation, Family Services of Greater New Orleans, WYES-TV12 capital campaign, the UNO Foundation and Covenant House, where in November of 2012 Joe joined 44 other business and community leaders to participate in the Covenant House Sleep Out where he slept outside in a sleeping bag the Thursday night before Thanksgiving as an expression of solidarity with the nearly one million homeless youth across the nation and here in New Orleans. A proud Crusader, Joe was the 1,000th graduate of Brother Martin High School in May, 1973.
