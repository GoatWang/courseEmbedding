Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

Launched in alliance with Jemstep the new platform will be fully supported by both Pershing and Envestnet, Advisor Group's primary clearing and advisory platform partners, respectively. The platform will enable advisors to seamlessly onboard new clients and open new accounts through one consolidated and entirely digital process accessible through any web-enabled electronic device, thereby eliminating most paperwork. The platform will support a broad spectrum of Advisor Group's advisory and brokerage solutions, encompassing data aggregation and account maintenance functions as well as a fully digital advice solution accessible through advisors' websites for clients who prefer a self-directed wealth management experience. Advisor Group expects to roll out the new platform during the fourth quarter of 2017. Advisor Group's new digital onboarding, advice and service platform is expected to address a number of crucial recurring challenges for advisors in the independent space as follows: Digital Onboarding and Paperless Workflows. The platform offers a greatly streamlined and paperless account opening process, both for traditional advisor-led client relationships and for client-driven relationships on the platform's fully-integrated digital advice solution. Following the onboarding process, the platform will provide clients with access to a secure, mobile-enabled web portal featuring paperless reporting and monitoring functionality, driving further practice efficiency for advisors and reducing unwanted paper deliveries for clients. Funding, Asset Transfers and Asset Allocation. The new platform is also expected to enable clients to more easily transfer assets from other institutions to their brokerage and advisory accounts as needed by initiating a paperless, e-signature-based transfer process at the client's discretion. Through seamless integration with both Pershing (for brokerage accounts) and Envestnet (for advisory solutions), the new platform will allow advisors to quickly and efficiently allocate client assets to the most appropriate investment solutions across the full range of Advisor Group's offerings. Account Aggregation. The new platform will enable the firm's financial advisors and their clients to view all client assets through a single consolidated interface. This will include the ability to view assets held at other institutions, such as bank balances and 401(k) assets, through the client portal. In addition to offering clients the convenience of consolidated reporting and monitoring across all their assets, this functionality is expected to drive new opportunities for advisors to increase their "wallet share" by identifying new ways to serve existing clients. Digital Advice. The digital advice component of the new platform will enable the firm's advisors to effectively serve a broader range of account sizes by allowing them to engage select clients through the platform's fully-integrated Jemstep Advisor Pro digital advice solution. The digital advice solution can be customized as an advisor-branded offering and can be made accessible to investors seeking a personally-driven wealth management experience through the advisor's website.
