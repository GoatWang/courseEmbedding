The aim of the City National Rochdale Funds is simple. We seek competitive performance through active and disciplined investment management that includes a strong commitment to style consistency.

Designed to offer a full spectrum of investments, the City National Rochdale Funds fit the various risk and return preferences of most investors. Using the full family of funds, investors may create an optimal portfolio or round out their current asset allocation strategy.

            City National Rochdale Funds are distributed by SEI Investments Distribution Co. (SIDCO), which is not affiliated with City National Rochdale. Check the background of SIDCO on FINRA’s BrokerCheck.


You could lose money by investing in the money market funds. Although the money market funds seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.



	
	City National Rochdale Funds do not generally accept investments by non-U.S. persons and may not be available in all states.
	

	To determine if these Funds are an appropriate investment for you, carefully consider each Fund's investment objectives, risk factors and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's full or summary prospectus which may be obtained by clicking here or by calling 1-888-889-0799. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
	

	Investment products are not bank deposits or obligations of or guaranteed by City National Bank or any subsidiary or affiliate and are not insured by the FDIC, and may lose value. Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Investment Manager for the City National Rochdale Funds is City National Rochdale, LLC, a subsidiary of City National Bank.
	
	Bond and bond funds will decrease in value as interest rates rise.  Funds that invest primarily in the securities of a single state may be more volatile and susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting those obligations.  High yield bonds involve greater risk of default or downgrade and are more volatile than investment-grade securities, due to the speculative nature of their investments.  Investments in smaller companies typically exhibit higher volatility.  Asset Allocation and diversification may not protect against market risk.  
    International investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from social, economic or political instability in other nations.  Emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and lower trading volume. There may be a significant change in legislation or policy affecting taxation on dividends, which may affect the performance of the Fund.

I.��Standards
  of Conduct

Six
  Point Summary





C

The
  interests of the Firm�s clients are paramount; avoid even the appearance
  of acting other than in the best interests of a client.
  









C

Keep
  all matters relating to the Firm or its clients strictly confidential.
  









C

Firm
  Employees may not
  participate in any IPO or secondary offering under any circumstances.
  This
  includes immediate family members of Firm employees wherein firm
  employees
  directly or indirectly support in such family member or have beneficial
  interest in such family member�s
  account.









C

Firm
  Employees may not facilitate participation by any client of the Firm
  in
  any IPO or secondary offering without the prior written approval
  of
  Management or a Designated Principal;










C

Firm
  Employees may not
  purchase any privately placed security without the prior written
  approval
  of Management or a Designated Principal or his
  designee.









C

Firm
  Employees are forbidden from trading, either personally or on behalf
  of
  others on material non-public inside information (insider trading)
  and
  from communicating or disseminating material non-public inside information
  to others (tipping).





A.��Improper
  Conduct: General. 
In
  general, it is inappropriate for any person associated with Rochdale to engage
  in any conduct that would give rise to an implication that such person was
  acting other than in the best interests of the Firm�s clients, including the
  Trust. As more fully discussed below, the Firm has adopted specific procedures
  designed to eliminate, to the greatest extent possible, investment related
  situations that might give rise to conflicts of interests between the Firm
  and
  its personnel on the one hand and the Firm�s clients on the other. Conduct
  outside of the investment arena could also affect the Firm�s reputation for
  integrity and fair dealing and Firm personnel are expected to refrain from
  engaging in such conduct. It is, of course, not possible to enumerate all
  conduct that might be deemed inappropriate. It is not, however, the intent
  of
  this Policy to prohibit the everyday courtesies of business life. The following
  examples are offered as guidance and should be applied with sound judgment
  and
  common sense:

It
  would
  be improper for any employee, officer or director of the Firm (hereinafter,
  Firm
  Employee), without written authorization from the Firm�s Management or
  Designated Principal to:

(i)
  engage in any self-dealing or other transactions benefiting a Firm Employee
  at
  the expense of the Firm or its clients. 

(ii)
  accept a gift, gratuity, or bequest, particularly from a client or an
  organization, such as a brokerage firm with which the Firm does business (Firm
  Supplier) if such acceptance would give rise to any
  implication of improper influence. (Advertising or promotional material or
  gifts
  recognizing established relationships with Firm Suppliers of a value not
  exceeding $100 per source would generally not be deemed to give rise to such
  an
  implication. Always consult with the Compliance Department before accepting
  any
  gift, gratuity of bequest.)

(iii)
  borrow money from or lend money to a client or Firm Supplier, except that loans
  from a bank or margin purchases through a brokerage firm that are clients or
  Firm Suppliers is permissible provided that no special terms are arranged for
  the benefit of a Firm Employee.

(iv)
  invest in business ventures sponsored by a client or a Firm Supplier, except
  that investments in publicly traded securities of highly capitalized, listed
  issuers would generally be permissible.

(v)
  make
  any contributions or expenditures for political candidates on behalf of the
  Firm
  without the written consent of the Firm, provided that Firm Employees
  individually may campaign for or contribute to candidates of their choice
  subject to the provisions of RIM Securities� and Rochdale Investment
  Management�s Written Supervisory Procedures and Rochdale investment Management�s
  Compliance Manual.

(vi)
  engage in any conduct for another business, accept employment outside of the
  Firm or serve on the board of any public company without the approval of the
  Firm. Firm Employees who serve as directors or trustees of any non-public
  company or nonprofit organizations are encouraged to report relevant information
  to the Firm's Management or Designated Principal.

�
(vii)
  trade, either personally or on behalf of others, on material non-public inside
  information and from communicating or disseminating material non-public inside
  information to others (tipping). Specific information relating to this matter
  are set forth in Section III of this Policy.

(viii)
  cause another person to do something on behalf of a Firm Employee that he or
  she
  could not have done personally.

B.��Special
  Responsibilities of Firm Employees with respect to the Trust.
Neither
  the Firm, nor any Firm Employee may, in connection with the purchase or sale,
  directly or indirectly, of a security or otherwise:
�






(i)
  

�employ
  any device, scheme or artifice to defraud the
  Trust;









�

(ii)

������� 

make
  any untrue statement of a material fact to the Trust or omit
  to state a
  material fact necessary in order to make the statements made
  to the Trust,
  in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
  misleading;
  









(iii)

�engage
  in any act, practice or course of business that operates or
  would operate
  as a fraud or deceit on the Trust;
  or









(iv)

�engage
  in any manipulative practice with respect to the
  Trust.







�
��������C.�����Confidentiality.�
The
  nature of the Firm�s business is such that employees may be in possession of
  confidential, proprietary or market-sensitive information, including material
  non-public inside information. All employees have an obligation to respect
  and
  protect the confidential nature of relationships with and information about
  former, present and prospective clients, portfolio relationships with and
  information about former, present and prospective clients, portfolio companies
  and suppliers of the Firm. Any such information that is acquired by employees
  in
  the course of the Firm�s business must be kept confidential and may be used
  solely for proper purposes of the Firm. Under no circumstances shall an employee
  disclose such information to unauthorized persons or use or assist others in
  using confidential information for personal gain. 

In
  addition to information concerning other companies or persons, confidential
  information about the Firm or its employees should not be disclosed to persons
  outside the Firm, or to employees who have no reasonable need for such
  information in the course of their duties, nor should any employee use or assist
  others in using confidential information for personal gain or any other reason.
  This principle applies, among other matters, to investment policy and strategy,
  trade secrets, pricing information (especially non-public fee schedules),
  internal policies and financial status. In addition, the Firm is, from time
  to
  time, party to confidentiality agreements that prohibit Firm Employees from
  disclosing confidential information to any one outside of the Firm and may
  be
  subject to suit in the event that the terms of any such agreement are
  breached.

D.��Compliance
  with Applicable Laws.
All
  employees must comply with all the applicable state and federal securities
  laws.

II.��Reporting

�
G.�Responsibility
  to Report:
  The
  responsibility for taking the initiative to report is imposed on each individual
  required to make a report. 

III.��Employee
  Personal Trading Procedures







A.

Securities
  Accounts of Firm Employees.







Each
  Firm
  Employee is required to adhere to the following procedures in connection with
  securities transactions effected for his or her own account (Personal Securities
  Accounts). The procedures described below are also applicable to securities
  transactions made in any account in which the Firm Employee has a Beneficial
  Ownership Interest or over which the Firm Employee has direct, indirect or
  shared influence or control (Related Accounts, i.e. spouse). In addition, there
  is an ongoing duty for each employee to advise the Compliance Department of
  any
  such new accounts opened during the course of their employment. 





B.

Prohibition
  on Personal
  Trading:�









1.��

Acquisition
  of �Hot Issues� Prohibited.




It
  is the
Firm�s
  policy
  that neither the Firm nor any Firm Employee may participate in any initial
  public offering or secondary offering (�Hot Issues�), either directly or in a
  Related Account. In addition, it is the policy of the Firm that the Firm will
  not facilitate the direct acquisition of Hot Issues by individual clients.
  The
  principle underlying this prohibition is twofold. First NASD Rules prohibit
  the
  purchase of Hot Issues by employees of NASD Member firms of which RIM Securities
  is a member. Second, if a Firm Employee (or the Firm itself) participates in
  such an offering and does not make the opportunity to acquire the issue
  available to those of the Firm�s clients for whom such an investment may be
  suitable, there arises an implication that the Firm Employee (or the Firm)
  has
  his or her own interests ahead of those of the client.1�Notwithstanding
  this prohibition, the Firm�s Management and/or Designated Principal or his/her
  designee, in their sole discretion, may approve the acquisition of a Hot Issue
  by a Firm client in circumstances that permit Management or a Designated
  Principal or his designee to reasonably determine that the opportunity to
  acquire the security has been made available to the person for reasons other
  than the person�s relationship with the Firm or its clients, such as when the
  opportunity to participate in the offering results from a pre-existing ownership
  of an interest in the issuer or an investor in such issuer, or other
  substantial, pre-existing relationship. Any such approval must be requested
  and
  approved in writing prior to effecting the transaction in question.

2.�����Private
  Placements.

  e.g.
In
  the
  Matter of Speaker and Janus,
  Investment Advisers Act Release No. 1605 (January 13, 1997); In
  the
  Matter of Joan Conan
  Investment Advisers Act Release No. 1446 (September 30,
1994).

�







�Page

Code
  of
  Ethics










�
Neither
  the Firm nor any Firm Employee may acquire an interest in an offering of
  securities that are exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933
  (Private Placements or Limited Offering Securities) unless approval of such
  acquisition is requested and approved in writing by Management or a Designated
  Principal or his designee in
  advance
  of the
  purchase. Such approval may be granted in cases where the acquisition does
  not
  conflict with the policies underlying this Policy, or the interests of the
  Firm
  or its clients and in circumstances in which the opportunity to acquire the
  security has been made available to the person for reasons other than the
  person�s relationship with the Firm or its clients. The purchase by or transfer
  to any Firm Employee of securities issued by the Firm or any of its affiliated
  entities is deemed approved in advance.








3.

Purchasing
  Securities on the Watch or Restricted
  List.






The
  Firm
  currently maintains both a Watch List and a Restricted List of securities that
  the firm is analyzing or recommending for client transactions. Analyst employees
  are responsible for updating both lists promptly as required. Securities should
  be placed on the Watch List when the Analyst decides to initiate coverage of
  the
  security as a potential candidate for a trade recommendation or research report.
  Securities should be removed from the Watch List when the Analyst decides to
  cease coverage and the security is no longer a potential candidate for a trade
  recommendation or research report. Securities should be placed on the Restricted
  List at the time the Analyst becomes aware that any of the following events
  will
  occur: 1) a research report will be issued on a security 2) an initial purchase
  of a security across all client accounts of fund; or 3) the substantial
  liquidation of a fund or client position in a security. For initial purchases
  or
  liquidations the security shall remain restricted for 10 days to allow all
  clients to enter or exit their positions. For liquidations however, a security
  may be removed from the Restricted List prior to the end of the 10 day
  restricted period if the Analyst confirms that the security is not held in
  any
  fund or client account.

Trust
  Access Persons are prohibited from executing transactions in any security listed
  on the Restricted List. Trust Access Persons may execute transactions in
  securities listed on the Watch List in accordance with the pre-clearance
  procedures below.






4.

Improper
  Transactions.�




If
  a case
  should arise where it appears that, in contravention of this Policy, Management
  or a Designated Principal may require such transactions to be unwound and/or
  may
  impose other sanctions, as deemed appropriate by the Firm. 

C.
  Special
  Trading Prohibitions for Research Analysts

1-NASD
  Rule 2711:�No

  purchase or receive any securities before the issuer�s initial public offering
  if the issuer is principally engaged in the same types of business as companies
  that the research analyst follows

b-May
  through their account purchase or sell any security issued by a company that
  the
  research analyst follows , or any option on or derivative of such security,
  for
  a period beginning thirty (30) calendar days before and ending five (5) calendar
  days after the publication of a research report concerning the company or a
  change in a rating or price target of the companies securities;
  however:



���

The
  Firm may permit a research analyst account to sell securities held
  by the
  account that are issued by a company that the research analyst follows,
  within thirty (30) calendar days after the research analyst began
  following the company for the Firm
  ;







���

The
  Firm may permit a research analyst account to purchase or sell any
  security issued by a subject company within thirty (30) calendar
  days
  before the publication or a research report or change in the rating
  or
  price target of the subject company�s securities due to significant news
  or a significant event concerning the subject company, provided that
  the
  Compliance Department pre-approves the research report and any changes
  in
  the rating or price target.




c-May
  through their account, purchase or sell any security or any option on or
  derivative of such security in a manner inconsistent with the research analyst�s
  recommendation as reflected in the most recent research report published by
  the
  Firm.

d-For
  the
  purposes of this section the term �their account� means any account in which a
  research analyst or member of the research analyst's household has a financial
  interest, or over which such analyst has discretion or control, other than
  an
  investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940.This
  term
  does not include a "blind trust" account that is controlled by a person other
  than the research analyst or member of the research analyst's household where
  neither the research analyst nor a member of the research analyst's household
  knows of the account's investments or investment transactions. The term "Member
  of a research analyst's household" means any individual whose principal
  residence is the same as the research analyst's principal
  residence.

  authorize a transaction otherwise prohibited under (c) (2) and (c) (3) based
  upon an unanticipated significant change in the persona l financial
  circumstances of the beneficial owner of the research analyst account
  provided:



���

The
  Compliance Department authorizes the transaction before it is
  entered;

Each
  exception is granted in compliance with polices and procedures adopted
  by
  the Firm that are reasonably designed to ensure that these transactions
  do
  not create a conflict of interest between the professional
  responsibilities and the personal trading activities of the research
  analyst; and







���

The
  Firm maintains a written record concerning the transaction and the
  justification for permitting the transaction for three years following
  the
  date of the transaction approved






IV.�Trade
  Pre-Clearance Requirements-
  All
  Firms employees are required to have their securities trades pre-cleared by
  the
  Compliance Department in accordance with the procedures below: 

E.��
  Procedures:
  



1.��

When
  Clearance is required:
  Notwithstanding
  the foregoing, all persons not deemed Trust Access Persons (see Appendix
  B-2) are not required to obtain pre-clearance for transactions of
  up to
  1,000 shares of securities of companies within the Standard & Poor's
  500 Index (�S&P 500�) or transactions of up to 500 shares of non
  S&P 500 securities. During any calendar month such transactions may
  not total more than 2,000 shares per side (buy or sell) for S&P 500
  securities or 2,000 shares per side for non S&P 500 securities. Any
  transactions in excess of these thresholds must be pre-cleared by
  the
  Compliance Department. All such securities are subject to all reporting
  requirements under this Policy.





Trust
  Access Persons are required to obtain pre-clearance from the Compliance
  Department for all security trade requests. 

Additionally,
  all employees will be required to receive prior approval from the Compliance
  Department before executing any transactions in any Rochdale funds of any
  size

Applicable
  Accounts:
  This
  rule also applies to all accounts involving immediate family members as well
  as
  those in which an employee has a beneficial interest in or discretion over.
  Immediate family� member is defined as a parent, child, sibling, spouse, or
  in-law who resides with the employee or any person financially dependent on
  the
  employee. �Beneficial interest� means any economic interest, such as the right
  to share in gains or losses.





2.��

Time
  of Clearance:
  All pre-clearance requests will be thoroughly reviewed by the Compliance
  Department prior to granting approval. Therefore, all employees are
  advised to allow adequate time for review when requesting pre-clearance.
  In order to allow for adequate time for review, pre-clearance requests
  for
  same day trades should be submitted to the Compliance Department
  by 2pm.
  If request is received after 2pm, approval may not be given until
  the
  following day. Rochdale will not be held liable for any losses to
  employee
  due to market fluctuations or delays in providing approval for any
  trade
  request. When possible these requests will be reviewed and either
  approved
  or declined prior to the close of the trading day. All employees
  should
  note that same day trading pre-clearance is not guaranteed and approval
  may be given after the market closes. Pre-clearance approvals expire
  3
  business days after date of approval. Transactions after the expiration
  date or in excess of the size approval was granted require new
  pre-clearance. 




�






�Page�8
Code
  of
  Ethics










�



3.��

Form:�Employees
  seeking authorization to enter into transactions requiring pre-clearance
  are required to send a written request to the Compliance Department
  (email
  is acceptable). Such requests will require that all details (size,
  security name/ ticker, buy/sell request) of proposed transaction
  be
  clearly set forth. If requested transaction is for options, warrants
  or
  other, additional information may be requested. Upon approving requested
  transaction, the Compliance Department will send approval via email
  or
  other means. Further, the Compliance Department shall maintain a
  record of
  all pre-clearance authorizations granted for as long as required
  by
  law.





F.���Factors
  Considered in Clearance of Personal Transactions:
The
  Compliance Department may refuse to grant clearance of a personal transaction
  in
  their sole discretion without being required to specify any reason for refusal.
  Generally, the Compliance Department will consider the following factors in
  determining whether or not to authorize a proposed transaction:




1.��

Whether
  the amount or nature of the transaction, or the person entering into
  the
  transaction, is likely to affect price or market for the Security;
  







2.��

Whether
  the individual making the proposed purchase or sale is likely to
  benefit
  from purchases or sales in the same or similar security being made
  or
  being considered by the trust or a private client;
  and







3.��

Whether
  the security proposed to be purchased or sold is one that would qualify
  for purchase or sale by the trust or private
  client.





V.��Insider
  Trading Policy

Five
  Point Summary



C������
  ��

The
  making of investment decisions based on material non-public inside
  information is prohibited;








C������
  ��

Communicating
  material non-public inside information to others is
  prohibited.







C���������

Information
  is non-public inside information if it is not generally known to
  the
  marketplace. 







C������
  ��

Information
  is considered material if is likely to be considered important by
  a
  reasonable investor in making an investment
  decision.







C������

Violation
  of the Firm�s Insider Trading Policy can result in violations of Federal
  law that may carry civil and/or criminal
  penalties.





The
  elements of insider trading and the penalties for such unlawful conduct are
  discussed below. If, after reviewing this policy statement, you have any
  questions you should contact the Firm�s Chief Compliance
  Officer.


A.��Prohibition.
  
Rochdale
  forbids any Firm Employee from trading, either personally or on behalf of
  others, on material non-public information or communicating material non-public
  information to others in violation of the law. This conduct is frequently
  referred to as "insider trading." The Firm prohibits any employee from trading,
  either personally or on behalf of others (including any funds and private
  accounts managed by the Firm) on material non-public inside information and
  prohibits communication or dissemination of material non-public inside
  information to others (tipping) in violation of the law. The
  Firm�s policy applies to every officer, director and employee and extends to
  activities within and outside their duties at the Firm. �

B.��What
  is
  Insider Trading? 
The
  term
  "insider trading" is not defined in the federal securities laws, but generally
  is used to refer to the use of material non-public information to trade in
  securities (whether or not one is an "insider") or the communications of
  material non-public information to others. While the law concerning insider
  trading is not static, it is generally understood that the law prohibits:

�






�Page�9
Code
  of
  Ethics










�
1-trading
  by an insider, while in possession of material non-public information, or


2-trading
  by a non-insider, while in possession of material non-public information, where
  the information either was disclosed to the non-insider in violation of an
  insider's duty to keep it confidential or was misappropriated, or ,

3-communicating
  material deemed non-public information, to others.
�



C.��

Identifying
  Inside Information.
  



Before
  trading for yourself or others in the securities of a company about which
  you
  may have potential inside information, ask yourself the following questions:
  

�



���

Is
  this information that an investor would consider important in making
  his
  or her investment decisions? 





���

Is
  this information that would substantially affect the market price
  of the
  securities if generally disclosed? 





���

What
  is the source of the information? 





���

Has
  the information been effectively communicated to the marketplace?�
  2�
�



If,
  after
  consideration of the above, you believe that the information is material
  and
  non-public, or if you have questions as to whether the information is material
  and non-public, you should report the matter to Management or Designated
  Principal or is Designee and refrain from trading with respect to the security
  involved and refrain from communicating the information in question to any
  one
  other than Management or Designated Principal or his Designee, either inside
  or
  outside of the Firm until you have received instructions on the matter from
  Management or Designated Principal or his Designee. The elements of insider
  trading and the penalties for such unlawful conduct are discussed
  below.
(i)�����Who
  is an Insider?
  

The
  concept of "insider" is broad. It includes officers, directors and employees
  of
  a company and may include principal shareholders. In addition, a person
  can be a
  "temporary insider" if he or she enters into a special confidential relationship
  in the conduct of a company's affairs and as a result is given access to
  information solely for the company's purposes. A temporary insider can
  include,
  among others, a company's attorneys, accountants, consultants, bank lending
  officers, and the employees of such organizations. In addition, Rochdale
  may
  become a temporary insider of a company it advises or for which it performs
  other services. According to the Supreme Court, the company must expect
  the
  individual to keep the disclosed non-public information confidential and
  the
  relationship must at least imply such a duty before the individual will
  be
  considered an insider.

�
ii)�����What
  is Material Information?
  

Trading
  on inside information is not a basis for liability unless the information is
  material. "Material information" generally is defined as information for which
  there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider
  it
  important in making his or her investment decisions, or information that is
  reasonably certain to have a substantial effect on the price of a company's
  securities.3�
�
(iii)�����What
  is Non-public Information?
  
Information
  is non-public until it has been effectively communicated to the market place.
  One must be able to point to some fact to show that the information is generally
  public. For example, information found in a report filed with the SEC, or
  appearing in Reuters
  Economic Services,
  The
  Wall Street Journal
  or other
  publications of general circulation would be considered public.

(iv)�����What
  are the Penalties for Insider Trading?
  
Penalties
  for trading on or communicating material non-public information are severe,
  both
  for individuals involved in such unlawful conduct and their employers. A person
  can be subject to some or all of the penalties below even if he or she does
  not
  personally benefit from the violation. Penalties include civil injunctions,
  treble damages, disgorgement of parties, jail sentences, fines for the person
  who committed the violation of up to three times the profit gained or loss
  avoided, whether or not the person actually benefited, and fines for the
  employer or other controlling person of up to the greater of $1,000,000 or
  three
  times the amount of the profit gained or loss avoided. In addition, any
  violation of this policy statement can be expected to result in serious
  sanctions by Rochdale, including dismissal of the persons involved.


2�For
  example, information that has been published in a newspaper or magazine
  of
  general publication, such as Reuters or The Wall Street Journal would be
  deemed
  to have been effectively communicated to the public.




3�Examples
  of information that should be presumed material include but are not
  limited to
  information relevant to dividend changes, earnings estimates, significant
  changes in relationships with clients, suppliers and key personnel,
  mergers or
  acquisitions, major litigation or significant new products or discoveries.
  This
  list is not exhaustive. 



�
�
�







�Page�10
Code
  of
  Ethics











It
  is
  important to note that, a situation in which a person can trade in possession
  of
  material non-public information without breaching a duty is rare, complex
  and
  uncertain so that the only safe course is not to trade, tip or recommend
  securities while in possession of material non-public information.

(v)

Any
  Firm Employee who serves an advisor of a fund or as its investment
  advisor.







Personal
  Securities Account
  means
  any securities or brokerage account of the individual employee.

Related
  Account means
  any
  securities account in which the individual employee has Beneficial Ownership
  Interest.

Beneficial
  Ownership Interest
  of a
  security is defined under Rule 16a-1 (a)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act
  of
  1934, which provides that a Firm Employee should consider himself/herself
  the
  beneficial owner of securities held by his/her spouse, his/her minor children,
  a
  relative who shares his/her home, or other persons, directly or indirectly,
  if
  by reason of any contract, understanding, relationship, agreement or other
  arrangement, he/she obtains from such securities benefits substantially
  equivalent to those of ownership. He/she should also consider himself/herself
  the beneficial owner of securities if he/she can vest or reinvest title in
  himself/herself now or in the future. 

For
  purposes of the Code, you will be deemed to have a beneficial interest in
  a
  security under the following circumstances: 



���

securities
  you own, no matter how they are registered, and including securities
  held
  for you by others (for example, by a custodian or broker, or by a
  relative, executor or administrator) or that you have pledged to
  another
  (as security for a loan, for example);






���

securities
  held by a trust of which you are a beneficiary (except that, if your
  interest is a remainder interest and you do not have or participate
  in
  investment control of trust assets, you will not be deemed to have
  a
  beneficial interest in securities held by the
  trust);






���

securities
  held by you as trustee or co-trustee, where either you or any member
  of
  your immediate family (i.e.,
  spouse, children or descendants, stepchildren, parents and their
  ancestors, and stepparents, in each case treating a legal adoption
  as
  blood relationship) has a beneficial interest (using these rules)
  in the
  trust.






���

securities
  held by a trust of which you are the settlor, if you have the power
  to
  revoke the trust without obtaining the consent of all the beneficiaries
  and have or participate in investment
  control;





�
5Under
  Rule 17j-1, certain officers and/or employees of any company that controlled
  the
  Firm would also be deemed a Trust Access Persons. Because the Firm is
  controlled
  solely by Jonathan J. Hirtle and Donald E. Callaghan, this provision
  is
  inapplicable.










�Page�21
Code
  of
  Ethics










�



���

securities
  held by any partnership in which you are a general partner, to the
  extent
  of your interest in partnership capital or
  profits;

  with
  others;






���

securities
  held by (i) your spouse, unless legally separated, or you and your

  who is sharing your home, even if the securities were not received
  from
  you and the income from the securities is not actually used for the
  maintenance of your household; or






���

securities
  you have the right to acquire (for example, through the exercise
  of a
  derivative security), even if the right is not presently exercisable,
  or
  securities as to which, through any other type of arrangement, you
  obtain
  benefits substantially equivalent to those of
  ownership.




You
  will
not
  be
  deemed to have beneficial ownership of securities in the following
  situations:



���

Transactions
  and holdings in direct obligations of the Government of the United
  States.






���

Money
  market instruments-bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit,
  commercial paper, repurchase agreements and other higher quality
  short
  term debt instruments.






���

Shares
  of money market funds.






���

Transactions
  and holdings in shares of other types of mutual funds, unless the
  adviser
  or a control affiliate acts as the investment adviser or the principal
  underwriter for the fund.






���

Transactions
  in units of a unit investment trust if the unit investment trust
  is
  invested exclusively in unaffiliated mutual
  funds.






���

securities
  held by a limited partnership in which you do not have a controlling
  interest and do not have or share investment control over the
  partnership�s portfolio; and






���

securities
  held by a foundation of which you are a trustee and donor, provided
  that
  the beneficiaries are exclusively charitable and you have no right
  to
  revoke the gift.




These
  examples are not exclusive. There are other circumstances in which you may
  be
  deemed to have a beneficial interest in a security. Any questions about whether
  you have a beneficial interest should be directed to the Designated
  Principal.
