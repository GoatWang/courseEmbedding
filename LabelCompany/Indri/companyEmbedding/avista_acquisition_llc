3/24/2014 Vertical Pharmaceuticals, LLC Acquires Portfolio of Branded Women’s Health Products from Upsher-Smith Laboratories, Inc.


Avista Capital Partners-Backed Company to Continue Add-On Acquisition Strategy


Sayreville, NJ, March 24, 2014 – Vertical Pharmaceuticals, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Vertical /
Trigen Holdings, LLC (“Vertical / Trigen”), today announced that it has acquired the rights to three
branded women’s health products from Upsher-Smith Laboratories, Inc. The terms of the transaction
were not disclosed. Vertical / Trigen is a portfolio company of Avista Capital Partners.

The acquisition complements and further diversifies Vertical Pharmaceuticals’ existing women’s health
franchise. The acquired products include: Divigel® (estradiol gel) 0.1%; Nexa® Plus, a branded line of
prenatal vitamins; and Provella®, a women’s health focused probiotic dietary supplement. As part of the
transaction, Upsher-Smith has transferred the New Drug Application (NDA) for Divigel® to Vertical
Pharmaceuticals. The products will be marketed by Vertical Pharmaceuticals’ dedicated women’s health
sales force.


“We are very excited to be expanding our position in the growing field of women’s health,” said Steven
Squashic, CEO of Vertical / Trigen. “With these additions to our portfolio, we will be able to drive
efficiencies through enhanced scale and further optimize our commercial infrastructure. We are
confident that our highly experienced women’s health sales force will enable us to reach more patients
and caregivers with these products.”


“This is a positive first step in our strategy to expand the Vertical / Trigen platform through add-on
acquisitions,” said Brian Markison, Executive Chairman of Vertical / Trigen and Healthcare Industry
Executive of Avista. “We will continue to pursue additional opportunities to acquire complementary
assets in order to broaden our portfolio of high-quality products and accelerate the Company’s growth.”
