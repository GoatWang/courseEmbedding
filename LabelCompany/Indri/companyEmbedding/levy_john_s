Home / About Us








About Us





	I am so proud to be the one to carry on my family's tradition started by my great grandfather in 1900. Levy Jewelers is Savannah's only Fourth Generation family jewelry business. We are celebrating our 116th continuous year in operation. We offer the highest quality diamonds, watches, jewelry and giftware at attractive pricing with exceptional personal service. Since our founding, our family and our associates are fortunate to have been included in so many of our customers important family events and occasions. For this we are truly grateful!

	I know that customers frequently require special assistance in updating insurance appraisals or having their watches and jewelry repaired. We are proud to be a member of the American Gem Society. Our staff on site includes two certified gemologists, expert watchmakers, master jewelers, bridal and gift consultants, and diamond specialists. We personally select each diamond and own an extensive collection encompassing all shapes, sizes, and qualities in our safes.

	Building relationships with your family and the community is why we have been so successful for all of these years. For those of you who are just discovering Levy Jewelers, we will strive to earn your trust and confidence every day! We invite you to visit us soon and see why we are Savannah's premier jeweler. Please feel free to e-mail me any time at Lowell@LevyJewelers.com or contact one of our many well trained staff members. I think of our employees as part of our extended family. We are confident you will receive both professional and personal service from them. Shop online or at one of our 3 locations: Historic Downtown and Oglethorpe Mall in Savannah and St. Johns Town Center in Jacksonville, Florida.

	Sincerely,

	Lowell Kronowitz
	President
