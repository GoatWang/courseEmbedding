Search Tips



                               The best way to find your textbook is to search by ISBN. This is a 13 digit number starting with 9. This can be found on your course guide, book list or the back of a book, near the 
                               barcode. Searching by ISBN means you will be sure to get the exact title you are looking for.
                            

                                If you don't have an ISBN, then use the full title and author surname ensuring the 
                                spelling is correct. This will help direct your search results to titles that are a close match. 
                                Or, just browse via the categories and the filters below.

We want nothing less than to position you #1 in your category.

Unlike other agencies, we combine data, psychology and original creative with a personalized approach that maximizes customer response.
Our secret sauce is the combination of

Consumer psychological insight (Ph.D. level insight and custom consumer research)
Inspired original creative for individual personas

BCG cannot work with every company. We may not have space, or it may not be the right fit. But when there’s a fit, remarkable things can happen.
Get a free 15-minute phone call with Brian to discuss your situation and goals and find out if it’s a fit on both sides. Contact us using the form to the right.

Search Tips



                               The best way to find your textbook is to search by ISBN. This is a 13 digit number starting with 9. This can be found on your course guide, book list or the back of a book, near the 
                               barcode. Searching by ISBN means you will be sure to get the exact title you are looking for.
                            

                                If you don't have an ISBN, then use the full title and author surname ensuring the 
                                spelling is correct. This will help direct your search results to titles that are a close match. 
                                Or, just browse via the categories and the filters below.
