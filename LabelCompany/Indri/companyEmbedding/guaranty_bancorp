Power Up Your Account





CLEAR Coverage2 is perfect for customers looking for a small safety net for their checking account with reduced overdraft fees. Protect yourself knowing you'll be covered if a small balancing mistake or unplanned expense puts your account a little under! Let's say you have a $0 available balance in your checking account and make two debit card purchases; a $10 gas purchase and a $20 grocery purchase. While you made $30 in purchases beyond your account available balance and in your Grace Zone, with CLEAR Coverage you saved $60 in overdraft fees.

LEARN MORE






Breaking it down, Credit Builder4 is a personal loan secured by a Certificate of Deposit (CD). You pay the loan back on time, and you start on the path to improving your score. It's that simple. If you're leery of banks, and more importantly, what they promise—we get it. The thing is, Credit Builder is different. Once approved, there's no down payment, and no need to wipe out your savings paying unreasonable fees. All we ask is that you're responsible and accountable. We'll handle reporting your payments to the credit bureaus, so you can focus on the real goal: Raising your credit score.

1Personal accounts only. Minimum to open Easy Checking is $25. No minimum balance.  Monthly maintenance fee is $5. If the account has paper statements an additional $2 monthly fee applies. Other fees may apply, such as overdraft, early closing and ATM. See the Consumer Account and Deposit Disclosure for terms and fees that may apply and for information on how to avoid the monthly maintenance fee. Terms and fees are subject to change.  Account opening is subject to approval. 
*The Real Cash Rewards Program (the “Program) is available for Easy Checking account customers. In order to participate in the Program, you must enroll. See the Real Cash Rewards Rules for terms and conditions and for information on how to enroll. Program is subject to change.
**Message and data rates may apply. 
2Clear Coverage is an optional service, available for personal checking accounts. This service provides overdraft coverage with reduced overdraft fees of $7 per item for overdrafts and fees that total no more than $50 in excess of the available balance. This is known as the Grace Zone. The cost is $10 per month. Paying overdrafts beyond the Grace Zone is not guaranteed and we typically do not pay overdrafts if you are consecutively overdrawn for an extended period of time, owe money on a Fresh Start or closed account, or not making regular deposits. Standard overdraft fees of $37 per item will apply for overdrafts beyond the Grace Zone. A fee may be imposed for covering overdrafts created by ATM and everyday debit card transactions (if you are enrolled in the overdraft service for those transactions), checks and other transactions made using your checking account number, automated bill payments and preauthorized electronic debits, telephone-initiated, online banking, or electronic transfers and recurring debit card transactions. You must repay an overdraft as soon as possible to avoid the $37 continuous overdrawn fee charged when your available balance remains negative for 10 calendar days. Excessive use of any overdraft service is costly and discouraged. Fees and terms are subject to change. See the CLEAR Coverage Service Agreement.
3Personal accounts only. Minimum to open My Money is $25. A $10 monthly service fee applies. If the account has paper statements an additional $2 monthly fee applies. Other fees may apply, such as early closing and ATM.  Account is not eligible for the courtesy overdraft service and has no overdraft fees. See the My Money Account Disclosure and Deposit Disclosure available at guarantybank.com or from any branch for terms and fees that may apply and for information on the qualifying activity. Terms and fees are subject to change. Account opening is subject to approval.
4 Results are not guaranteed- Credit Builder Loan is subject to application, eligibility and credit qualification. Rates and terms are subject to change. Improvement in credit score is dependent on multiple factors specific to your situation and financial behavior. For example, late payments on utility bills, car loans or credit card accounts would negatively influence your credit score, even if your payments on a Credit Builder Loan are current.- Failure to make required monthly minimum payments by the payment due date for the Credit Builder Loan will result in negative reporting to the credit bureau and will not improve your credit score. - This product will not repair your credit, and negative credit history will not be removed from your credit report as a result of this program.- Money Back Refund of interest paid requires that all Credit Builder loan payments must be made within 29 days of their due dates for the full five-year term.
