Publication Date: September 10, 2008

 Frank Addante is a 28-year-old serial entrepreneur who is in the process of building his fifth venture. Of his first four ventures, two were sold, one went public, and in the last he decided to close the venture and return unused capital to his investors. With the passing of each venture, he has learned about forming founding teams, splitting equity with his co-founders, hiring executives to work for him, and when to take outside funding. Now, he's facing pressure from investors who aren't happy with how he is building his current team and are questioning whether he should remain CEO.

Build a Product-Driven Company


If you want to manage a hyper-growth company, start with a great product. Here's how.

The best product wins.  Period.
With a great product comes great customers, and with customers comes revenue and profit, which in turn can be used to build more great products.  It's a continuous cycle.
That's why I believe so strongly in a product-driven organization.  That is, a company that focuses all functions on the product.  Sales and marketing become the channels to take that product to market and everything else in the organization-finance, human resources, IT-are there to support the product and those who work on it.
In a product-driven organization, management teams oversee products as if they are each independent businesses.  A product manager is like the CEO of the product, the engineering lead like the CTO, and the top marketer the CMO.  Each one needs dedicated resources for his respective functions and needs control over those resources to drive the plan.  Together, as a product leadership team, they live and breathe their product every day.  The product is their life, their passion.
This team measures its product just like a standalone business.  It strives to meet and balance short-term revenue and profit goals, as well as long-term strategic objectives.   Just like a healthy top-level management team, its members all need to be in constant communication, and always 100% in sync, driving to the same goals.  They may initially differ on direction, but always need to be committed to executing the same plan.  They need to work together as a tight unit-always committed to each other, always working together.  I would never walk into a board meeting out of sync with my management team and would never point a finger at a member of my team in a board meeting; a product leadership team needs to behave the same way.
Scaling and turning one product into multiple products sold in multiple regions is the challenge.  Great companies master this, average companies grow beyond one product, and those who lose sight of it fail.  If you try to manage multiple products with a horizontal company structure (sales, engineering, product management, and marketing are separate silos), you'll force decision-making in two directions: up to the top of those department and across to the product leads.  No one will have clear ownership, and autonomy becomes impossible.
It's also very difficult for a company to grow from a single product to multiple products if the company also has to shift from a horizontal organization to one that has multiple product leadership teams.  The challenge will always be decentralizing a common platform or code base, and assigning team members who wear multiple hats to one team.  If you wait for that all to untangle, you'll never get there.  Rip it apart, make the commitment to a product-by-product managed organization, and you will force untangling to happen.
Great companies like Amazon, Google, and Apple have adopted product-driven structures very successfully.  Jeff Bezos, Founder and CEO of Amazon, walked into the office one day and demanded that everything be separated and run as an independent service.
The team at Apple that built the iTouch is a separate team than the one that built the iPhone.  Though they appear to be similar products, the iTouch team woke up every day thinking about how it could get more people to buy and use the iTouch more often.  That team's members likely thought about video, music, entertainment, games, which resulted in the creation of the AppStore.  Meanwhile, the iPhone team likely thought about battery life, wireless network connectivity, and email and calendar integration.  If these were the same products, I doubt Apple would have built the iPhone as quickly as it did, and the iPhone probably wouldn't have been able to launch with the AppStore.  The two teams would have iterated on original products, and in the face of competitive pressure, would have been slower to take big leaps.  Instead, the two products helped each other.
Ironically, the iTouch and the iPhone are also competitors.  The iPhone's sales cannibalized the iTouch.  But all in all, Apple as a company won and is now the most valuable technology company in the world, known for building the greatest products.  The perfect example of a product-driven organization.

January 9, 2014







First impressions can be deceiving. At a glance, Frank Addante seems like the fresh-faced kid who just delivered the pizza to the office lunchroom. His unassuming demeanor, refreshing candor, and casual attire do not telegraph the substantial influence he has had as an innovator in his industry.
Addante’s company, Rubicon Project, has rapidly become a leader in the juggernaut of digital advertising with more than 3 trillion bid requests processed every month. However, the 37-year-old Chicago native is a traditionalist to the core. To hear him tell it, the path to his success has been paved with the simple masonry of “good, old-fashioned hard work.”
The company’s Playa Vista offices feature an open floor plan that feels like a giant, collaborative think tank. There are no cloistered VIP offices; spacious halls are lined with walls declaring the company’s core values, which center on People, Product, and Customers; and glass-encased conference rooms pay tribute to trailblazing innovators such as Nikola Tesla, Johannes Gutenberg, Alan Turing, and Thomas Edison. At the center of all this activity is a conglomeration of colorful graphic display screens that track the real-time transactions and algorithms, bringing to mind a hybrid of NASDAQ and starship command center.
Quite simply, Addante is doing for advertising what others have done for a number of other services – from booking a flight to buying concert tickets – seamlessly rolling it into the world of automation. With its Advertising Automation Cloud platform, Rubicon Project has made it ridiculously easy to buy and sell ad space in all available online capacities. And he doesn’t plan on stopping there.
“[Our] vision was to start with digital advertising,” he says, “but our mission is to automate all advertising.”
“We’re a bit behind the scenes,” he continues. “We’re the first company to come along and connect over 100,000 advertiser brands with 650 million users. There’s no other technology platform or company that reaches more users on the Internet.”
In 2013, Rubicon Project passed Google as the No. 1 company in terms of Internet audience reach, with more than 95 percent of the U.S. audience being exposed to its customers’ ads. The company counts 40 of the Top 100 ranked websites as users of its platform, including Time Inc., Wall Street Journal, and Tribune Company.

With such substantial facts and figures to corroborate his vision, Addante is a compelling pitchman for Rubicon Project’s ambitious mission. A college dropout who studied electrical and computer engineering, Addante is yet another example of tech success stories (Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg are a few notable others) who have proven that academic accolades are not a necessary path to reach the pinnacle of business prosperity.
After dropping out of college, Addante left Chicago, a city “not known for its innovation,” he admits, and landed in Los Angeles. He quickly made an impact on the tech landscape before moving north to Silicon Valley in 2004 because, at the time, LA didn’t have as much access to venture capital. “The myth is that there wasn’t as much talent here,” he recalls.
“There’s a ton of talent here in Los Angeles,” Addante continues. “LA’s been a great source of innovation. We just need to shine a light on it. If you think about innovation in the entertainment industry, a new movie is like a new company.”
Addante returned to Los Angeles a couple years later and is a staunch supporter of the region’s wealth of innovators – locally grown as well as those attracted by the quality of higher education Southern California offers. Keeping brilliant people in the region, however, can be a challenge due to misconceptions about where the opportunities lie. “There’s this huge brain drain where we’ve got these great universities where engineers are coming to Southern California, and then they leave. They go to Silicon Valley. They’re not even aware there are engineering jobs available at companies here.” The reality is that there are “hundreds of startups being created here every year.”
In 2013, Rubicon Project passed Google as the No. 1 company in terms of Internet audience reach, with more than 95 percent of the U.S. audience being exposed to its customers’ ads.
His advice for the young entrepreneur? Keep it simple. Coming from Addante – a man who has launched six companies, resulting in one IPO, two acquisitions, and a combined market value in excess of $1 billion – that seems like a contradictory proposition. “Don’t over-complicate things,” he advises. “Companies are more likely to fail from indigestion than from digestion. And be persistent. You have to see through walls and see around corners.”
He considers his management style “adaptive,” admitting some people would label that as “inconsistent.” Yet for all his “real-time decisioning,” Addante is a pragmatist. “I don’t believe in ‘gut’ feelings,” Addante says. “I do have gut feelings, but they’re all data driven.”
Asked what his process is for deciding what projects are worth pursuing – and to what degree – he says there are three questions he asks himself when evaluating an idea. “Why do I need it? Why do I need your [idea] specifically? And the third, which is the most difficult,” he summarizes, is “Why do I need it right now? Not six months ago, [and] not six months from now.”
With that kind of precision, drive, and vision, Frank Addante will continue to be a force with which to be reckoned.

Rubicon Project, the programmatic advertising company that went public last year, acquired Toronto-based search and ad regargeting company Chango on Tuesday for approximately $122 million in cash and stock (but primarily stock).
Toronto-based Chango specializes in "intent marketing," mixing information from search queries with behavioral, contextual (the kind of content a web user is consuming), and advertiser data to allow brands to better target their ads.
As AdExchanger points out, Chango gives Rubicon Project (which originally started out as a supply-side-platform - or SSP - to help publishers and app developers monetize their content) more clout on the other side of the market, the buyer-side. Rubicon Project itself says Chango will open up an incremental $35 billion "intent marketing" revenue opportunity.
We spoke to Rubicon Project's founder and CEO Frank Addante over the phone to dig into why Rubicon Project is bolstering up more on the buy-side now, and how its ad tech stack stands up to the likes of Google and Facebook which are rapidly building up (or acquiring) their stacks on both sides of the digital ad market too — serving both publishers and app developers on one side, and the advertisers, agencies, and the other ad-tech companies in the ecosystem (like demand-side-platforms/DSPs) that serve them.
This transcript has been lightly edited for brevity.
BUSINESS INSIDER: Chango is an interesting acquisition for you as it's on the buy-side of the ad market, rather than the sell-side. Is this a pivot for Rubicon Project?
FRANK ADDANTE: It’s actually not a pivot at all. Our mission from day one at the company has been to automate the buying and selling of advertising, and from day one we’ve had technologies that we’ve built for both buyers and sellers. Initially it was about connecting publishers and ad networks through ad network optimization, then we pioneered real time bidding, and that led to the creation of DSPs (demand-side-platforms.)
Then a couple of years ago we launched our direct orders product, which enabled buyers and sellers to transact directly with each other. They also have the ability to use a DSP in that transaction. So we have a history from day one we’ve been developing technologies for both buyers and sellers. so this is very much in line with that vision and that plan.
BI: OK, you've worked on the buy-side before, but most of your revenue is sell side, and that can be a difficult place to make money. SaaS (Software as a Service) can be a difficult place to make money, and, as a you're a public company, you need to show that you’ve a long-term growth strategy, and Wall Street loves high margins as well. There’s one interesting theory that the idea of SaaS in the ad-tech market is a dying breed. Do you any thoughts on that?
Rubicon Project ringing the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange to celebrate its IPO in April 2014.Rubicon ProjectFA: [Laughs] There are always conspiracy theorists out there. So, first, our business is obviously very healthy, you can see that very clearly in our financials.
Comments about most of our revenue [coming from the seller side]: We actually haven't disclosed and don’t disclose how much of our revenue comes from the buyer piece and seller piece, they do come from both.
To give a bit of perspective, a few years back, we had acquired a company called Fox Audience Networks a company we acquired from Fox, part of News Corporation. It was a fairly large acquisition at the time, and a lot of people were confused by that because Fox Audience Networks was effectively perceived to be an ad network, for MySpace, and News Corp, and Fox, and a bunch of other companies. But we acquired that company for their technology, scale, and their team. 
Those three things really led to a lot of the success we had introducing products like real time bidding or direct orders into the market. And those were technologies we made available and for all buyers and sellers in our market: Publishers, application developers, the DSPs, the ad networks — we had the technology at the company at the point in marketplace.
Chango founder and CEO Chris Sukornyk.LinkedInChango is exactly the same. Chango has built incredible technology in intent marketing, and intent marketing dollars today are primarily directed towards search. A lot of people, when they think of search, they think of the ads that show up next to search results, but a large portion of search is actually going to ... keywords on pages, content on the page.
The intent for us is to make those capabilities available to all buyers and all sellers in our marketplace, including the DSPs, ad networks, and the agencies. What this deal does is it gives us the ability to bring this technology from search into premium advertising. We see it as a $35 billion dollar incremental market and it accelerates what we already have in this area, it accelerates our buyer technology by more than a year. There are 150 people in the Chango team, and that accelerates our hires quite a bit, as well as the customer relationships. Sixty of the Fortune 500 advertisers are on their platform today, and they are now part of Rubicon Project marketplace.
BI: How does your ad-tech stack compare to the rest of the market?
FA: I think that its fair to say that we’ve established a leadership position. Us and Google are the two largest exchanges in the market. With Google ... they are starting to try to service themselves: They are a major publisher and app developer.
Whereas we’ve built our technology and our platform for the rest of the market, where we are focused on trying to power an open marketplace. Google has invested billions of dollars in buying DoubleClick, Invite Media, Admeld to try to put together the stack, whereas we’ve built the stack organically ... Our exchange tech is very strong, our seller cloud is very strong, and our buyer cloud is ... an area in which we are accelerating, and that part of the business has got more and more clout.
BI: Facebook is also considerably building up its ad-tech stack. There's the rumor it's launching a DSP, and it's expanding Atlas. Do you credibly think you can stay the number two to Google for long?
Brian Boland is leading Facebook's ad-tech efforts.Michael Seto/Business InsiderFA: By the way, we are not saying we are number two, we are aiming for number one with Google. But there’s certainly room for a couple of winners in this space. 
Facebook has built an outstanding business, obviously.  They are trying to generate revenue on their own property and they're doing a good job in doing that. But they have got to solve their monetization needs first before they focus on the rest of the market. I think that’s actually what they’re doing, which makes a lot of sense.
I think for them to try to get into real-time-bidding, or an exchange, or a marketplace for the rest of the market is a huge huge leap for them to make.
If they were to move in that direction, I think they would be more likely to be a buyer like Google. Google is one of our largest customers. I look at Facebook more like a partner or a customer.
