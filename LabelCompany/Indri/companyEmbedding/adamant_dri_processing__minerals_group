(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7 Management's Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations.  Overview  We seek to profit by participating in various aspects of the Chinese steel making industry including the mining and processing of iron ore and other forms of iron, which can be used to produce iron concentrate, fines, pellets or sinter. To date we have been engaged in iron ore processing and the production of iron ore concentrate in the People's Republic of China ("PRC") through our variable interest entity ('VIE'), China Jinxin, and through the production of DRI by our subsidiary, China Huaxin.  China Jinxin is currently in the process of upgrading its Zhuolu facilities and adding the equipment necessary to produce DRI.  On January 17, 2014, we acquired a direct reduced iron ("DRI") production facility in Haixing County, Hebei Province. We completed trial production at this facility and expected to commence commercial production in May 2015. However, as a result of environmental initiatives by government authorities in China, starting in June 2015, we began upgrading the DRI facilities by converting the existing coal-gas station systems to liquefied natural gas ("LNG") station systems. The conversion to LNG systems will reduce pollutants and produce higher quality DRIs with less impurities. China Huaxin has completed the upgrading and resumed trial production from its upgraded DRI facilities.  As a result of our acquisition of Target, we own all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Real Fortune BVI, which in turn owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Real Fortune Holdings Limited, a Hong Kong limited company ("Real Fortune HK"), which in turn owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Zhangjiakou Tongda Mining Technologies Service Co., Ltd., a Chinese limited company ("China Tongda"). Real Fortune BVI was established in the BVI in September 2010 to serve as an intermediate holding company. Real Fortune HK was established in HK in April 2010. China Tongda was established in the PRC in August 2010, and in August 2010, the local government of the PRC issued a certificate of approval regarding the foreign ownership of China Tongda by Real Fortune HK. China Jinxin, our operating affiliate, was established in the PRC in December 2006.  We have effective control of the management and operations of China Jinxin, an iron ore processing and high grade iron ore concentrate producer with a production line located in Zhuolu County, Zhangjiakou City, Hebei Province, China, through a series of agreements among China Tongda, China Jinxin and its shareholders, referred to as "VIE agreements." China Jinxin has an annual capacity of approximately 300,000 tons. Under the VIE agreements, China Tongda is entitled to receive the pre-tax profits of China Jinxin.  Table of Contents  On January 17, 2014, China Tongda acquired all of the outstanding shares of China Huaxin. China Huaxin produces Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) at its DRI production facility (the "DRI Facility") in Haixing County, Hebei Province, about 50 km from the nearest port, using advanced reduction rotary kiln technology with iron sand as the principal raw material. China Huaxin imports iron sands from New Zealand, Australia, Indonesia and the Philippines. The total amount expended to construct the DRI Facility, inclusive of both hard and soft costs, was approximately 244,270,000 RMB or $39 million. China Huaxin completed trial production in May 2015. However, due to environmental initiatives by government authorities in China, starting in June 2015, China Huaxin began upgrading the DRI facilities by converting the existing coal-gas station systems to liquefied natural gas ("LNG") station systems. In the end of 2016, China Huaxin completed the upgrading and resumed trial production from its upgraded DRI facilities. Unlike China Jinxin, which we control through the VIE agreements, China Huaxin is directly owned by China Tongda, our wholly owned subsidiary.  To date, we have received only temporary manufacturing licenses granted by the agencies of the local government, which allowed us to process ore that we obtained from Zhuolu Mine, the mine on which our facility is located, or other third parties.  Our ability to profit from our facility in Zhuolu is dependent upon our ability to extract and process iron ore from the Zhuolu Mine and sell the output for a price that enables us to profit. To date, all of our sales from this facility have been made to a single customer. We entered into a ten-year contract with this customer, which expires in January 2019. Pursuant to this agreement, we agreed to sell the customer, HSG all of the output from our Zhuolu facility, which it agreed to purchase. The price paid to us by HSG is to be determined by HSG in light of the quality of our product and market prices and is to be such that it results in a proper margin to us. Thus, our ability to profit from our current production facility at the Zhuolu Mine over the next few years will be determined by the prices we receive from HSG. We cannot guarantee that HSG will not offer a price below what it pays to the Company's competitors. The lower price will reduce our profit margin. However, if we are not satisfied with the price set by HSG, we can attempt to renegotiate the price. In an effort to obtain a higher price from HSG, we have yet to deliver iron ore concentrate we produced in the fourth quarter of 2011. We are continuing to negotiate with HSG to resolve our dispute over the price to be paid for our output.  Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $613,295, of which $611,833 were from China Huaxin and $1,462 were from consulting services performed by China Tongda, as compared to net sales of $720,439 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from China Huaxin's trial production.  All mineral resources in China are owned by the state. Thus, our ability to obtain iron ore depends upon our ability to obtain mineral licenses from the relevant state authorities, purchase ore from another party that has mining rights or import ore from outside of China. It is generally not feasible to transport iron ore any significant distance before processing. We believe, as evidenced by our shareholders' willingness to finance the construction of our Zhuolu facilities, there is sufficient iron ore in the vicinity of our Zhuolu facilities to enable us to operate them at a profit. Nevertheless, we have yet to obtain long term rights to any iron mine and there is no assurance we will be able to do so. Although we extracted iron ore from the Zhuolu Mine where our production facilities are located, we do not have the right to do so and can be subjected to various fines and penalties. However, since we paid geological survey fees on behalf of the local government so it could process applications related to the right to mine the Zhuolu Mine and has not received any challenges from any authorities regarding our mining activities, we believe that even if fines and penalties are assessed against us in the future, the amount should be negotiable with the authorities. If we are unable to obtain mining rights to the Zhuolu Mine, we will have to acquire iron ore from third parties. The failure to obtain iron ore for processing at all or on reasonably acceptable terms would have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. We have not yet receive the official mining rights to extract; accordingly, we made a provision for fixed assets impairment for all the mine extracting and broken equipment and machinery; We've been negotiating a sale agreement with a new customer for China Jinxin, and expecting the agreement to be signed in mid of 2017.  To date we have been dependent upon cash advances from our shareholders. If we were not to obtain sufficient iron ore for processing, it is likely our operations would cease unless our shareholders continue to provide sufficient funds to maintain our plant and equipment until such time as our operations could be resumed.  We may seek to grow our operations by acquiring mining rights and other production facilities. The cash necessary to acquire such rights may exceed that which we have on hand. In such event, we may seek to raise the necessary cash through bank loans or the issuance of equity to the vendors of such rights, our shareholders or third parties. There can be no assurance such cash will be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all. The prices and terms at which we issue equity securities and the performance of any rights or facilities we acquire, will determine whether we operate profitably.  Table of Contents  The profitability of the mining industry in China and of our Company in particular, is dependent upon the demand for iron ore and other metals within China. This demand in turn, is influenced by general economic factors, such as the rate of growth of the economy and of the construction industry. There can be no assurance that China will return to the rapid rates of growth it experienced in the recent past. If the rate of growth of the Chinese economy remains low or were to slow down, demand for iron and steel could fall, adversely impacting our operations.

We commenced production of iron ore at our Zhuolu facility in March 2010. However, we ceased production from September 2010 to March 2011 because the local government implemented an "Energy Saving and Emission Reduction Plan" to reduce local power consumption. We installed power equipment to enable us to maintain a stable power supply to our production equipment and management believes the Energy Saving and Emission Reduction Plan is one-time event and disruptions to our access to energy will not have a material impact on our production in the future. We also ceased production in December 2011 due to a pricing dispute with our major customer and to upgrade our production facilities. Construction for China Jinxin's DRI facility upgrade was complete as of the date of this report and we are currently in the final stages of adjusting the equipment and making certain modification to the facility after relevant authority's inspection and testing.  Table of Contents  We acquired a new subsidiary, China Huaxin, in January 2014, through which we own a direct reduced iron production facility, which was recently constructed. China Huaxin completed trial production and expected to commence commercial production in May 2015. However, as a result of environmental initiatives by government authorities in China, starting in June 2015, China Huaxin has been upgrading the DRI facilities by converting the existing coal-gas station systems to liquefied natural gas ("LNG") station systems. The conversion to LNG systems will reduce pollutants and produce higher quality DRIs with less impurities. China Huaxin has completed the upgrading and resumed trial production from its upgraded DRI facilities.  Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $613,295, of which $611,833 were from China Huaxin and $1,462 were from consulting services performed by China Tongda, as compared net sales of $720,439 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from China Huaxin's trial production.  Cost of Goods Sold  Cost of goods ("COGS") sold consists primarily of fuel, power, direct material, direct labor, depreciation of production plant items and equipment, and accrual of the mining rights, which are attributable to the production of iron ore, iron ore concentrate and DRI.  COGS for China Huaxin's trial production were $293,794 for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $1,207,032 for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Gross Income (Loss)  Gross income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $319,501, as compared to a gross loss of $486,593 for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to our low sales volume, low unit selling prices resulting from the sale of semi-finished products, and high COGS during the trial production period in 2015.  Operating Expenses  Operating expenses consist mainly of employee salaries and welfare, business meeting and promotion expense, depreciation and amortization of items not associated with production, utilities, and audit and legal expenses.  Operating expenses were $4,425,792 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $6,723,529 for the period in 2015, a decrease of $2,297,737 or 34%, which was mainly due to the absence of trial production related expenses and absence of impairment provision for fixed assets in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $1,800,723 of trial production related expenses and $1,188,286 impairment provision for fixed assets incurred in 2015.  Other Expenses  Other expenses were $1,153,613 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $1,981,836 for the 2015 period. The 42% decrease in other expenses was mainly due to decreased interest expense of $1,054,336 and no loss from the disposal of fixed assets for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $1,124,675 of interest expense and a $835,928 loss on disposal of fixed assets for the 2015 period.  Net Loss  We had a net loss of $5,228,253 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to net loss of $9,163,016 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The reduction in our net loss year over year results from the absence of trial production expenses and the absence of an impairment provision for fixed assets.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our ability to generate cash from operations is dependent upon our ability to obtain iron ore and iron sands to process and to maintain the permits necessary to process such ore at our current facilities, neither of which is assured. If we cannot obtain iron ore and iron sands to process or are no longer able to process ore and sands, we would be dependent upon cash infusions from our current shareholders or third parties in the form of loans or equity contributions, or a combination thereof, to maintain our facilities until we can resume operations. One shareholder has indicated she will continue to fund China Jinxin, although there is no written agreement in place and China Jinxin currently owes $10.04 million to the shareholder. In addition, China Huaxin borrowed $23.88 million from three of our shareholders (one of whom is the individual who funded China Jinxin and who has loaned $16.28 million to China Huaxin, another of whom is our CEO and who has loaned $2.04 million, and the third of whom is a shareholder and senior officer who has loaned $5.56 million). Despite such commitments, there is no assurance adequate cash will be available from current shareholders or from third parties and, if it is available, what the terms of any loan or investment might be. If we are unable to obtain the funding required, we may have to curtail or cease our operations. We have no specific plans, understandings or agreements with respect to the raising of such funds, and we may seek to raise the required capital by the issuance of equity or debt securities or by other means. Since we have no such arrangements or plans currently in effect, our inability to raise funds may have a severe negative impact on our ability to become a viable company.  Table of Contents  Other than current construction in progress, which will be funded by one of our shareholders, we do not anticipate significant cash expenditures in the immediate future on our current production facilities. Nevertheless, we may require working capital once we resume production at our facilities. Certain of our shareholders have verbally agreed to continue to provide cash to satisfy our working capital needs. However, in the future, we intend to continue the expansion of operations by acquiring new production facilities and mines. The acquisitions will be paid for with cash or our equity securities, or combinations of both. Failure to obtain such financing could have a material adverse effect on our business expansion. The issuance and sale our equity securities would dilute the interest of our current shareholders. Further, there is no guarantee of the terms on which such an issuance would occur, if at all, or whether such terms would be favorable to our current shareholders.  As of December 31, 2016, cash and equivalents were $86,519 for China Huaxin, and bank overdraft of $94,169 for China Jinxin, compared to $26,957 cash and equivalents as of December 31, 2015. The following is a summary of cash provided by or used in each of the indicated types of activities during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   2016 2015 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (458,642 ) $ 1,112,188 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (317,883 ) $ 538,928 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 840,358 $ (1,887,675 )  Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities  Net cash used in operating activities was $458,642 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $1,112,188 in 2015. The increase of cash outflow from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was principally attributable to decreased cash inflow from other receivables of $2,737 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with cash inflow from other receivables of $1,105,021 for the same period of 2015; decreased cash inflow for accounts payable of $21,495 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with cash inflow from accounts payable of $2,618,427 for the same period of 2015; despite the decreased net loss of $5,228,253 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with net loss of $9,163,016 for the same period of 2015.  Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities  Net cash used investing activities was $317,883 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to cash provided by investing activities of $538,928 for the period in 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we had cash outflow of $317,883 for acquisition of fixed assets. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid $348,298 for construction projects, and had proceeds of $887,226 from disposal of fixed assets.  Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities  Net cash provided by financing activities was $840,358 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $1,887,675 in 2015. The net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2016 was due to advances from related parties; while in 2015, we paid $1,887,675 to related parties in respect of prior loans.  Table of Contents  At December 31, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $51.99 million, a decrease of $0.7 million from the deficit at December 31, 2015 of $52.69 million, which was mainly from increased accrued liabilities and other payables and decreased value-added tax receivable.  As of December 31, 2016, China Jinxin had borrowed $10.04 million from one of its shareholders for working capital and production facility construction needs. The loan of $10.04 million will not bear interest prior to the commencement of production pursuant to an amended loan agreement entered on January 16, 2013. Commencing on the production date, interest will begin to accrue at the bank's annual interest rate on certificates of deposit at that time on the amount outstanding from time to time and all amounts inclusive of accrued interest is to be repaid within three years of our commencement of production at the Zhuolu Mine. China Huaxin borrowed $23.88 million from three shareholders; of the $23.88 million, $6.88 million has an interest rate of 10% with a due date of the 6th month anniversary of the date of official production. The remaining payables bear no interest, and are payable upon demand. In addition, China Huaxin borrowed $4.99 million from certain companies owned by its major shareholder, which bear no interest and are payable upon demand.  Contractual Obligations  We have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments in respect of which we estimate future payments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We present below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the tables, in order to assist in the review of this information within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.  The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016, and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.   Payments Due by Period Less than 1 Total Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 Years + Contractual Obligations: Payable to contractor $ 792,850 $ 792,850 $ - $ - $ - Short-term bank loan 187,401 187,401 Loan payable to related party with 10% annual interest rate 6,948,249 6,948,249 - - - Loan payable to unrelated party with 10% annual interest rate 2,531,137 2,531,137 - - - Total $ 10,459,637 $ 10,459,637 $ - $ - $ -  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We have not entered into any financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the obligations of any third parties. We have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as shareholder's equity or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Our management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in accordance with US GAAP. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this management discussion and analysis.  Table of Contents  Emerging Growth Company  On April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. As an "emerging growth company," we may, under  Basis of Presentations  Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with US GAAP and the requirements of Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").  Going Concern  We incurred net losses of $5.23 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. We also had a working capital deficit of $51.99 million as of December 31, 2016. In addition, we have refused to sell our iron ore concentrate to our sole customer because of the low price offered for our product. The price of iron ore concentrate is still in decline. These conditions raise a substantial doubt as to whether we can continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. One shareholder has indicated she will continue to fund China Jinxin, though there is no written agreement in place and the Company currently owes $10.04 million to the shareholder. In addition, China Huaxin borrowed $23.88 million from three shareholders, and borrowed $4.99 million from certain companies owned by its major shareholder. Despite such commitments, there is no assurance that adequate cash will be available from current shareholders or from third parties and, if it is available, what the terms of any loan or investment might be. If we are unable to obtain the funding required, we may have to curtail or cease our operations. The Company has no specific plans, understandings or agreements with respect to the raising of such funds, and it may seek to raise the required capital by the issuance of equity or debt securities or by other means. Since it has no such arrangements or plans currently in effect, its inability to raise funds may have a severe negative impact on its ability to become a viable company.  Use of Estimates  In preparing financial statements in conformity with US GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and . . .

Our advertisements involve an actual conflict of interest, since we sometimes receive compensation in the very securities we are promoting and then sell the securities during our advertising campaign or advertorial activities or thereafter. The third party shareholder from which we receive compensation also has an actual conflict of interest since he or she pays us securities compensation for advertising services and then may sell other shares he or she holds, while we are promoting the issuer that issues the stock, held by the third party shareholder. A Public Company that pays us for our advertising services also has a conflict of interest since they are paying us compensation to advertise on their behalf, for their own benefit.
Innovative Marketing has been compensated $2500 from Adamant DRI Processing and Minerals Group. We have never owned any shares of ADMG stock.
The Public Companies we profile are considered penny stocks. Penny Stocks inherently involve high risk and volatility. You should be aware of the following information pertaining to penny stock investments and our activities
 We conduct no due diligence whatsoever regarding a the Issuer b the third party shareholder and c the relationship, if any, between the third party shareholder and the Issuer
 Our trading activities described above may cause a significant volatility in the Issuers stock price b price declines from our selling activities c unrealistic report of trading volume, without denoting publicly that we are the primary seller d permit us to make substantial profits while we are disseminating profiles or information about the issuer, yet may result in a diminished stock value for investors
 We conduct no due diligence on the press releases or profiles we receive from OTC Markets News Service or other publicly available source, nor do we conduct due diligence on any other information we disseminate to the public
 Penny stocks are subject to the SECs penny stock rules and subject broker-dealers to customer suitability rules and other requirements, which may lead to low volume in the securities andor difficulties in selling the shares
 We do not assume any responsibility for forward looking statements nor do we assume any responsibility for updating forward looking statements
 Use of this information is at your own risk and is presented only on an as is basis  in other words, you must conduct your own analysis of the risks associated with use of the Information, including its accuracy or reliability
 Many penny stocks are thinly traded, which may lead to difficulties in selling your securities and extreme price volatility  Penny stock companies are often subject to extreme regulatory oversight in the industry that they participate in
 Penny stock companies are often subject to extreme competition and most frequently have less brand name recognition, operational and personnel resources, technical resources, capital resources, or financing sources
 There is no right time to purchase or sell penny stocks or set of factors making it advisable to purchase now, since at any time such stocks may be subject to price volatility, stock manipulation forces and other negative aspects
 An issuer we profile may have negative signs on the otcmarkets.com website that indicate various risks of investing in that individual issuer, as follows i Limited Information for companies with financial reporting problems, economic distress, or that are unwilling to file required reports with the Pink Sheets ii Pink Sheets  No Information, which indicates companies that are unable or unwilling to provide disclosure to the public markets, to the SEC or the Pink Sheets and iii Caveat Emptor, signifying Buyer Beware that there is a public interest concern associated with a companys illegal spam campaign, questionable stock promotion, known investigation of a companys fraudulent activity or its insiders, regulatory suspensions or disruptive corporate actions
 The Issuer may be delinquent in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or at otcmarkets.com, which you should determine at sec.gov or otcmarkets.com
 The stock price and trading volume of any Issuer that we advertise may increase significantly as a result of our dissemination of the Information and then significantly decrease as a result of our or others selling significant or massive quantifies of an Issuers stock
 Many penny stock companies are subject to risks pertaining to their type of business in their development stages, including that they have failed to provide a proof of concept to their technology or business or their business plan has little if no merit
 Many penny stock companies are in need of financing, which they may be unable to obtain on favorable terms or at all
 Our advertising activities may cause trading volume in Issuers to temporarily increase by hundreds or thousands of percent, yet such trading volume may cease at any one time, especially if we cease disseminating Information about the Issuers, which will cause difficulties in selling your securities or may be an unrealistic indicator of interest in the Issuers securities
 The Information has no predictive value whatsoever of the future stock price of the Issuer that we profile or the Issuers ability to be successful in its business objectives
 Should the SEC determine that inadequate information or irregularities have occurred with an Issuer, they may issue a trading suspension, which will suspend trading in the Issuers securities and may for all intents and purposes permanently cease trading because broker-dealers may not accept trades in that particular Issuers securities
 The press releases, issuer profiles and information we provide represent only a small amount of information regarding the Issuer, which is insufficient to formulate an investment decision as such, that information should only be a starting point from which you conduct an in-depth investigation of the issuer from available public sources, such as , otcmarkets.com, and other available public sources and
 You should conduct an in-depth investigation of the Issuer from the above or any other credible available sources, especially because we only present positive information and limited specific information which is an insufficient basis to invest in any stock, yet alone a penny stock accordingly, you should proceed with an investigation to determine, among other things, information pertaining to the issuers financial condition, operations, business model, and risks involved in the issuers business The compensation that we receive from Issuers appears at the link below.

	Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements


	 


	This report contains forward-looking statements. The forward-looking
	statements are contained principally in the section entitled “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
	and Results of Operations.” These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause
	our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performances or achievements
	expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such
	as “anticipates,” “believes,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,”
	“may,” “plans,” “potential,” “predicts,” “projects,” “should,”
	“would” and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect
	our current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and subject to risks and uncertainties. Given these
	uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.


	 


	Also, forward-looking statements represent our estimates and
	assumptions only as of the date of this report. You should read this report and the documents that we reference and filed as exhibits
	to this report completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect.
	Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements publicly, or to update the reasons
	actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes
	available in the future.

	ADAMANT DRI
	PROCESSING AND MINERALS GROUP






	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
	FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

	 



	MARCH 31, 2017
	(UNAUDITED) AND DECEMBER 31, 2016



	 



	1. ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS



	 


	Adamant DRI Processing
	and Minerals Group (“Adamant’ or “the Company” or “Group”), is a Nevada corporation incorporated in
	July 2014 and successor by merger to UHF Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (“UHF”).  


	 


	The Company produces
	Direct Reduced Iron (“DRI”) using advanced reduction rotary kiln technology with iron ore as the principal raw material.
	‘Reduced Iron’ derives its name from the chemical change that iron ore undergoes when it is heated in a furnace at
	high temperatures in the presence of hydrocarbon-rich gasses. ‘Direct reduction’ refers to processes which reduce
	iron oxides to metallic iron below the melting point of iron.


	 


	UHF was the successor
	to UHF Incorporated, a Michigan corporation (“UHF Michigan”), as a result of domicile merger effected on December 29,
	2011.


	 


	On June 30, 2014,
	UHF entered into and closed a share exchange agreement, or the Target Share Exchange Agreement, with Target Acquisitions I, Inc.,
	a Delaware corporation (“Target”), and the stockholders of Target (the “Target Stockholders”), pursuant
	to which UHF acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Target for 43,375,638 shares of UHF’s common stock
	and one share of UHF’s series A convertible preferred stock, convertible into an additional 17,839,800 shares of common stock.  Since
	UHF’s certificate of incorporation only authorized the issuance of 50,000,000 shares of common stock, UHF did not have
	sufficient authorized but unissued shares of common stock to complete the acquisition of Target, so the Board of Directors authorized
	the issuance to one of the Target Stockholders one share of series A convertible preferred stock convertible into 17,839,800 shares
	of common stock at such time as UHF amended its certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common
	stock or merged with and into another corporation which had sufficient shares of authorized but unissued shares of common stock
	for issuance upon conversion. Following the closing of the share exchange, UHF had outstanding 45,920,310 shares of common
	stock and one share of series A convertible preferred stock, which was converted into 17,839,800 common shares on August 29, 2014.


	 


	For accounting
	purposes, the share exchange transaction with Target and the Target Stockholders was treated as a reverse acquisition, with Target
	as the acquirer and UHF as the acquired party.   The shares issued to Target’s shareholders were accounted for
	as a recapitalization of Target and were retroactively restated for the periods presented because after the share exchange, Target’s
	shareholders owned the majority of UHF’s outstanding shares and exercised significant influence over the operating and
	financial policies of the consolidated entity, and UHF was a non-operating shell with nominal net assets prior to the acquisition.
	Pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules, this is considered a capital transaction in substance,
	rather than a business combination.


	 


	On July 4, 2014,
	the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with UHF, pursuant to which UHF merged with and into Adamant with
	Adamant as the surviving entity (the “Merger”), as a result of which each outstanding share of common stock of UHF
	at the effective time of the Merger was converted into one share of the common stock of Adamant, and the outstanding share
	of series A Preferred Stock was converted into 17,839,800 shares of common stock. The Merger was effected on August 29, 2014.


	 


	As a result of
	the acquisition of Target and UHF, the Company now owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Real Fortune BVI, which
	in turn owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Real Fortune Holdings Limited, a Hong Kong limited company (“Real
	Fortune HK”), which in turn owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Zhangjiakou Tongda Mining Technologies
	Service Co., Ltd. (“China Tongda”), a Chinese limited company.

	The Company operates in
	China through Zhuolu Jinxin Mining Co., Ltd. (“China Jinxin”), the Company’s variable interest entity which the
	Company controls through a series of agreements between China Jinxin and China Tongda and, as of January 24, 2014, owned Haixing
	Huaxin Mining Industry Co., Ltd. (“China Huaxin”) which is owned by China Tongda.  The Group’s current structure
	is as follows:

	China Jinxin is
	an early stage mining company which processes iron ore at its production facility in Hebei Province. China Jinxin currently does
	not own any mines or hold any mining rights. In 2015, management determined to further upgrade the facility to enable it to
	produce DRI due to increased demand for DRI products in China; accordingly, China Jinxin will produce DRI at its facility. Through
	contractual arrangements among China Tongda and China Jinxin, and its shareholders, the Company controls China Jinxin’s operations
	and financial affairs. As a result of these agreements, China Tongda is considered the primary beneficiary of China Jinxin (see
	Note 2) and accordingly, China Jinxin’s results of operations and financial condition are consolidated in the Group’s
	financial statements. All issued and outstanding shares of China Jinxin are held by 15 Chinese citizens.


	 


	On January 17,
	2014, the Company entered into a series of substantially identical agreements with five shareholders of Haixing Huaxin Mining Industry
	Co., Ltd. (“China Huaxin”) pursuant to which the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of China Huaxin.  The
	consideration paid to the shareholders of China Huaxin for their interests consisted of cash of RMB 10 million ($1.64 million)
	and 5.1 million shares of the Company’s common stock, valued at $0.014 per share ($71,400).


	 


	China Tongda,
	the Company’s wholly-owned Chinese subsidiary, filed a notice of transfer with respect to the change of ownership of China
	Huaxin with the local company registration authority which was approved on January 23, 2014.

	Table of Contents





	 


	China Huaxin was
	established in August 2010 and is located in Haixing Qingxian Industrial Park, Cangzhou, Hebei Province PRC.  China Huaxin
	is engaged in producing and selling DRI.  Prior to 2015, China Huaxin conducted no business activities other than construction
	of its DRI production facility.  Construction of the DRI Facility was completed, and China Huaxin completed trial production
	and expected to commence commercial production in May 2015. However, as a result of environmental initiatives by national, provincial
	and local government authorities in China, starting in June 2015, China Huaxin began upgrading the DRI facilities by converting
	the existing coal-gas station systems to liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) station systems. The conversion
	to LNG systems will reduce pollutants and produce higher quality DRIs with less impurities. China Huaxin completed the upgrading
	and resumed trial production from its upgraded DRI facilities, China Huaxin is currently doing equipment debugging and adjustment,
	and expects the official production to resume in mid-2017.


	 


	The consolidated
	interim financial information as of March 31, 2017 and for the three month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was prepared without
	audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Certain information and footnote disclosures, which are normally included
	in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
	of America (“US GAAP”) was not included. The interim consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction
	with the Financial Statements and the notes thereto, included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
	year ended December 31, 2016, previously filed with the SEC. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include normal
	recurring adjustments) necessary to present a fair statement of the Company’s consolidated financial position as of March
	31, 2017, results of operations and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, as applicable, were made. The
	interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future periods.


	 



	2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
	POLICIES



	 



	Basis of Presentation



	 


	The accompanying
	Consolidated Financial Statements (“CFS”) are prepared in conformity with US GAAP. Adamant, Real Fortune BVI and Real
	Fortune HK’s functional currency is the US Dollar (‘‘USD’’ or “$”), and China Tongda,
	China Jinxin and China Huaxin’s functional currency is Chinese Renminbi (‘‘RMB’’). The accompanying
	CFS are translated from functional currencies and presented in USD.


	 



	Principles
	of Consolidation



	 


	The CFS include
	the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries and its VIE (China Jinxin) for which the Company’s subsidiary China
	Tongda is the primary beneficiary; and China Tongda’s 100% owned subsidiary China Huaxin. All transactions and balances among
	the Company, its subsidiaries and VIE are eliminated in consolidation.


	 


	The Company follows the
	Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 810 which
	requires a VIE to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the VIE or is
	entitled to a majority of the VIE’s residual returns.  In determining China Jinxin to be the VIE of China Tongda,
	the Company considered the following indicators, among others:


	 


	China Tongda has
	the right to control and administer the financial affairs and operations of China Jinxin and to manage and control all assets of
	China Jinxin. The equity holders of China Jinxin as a group have no right to make any decision about China Jinxin’s activities
	without the consent of China Tongda. China Tongda will be paid quarterly, management consulting and technical support fees equal
	to all pre-tax profits, if any, of that quarter. If there are no earnings before taxes and other cash expenses, during any quarter, no
	fee shall be paid. If China Jinxin sustains losses, they will be carried to the next period and deducted from the next service
	fee. China Jinxin has the right to require China Tongda to pay China Jinxin the amount of any loss incurred by China Jinxin.  


	 


	The shareholders
	of China Jinxin pledged their equity interests in China Jinxin to China Tongda to guarantee China Jinxin’s performance of
	its obligations under the Management Entrustment and Option Agreements. If either China Jinxin or its equity owners is
	in breach of the Equity Pledge or Exclusive Purchase Option Agreements, then China Tongda is entitled to require the equity
	owners of China Jinxin to transfer their equity interests in China Jinxin to it.


	 







	6







	Table of Contents





	 


	The shareholders
	of China Jinxin irrevocably granted China Tongda or its designated person an exclusive option to acquire, at any time, all of the
	assets or outstanding shares of China Jinxin, to the extent permitted by PRC law. The purchase price for the shareholders’
	equity interests in China Jinxin shall be the lower of (i) the actual registered capital of China Jinxin or (ii) RMB 500,000 ($74,000),
	unless an appraisal is required by the laws of China.


	 


	Each shareholder
	of China Jinxin executed an irrevocable power of attorney to appoint China Tongda as its attorney-in-fact to exercise all of its
	rights as equity owner of China Jinxin, including 1) attend the shareholders’ meetings of China Jinxin and/or sign the relevant
	resolutions; 2) exercise all the shareholder's rights and shareholder's voting rights that the shareholder is entitled to under
	the laws of the PRC and the Articles of Association of China Jinxin, including but not limited to the sale or transfer or pledge
	or disposition of the shares in part or in whole; 3) designate and appoint the legal representative, Chairman of the Board of Directors
	(“BOD”), Directors, Supervisors, the Chief Executive Officer, Financial Officer and other senior management members
	of China Jinxin; and 4) execute the relevant share purchases and other terms stipulated in the Exclusive Purchase Option and Share
	Pledge Agreements.


	 


	However, the VIE
	is monitored by the Company to determine if any events have occurred that could cause its primary beneficiary status to change.
	These events include whether:


	 





	a.




	China Jinxin's governing documents or contractual arrangements are changed in a manner that changes the characteristics or adequacy of China Tongda's equity investment at risk.





	 





	b.




	The equity investment in China Jinxin or some part thereof is returned to its shareholders or China Tongda, and other entities become exposed to expected losses of China Jinxin.





	 





	c.




	China Jinxin undertakes additional activities or acquires additional assets, beyond those anticipated at the later of the inception of China Jinxin or the latest reconsideration event, that increase the entity's expected losses.





	 





	d.




	China Jinxin receives an additional equity investment that is at risk, or China Jinxin curtails or modifies its activities in a way that decreases its expected losses.





	 


	There has been no change in the VIE
	structure during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, and none of the events listed in a-d above have occurred.


	 



	The
	accompanying CFS include the accounts of 

	Real Fortune BVI, Real Fortune HK, China Tongda, China Jinxin and China Huaxin

	,
	which are collectively referred to as the “Company”. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions were eliminated
	in the CFS.



	 



	Going Concern



	 


	The Company incurred
	a net loss of $1.30 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The Company also had a working capital deficit of $51.84
	million as of March 31, 2017. In addition, China Jinxin has refused to sell its iron ore concentrate to its sole customer because
	of the low price offered. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
	The CFS do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. China Jinxin is upgrading its facility
	and equipment, which when completed, will enable the Company to produce DRI. China Jinxin’s DRI facility upgrade was almost
	complete as of the date of this report and is currently in the final stage of adjusting the equipment and making certain modifications
	to the facility after relevant authority’s inspection and testing.  A shareholder of the Company indicated she
	will continue to fund China Jinxin, although there is no written agreement in place and China Jinxin currently owes her $10.19
	million.  In addition, China Huaxin currently owes $24.17 million to three of the Company’s shareholders for constructing
	its DRI facility; one is the major lender of China Jinxin who lent $16.52 million to China Huaxin, and the other two are also members
	of the Company’s management. In addition, China Huaxin borrowed $5.02 million from companies owned by its major shareholder.
	China Huaxin completed trial production and expected to commence commercial production in May 2015. However, as a result of
	environmental initiatives by national, provincial and local government authorities in China, in June 2015, China Huaxin began upgrading
	the DRI facilities by converting the existing coal-gas station systems to liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) station
	systems. The conversion to LNG systems will reduce pollutants and produce higher quality DRIs with less impurities. China Huaxin
	has completed the upgrading and resumed trial production from its upgraded DRI facilities. China Huaxin is currently doing the
	equipment debugging and adjustments, and expects the official production to resume in mid-2017.

	Use of Estimates



	 


	In preparing financial
	statements in conformity with US GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
	liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, as well as the reported
	amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates, required by management, include the recoverability
	of long-lived assets, allowance for doubtful accounts, and the reserve for obsolete and slow-moving inventories. Actual results
	could differ from these estimates.


	 



	Business Combination



	 


	For a business
	combination, the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recognized at the
	acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date. In a business combination achieved in stages, the identifiable
	assets and liabilities, as well as the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, are recognized at the full amounts of their fair
	values. In a bargain purchase in which the total acquisition-date fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the
	fair value of the consideration transferred plus any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree that excess in earnings is recognized
	as a gain attributable to the acquirer.


	 


	Deferred tax liability
	and asset are recognized for the deferred tax consequences of differences between the tax bases and the recognized values of assets
	acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination in accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic 740-10. 


	 



	Goodwill



	 


	Goodwill is the
	excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses
	acquired. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other,” goodwill is not amortized but is
	tested for impairment, annually or when circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist. Impairment testing is performed
	at a reporting unit level. An impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds
	its fair value, with the fair value of the reporting unit determined using discounted cash flow (“DCF”) analysis. A
	number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of DCF analysis to forecast operating cash
	flows, including the discount rate, the internal rate of return and projections of realizations and costs to produce. Management
	considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated.


	 


	On January 23,
	2014, the Company completed the acquisition of China Huaxin.  Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase
	price is allocated to tangible assets and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values with the
	excess recorded to goodwill. The Company recognized RMB 40.02 million ($6.54 million) goodwill from the acquisition.  At
	December 31, 2015, the Company reappraised the fair value of China Huaxin by using the replacement cost since China Huaxin did
	not start official production in 2015 due to the upgrading of its DRI facilities.  As of March 31, 2017 and December
	31, 2016, the Company evaluated the impairment goodwill of using DCF analysis and concluded the goodwill of Huaxin was not
	impaired.


	 



	Cash and Equivalents





	 


	For financial statement purposes,
	the Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash
	equivalents. The Company’s account in the Agriculture Bank of China, Zhuolu Branch of China Jinxin was required to
	be frozen for RMB654,300.00 ($94,320) since October 2016 as a result of a civil judgement for accidental death in favor of an
	employee death (see Note 17). The Company’s bank account in the Bank of China, Cangzhou Bohai district Branch of China
	Huaxin was required to be frozen for RMB79,852 ($11,574) as a result of two civil judgements against the Company for repaying
	two personal loans (see Note 17). Due to limited cash balance in the bank account, the Company recorded $8,791 and $94,320 as
	restricted cash as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.

	Accounts Receivable,

	The Company maintains
	reserves for potential credit losses on accounts receivable. Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes
	historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment
	patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves. The Company had no accounts receivable or bad debt allowances at March 31,
	2017 and December 31, 2016. 


	 



	Inventory,
	net



	 


	Inventory mainly
	consists of iron ore, iron ore concentrate, mineral powder and coal slime for DRI.  Inventory is valued at the lower
	of average cost or market, cost being determined on a moving weighted average basis method; including labor and all production
	overheads.  


	 



	Property and
	Equipment, net



	 


	Property and equipment
	are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Major repairs and betterments that significantly extend original useful lives
	or improve productivity are capitalized and depreciated over the period benefited. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
	When property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from
	the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is included in operations. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed
	using shorter of useful lives of the property or the unit of depletion method. For shorter-lived assets the straight-line method
	over estimated lives ranging from 3 to 20 years is used as follows: 


	 







	Office Equipment




	3-5 years






	Machinery




	10 years






	Vehicles




	5 years






	Building




	20 years







	 




	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets



	 


	Long-lived assets,
	which include property and equipment and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
	indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.


	 


	Recoverability
	of long-lived assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted
	future cash flows expected to be generated by it. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future
	cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value (“FV”).
	FV is generally determined using the asset’s expected future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily determinable.
	Based on its review, the Company believes that, as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, there were $1.07 million and $1.07
	million in impairments of its long-lived assets, respectively (See Note 6). 


	 



	Income Taxes



	 


	The Company follows
	FASB ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes”, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected
	future tax consequences of events included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes
	are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their
	financial reporting amounts at each period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which
	the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred
	tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.


	 


	When tax returns
	are filed, it is likely that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are
	subject to uncertainty about their merits or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax
	position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes
	it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation
	processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not
	recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement
	with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured
	as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheets along with any
	associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. Interest associated with unrecognized
	tax benefits are classified as interest expense and penalties are classified in selling, general and administrative expenses in
	the statements of income. At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company did not take any uncertain positions that would
	necessitate recording a tax related liability.

	Revenue Recognition



	 


	The Company’s
	revenue recognition policies are in compliance with FASB ASC Topic 605, “Revenue Recognition”.   Sales
	are recognized when a formal arrangement exists, which is generally represented by a contract between the Company and the buyer;
	the price is fixed or determinable; title has passed to the buyer, which generally is at the time of delivery; no other significant
	obligations of the Company exist and collectability is reasonably assured. Payments received before all of the relevant criteria
	for revenue recognition are recorded as unearned revenue. 


	 


	Sales are the
	invoiced value of iron ore concentrate and DRI products, net of value-added tax (“VAT”). All of the Company’s
	iron ore concentrate sold in the PRC is subject to a value-added tax of 17% of the gross sales price. This VAT may be offset
	by VAT paid by the Company on raw materials and other materials included in the cost of producing the finished product. The Company
	records VAT payable and VAT receivable net of payments in the financial statements. The VAT tax return is filed offsetting the
	payables against the receivables. Sales and purchases are recorded net of VAT collected and paid as the Company acts as an agent
	for the government.


	 



	Cost of Goods
	Sold



	 


	Cost of goods
	sold (“COGS”) consists primarily of fuel and power, direct material and labor, depreciation of mining plant and equipment,
	attributable to the production of iron ore concentrate. Any write-down of inventory to lower of cost or market is also recorded
	in COGS.


	 



	Concentration
	of Credit Risk



	 


	The operations
	of the Company are in the PRC.  Accordingly, the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations
	may be influenced by the political, economic, and legal environments in the PRC, and by the general state of the PRC economy. 


	 


	The Company has
	cash on hand and demand deposits in accounts maintained with state-owned banks within the PRC. Cash in state-owned banks is not
	covered by insurance. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any risks on
	its cash in these bank accounts.


	 



	Statement of
	Cash Flows



	 


	In accordance
	with FASB ASC Topic 230, “Statement of Cash Flows”, cash flows from the Company’s operations are calculated based
	upon the local currencies. As a result, amounts related to assets and liabilities reported on the statement of cash flows may not
	necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the balance sheet.  Cash from operating, investing and
	financing activities is net of assets and liabilities acquired.


	 



	Fair Value
	of Financial Instruments



	 


	For certain of
	the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and equivalents, accrued liabilities and accounts payable, carrying amounts
	approximate their fair values due to their short maturities.  FASB ASC Topic 825, “Financial Instruments,”
	requires disclosure of the FV of financial instruments held by the Company. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets
	for current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because of the
	short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and the current market rate of
	interest.

	Table of Contents





	 



	Fair Value
	Measurements and Disclosures



	 


	FASB ASC Topic
	820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” defines FV, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures
	of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for FV measures. The three levels are defined as follow:


	 




	 



	●




	Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.





	 



	●




	Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.





	 



	●




	Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the FV measurement.





	 


	As of March 31,
	2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company did not identify any assets and liabilities that are required to be presented on the balance
	sheet at FV.


	 



	Foreign Currency
	Translation and Comprehensive Income (Loss)



	 


	The functional
	currency of China Jinxin and China Huaxin is RMB. For financial reporting purposes, RMB is translated into USD as the reporting
	currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet dates. Revenues and expenses
	are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the reporting period.


	 


	Translation adjustments
	arising from the use of different exchange rates from period to period are included as a component of stockholders’ equity
	as “Accumulated other comprehensive income”. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included
	in income. There was no significant fluctuation in the exchange rate for the conversion of RMB to USD after the balance sheet date. 


	 


	The Company uses
	FASB ASC Topic 220, “Comprehensive Income”. Comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net income and all changes
	to the statements of stockholders’ equity, except those due to investments by stockholders, changes in paid-in capital and
	distributions to stockholders. Comprehensive loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 consisted of net loss and
	foreign currency translation adjustments.


	 



	Share-based compensation



	 


	The Company accounts for share-based compensation
	awards to employees in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, “Compensation – Stock Compensation”, which requires
	that share-based payment transactions with employees be measured based on the grant-date FV of the equity instrument issued and
	recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period.


	 


	The Company accounts for share-based compensation
	awards to non-employees in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 and FASB ASC Subtopic 505-50, “Equity-Based Payments to Non-employees”.
	Share-based compensation associated with the issuance of equity instruments to non-employees is measured at the FV of the equity
	instrument issued or committed to be issued, as this is more reliable than the FV of the services received. The FV is measured
	at the date that the commitment for performance by the counterparty has been reached or the counterparty's performance is complete.


	 



	Earnings (loss)
	per Share (EPS)



	 


	Basic EPS is computed
	by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed similar
	to basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding
	if all the potential common shares, warrants and stock options had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.
	Diluted EPS is based on the assumption that all dilutive convertible shares and stock options and warrants were converted
	or exercised. Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method for the outstanding options and warrants, and the if-converted
	method for the outstanding convertible instruments. Under the treasury stock method, options and warrants are assumed to be exercised
	at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later) and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common
	stock at the average market price during the period. Under the if-converted method, outstanding convertible instruments are assumed
	to be converted into common stock at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later).

	Segment Reporting



	 


	FASB ASC Topic
	280, “Segment Reporting”, requires use of the “management approach” model for segment reporting.  The
	management approach

	 

	model is based on the way a company’s management organizes segments within the Company for
	making operating decisions and assessing performance.  Reportable segments are based on products and services, geography,
	legal structure, management structure, or any other manner in which management disaggregates a company.


	 


	FASB ASC Topic
	280 has no effect on the Company’s financial statements as substantially all of its operations are conducted in one industry
	segment – iron ore mining.  With the upgrading of DRI facilities for both China Jinxin and China Huaxin, the Company
	will be shifting its main product from iron ore to DRI when the upgrading is completed and production starts.


	 



	New Accounting
	Pronouncements



	 


	In August 2014, the Financial Accounting
	Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Presentation of Financial Statements — Going Concern. This standard requires
	management to evaluate for each annual and interim reporting period whether it is probable that the reporting entity will not be
	able to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. If the
	entity is in such a position, the standard provides for certain disclosures depending on whether or not the entity will be able
	to successfully mitigate its going concern status. This guidance is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016
	and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted. The Company does not
	anticipate that this adoption will have a significant impact on its CFS.


	 


	In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting
	Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2015-11, Inventory, which requires an entity to measure inventory within the scope at
	the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business,
	less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The effective date for the standard is for fiscal
	years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate that this adoption will have
	a significant impact on its CFS.


	 


	In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU
	No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. To simplify the
	accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination, the amendments eliminate the requirement
	to retrospectively account for those adjustments. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning
	after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments in this update
	are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December
	15, 2017. The amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date
	with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. The Company does not anticipate that this
	adoption will have a significant impact on its CFS.


	 


	In May 2014, the FASB issued No. 2014-09,
	Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification
	605 - Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Codification. The standard requires that an entity
	recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
	to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB approved a one-year
	deferral of the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities,
	and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December
	15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual
	reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. In March
	2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting
	Revenue versus Net). In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Identifying
	Performance Obligations and Licensing. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-11, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
	and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of ASU 2014-09 and 2014-16, and ASU 2016-12, Revenue
	from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. These ASUs clarify the implementation
	guidance on a few narrow areas and adds some practical expedients to the guidance Topic 606. The Company is evaluating the effect
	that these ASUs will have on its CFS.

	Table of Contents





	 


	On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU
	No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which includes amendments to accounting for income taxes
	at settlement, forfeitures, and net settlements to cover withholding taxes. The amendments in ASU 2016-09 are effective for public
	companies for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is
	permitted but requires all elements of the amendments to be adopted at once rather than individually. The Company is evaluating
	the effect that ASU No. 2016-09 will have on the Company’s CFS.


	 


	In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,
	Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), which requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets
	held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This replaces
	the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized
	cost. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15,
	2019. Early application will be permitted for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
	after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on its CFS.


	 


	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
	2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2016-15 clarifies the presentation and classification of
	certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for public business entities for
	fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company
	is currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2016-15 on its CFS.


	 


	In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
	2016-16—Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. This ASU improves the accounting
	for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. For public business entities, the amendments
	in this update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods
	within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this ASU
	will have a significant impact on its CFS.


	 


	In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
	2016-17 Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control. This update amends the
	consolidation guidance on how a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a variable interest entity (VIE) should treat
	indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining
	whether it is the primary beneficiary of that VIE. This ASU is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning
	after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not
	anticipate that the adoption of this ASU will have a significant impact on its CFS.


	 


	In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18,
	Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash. The guidance requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change
	during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash
	equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with
	cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash
	flows. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim period within those fiscal
	years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The standard should be applied using a retrospective
	transition method to each period presented. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this ASU will have a significant
	impact on its CFS.


	 


	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01,
	Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which clarifies the definition of a business with
	the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions
	or disposals of assets or businesses. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including
	interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The standard should be applied prospectively on or after
	the effective date. The Company will evaluate the impact of adopting this standard prospectively upon any transactions of acquisitions
	or disposals of assets or businesses.

	Table of Contents





	 


	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04,
	Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The guidance removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical
	purchase price allocation. A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds
	its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The guidance should be adopted on a prospective basis for the annual
	or any interim goodwill impairment tests beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual
	goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
	of adopting this standard on its CFS.

	4. MINING RIGHTS



	 


	The Company is
	currently negotiating with the Department of Land and Resources of Hebei Province and the local Zhuolu County government to obtain
	the rights to mine in Zhuolu County where one of its production facilities is located. Pending the final contract, the
	Company accrued the cost of mining rights based on the quantity of ore extracted (see Note 11). The Company used $0.68 (RMB 2.4
	per ton) based on a royalty rate prescribed by the local authority based on the purity of ore in the subject mines. If the rate
	per ton of ore changes when the contract is finalized, the Company will account for the change prospectively as a change in an
	accounting estimate. The Company did not extract any ore in the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, and accordingly
	did not accrue the cost of mining rights for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.

	7. RELATED PARTIES TRANSACTIONS



	 



	Sales to related parties



	 


	In 2016, all of
	the Company's sales was to a related party company owned by its major shareholder. The Company uses sales to offset the borrowings
	from this related party company.


	 



	Advance from related parties



	 


	At March 31, 2017
	and December 31, 2016, China Jinxin owed one of its shareholders $10,220,982 and $10,039,155, respectively, for the purchase of
	equipment used in construction in progress and for working capital needs. The advance from shareholders will not bear
	interest prior to the commencement of the Company's production pursuant to an amended loan agreement entered on January 16, 2013.
	Commencing on the production date, interest will begin to accrue at the bank's annual interest rate on certificates of deposit
	at that time on the amount outstanding from time to time and all amounts inclusive of accrued interest is to be repaid within three
	years of commencement of production at the Zhuolu Mine. China Jinxin had not commenced production as of March 31, 2017.  


	 


	At March
	31, 2017, China Huaxin owed three shareholders, two of whom are also the Company’s management, $24.17 million used to construct
	its DRI facility. Of the $24.17 million, $6.91 million had interest of 10% and a due date of six months from the start date of
	official production.  The remaining payable bore no interest, and is payable upon demand. China Huaxin also borrowed
	$5.02 million from certain companies owned by its major shareholder, which bore no interest and is payable upon demand. At March
	31, 2017, China Huaxin also owed one related party who is the brother of the Company’s major shareholder the amount
	of $72,471, this loan bore interest of 10% and is payable upon demand.


	 


	At December
	31, 2016, China Huaxin owed three shareholders, two of whom are also the Company’s management, $23.88 million used to construct
	its DRI facility. Of the $23.88 million, $6.88 million had interest of 10% and a due date of six months from the start date of
	official production.  The remaining payable bore no interest, and is payable upon demand. China Huaxin also borrowed
	$4.99 million from certain companies owned by its major shareholder, which bore no interest and is payable upon demand. At December
	31, 2016, China Huaxin also owed one related party who is the brother of the Company’s major shareholder the amount
	of $72,077, this loan bore interest of 10% and is payable upon demand. 


	 


	At March 31, 2017

	8. INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET



	 


	Intangible assets
	consisted solely of land use rights. All land in the PRC is government-owned and cannot be sold to any individual or company. However,
	the government grants the user a “land use right” to use the land. China Jinxin acquired land use rights during 2006
	for $0.75 million (RMB 5 million). China Huaxin acquired land use rights for $2.96 million (RMB 18.24 million) in November 2012
	with FV of $5.04 million (RMB 31 million) at acquisition date. China Jinxin and China Huaxin have the right to use their land for
	20 and 49 years, respectively, and are amortizing such rights on a straight-line basis for 20 and 49 years, respectively. 


	 


	Intangible assets

	April 1, 2017, is expected to be: $95,406; $95,406; $95,406; $95,406, and $95,406.


	 



	9. CONSTRUCTION IN PROGRESS



	 


	Construction in
	progress is for the purchase and installation of equipment for future iron ore refining for China Jinxin.  China
	Jinxin had construction in progress of $6,029,718 and $6,036,736 at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. China Jinxin
	completed most of the construction for iron ore refining; however, the management plans to further upgrade the facility for DRI
	production due to increased demand for DRI products in China. The construction for China Jinxin’s DRI facility upgrade was
	almost completed as of the date of this report date and is currently in the final stage of adjusting the equipment and making certain
	modification to the facility after relevant authority’s inspection and testing.


	 



	10. DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY



	 


	At March 31, 2017,
	deferred tax liability was $0.  


	 


	At December 31,
	2016, deferred tax liability of $2,485 arose from the differences between the tax bases and book bases of property and equipment
	and intangible assets arising from the acquisition of China Huaxin.

	As of March 31,
	2017, the $6,167,537 due to unrelated parties were short-term advances from unrelated companies or individuals for the
	Company’s construction and working capital needs, of which, $2,544,968 bore interest of 10% and is due 6 months after the
	commencement of China Huaxin’s official production. The remaining amount of short-term advances bore no interest, and
	is payable upon demand.


	 


	As of December
	31, 2016, the $6,134,019 due to unrelated parties were short-term advances from unrelated companies or individuals for
	the Company’s construction and working capital needs, of which, $2,629,384 bore interest of 10% and is due 6 months after
	the commencement of China Huaxin’s official production. The remaining amount of short-term advances bore no interest,
	and is payable upon demand.


	 



	NONCURRENT



	 


	Under local environmental
	regulations, the Company is obligated at the end of the mine’s useful life to restore and rehabilitate the land that is used
	in its mining operations. The Company estimates it would cost $560,000 (RMB 3.5 million) to restore the entire Zhuolu mine
	after extracting all the economical ore for such efforts.   


	 


	The Company accrued
	certain mine restoration expenses based on the actual production volume during the period it extracted ore. As of March 31, 2017
	and December 31, 2016, the long term accrued mine restoration cost was $11,864 and $11,800, respectively. There was no production
	during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.


	 



	12. SHORT TERM LOAN



	 


	At March 31, 2017
	and December 31, 2016, China Jinxin had a short-term bank loan of $188,425 and $187,401, respectively.  This loan was
	entered in June 2013 for one year, and renewed on June 27, 2014 to June 26, 2015, with monthly interest of 0.9%. This
	loan was renewed on June 30, 2015, for a one-year term to June 29, 2016, and was further renewed to June 26, 2017, with monthly
	interest of 0.83375%.  The loan was secured by a lien on a fixed asset of China Jinxin.


	 



	13. PAYABLE
	TO CONTRACTORS



	 


	In 2007 and 2008,
	the Company entered into contracts with an equipment supplier and a construction company for equipment and construction of a water
	pipeline for $5.75 million (RMB 38 million). The Company recorded the payable in 2009. In 2010, the Company amended the payment
	terms and paid $2.2 million (RMB 14.5 million) and agreed to pay the remaining balance as follows: $2.08 million (RMB 13.5 million)
	on December 31, 2011, and $1.47 million (RMB 10 million) on December 31, 2012. During 2011, the Company paid $2.86 million (RMB
	18.0 million). During 2012, the Company did not make any payment on this payable. On March 20, 2013, the Company amended the payment
	terms and agreed to pay the remaining balance of $902,098 (RMB 5,500,000) on December 31, 2014. Based on the amended agreement,
	if the Company paid in full by December 31, 2014, no interest would be charged. The Company agreed that if it defaulted it would
	pay interest starting on January 1, 2015 based on the current bank interest rate for the remaining balance at that time. Starting
	from January 1, 2015, the Company agreed to pay interest based on the current bank interest rate of 5.35% for the outstanding
	balance at December 31, 2014.  As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company has $797,182 and $792,850
	of payable to contractors, respectively. 


	 


	The Company recorded
	the restructuring of this payable in accordance with ASC 470-60-35-5, as it was a modification of its terms, it did not involve
	a transfer of assets or grant of an equity interest. Accordingly, the Company accounted for the effects of the restructuring prospectively
	from the time of restructuring, and did not change the carrying amount of the payable at the time of the restructuring as the carrying
	amount did not exceed the total future cash payments specified by the new terms. 


	 



	14. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY



	 




	Shares issued to consulting firm




	 


	On November 15, 2016, the Company entered
	into a consulting agreement with a consulting firm. The Company issued 3,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to
	the firm for 24 months of consulting services including financial analysis, business plan advisory, due diligence assistance for
	financing and IR services.  The shares were issued in January 2017; and the FVwas $1,050,000, which was recorded as prepaid
	expense; the FV was calculated based on the stock price of $0.35 per share on November 15, 2016, and amortized over the service
	term. At March 31, 2017, the Company had prepaid expense of $853,125. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company
	amortized $131,250 as stock compensation expense. In addition to the 3,000,000 shares, the Company also agreed to pay the consultant
	$4,000 cash per month on or before the 5

	th

	 day of each calendar month.

	16. MAJOR CUSTOMER AND VENDORS



	 


	Sales for the
	three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were $0, respectively.


	 


	China Jinxin made
	a 10-year contract with Handan Steel Group Company (“HSG”) a state-owned enterprise, and agreed to sell all of its
	output from its Zhuolu production facility to HSG. The selling price was to be based on the market price. HSG agreed to purchase
	all the Company’s products from its Zhuolu production facility regardless of changes in the market. China Jinxin is economically
	dependent on HSG. However, as of today, China Jinxin has refused to sell its iron ore concentrate to its sole customer because
	of the low price offered.


	 



	17. LITIGATION



	 


	On September 4, 2012, Shijiazhuang City
	QiaoXi District People’s Court ruled China Huaxin had to repay a loan of RMB 49,067 ($7,073) plus court fees of RMB 510 ($74)
	to a plaintiff within 10 days of the judgment. 

	China Huaxin has paid RMB 10,216 ($1,481)
	in January 2017.



	 


	On April 7, 2013, the Zhulu County Labor
	Dispute Arbitration Committee ruled that China Jinxin had to pay RMB 654,300 ($94,320) to an employee as a result of her death
	in a traffic accident in 2010 when she was on the way to China Jinxin. China Jinxin denied that it had an employment relationship
	with the plaintiff and appealed to Hebei Province Zhulu County People’s Court; on August 3, 2015, Hebei Province Zhulu County
	People’s Court confirmed there was an employment relationship and affirmed the original judgement in favor of the plaintiff.
	The Court froze the Company’s bank account for $94,320 in October 2016. This liability was accrued as of December 31, 2016.


	 


	On December 30, 2016, Hebei Province Haixing
	County People’s Court ruled that China Huaxin had to pay the outstanding balance of RMB 410,537 ($59,181) electricity fee
	plus RMB 3,288 ($474) in court fees that it owed to GuoWang Hebei Province Electric Company Haixing County branch before January
	9

	th

	, 2017. China Huaxin accrued this liability in 2016 and paid the balance in full in March 2017.


	 


	On August 13, 2014, Heibei Province Haixing
	County People’s Court ruled that China Huaxin had to repay a loan of RMB 60,000 ($8,697) plus applicable interest which
	is calculated based on the Bank of China’s interest rate for the loan with the same term to a plaintiff within 10 days of
	the judgment. At March 31, 2017,

	China Huaxin had outstanding balance of RMB 39,502
	($5,726).

	18. STATUTORY RESERVES



	 


	Pursuant to the
	corporate law of the PRC effective January 1, 2006, the Company is now only required to maintain one statutory reserve by appropriating
	money from its after-tax profit before declaration or payment of dividends. The statutory reserve represents restricted retained
	earnings.


	 



	19. OPERATING RISKS



	 


	The Company’s
	operations in the PRC are subject to specific considerations and significant risks not typically associated with companies in North
	America and Western Europe. These include risks associated with, among others, the political, economic and legal environments and
	foreign currency exchange. The Company’s results may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies with respect
	to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, currency conversion and remittance abroad, and rates and methods of taxation,
	among other things. 


	 


	The Company’s
	sales, purchases and expenses are denominated in RMB and all of the Company’s assets and liabilities are also denominated
	in RMB. The RMB is not freely convertible into foreign currencies under the current law. In China, foreign exchange transactions
	are required by law to be transacted only by authorized financial institutions. Remittances in currencies other than RMB may require
	certain supporting documentation in order to effect the remittance.


	 


	All mineral resources in China are owned
	by the state. Thus, the Company’s ability to obtain iron ore is dependent upon its ability to obtain mineral rights
	from the relevant state authorities, purchase ore from another party that has mining rights from the state or import ore from outside
	the PRC. It is generally not feasible to transport iron ore any significant distance before processing. The Company has yet to
	obtain long term rights to any iron mine and there is no assurance the Company will be able to do so. Although the Company has
	extracted iron ore from the Zhuolu Mine on which the Company’s production facilities are located, the Company does not have
	the right to do so and can be subjected to various fines and penalties. The Company is not able to determine the amount of fines
	and penalties at the current stage; however, the Company believes the fines and penalties are negotiable with the authorities.
	If the Company is not able to obtain mining rights to the Zhuolu Mine in the future, the Company will have to cease mining operations
	at the Zhuolu Mine and the Company will seek to acquire iron ore from third parties. The failure to obtain iron ore reserves for
	processing at all or on reasonably acceptable terms would have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results.


	 



	20. SUBSEQUENT
	EVENT



	 


	On April 27, 2017, the Company issued a
	press release announcing the restart of production following a 2-year production modernization period. The production
	was limited to test runs and no revenue was accrued during the first quarter of 2017.


	 



	Item 2

	.

	  Management's
	Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations



	 




	Overview




	 


	We seek to profit
	by participating in various aspects of the Chinese steel making industry including the mining and processing of iron ore and other
	forms of iron, which can be used to produce iron concentrate, fines, pellets or sinter.  To date we have been engaged in iron ore
	processing and the production of iron ore concentrate in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) through our variable
	interest entity (‘VIE’), China Jinxin, and through the production of DRI by our subsidiary, China Huaxin.


	 


	China Jinxin’s
	DRI facility upgrade was almost completed as of the date of this report and is currently in the final stage of adjusting equipment
	and making certain modification to the facility after relevant authority’s inspection and testing.


	 







	19







	Table of Contents





	 


	On January 17,
	2014, we acquired a direct reduced iron (“DRI”) production facility in Haixing County, Hebei Province.  We
	completed trial production at this facility and expected to commence commercial production in May 2015. However, as a result of
	environmental initiatives by government authorities in China, starting in June 2015, we began upgrading the DRI facilities by converting
	the existing coal-gas station systems to liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) station systems. The conversion
	to LNG systems will reduce pollutants and produce higher quality DRIs with less impurities. China Huaxin has completed the upgrading
	and resumed trial production from its upgraded DRI facilities. China Huaxin is currently doing equipment debugging and adjustment,
	and expects to resume official production in mid-2017.


	 


	We own all of
	the issued and outstanding capital stock of Real Fortune BVI, which in turn owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock
	of Real Fortune Holdings Limited, a Hong Kong limited company (“Real Fortune HK”), which in turn owns all of the
	issued and outstanding capital stock of Zhangjiakou Tongda Mining Technologies Service Co., Ltd., a Chinese limited company (“China
	Tongda”). Real Fortune BVI was established in the BVI in September 2010 to serve as an intermediate holding company. 
	Real Fortune HK was established in HK in April 2010. China Tongda was established in the PRC in August 2010, and in August 2010,
	the local government of the PRC issued a certificate of approval regarding the foreign ownership of China Tongda by Real Fortune
	HK.  China Jinxin, one of our operating affiliates, was established in the PRC in December 2006. 


	 


	We have effective
	control of the management and operations of China Jinxin, an iron ore processing and high grade iron ore concentrate producer with
	a production line located in Zhuolu County, Zhangjiakou City, Hebei Province, China, through a series of agreements among China
	Tongda, China Jinxin and its shareholders, referred to as “VIE agreements.” China Jinxin has an annual capacity of
	approximately 300,000 tons.  Under the VIE agreements, China Tongda is entitled to receive the pre-tax profits of China
	Jinxin.  


	 


	On January 17,
	2014, China Tongda acquired all of the outstanding shares of China Huaxin. China Huaxin produces Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) at its
	DRI production facility (the “DRI Facility”) in Haixing County, Hebei Province, about 50 km from the nearest port,
	using advanced reduction rotary kiln technology with iron sand as the principal raw material. China Huaxin imports iron sands
	from New Zealand, Australia, Indonesia and the Philippines. The total amount expended to construct the DRI Facility, inclusive
	of both hard and soft costs, was approximately 244,270,000 RMB or $39 million.  China Huaxin completed trial production
	in May 2015. However, due to environmental initiatives by government authorities in China, starting in June 2015, China Huaxin
	began upgrading the DRI facilities by converting the existing coal-gas station systems to liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) station
	systems. In the end of 2016, China Huaxin completed the upgrading and resumed trial production from its upgraded DRI facilities.
	Unlike China Jinxin, which we control through the VIE agreements, China Huaxin is directly owned by China Tongda, our wholly owned
	subsidiary.


	 


	To date, we have
	received only temporary manufacturing licenses granted by the agencies of the local government, which allowed us to process ore
	that we obtained from Zhuolu Mine, the mine on which our facility is located, or other third parties.


	 


	Our ability to
	profit from our facility in Zhuolu is dependent upon our ability to extract and process iron ore from the Zhuolu Mine and sell
	the output for a price that enables us to profit. To date, all of our sales from this facility have been made to a single customer.
	We entered into a ten-year contract with this customer, which expires in January 2019. Pursuant to this agreement, we agreed to
	sell the customer, HSG, all of the output from our Zhuolu facility, which it agreed to purchase. The price paid to us by HSG is
	to be determined by HSG in light of the quality of our product and market prices and is to be such that it results in a proper
	margin to us. Thus, our ability to profit from our current production facility at the Zhuolu Mine over the next few years
	will be determined by the prices we receive from HSG. We cannot guarantee that HSG will not offer a price below what it pays to
	the Company’s competitors. The lower price will reduce our profit margin. However, if we are not satisfied with the price
	set by HSG, we can attempt to renegotiate the price. In an effort to obtain a higher price from HSG, we have yet to deliver iron
	ore concentrate we produced in the fourth quarter of 2011. We are continuing to negotiate with HSG to resolve our dispute over
	the price to be paid for our output. 


	 


	There was no production
	and sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. China Huaxin is currently doing the equipment debugging and
	adjustment, and expected the official production in mid-2017.

	All mineral resources
	in China are owned by the state. Thus, our ability to obtain iron ore depends upon our ability to obtain mineral licenses from
	the relevant state authorities, purchase ore from another party that has mining rights or import ore from outside of China. It
	is generally not feasible to transport iron ore any significant distance before processing. We believe, as evidenced by our shareholders’
	willingness to finance the construction of our Zhuolu facilities, there is sufficient iron ore in the vicinity of our Zhuolu facilities
	to enable us to operate them at a profit. Nevertheless, we have yet to obtain long term rights to any iron mine and there is no
	assurance we will be able to do so. Although we extracted iron ore from the Zhuolu Mine where our production facilities are located,
	we do not have the right to do so and can be subjected to various fines and penalties. However, since we paid geological survey
	fees on behalf of the local government so it could process applications related to the right to mine the Zhuolu Mine and has not
	received any challenges from any authorities regarding our mining activities, we believe that even if fines and penalties are assessed
	against us in the future, the amount should be negotiable with the authorities. If we are unable to obtain mining rights to the
	Zhuolu Mine, we will have to acquire iron ore from third parties. The failure to obtain iron ore for processing at all or on reasonably
	acceptable terms would have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. We have not yet receive the official
	mining rights to extract; accordingly, we made a provision for fixed assets impairment for all the mine extracting and broken equipment
	and machinery. We’ve been negotiating a sale agreement with a new customer for China Jinxin, and expecting the agreement
	to be signed in mid-2017.


	 


	To date we have
	been dependent upon cash advances from our shareholders. If we were not to obtain sufficient iron ore for processing, it is likely
	our operations would cease unless our shareholders continue to provide sufficient funds to maintain our plant and equipment until
	such time as our operations could be resumed.


	 


	We may seek to
	grow our operations by acquiring mining rights and other production facilities. The cash necessary to acquire such rights may exceed
	that which we have on hand. In such event, we may seek to raise the necessary cash through bank loans or the issuance of equity
	to the vendors of such rights, our shareholders or third parties. There can be no assurance such cash will be available to us on
	reasonable terms, if at all. The prices and terms at which we issue equity securities and the performance of any rights or facilities
	we acquire, will determine whether we operate profitably.


	 


	The profitability
	of the mining industry in China and of our Company in particular, is dependent upon the demand for iron ore and other metals within
	China. This demand in turn, is influenced by general economic factors, such as the rate of growth of the economy and of the construction
	industry. There can be no assurance that China will return to the rapid rates of growth it experienced in the recent past. If the
	rate of growth of the Chinese economy remains low or were to slow down, demand for iron and steel could fall, adversely impacting
	our operations.

	Sales



	 


	Our revenues have
	been from the sale of DRI and iron ore concentrate. We commenced production of iron ore at our Zhuolu facility in March 2010. However,
	we ceased production from September 2010 to March 2011 because the local government implemented an “Energy Saving and Emission
	Reduction Plan” to reduce local power consumption. We installed power equipment to enable us to maintain a stable power supply
	to our production equipment and management believes the Energy Saving and Emission Reduction Plan is one-time event and disruptions
	to our access to energy will not have a material impact on our production in the future. We also ceased production in December
	2011 due to a pricing dispute with our major customer and to upgrade our production facilities. Construction for China Jinxin’s
	DRI facility upgrade was complete as of the date of this report and we are currently in the final stages of adjusting the equipment
	and making certain modification to the facility after relevant authority’s inspection and testing.


	 


	We acquired a
	new subsidiary, China Huaxin, in January 2014, through which we own a direct reduced iron production facility, which was recently
	constructed. China Huaxin completed trial production and expected to commence commercial production in May 2015. However, as a
	result of environmental initiatives by government authorities in China, starting in June 2015, China Huaxin has been upgrading
	the DRI facilities by converting the existing coal-gas station systems to liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) station
	systems. The conversion to LNG systems will reduce pollutants and produce higher quality DRIs with less impurities.  China
	Huaxin has completed the upgrading and resumed trial production from its upgraded DRI facilities. China Huaxin is currently doing
	the equipment debugging and adjustments, and expects to resume official production in mid-2017.


	 


	There was no production
	and sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.


	 



	Cost of Goods
	Sold



	 


	Cost of goods
	("COGS”) sold consists primarily of fuel, power, direct material, direct labor, depreciation of production plant items
	and equipment, and accrual of the mining rights, which are attributable to the production of iron ore, iron ore concentrate and
	DRI.


	 


	COGS for the three
	months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was $0 due to the absence of sales and production.


	 



	Gross Income
	(Loss)



	 


	We did not have
	any sales and production for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.


	 



	Operating Expenses



	 


	Operating expenses
	consist mainly of employee salaries and welfare, business meeting and promotion expense, depreciation and amortization of items
	not associated with production, utilities, and audit and legal expenses.


	 



	Operating
	expenses were $1,009,565 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $1,007,404 for the same period in
	2016, an increase of $2,161 or 0.2%; despite we had stock compensation expense of $131,250 for shares issued for consulting
	service in the three months ended March 31, 2017, we actually incurred less operating expenses for salary and welfare expenses,
	marketing and business entertainment expenses during the three months ended March 31, 2017 as a result of the company’s cost
	saving efforts.

	Other Expenses



	 



	Other
	expenses were $291,080

	 

	for the three months ended 

	March 31, 2017

	,
	compared to $267,870 for the 2016 period.  The 9% increase in other expenses was mainly due to the loss on disposal
	of certain obsolete construction in progress of $40,081 for China Jinxin for the three months ended March 31, 2017.



	 



	Net Loss



	 


	We had a net loss of $1,298,146 for
	the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to net loss of $1,267,062 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase
	in our net loss results from the increased operating and other expenses.


	 




	Liquidity and Capital Resources




	 


	Our ability to
	generate cash from operations is dependent upon our ability to obtain iron ore and iron sands to process and to maintain the permits
	necessary to process such ore at our current facilities, neither of which is assured. If we cannot obtain iron ore and iron sands
	to process or are no longer able to process ore and sands, we would be dependent upon cash infusions from our current
	shareholders or third parties in the form of loans or equity contributions, or a combination thereof, to maintain our facilities
	until we can resume operations. One shareholder has indicated she will continue to fund China Jinxin, although there is no written
	agreement in place and China Jinxin currently owes her $10.19 million. In addition, China Huaxin borrowed $24.17 million from three
	of our shareholders (one of whom is the individual who funded China Jinxin and who has loaned $16.52 million to China Huaxin, another
	of whom is our CEO and who has loaned $2.05 million, and the third of whom is a shareholder and senior officer who has loaned
	$5.59 million). Despite such commitments, there is no assurance adequate cash will be available from current shareholders or from
	third parties and, if it is available, what the terms of any loan or investment might be. If we are unable to obtain the funding
	required, we may have to curtail or cease our operations. We have no specific plans, understandings or agreements with respect
	to the raising of such funds, and we may seek to raise the required capital by the issuance of equity or debt securities or by
	other means. Since we have no such arrangements or plans currently in effect, our inability to raise funds may have a severe negative
	impact on our ability to become a viable company.  


	 


	Other than current
	construction in progress, which will be funded by one of our shareholders, we do not anticipate significant cash expenditures in
	the immediate future on our current production facilities. Nevertheless, we may require working capital once we resume production
	at our facilities. Certain of our shareholders have verbally agreed to continue to provide cash to satisfy our working capital
	needs. However, in the future, we intend to continue the expansion of operations by acquiring new production facilities and mines.
	The acquisitions will be paid for with cash or our equity securities, or combinations of both. Failure to obtain such financing
	could have a material adverse effect on our business expansion. The issuance and sale our equity securities would dilute the interest
	of our current shareholders. Further, there is no guarantee of the terms on which such an issuance would occur, if at all, or whether
	such terms would be favorable to our current shareholders. 


	 


	As of March 31,
	2017, cash and equivalents were $23,779, compared to $86,519 cash and equivalents as of December 31, 2016. The following is a summary
	of cash provided by or used in each of the indicated types of activities during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016,
	respectively.

	Net cash used in operating activities was $317,657 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared
	to net cash used in operating activities of $129,119 in the same period of 2016. The increase of cash outflow from operating activities
	for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was principally attributable to increased cash outflow from accounts payable of $71,236
	for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared with cash inflow from accounts payable of $50,317 for the same period of 2016;
	decreased cash inflow from accrued liabilities and other payables of $235,479 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared
	with cash inflow from accrued liabilities and other payables of $454,611 for the same period of 2016; despite the increased cash
	inflow from restricted cash of $86,226 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared with cash inflow from restricted cash
	of $0 for the same period of 2016.

	Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities



	 


	Net cash used in investing activities was $1,002 for the three
	months ended March 31, 2017, compared to cash provided by investing activities of $14,091 for the same period in 2016. During the
	three months ended March 31, 2017, we had cash inflow of $95,018 for restricted cash and cash outflow of $1,002 for acquisition
	of fixed assets. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we had cash inflow of $14,091 for advance to suppliers for construction
	and equipment.


	 



	Net cash provided by financing activities



	 


	Net cash provided by financing activities was $255,352 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared
	to net cash provided by financing activities of $177,827 in the same period of 2016. The net cash provided by financing activities
	in the three months ended March 31, 2017 was due to advances from related parties of $255,352, compared with cash inflow from
	advances from related parties of $177,827 for the same period of 2016.


	 


	At 

	March
	31, 2017

	, we had a working capital deficit of $51.84 million, a decrease in deficit of $0.15 million from the deficit at
	December 31, 2016 of $51.99 million, 

	which was mainly from increased prepaid expense.



	 


	As of March 31,
	2017, China Jinxin had borrowed $10.19 million from one of its shareholders for working capital and production facility construction
	needs. 

	The loan of $10.19 million will not bear interest prior to the commencement of
	production pursuant to an amended loan agreement entered on January 16, 2013. Commencing on the production date, interest will
	begin to accrue at the bank's annual interest rate on certificates of deposit at that time on the amount outstanding from time
	to time and all amounts inclusive of accrued interest is to be repaid within three years of our commencement of production at the
	Zhuolu Mine. China Huaxin borrowed $24.17 million from three shareholders; 

	of the $24.17 million, $6.91 million has
	an interest rate of 10% with a due date of the 6th month anniversary of the date of official production.  The remaining
	payables bear no interest, and are payable upon demand.  In addition, China Huaxin borrowed $5.02 million from certain
	companies owned by its major shareholder, which bear no interest and are payable upon demand.


	 




	Contractual Obligations




	 


	We have certain
	fixed contractual obligations and commitments in respect of which we estimate future payments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation
	provisions, changing interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates. We cannot provide
	certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We present below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in
	our determination of amounts presented in the tables, in order to assist in the review of this information within the context of
	our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.

	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements




	 


	We have not entered
	into any financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the obligations of any third parties. We have not entered into
	any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as shareholder’s equity or that are not reflected
	in our consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred
	to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do not have any variable
	interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing,
	hedging or research and development services with us. 


	 




	Critical Accounting Policies
	and Estimates




	 


	Our management's
	discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements,
	which were prepared in accordance with US GAAP. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to
	our consolidated financial statements, we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding
	and evaluating this management discussion and analysis.


	 




	Emerging Growth Company




	 


	On April 5, 2012,
	the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements
	for qualifying public companies. As an “emerging growth company,” we may, under Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities
	Act, delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until such standards would otherwise
	apply to private companies. We may take advantage of this extended transition period until the first to occur of the date that
	we (i) are no longer an "emerging growth company" or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of this extended transition
	period. We elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore
	not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. Until the date we are no longer
	an "emerging growth company" or affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the exemption provided by Securities Act Section
	7(a)(2)(B), upon issuance of a new or revised accounting standard that applies to our financial statements and that has a different
	effective date for public and private companies, we will disclose the date on which adoption is required for non-emerging growth
	companies and the date on which we will adopt the recently issued accounting standard. The Jobs Act also provides exemption
	from auditor reporting on the Company’s Internal Control Over Financial reporting as required by section 404(b) of the Sarbanes
	Oxley Act of 2002.


	 




	Basis of Presentations




	 


	Our financial
	statements are prepared in accordance with US GAAP and the requirements of Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange
	Commission (“SEC”).


	 




	Going Concern




	 


	We incurred net
	losses of $1.30 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. We also had a working capital deficit of $51.84 million as of
	March 31, 2017. In addition, we have refused to sell our iron ore concentrate to our sole customer because of the low price offered
	for our product. The price of iron ore concentrate is still in decline. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to whether
	we can continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
	of this uncertainty. One shareholder has indicated she will continue to fund China Jinxin, though there is no written agreement
	in place and the Company currently owes $10.19 million to the shareholder. In addition, China Huaxin borrowed $24.17 million from
	three shareholders, and borrowed $5.02 million from certain companies owned by its major shareholder. Despite such commitments,
	there is no assurance that adequate cash will be available from current shareholders or from third parties and, if it is available,
	what the terms of any loan or investment might be. If we are unable to obtain the funding required, we may have to curtail or cease
	our operations. The Company has no specific plans, understandings or agreements with respect to the raising of such funds, and
	it may seek to raise the required capital by the issuance of equity or debt securities or by other means. Since it has no such
	arrangements or plans currently in effect, its inability to raise funds may have a severe negative impact on its ability to become
	a viable company.

	Use of Estimates




	 


	In preparing financial
	statements in conformity with US GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
	liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, as well as the reported
	amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates, required by management, include the recoverability
	of long-lived assets, allowance for doubtful accounts, and the reserve for obsolete and slow-moving inventories. Actual results
	could differ from those estimates.


	 




	Revenue Recognition




	 


	The Company’s
	revenue recognition policies are in compliance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 104 (codified in FASB ASC
	Topic 605). Sales are recognized when a formal arrangement exists, which is generally represented by a contract between the Company
	and the buyer; the price is fixed or determinable; title has passed to the buyer, which generally is at the time of delivery; no
	other significant obligations of the Company exist and collectability is reasonably assured. Payments received before all of the
	relevant criteria for revenue recognition are recorded as unearned revenue.  


	 


	Sales were the
	invoiced value of iron ore and iron ore concentrate, net of value-added tax (“VAT”). All of the Company’s iron
	ore concentrate sold in the PRC is subject to a VAT of 17% of the gross sales price. This VAT may be offset by VAT paid by the
	Company on raw materials and other materials included in the cost of producing the finished product. The Company records VAT payable
	and VAT receivable net of payments in the financial statements. The VAT tax return is filed offsetting the payables against the
	receivables. Sales and purchases are recorded net of VAT collected and paid as the Company acts as an agent for the government. 


	 


	The Company uses
	FASB ASC Topic 220, “Comprehensive Income”. Comprehensive income is comprised of net income and all changes to the
	statements of stockholders’ equity, except those due to investments by stockholders, changes in paid-in capital and distributions
	to stockholders. 


	 




	Foreign Currency Translation
	and Comprehensive Income (Loss)




	 


	The functional
	currency is the Renminbi (“RMB”). For financial reporting purposes, RMB were translated into United States Dollars
	(“USD” or “$”) as the reporting currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in
	effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the reporting
	period.


	 


	Translation adjustments
	arising from the use of different exchange rates from period to period are included as a component of stockholders’ equity
	as “Accumulated other comprehensive income”. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included
	in income. There has been no significant fluctuation in the exchange rate for the conversion of RMB to USD after the balance sheet
	date.


	 


	The fluctuation
	of exchange rates does not imply free convertibility of RMB to other foreign currencies. All foreign exchange transactions continue
	to take place either through the People’s Bank of China (“PBOC”) or other banks authorized to buy and sell foreign
	currencies at the exchange rate quoted by the PBOC.


	 


	The Company uses
	FASB ASC Topic 220, “Comprehensive Income”.  Comprehensive income is comprised of net income and all changes
	to the statements of stockholders’ equity, except those due to investments by stockholders, changes in paid-in capital and
	distributions to stockholders.

	Segment Reporting




	 


	Disclosures about
	segments of an enterprise and related information require use of the “management approach” model for segment reporting,
	codified in FASB ASC Topic 280.  The management approach model is based on the way a company's management organizes segments
	within the company for making operating decisions and assessing performance.  Reportable segments are based on products
	and services, geography, legal structure, management structure, or any other manner in which management disaggregates a company.


	 


	FASB ASC Topic
	280 has no effect on the Company’s financial statements as substantially all of its operations are conducted in one industry
	segment – iron ore refining.


	 




	Recent Accounting Pronouncements 




	 


	In August 2014, the Financial Accounting
	Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Presentation of Financial Statements — Going Concern. This standard requires
	management to evaluate for each annual and interim reporting period whether it is probable that the reporting entity will not be
	able to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. If the
	entity is in such a position, the standard provides for certain disclosures depending on whether or not the entity will be able
	to successfully mitigate its going concern status. This guidance is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016
	and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted. The Company does not
	anticipate that this adoption will have a significant impact on its CFS.


	 


	In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting
	Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2015-11, Inventory, which requires an entity to measure inventory within the scope at
	the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business,
	less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The effective date for the standard is for fiscal
	years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate that this adoption will have
	a significant impact on its CFS.


	 


	In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU
	No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. To simplify the
	accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination, the amendments eliminate the requirement
	to retrospectively account for those adjustments. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning
	after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments in this update
	are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December
	15, 2017. The amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date
	with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. The Company does not anticipate that this
	adoption will have a significant impact on its CFS.


	 


	In May 2014, the FASB issued No. 2014-09,
	Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification
	605 - Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Codification. The standard requires that an entity
	recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
	to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB approved a one-year
	deferral of the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities,
	and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December
	15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual
	reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. In March
	2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting
	Revenue versus Net). In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Identifying
	Performance Obligations and Licensing. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-11, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
	and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of ASU 2014-09 and 2014-16, and ASU 2016-12, Revenue
	from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. These ASUs clarify the implementation
	guidance on a few narrow areas and adds some practical expedients to the guidance Topic 606. The Company is evaluating the effect
	that these ASUs will have on its CFS.

	On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU
	No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which includes amendments to accounting for income taxes
	at settlement, forfeitures, and net settlements to cover withholding taxes. The amendments in ASU 2016-09 are effective for public
	companies for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is
	permitted but requires all elements of the amendments to be adopted at once rather than individually. The Company is evaluating
	the effect that ASU No. 2016-09 will have on the Company’s CFS.


	 


	In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,
	Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), which requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets
	held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This replaces
	the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized
	cost. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15,
	2019. Early application will be permitted for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
	after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on its CFSs.


	 


	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
	2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2016-15 clarifies the presentation and classification of
	certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for public business entities for
	fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company
	is currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2016-15 on its CFS.


	 


	In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
	2016-16—Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. This ASU improves the accounting
	for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. For public business entities, the amendments
	in this update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods
	within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this ASU
	will have a significant impact on its CFS.


	 


	In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
	2016-17 Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control. This update amends the
	consolidation guidance on how a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a variable interest entity (VIE) should treat
	indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining
	whether it is the primary beneficiary of that VIE. This ASU is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning
	after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not
	anticipate that the adoption of this ASU will have a significant impact on its CFS.


	 


	In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18,
	Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash. The guidance requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change
	during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash
	equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with
	cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash
	flows. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim period within those fiscal
	years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The standard should be applied using a retrospective
	transition method to each period presented. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this ASU will have a significant
	impact on its CFS.


	 


	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01,
	Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which clarifies the definition of a business with
	the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions
	or disposals of assets or businesses. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including
	interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The standard should be applied prospectively on or after
	the effective date. The Company will evaluate the impact of adopting this standard prospectively upon any transactions of acquisitions
	or disposals of assets or businesses.

	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04,
	Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The guidance removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical
	purchase price allocation. A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds
	its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The guidance should be adopted on a prospective basis for the annual
	or any interim goodwill impairment tests beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual
	goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
	of adopting this standard on its CFS.


	 


	As of December 31, 2016, there is no
	other recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted that would have a material effect on the Company’s CFS.


	 



	Item 4. Controls and Procedures.



	 



	(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

	.


	 


	Management of Adamant DRI Processing and
	Minerals Group is responsible for maintaining disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required
	to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange
	Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s
	rules and forms. In addition, the disclosure controls and procedures must ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated
	to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow
	timely decisions regarding required financial and other required disclosures.


	 


	At March 31, 2017, an evaluation of the
	effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) of the Securities Exchange
	Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive
	Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based on their evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, they concluded that
	at March 31, 2017, such disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.  This was due to our limited resources,
	including the absence of a financial staff with accounting and financial expertise and deficiencies in the design or operation
	of our internal control over financial reporting that adversely affected our disclosure controls and that may be considered to
	be “material weaknesses.”


	 


	We plan to designate individuals responsible
	for identifying reportable developments and to implement procedures designed to remediate the material weakness by focusing additional
	attention and resources in our internal accounting functions. However, the material weakness will not be considered remediated
	until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that
	these controls are operating effectively.


	 



	(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.



	 


	 There have been no changes in our internal control over
	financial reporting that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonable
	likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Given the limitations of our accounting personnel,
	we need to take additional steps to ensure that our financial statements are in accordance with US GAAP.


	 



	PART II



	 



	OTHER INFORMATION



	 



	Item 1A – Risk Factors.
