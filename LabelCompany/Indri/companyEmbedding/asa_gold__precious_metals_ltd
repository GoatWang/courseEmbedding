Gold
Civilizations have equated gold with gods, wealth, and immortality. For centuries, gold has symbolized power and used as a storage of wealth. The fact that gold neither corrodes nor tarnishes not to mention the beauty of the precious metal made it suitable for deities and royalty in ancient civilizations. A gold standard was used as a monetary policy within and between nations but the world gold standard ended in 1976. The 1930’s was the last time gold was used in minted coins designated for circulation. Historically, the value of gold was based on perceived rarity and its distinctive color.

Almost half of the new gold consumed each year is for jewelry, 40% is for investments and 10% for industry purposes. The high malleability and conductivity of gold are characteristics that make gold used in many types of computerized devices. The precious metal is also used in tooth restoration, as an anti-inflammatory, and infrared shields.
Paper currencies have come and gone but gold remains in demand and has an inherent value. Gold bars, coins, and Investment Grade Coins are all popular ways to invest in the yellow metal.

Gold Bars
Gold bars are the most popular way to invest in gold and generally the form of gold bullion that most people think about. A gold bar can come in a variety of sizes from 1 gram to 1 kilo. Actually, a gold bar can be as big as someone’s imagination. Currently, the largest gold bar in history was produced by Mitsubishi Materials Corporation. The bar weighed 551 pounds and would be worth over $11 million with a spot price of $1275.

Investors prefer gold bars because they offer the most gold with a lower premium versus gold coins. Investors and collectors like gold coins and are willing to pay a higher premium due to the collectability of gold coins.
Gold Coins

Gold coins value is based on the weight of the precious metal and the scarcity of the coin itself. The scarcity arises from the fact that once a mintage of a coin is done for a specific year there will never be another coin of that year produced. Minted coins also offer the guarantee that comes from a reputable mint like the U.S. Mint. Gold coins are generally legal tender in the country that the coin was minted.

Investment Grade Coins

Investment Grade Coins are higher quality and more rare than bullion coins. These coins are also graded and are enclosed in a protective slab to ensure and preserve the condition of the coin. A study commissioned by the U.S. Congress has proven that certain Investment Grade Coins are shown to have an annual return of 15%. Investment Grade Coins are for investors planning to hold onto their investment for at least 3 years.

How to Build Your Precious Metals Portfolio

The following questionnaire takes into account your commodities experience, tolerance for risk, time horizon and other factors. The way you answer these questions will help us design a metals portfolio that safeguards your money from fluctuations in the market while positioning for superior long-term growth.
In the financial world, this concept is known as a “straddle and strangle strategy." It is commonly done by professionals in the options market when they know that there will be volatility in a certain asset, but they don’t necessarily know which way it will swing. Should you invest in raw coins and bars (bullion) or would you be better suited to acquire investment grade coins? It depends on the goals and objectives of your investment.Select the number that indicates where you rank on the scale for each of the following questions. There are no right or wrong answers!

Don’t rely on the government, or anyone else, to "protect" your hard-earned retirement savings for you.

Thanks to a little-known law, you can now put physical gold or silver (not mining stocks or "paper gold") into your IRA account. You'll never have to wonder if your retirement fund is secure, because YOU have all the control. There's no hassle to access it, no password to remember, and no wondering if it's really there when you need it most.

About
History

Board of Directors


Company

	ASA Gold and Precious Metals Limited, originally named American-South African Investment Company, Limited, was founded as a South African corporation in 1958. The Company was the idea of Charles Engelhard, Chairman of Engelhard Industries Inc., which at the time maintained extensive business interests in the United States and South Africa. 

	 

	The Company was organized to provide Americans with a medium to invest in the common shares of companies engaged in the business of mining gold in South Africa. At the time, Americans were prohibited from owning gold bullion and 80 percent of the world's gold was produced in South Africa. Unlike today, it was difficult for the average investor to purchase shares traded on the Johannesburg stock market. 

	 

	Originally, ASA's investment policies required it to invest only in South African companies. In 1969, shareholders approved a proposal to allow the Company to invest up to 20 percent of its assets outside of South Africa. Later, as it became evident that gold production in South Africa was declining both absolutely and as a percentage of world production, the Company reached out to find opportunities in other parts of the world. 

	 

	In 2004 the Company moved its place of incorporation to Bermuda because of a change in tax law in South Africa that would have adversely affected ASA and its shareholders. Shortly thereafter, in 2005, shareholders approved changes to the Company's investment policies to permit the Company to invest its assets worldwide without geographical restrictions. 

	 

	Today ASA Gold and Precious Metals Limited is a professionally managed, globally diversified precious minerals closed-end investment company. The Company is registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and its shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion.

Gold
Civilizations have equated gold with gods, wealth, and immortality. For centuries, gold has symbolized power and used as a storage of wealth. The fact that gold neither corrodes nor tarnishes not to mention the beauty of the precious metal made it suitable for deities and royalty in ancient civilizations. A gold standard was used as a monetary policy within and between nations but the world gold standard ended in 1976. The 1930’s was the last time gold was used in minted coins designated for circulation. Historically, the value of gold was based on perceived rarity and its distinctive color.

Almost half of the new gold consumed each year is for jewelry, 40% is for investments and 10% for industry purposes. The high malleability and conductivity of gold are characteristics that make gold used in many types of computerized devices. The precious metal is also used in tooth restoration, as an anti-inflammatory, and infrared shields.
Paper currencies have come and gone but gold remains in demand and has an inherent value. Gold bars, coins, and Investment Grade Coins are all popular ways to invest in the yellow metal.

Gold Bars
Gold bars are the most popular way to invest in gold and generally the form of gold bullion that most people think about. A gold bar can come in a variety of sizes from 1 gram to 1 kilo. Actually, a gold bar can be as big as someone’s imagination. Currently, the largest gold bar in history was produced by Mitsubishi Materials Corporation. The bar weighed 551 pounds and would be worth over $11 million with a spot price of $1275.

Investors prefer gold bars because they offer the most gold with a lower premium versus gold coins. Investors and collectors like gold coins and are willing to pay a higher premium due to the collectability of gold coins.
Gold Coins

Gold coins value is based on the weight of the precious metal and the scarcity of the coin itself. The scarcity arises from the fact that once a mintage of a coin is done for a specific year there will never be another coin of that year produced. Minted coins also offer the guarantee that comes from a reputable mint like the U.S. Mint. Gold coins are generally legal tender in the country that the coin was minted.

Investment Grade Coins

Investment Grade Coins are higher quality and more rare than bullion coins. These coins are also graded and are enclosed in a protective slab to ensure and preserve the condition of the coin. A study commissioned by the U.S. Congress has proven that certain Investment Grade Coins are shown to have an annual return of 15%. Investment Grade Coins are for investors planning to hold onto their investment for at least 3 years.

How to Build Your Precious Metals Portfolio

The following questionnaire takes into account your commodities experience, tolerance for risk, time horizon and other factors. The way you answer these questions will help us design a metals portfolio that safeguards your money from fluctuations in the market while positioning for superior long-term growth.
In the financial world, this concept is known as a “straddle and strangle strategy." It is commonly done by professionals in the options market when they know that there will be volatility in a certain asset, but they don’t necessarily know which way it will swing. Should you invest in raw coins and bars (bullion) or would you be better suited to acquire investment grade coins? It depends on the goals and objectives of your investment.Select the number that indicates where you rank on the scale for each of the following questions. There are no right or wrong answers!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
