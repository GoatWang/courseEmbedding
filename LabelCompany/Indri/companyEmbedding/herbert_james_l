In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

Thursday 21 March 2013 09.53 EDT


First published on Thursday 21 March 2013 09.53 EDT





When James Herbert published his first novel, The Rats (1974), at the age of 30, it was an immediate bestseller. Copies of the book – produced cheaply in paperback with a vicious-looking rodent on the cover, its jaws open and eyes bloodshot – flew off the shelves, the initial print run of 100,000 selling out in three weeks. Behind its cover star, the title was printed in bold, red type. Edition after edition came out and changes were subtly made. The rat remained but eventually it was the name of Herbert, who has died aged 69, that dominated the cover.
Herbert's early novels were literary nasties. The Rats opens with a tramp being devoured alive. Soon afterwards, a baby is killed and partly eaten before her mother can rescue the mutilated body. The Fog (1975) continued his uncompromisingly explicit, visceral exploration of horror. Innocent villagers and schoolchildren turn psychotic under the influence of a mysterious fog, and torture and murder each other. The gruesome and depraved events seem all the more horrific for taking place in rural, respectable England.
These novels of catastrophe were compared by Stephen King to the music of the Sex Pistols: "If The Rats, with its scenes of gruesome horror and its blasted East End landscape, is not a literary version of Anarchy in the UK, what is?" But just as a host of brutal horror novels was unleashed in bookshops in the wake of Herbert's success, its progenitor changed tack and took his readers into other fearful territories, while the paperback horror genre collapsed under the weight of Rats rip-offs and sub-Herbert savagery.
Herbert's 23 novels have sold 54m copies worldwide. He was published in 34 languages, including Russian and Chinese. In 2010 he was made an OBE and received the Grand Master award at the World Horror Convention.
He was born in the East End of London, the third son of Herbert Herbert and his wife, Kitty. His parents sold fruit and veg from stalls at Brick Lane and Bethnal Green. Growing up in Whitechapel, which was damaged by bombing during the second world war, Herbert attended a local Catholic school and earned a scholarship to St Aloysius' college in Highgate, north London.
As a boy, Herbert was inspired by the American comic book Casey Ruggles, which he found on the market stalls in Petticoat Lane. "That's where I learned to write," he said. "For a cowboy comic, it was incredible. The only time I wrote a fan letter in my life was to [its writer and artist] Warren Tufts and that was when I was 30. I rang up Hanna-Barbera because somebody told me he was working there as an animator and got his address, wrote a letter and got a cautious reply back." His next letter – 11 pages explaining his appreciation of Ruggles – led to Herbert and Tufts becoming penpals.
He also grew up on ghost stories and American horror comics that his brother Peter brought home. There were the additional real-life horrors of the Whitechapel area: one of Jack the Ripper's victims had been murdered close to Herbert's home, and a more immediate menace could be found in the stables where his parents' stock of fruit and vegetables attracted hordes of rats.
From the age of 16, Herbert attended Hornsey College of Art, where he spent four years studying graphic design, print and photography. He worked as a paste-up artist and a typographer at one advertising agency, and then became art director and subsequently group head at Charles Barker Advertising.
Herbert had no burning desire to become an author but found himself surrounded by copywriters who were working on novels in order to get out of advertising. Looking for a challenge, he decided to write a novel himself. Inspired by an image he saw during a late-night showing of Dracula (1931) starring Bela Lugosi – a scene in which Renfield has a vision of thousands of rats – Herbert poured his energies into The Rats for 10 months and sent out six copies of his finished manuscript to publishers. Three weeks later, he had three replies: two rejections and, from New English Library (NEL), an acceptance.
The Survivor (1976), his third novel, concerned the sole survivor of a plane crash who begins to experience visions of the afterlife. Fluke (1977) was an even greater departure, in which a murdered man, reincarnated as a dog, tracks down his family and solves the mystery surrounding his death. In the thriller The Spear (1978), a private eye finds himself involved with a neo-Nazi cult that plans to use the power of the spear that pierced the side of Christ to take over the world. The book's brief, historical prefaces led to problems, when Herbert and NEL were sued for plagiarism. These sections were removed for the paperback edition which, thanks to the notoriety of the case, returned Herbert to the bestseller charts.
With his next novel, Lair (1979), Herbert regaled readers with the return of the rats, and he completed the trilogy with Domain (1984), set in a future where rats are now dominant following a nuclear war that has devastated civilisation. Herbert's The City (1994), a graphic novel illustrated by Ian Miller, was set in the same post-apocalypse world in which only a handful of people have survived.
An ancient force is at the centre of The Dark (1980), which was reminiscent of The Fog, and the bane of bad luck dogs a policeman in The Jonah (1981). In Shrine (1983), a deaf-mute girl blessed with the power of healing discovers that it is actually a curse, and in Moon (1985) a man finds himself telepathically linked to a serial killer.
With The Magic Cottage (1986), Herbert created one of his best novels, an unconventional haunted house yarn that is part fairytale, part ghost story. Haunted (1988), originally plotted as a BBC TV movie, is also a ghost story, the first of three novels featuring David Ash, a sceptical parapsychologist and psychic investigator who returned in The Ghosts of Sleath (1994) and Ash (2012).
The best of Herbert's later books were more character-driven. Creed (1990) features a sleazy paparazzo who can photograph things invisible to the naked eye; Others (1999) introduces Nicholas Dismas, a private investigator with physical defects; and The Secret of Crickley Hall (2006) relates how a couple move to the West Country to try to recover from the disappearance of their son. It was adapted for BBC TV in 2012.
The film and TV versions of Herbert's other novels were not always successful: The Survivor (1981), directed by David Hemmings and starring Robert Powell, was shot in Australia and heavily cut for UK release. Rats (1982), released in the US as Deadly Eyes, featured dachshunds in rodent costumes. Haunted and Fluke (both 1995) received mixed reviews.
Calling upon his background in typography and design, Herbert saw his books all the way through from the first draft, written in longhand in jumbo pads, to the finished product. He was actively involved in the presentation and promotion of his work.
He is survived by his wife, Eileen, whom he married in 1967, and their daughters, Kerry, Emma and Casey.
