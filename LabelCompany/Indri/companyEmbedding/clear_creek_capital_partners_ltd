What’s Your Opportunity…
ClearCreek provides financial advisory services to entrepreneurs and CEO’s of private businesses. We specialize in institutional capital raises, sell-side M&A, and licensing agreements, with transactions ranging in size from $2 to $25 million.















Growth

										 Companies with exceptional promise require resources. Our clients have raised capital from premier institutional funds as well as strategic investors.
									








Liquidity

										 Many founders have a large percentage of their net worth committed to their firm. We’ve helped clients cash out entirely through an acquisition, or just take some money off the table for peace of mind.
									








Partnerships

										 We’ve worked with companies to develop licensing opportunities or to forge corporate alliances – individualized partnerships that contribute specific assets and expertise to accelerate their business.
									








Restructuring

										 A company can quickly evolve beyond their initial configuration. We can help determine the optimal capital structure to unlock your firm’s true potential.
									





 












CLIENTS












								 "When we were approached about a transaction, we knew we needed professional advice from people we could trust. ClearCreek played a small but valuable role in providing thoughtful and clear-headed counsel at an important stage of the process. We're so grateful for the integrity and clarity they brought to what could otherwise have been an difficult road to travel."
							

								 Katie Thurmes & Jenna Walker
							

								 Co-Founders, Artifact Uprising



								 "One of the best decisions our team made during our M&A process was to work with ClearCreek Partners. They were incredibly knowledgeable and responsive in guiding us through all aspects of the acquisition process. As a result of their efforts, the Beat the GMAT company found a great partner in Hobsons and achieved an acquisition with very favorable terms."
							

								 Eric Bahn
							

								 Founder, Beat The GMAT



								 "ClearCreek took us from our first venture fund introduction to a Series A equity investment from Kleiner Perkins in about 90 days, while helping us evaluate multiple offers along the way. The professionalism, integrity and impact was clear at every step of the process, and their advice was always grounded in what was in the best long-term interest for our business. I cannot recommend ClearCreek highly enough to any other firm seeking venture or growth capital."
							

								 Craig Schmeizer
							

								 Co-Founder and CEO, Working Equity



								 "ClearCreek got us in front of firms we had not been able to see on our own, and were grounded and flexible advisors during a long and complex transaction. We would work with them again without hesitation."
							

								 Dr. Charles Henry
							

								 Co-Founder and CEO, Advanced Microlabs



								 "I had not worked with an investment banker previously, and while we initially focused on raising growth capital, with ClearCreek we considered a variety of options --including the opportunity to sell FCI to a large public company and accelerate our growth through their established channels and global footprint. ClearCreek helped us tell our story authentically and provided incredibly sound advice from beginning to end. It was a great partnership and terrific outcome."
							

								 Joe Carey
							

								 Founder and CEO, Fidelity Comtech

We're big fans of behavioral economics, so the idea that you can make better decisions by flipping a coin naturally caught our eye. The author of a working paper that makes this claim is none other than Steven Levitt, of Freakonomist fame. Levitt recruited people who were struggling to make a big decision and were willing to allow their choice to be governed by a coin toss. When he followed up, what he found was telling: For important decisions (e.g. quitting a job…

Leadership transitions within private equity firms are icebergs: sometimes the tips are spotted in the distance, but the vast majority are usually out of sight and only significant in a catastrophe. Large crashes became well-known, but even then information is largely anecdotal -- stories passed around with cocktail glasses. Most leadership transitions float past, largely hidden from view. However a working paper from researchers at Harvard Business School (aptly subtitled The Economics within the Private Equity Partnership) has quantified the inputs and impact of the mechanics…

This month what's caught our eye includes: a brief from consultancy McKinsey on where machines can replace humans (with accompanying visualization) -- not to give it away, but about 60 percent of occupations could see just under one-third of their activities automated. And perhaps related is a thoughtful essay by Tyler Cowen on the political anger of generally prosperous Americans, which has at its genesis insufficient savings for many people on the cusp of retirement (which should be of concern regardless of the political…

Looking at venture capital investment during the first half of 2016, Redpoint's Tomasz Tunguz has a nice piece (and several graphs) on the flux in the fundraising market -- early stage deals (Series A) have nosedived by a whopping one-third, as have later stage financings, while expansion stage financings (Series B) are up substantially. This view is a little bit more light than heat, as even with this data Series A investment is still higher than at any point since…

Mutual Fund Fun

Entrepreneurs, Financing, Investing, Venture Capital

0  Comments


One of many interesting changes in venture capital in the past few years has been the emergence of mutual fund companies investing in very late rounds. In many ways this makes sense -- technology companies are delaying IPOs, and a late-stage investment gets a mutual fund pre-IPO equity at a slightly better price (they hope) and often with significant  downside protection not available in a public offering. But good intentions have unforeseen consequences, for mutual funds have to publicly price…

When you're in a boom, it's always hard to see if a down quarter is a welcome correction or the beginning of a slump. For venture capital, Q3 could be either.  Based on data from Pitchbook, the number of Q3 financing were down significantly: 22% from the second quarter and 34% from the same period last year. However the dollar amounts rose: the $14.1 billion invested in Q3 is up 13% from Q2 and a whopping 81% from the same…

Important stuff can be hard. So, somewhat against our better judgement, we are covering a pretty technical subject, but one that has enormous potential: Blockchain. Best known as the technology underlying Bitcoin (which we covered here), a blockchain is essentially a distributed database of transactions which can be applied to almost any series of related events involving the same assets -- from real estate to currency (this brief blockchain primer is a good place to start). Of paramount importance here is that the data is…

ClearCreek works with emerging companies across various stages, from pre-revenue businesses looking for their first institutional investor, to established firms with positive cash flows who want to explore a strategic opportunity.
We’re selective. ClearCreek works with just a handful of firms each year, and stake much of our reputation and compensation on our mutual success. Our client engagements are partnerships, and the right fit and commitment are critical to a successful transaction. There are many excellent companies and CEOs for whom we are simply not the right financial advisor, or where we believe it is not the optimal time.
We have assisted our clients in sourcing growth capital from numerous institutional funds, including Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins, Hummer Winblad, Battery Ventures, Sevin Rosen, and Summit Partners. For other companies, we have enabled shareholders to realize some liquidity or exit entirely through a sale to a strategic acquirer. We have also found specialized corporate investors or licensing partners that best match our client’s individual strategy or preferences. Each company is unique, and every transaction is different.
