Henry Hyde leaves the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York to start his own firm, then known as Equitable Life Assurance Society of America. In its tenth year, Equitable writes more new business than any other company in the world.



The company's new headquarters is the first office building with steam elevators, paving the way for future skyscrapers. By 1879, it will expand to be the tallest office building in the world at that time.



Equitable markets the first joint and survivor annuity and pioneers the practice of paying death claims immediately. Miss Ray Wilner appointed Equitable's first woman agency manager.



Equitable supported the American College in launching the CLU professional designation program. Equitable started new agent training classes in 1902.



Equitable introduces its first line of individual variable annuity products and in 1976 pioneers variable life insurance, an investment-oriented policy that commands significant market share.



With a $1 billion investment from the AXA Group, Equitable completes the largest-ever conversion from a mutual to a stock company at that time and soon becomes a member of the Global AXA Group.



AXA celebrates its eighth consecutive year as the #1 insurance brand in the world as measured by the Interbrand annual report.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        AXA Financial, Inc. has received 3.68 out of 5 stars based on 6 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

In… MoreAXA Financial, Inc. is a member of the global AXA Group and a provider of financial protection and wealth management services. AXA Group's operations are diverse geographically with its main operations in Western Europe, North America, and the Asia/Pacific region.

In the United States, AXA Group operates as AXA Financial, Inc. and has a number of subsidiaries, including AXA Advisors, LLC; AXA Equitable Life Insurance; AXA Network; Mutual of New York (MONY); US Financial Life; and AllianceBernstein (maintained in a separate profile).
• AXA Financial Inc. maintains a $100,000-$250,000 hardware support maintenance contract with IBM.
• AXA Financial Inc. maintains a $100,000-$250,000 legacy application support contract with CSC.

• AXA Financial Inc. maintains a $250,000-$1M help desk management contract with Dell.

2013 and Earlier:
AXA Financial, Inc. is a member of the global AXA Group and a provider of financial protection and wealth management services. AXA Group's operations are diverse geographically with its main operations in Western Europe, North America, and the Asia/Pacific region.

In the United States, AXA Group operates as AXA Financial, Inc. and has a number of subsidiaries, including AXA Advisors, LLC; AXA Equitable Life Insurance; AXA Network; Mutual of New York (MONY); US Financial Life; and AllianceBernstein (maintained in a separate profile).

IT STRUCTURE AXA Financial is the American segment of AXA Group, based in Paris. The IT department for AXA Group is a separate subsidiary at the company, AXA Technology Services, known as AXA Tech. Less than 10 percent of AXA Tech's 3,300-person worldwide staff works in the United States, but that ratio belies the number of key company-wide IT decision-makers based here.  Most US AXA Tech employees work at AXA Tech's primary office in Jersey City, NJ, but others operate from AXA Financial's headquarters in New York, NY, and AXA Equitable's office in Syracuse, NY. AXA Equitable is the main business line of AXA Financial. The employees at AXA Financial and AXA Equitable are not officially part of AXA Tech, and that is why the number of IT employees in the US is much higher than the 300-range. The main operator in New York can direct callers to employees in Jersey City; the number published on the AXA Tech website as of spring 2012 for the Jersey City office is incorrect. AXA Tech is a centralized organization that takes overall direction from executives in Paris. The subsidiary was created to do much of the work in house, but dozens of solutions from outside vendors are used as well.  The two leading US officials at AXA Tech are the Chief Operations Officer for IT and the Chief Information Officer. The other three highest-ranking executives are the Chief Technology Officer, Chief Information Security Officer, and Chief Privacy Officer (CPO). All are in Jersey City save the CPO, a position with significant IT responsibilities.  In the past two years, high-level executives from the US IT team have transitioned to positions leading AXA Tech operations in Hong Kong, Japan, and Mexico. The latter executive remains based in the US despite a mission to build out AXA Tech's newest region.  AXA Rosenberg is a small subsidiary based in Orinda, CA. IT INFORMATION SNIPPITS •Like many global conglomerates, AXA Tech strives to streamline and consolidate operations worldwide, often with an eye toward green IT. A global Transformation Office, with some leadership in the US, oversees efforts to unify IT across the whole business. Windows 7 was fully rolled out in the US in April 2012. In 2011-12, the company is deploying IBM MDM and InfoSphere. The company operates in an SAP ERP environment and relies on IBM and VMware for many of its infrastructure needs. •The company uses VSphere as its storage security solution, and checkpoint for its fraud detection. •AXA Financial Inc. has the following security safeguards in place: regular policy reviews, inventory of personal employee and customer data, inventory of locations where data is stored, documented incident response process, inventory of third parties, encryption of mobile devices, malware and virus protection software on all devices, has a documented incident response process, has a regular compliance review process, provides application access and manage identities for >10,000 customers/vendors, and has a continuous compliance model in place, and operates under HIPAA compliance regimes.   •The company uses home-grown solution to monitor threats across its networks, security devices, and data.  •It already has some security solution outsourcing in place.    •The company, AXA Financial Inc. is currently evaluating cloud solutions for a possible implementation.  The company currently runs business applications in a cloud environment, and senior sources report control / billing, are the company's biggest cloud related security concerns. •AXA Financial Inc. has a company-wide BYOD program in place.    •The IT budget is typically finalized in Q1.

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1816 as Mutuelle de L'assurance contre L'incendie (the Ancienne Mutuelle).[6] It acquired Compagnie Parisienne de Garantie in 1978 and became Mutuelles Unies.[7] It went on to buy the Drouot Group in 1982, becoming Mutuelles Unies/Drouot. It adopted the AXA name in 1985.[7] The takeover of the American insurance company The Equitable, came in 1991.[7] It bought Union des Assurances De Paris (UAP), France's largest insurer, in 1996 becoming AXA-UAP for a while before reverting to the name AXA in 1999.[8] Then in February 1999 AXA acquired Guardian Royal Exchange.[9] In May 2000 AXA acquired all shares it did not already own in Sun Life & Provincial Holdings.[10] On 14 June 2006 AXA acquired the leading Swiss insurance company Winterthur Group from Credit Suisse for approximately €9 billion.[11]
During May 2016 it announced it was to stop investing in tobacco shares and bonds and allow its portfolio of tobacco-related bonds to run off.[12]
The AXA name[edit]
Despite being written in upper case, "AXA" is not an acronym, but was chosen because its name can be pronounced easily by people who speak any language. After acquiring the Drouot Group in 1982, Chairman and CEO Claude Bébéar hired an outside consultant to conduct a computer-aided search for a new name. Bébéar wanted a short and snappy name to convey vitality and could be pronounced the same way in every language, consistent with the group's desire for an international presence. Initially, "Elan" was the top choice, but Canadian executives balked because "elan" is the French word for a moose or elk. In 1985, Bébéar chose the name AXA.[13]

Operations[edit]
In the United Kingdom[edit]
AXA trades in the United Kingdom as AXA UK using a number of subsidiaries such as AXA Sun Life, AXA Insurance, AXA Investment Managers, AXA Wealth and AXA PPP Healthcare. AXA PPP Healthcare was created when AXA bought Guardian Royal Exchange (GRE), though it subsequently sold the other parts of GRE to Aegon. The company also owns the online insurer Swiftcover, distribution business Bluefin and fund manager Architas. In January 2007 AXA was reorganised into "strategic business units" (SBU's) aimed at competing within their specific markets.
In September 2013, AXA Wealth was fined £1.8m by the FCA for failing to ensure it gave suitable investment advice to its customers. The regulator says it found “serious defects” in the way AXA advisers in Clydesdale Bank, Yorkshire Bank and the West Bromwich Building Society advised customers on investments.[14]
AXA run its investment branch through AXA Investment Managers (IM).
AXA Sun Life[edit]
AXA Sun Life was created following the merger between AXA Equity & Law and Sun Life Assurance Society PLC. In 2006 Winterthur Life in the UK was absorbed although AXA continue to use the Winterthur brand for high-net-worth wealth management business. The business units are:[15]

AXA Wealth – This includes AXA + Winterthur's Bonds + Individual Pensions, AXA Distribution Services who offer the Elevate wrap platform and Architas.
Corporate Business – AXA + Winterthur's Group Pensions. AXA intend to create a "Market Leading" group pension proposition using Winterthur's 'Embassy' IT platform.
Protection – This business aims to market AXA's Protection Account as AXA continues to build on its presence in this area with the intention of becoming a leading protection provider.
Traditional Business – Concentrating on policies which are still in force but no longer actively marketed.
SunLife[16] – This business focuses solely on selling protection & savings products directly to those in the UK.
Bancassurance – This business is responsible for an advisory and sales force that sell AXAs products and propositions.

AXA sold AXA Sun Life Holdings Ltd to Resolution Limited in autumn 2010,[17][18] whilst retaining AXA Wealth (including Architas and the Elevate wrap platform), SunLife and Bancassurance business units. Closure of the Bancassurance arm was announced in April 2013.[19]
AXA PPP healthcare[edit]
AXA PPP healthcare is a UK private medical insurance provider.
AXA PPP healthcare was originally known as The London Association of Hospital Services, which was set up in 1938 as a private healthcare scheme for people of middle income in London.
The company has its headquarters in the town of Tunbridge Wells in Kent, England, and is the town’s largest private sector employer. AXA PPP healthcare provides individual private medical insurance for individuals and business as well as employee assistance programmes.
In 2009, AXA PPP International was created, catering for the expatriate health cover market.
On the Isle of Man[edit]
AXA Isle of Man Limited was originally created as a subsidiary of AXA Sun Life in the United Kingdom, but since the Isle of Man is not a part of the United Kingdom it is regulated instead by the laws of the Isle of Man. AXA Isle of Man Limited advertises itself as a repository for citizens of the United Kingdom and the Channel Islands who seek to shelter their assets from taxation.
While the company trades upon the AXA logo, name and group advertising which promotes the total wealth of the group, the assets of the Isle of Man company are limited to those of the Isle of Man company itself.
AXA Schengen[edit]
AXA Schengen Travel Insurance provides insurance to travelers who need a visa to enter the Schengen Area.
In Canada[edit]
AXA Canada offers insurance services through a network of affiliates operating in the different Canadian regions such as Quebec, Ontario, Western Canada and Atlantic Canada. In 2009, the company had a total of approximately 2,300 employees and 4000 brokers and advisors. The head office is in Montreal, Quebec. In 2011, AXA's Canadian operations were acquired by Intact Financial Corp. for C$2.6 billion.[20]
In the United States[edit]
The American arm of AXA is AXA Financial, inc., which is known mainly through its subsidiaries such as AXA Advisors, LLC, AXA Equitable Life Insurance, AXA Network, MONY (former Mutual of New York), US Financial Life, and AllianceBernstein.[21] The Equitable was acquired in 1991; MONY was acquired in 2004.[22][23]
On December 15, 2006, AXA Advisors, LLC entered into agreements with LPL (Linsco Private Ledger), the country's largest independent broker-dealer. LPL agreed to provide brokerage, clearing and custody services on a fully disclosed basis. The terms of the agreements are five years, subject to additional 24-month extensions. Services began in August 2007.
In Gulf and Middle East[edit]
AXA is present in GCC countries as AXA Insurance (Gulf) B.S.C. Present in the region for more than 60 years, AXA is the largest insurer in the GCC with branches across Bahrain, Oman, UAE and Turkey. In Saudi Arabia AXA is known as AXA Cooperative Insurance. It offers insurance for individuals and businesses with Health, Motor, Home, Travel, Personal and Group Accident, Fire, Engineering, Life and various other products.[24]
AXA is present in Lebanon as AXA Middle East. In 2000, AXA group acquired 51% of SLF’ capital and the Nasnas & Hanemoglou’s Group the remaining 49% to start the operations in Middle East.
AXA has also started operations in Egypt in the year 2015.[25]
In Mexico[edit]
In July 2008, AXA acquired ING Insurance Mexico, offering essentially the same services that ING offered. AXA then sued an ING Groep NV subsidiary over alleged misrepresentations in the $1.5 billion sale stating it suffered “tens (if not hundreds) of millions of dollars in damages.”[26]
In Asia Pacific[edit]
AXA Asia - Based in Hong Kong, AXA Asia is the Regional Office of AXA in Asia, with operating businesses across Life Insurance in 8 markets (Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, India, Thailand, and the Philippines) and General Insurance in 7 markets (Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, India and Thailand)

Headquarters[edit]
AXA headquarters is located in the 8th arrondissement of Paris.[29] AXA, which already owned 23 Avenue Matignon, acquired the former Hotel de La Vaupalière, an 18th-century building, in the late 1990s. Architect Ricardo Bofill integrated the facade of the hotel with a modern glass building that covers the courtyard that the hotel also occupies. The complex serves as AXA's head office.[30]
Philanthropy[edit]
Besides its artistic and social philanthropic initiatives (AXA Heart in action),[31] AXA created the AXA Research Fund in 2008. Endowed with €100 million, it provides support for research focused on understanding and preventing the risks threatening the environment, human life and society.[32]
256 basic-research projects were funded within three years, including 230 young researchers, PhDs or in postdoctoral year, working in laboratories all around the world. AXA also gathers every year the young fellows to meet a world-class researcher, exchange best practices and network.
The Fund has also awarded 11 endowments for several million euros supporting research institutions of excellence (HEC Paris, NUS, University of Bristol, LSE, MetOffice, INSERM, IHES...). These Research and Education Chairs intend to attract the best scientists. For example, the AXA - Polytechnique Chair in Cellular Cardiovascular Engineering,[33] held by Abdul Barakat, aims to promote research on cardiovascular diseases, but also to train and develop young researchers through extended educational programs.
The 256 research projects funded as of today are implemented in 22 countries with researchers of 42 different nationalities. The Scientific Board is chaired by Ezra Suleiman and composed of eminent members of the academic world and AXA Group representatives Pascale Cossart, Brian Hoskins, José Scheinkman, member of the Scientific Board and James Vaupel.

AXA is a French multinational insurance firm headquartered in the 8th arrondissement of Paris that engages in global insurance, investment management, and other financial services.

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1816 as Mutuelle de L'assurance contre L'incendie (the Ancienne Mutuelle).[6] It acquired Compagnie Parisienne de Garantie in 1978 and became Mutuelles Unies.[7] It went on to buy the Drouot Group in 1982, becoming Mutuelles Unies/Drouot. It adopted the AXA name in 1985.[7] The takeover of the American insurance company The Equitable, came in 1991.[7] It bought Union des Assurances De Paris (UAP), France's largest insurer, in 1996 becoming AXA-UAP for a while before reverting to the name AXA in 1999.[8] Then in February 1999 AXA acquired Guardian Royal Exchange.[9] In May 2000 AXA acquired all shares it did not already own in Sun Life & Provincial Holdings.[10] On 14 June 2006 AXA acquired the leading Swiss insurance company Winterthur Group from Credit Suisse for approximately €9 billion.[11]
During May 2016 it announced it was to stop investing in tobacco shares and bonds and allow its portfolio of tobacco-related bonds to run off.[12]
The AXA name[edit]
Despite being written in upper case, "AXA" is not an acronym, but was chosen because its name can be pronounced easily by people who speak any language. After acquiring the Drouot Group in 1982, Chairman and CEO Claude Bébéar hired an outside consultant to conduct a computer-aided search for a new name. Bébéar wanted a short and snappy name to convey vitality and could be pronounced the same way in every language, consistent with the group's desire for an international presence. Initially, "Elan" was the top choice, but Canadian executives balked because "elan" is the French word for a moose or elk. In 1985, Bébéar chose the name AXA.[13]

Operations[edit]
In the United Kingdom[edit]
AXA trades in the United Kingdom as AXA UK using a number of subsidiaries such as AXA Sun Life, AXA Insurance, AXA Investment Managers, AXA Wealth and AXA PPP Healthcare. AXA PPP Healthcare was created when AXA bought Guardian Royal Exchange (GRE), though it subsequently sold the other parts of GRE to Aegon. The company also owns the online insurer Swiftcover, distribution business Bluefin and fund manager Architas. In January 2007 AXA was reorganised into "strategic business units" (SBU's) aimed at competing within their specific markets.
In September 2013, AXA Wealth was fined £1.8m by the FCA for failing to ensure it gave suitable investment advice to its customers. The regulator says it found “serious defects” in the way AXA advisers in Clydesdale Bank, Yorkshire Bank and the West Bromwich Building Society advised customers on investments.[14]
AXA run its investment branch through AXA Investment Managers (IM).
AXA Sun Life[edit]
AXA Sun Life was created following the merger between AXA Equity & Law and Sun Life Assurance Society PLC. In 2006 Winterthur Life in the UK was absorbed although AXA continue to use the Winterthur brand for high-net-worth wealth management business. The business units are:[15]

AXA Wealth – This includes AXA + Winterthur's Bonds + Individual Pensions, AXA Distribution Services who offer the Elevate wrap platform and Architas.
Corporate Business – AXA + Winterthur's Group Pensions. AXA intend to create a "Market Leading" group pension proposition using Winterthur's 'Embassy' IT platform.
Protection – This business aims to market AXA's Protection Account as AXA continues to build on its presence in this area with the intention of becoming a leading protection provider.
Traditional Business – Concentrating on policies which are still in force but no longer actively marketed.
SunLife[16] – This business focuses solely on selling protection & savings products directly to those in the UK.
Bancassurance – This business is responsible for an advisory and sales force that sell AXAs products and propositions.

AXA sold AXA Sun Life Holdings Ltd to Resolution Limited in autumn 2010,[17][18] whilst retaining AXA Wealth (including Architas and the Elevate wrap platform), SunLife and Bancassurance business units. Closure of the Bancassurance arm was announced in April 2013.[19]

On the Isle of Man[edit]
AXA Isle of Man Limited was originally created as a subsidiary of AXA Sun Life in the United Kingdom, but since the Isle of Man is not a part of the United Kingdom it is regulated instead by the laws of the Isle of Man. AXA Isle of Man Limited advertises itself as a repository for citizens of the United Kingdom and the Channel Islands who seek to shelter their assets from taxation.
While the company trades upon the AXA logo, name and group advertising which promotes the total wealth of the group, the assets of the Isle of Man company are limited to those of the Isle of Man company itself.

Headquarters[edit]
AXA headquarters is located in the 8th arrondissement of Paris.[29] AXA, which already owned 23 Avenue Matignon, acquired the former Hotel de La Vaupalière, an 18th-century building, in the late 1990s. Architect Ricardo Bofill integrated the facade of the hotel with a modern glass building that covers the courtyard that the hotel also occupies. The complex serves as AXA's head office.[30]
Philanthropy[edit]
Besides its artistic and social philanthropic initiatives (AXA Heart in action),[31] AXA created the AXA Research Fund in 2008. Endowed with €100 million, it provides support for research focused on understanding and preventing the risks threatening the environment, human life and society.[32]
256 basic-research projects were funded within three years, including 230 young researchers, PhDs or in postdoctoral year, working in laboratories all around the world. AXA also gathers every year the young fellows to meet a world-class researcher, exchange best practices and network.
The Fund has also awarded 11 endowments for several million euros supporting research institutions of excellence (HEC Paris, NUS, University of Bristol, LSE, MetOffice, INSERM, IHES...). These Research and Education Chairs intend to attract the best scientists. For example, the AXA - Polytechnique Chair in Cellular Cardiovascular Engineering,[33] held by Abdul Barakat, aims to promote research on cardiovascular diseases, but also to train and develop young researchers through extended educational programs.
The 256 research projects funded as of today are implemented in 22 countries with researchers of 42 different nationalities. The Scientific Board is chaired by Ezra Suleiman and composed of eminent members of the academic world and AXA Group representatives Pascale Cossart, Brian Hoskins, José Scheinkman, member of the Scientific Board and James Vaupel.

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1816 as Mutuelle de L'assurance contre L'incendie (the Ancienne Mutuelle).[6] It acquired Compagnie Parisienne de Garantie in 1978 and became Mutuelles Unies.[7] It went on to buy the Drouot Group in 1982, becoming Mutuelles Unies/Drouot. It adopted the AXA name in 1985.[7] The takeover of the American insurance company The Equitable, came in 1991.[7] It bought Union des Assurances De Paris (UAP), France's largest insurer, in 1996 becoming AXA-UAP for a while before reverting to the name AXA in 1999.[8] Then in February 1999 AXA acquired Guardian Royal Exchange.[9] In May 2000 AXA acquired all shares it did not already own in Sun Life & Provincial Holdings.[10] On 14 June 2006 AXA acquired the leading Swiss insurance company Winterthur Group from Credit Suisse for approximately €9 billion.[11]
During May 2016 it announced it was to stop investing in tobacco shares and bonds and allow its portfolio of tobacco-related bonds to run off.[12]
The AXA name[edit]
Despite being written in upper case, "AXA" is not an acronym, but was chosen because its name can be pronounced easily by people who speak any language. After acquiring the Drouot Group in 1982, Chairman and CEO Claude Bébéar hired an outside consultant to conduct a computer-aided search for a new name. Bébéar wanted a short and snappy name to convey vitality and could be pronounced the same way in every language, consistent with the group's desire for an international presence. Initially, "Elan" was the top choice, but Canadian executives balked because "elan" is the French word for a moose or elk. In 1985, Bébéar chose the name AXA.[13]

Operations[edit]
In the United Kingdom[edit]
AXA trades in the United Kingdom as AXA UK using a number of subsidiaries such as AXA Sun Life, AXA Insurance, AXA Investment Managers, AXA Wealth and AXA PPP Healthcare. AXA PPP Healthcare was created when AXA bought Guardian Royal Exchange (GRE), though it subsequently sold the other parts of GRE to Aegon. The company also owns the online insurer Swiftcover, distribution business Bluefin and fund manager Architas. In January 2007 AXA was reorganised into "strategic business units" (SBU's) aimed at competing within their specific markets.
In September 2013, AXA Wealth was fined £1.8m by the FCA for failing to ensure it gave suitable investment advice to its customers. The regulator says it found “serious defects” in the way AXA advisers in Clydesdale Bank, Yorkshire Bank and the West Bromwich Building Society advised customers on investments.[14]
AXA run its investment branch through AXA Investment Managers (IM).
AXA Sun Life[edit]
AXA Sun Life was created following the merger between AXA Equity & Law and Sun Life Assurance Society PLC. In 2006 Winterthur Life in the UK was absorbed although AXA continue to use the Winterthur brand for high-net-worth wealth management business. The business units are:[15]

AXA Wealth – This includes AXA + Winterthur's Bonds + Individual Pensions, AXA Distribution Services who offer the Elevate wrap platform and Architas.
Corporate Business – AXA + Winterthur's Group Pensions. AXA intend to create a "Market Leading" group pension proposition using Winterthur's 'Embassy' IT platform.
Protection – This business aims to market AXA's Protection Account as AXA continues to build on its presence in this area with the intention of becoming a leading protection provider.
Traditional Business – Concentrating on policies which are still in force but no longer actively marketed.
SunLife[16] – This business focuses solely on selling protection & savings products directly to those in the UK.
Bancassurance – This business is responsible for an advisory and sales force that sell AXAs products and propositions.

AXA sold AXA Sun Life Holdings Ltd to Resolution Limited in autumn 2010,[17][18] whilst retaining AXA Wealth (including Architas and the Elevate wrap platform), SunLife and Bancassurance business units. Closure of the Bancassurance arm was announced in April 2013.[19]
AXA PPP healthcare[edit]
AXA PPP healthcare is a UK private medical insurance provider.
AXA PPP healthcare was originally known as The London Association of Hospital Services, which was set up in 1938 as a private healthcare scheme for people of middle income in London.
The company has its headquarters in the town of Tunbridge Wells in Kent, England, and is the town’s largest private sector employer. AXA PPP healthcare provides individual private medical insurance for individuals and business as well as employee assistance programmes.
In 2009, AXA PPP International was created, catering for the expatriate health cover market.
On the Isle of Man[edit]
AXA Isle of Man Limited was originally created as a subsidiary of AXA Sun Life in the United Kingdom, but since the Isle of Man is not a part of the United Kingdom it is regulated instead by the laws of the Isle of Man. AXA Isle of Man Limited advertises itself as a repository for citizens of the United Kingdom and the Channel Islands who seek to shelter their assets from taxation.
While the company trades upon the AXA logo, name and group advertising which promotes the total wealth of the group, the assets of the Isle of Man company are limited to those of the Isle of Man company itself.
AXA Schengen[edit]
AXA Schengen Travel Insurance provides insurance to travelers who need a visa to enter the Schengen Area.
In Canada[edit]
AXA Canada offers insurance services through a network of affiliates operating in the different Canadian regions such as Quebec, Ontario, Western Canada and Atlantic Canada. In 2009, the company had a total of approximately 2,300 employees and 4000 brokers and advisors. The head office is in Montreal, Quebec. In 2011, AXA's Canadian operations were acquired by Intact Financial Corp. for C$2.6 billion.[20]
In the United States[edit]
The American arm of AXA is AXA Financial, inc., which is known mainly through its subsidiaries such as AXA Advisors, LLC, AXA Equitable Life Insurance, AXA Network, MONY (former Mutual of New York), US Financial Life, and AllianceBernstein.[21] The Equitable was acquired in 1991; MONY was acquired in 2004.[22][23]
On December 15, 2006, AXA Advisors, LLC entered into agreements with LPL (Linsco Private Ledger), the country's largest independent broker-dealer.

Headquarters[edit]
AXA headquarters is located in the 8th arrondissement of Paris.[29] AXA, which already owned 23 Avenue Matignon, acquired the former Hotel de La Vaupalière, an 18th-century building, in the late 1990s. Architect Ricardo Bofill integrated the facade of the hotel with a modern glass building that covers the courtyard that the hotel also occupies. The complex serves as AXA's head office.[30]
Philanthropy[edit]
Besides its artistic and social philanthropic initiatives (AXA Heart in action),[31] AXA created the AXA Research Fund in 2008. Endowed with €100 million, it provides support for research focused on understanding and preventing the risks threatening the environment, human life and society.[32]
256 basic-research projects were funded within three years, including 230 young researchers, PhDs or in postdoctoral year, working in laboratories all around the world. AXA also gathers every year the young fellows to meet a world-class researcher, exchange best practices and network.
The Fund has also awarded 11 endowments for several million euros supporting research institutions of excellence (HEC Paris, NUS, University of Bristol, LSE, MetOffice, INSERM, IHES...). These Research and Education Chairs intend to attract the best scientists. For example, the AXA - Polytechnique Chair in Cellular Cardiovascular Engineering,[33] held by Abdul Barakat, aims to promote research on cardiovascular diseases, but also to train and develop young researchers through extended educational programs.
The 256 research projects funded as of today are implemented in 22 countries with researchers of 42 different nationalities. The Scientific Board is chaired by Ezra Suleiman and composed of eminent members of the academic world and AXA Group representatives Pascale Cossart, Brian Hoskins, José Scheinkman, member of the Scientific Board and James Vaupel.

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1816 as Mutuelle de L'assurance contre L'incendie (the Ancienne Mutuelle).[6] It acquired Compagnie Parisienne de Garantie in 1978 and became Mutuelles Unies.[7] It went on to buy the Drouot Group in 1982, becoming Mutuelles Unies/Drouot. It adopted the AXA name in 1985.[7] The takeover of the American insurance company The Equitable, came in 1991.[7] It bought Union des Assurances De Paris (UAP), France's largest insurer, in 1996 becoming AXA-UAP for a while before reverting to the name AXA in 1999.[8] Then in February 1999 AXA acquired Guardian Royal Exchange.[9] In May 2000 AXA acquired all shares it did not already own in Sun Life & Provincial Holdings.[10] On 14 June 2006 AXA acquired the leading Swiss insurance company Winterthur Group from Credit Suisse for approximately €9 billion.[11]
During May 2016 it announced it was to stop investing in tobacco shares and bonds and allow its portfolio of tobacco-related bonds to run off.[12]
The AXA name[edit]
Despite being written in upper case, "AXA" is not an acronym, but was chosen because its name can be pronounced easily by people who speak any language. After acquiring the Drouot Group in 1982, Chairman and CEO Claude Bébéar hired an outside consultant to conduct a computer-aided search for a new name. Bébéar wanted a short and snappy name to convey vitality and could be pronounced the same way in every language, consistent with the group's desire for an international presence. Initially, "Elan" was the top choice, but Canadian executives balked because "elan" is the French word for a moose or elk. In 1985, Bébéar chose the name AXA.[13]

Operations[edit]
In the United Kingdom[edit]
AXA trades in the United Kingdom as AXA UK using a number of subsidiaries such as AXA Sun Life, AXA Insurance, AXA Investment Managers, AXA Wealth and AXA PPP Healthcare. AXA PPP Healthcare was created when AXA bought Guardian Royal Exchange (GRE), though it subsequently sold the other parts of GRE to Aegon. The company also owns the online insurer Swiftcover, distribution business Bluefin and fund manager Architas. In January 2007 AXA was reorganised into "strategic business units" (SBU's) aimed at competing within their specific markets.
In September 2013, AXA Wealth was fined £1.8m by the FCA for failing to ensure it gave suitable investment advice to its customers. The regulator says it found “serious defects” in the way AXA advisers in Clydesdale Bank, Yorkshire Bank and the West Bromwich Building Society advised customers on investments.[14]
AXA run its investment branch through AXA Investment Managers (IM).
AXA Sun Life[edit]
AXA Sun Life was created following the merger between AXA Equity & Law and Sun Life Assurance Society PLC. In 2006 Winterthur Life in the UK was absorbed although AXA continue to use the Winterthur brand for high-net-worth wealth management business. The business units are:[15]

AXA Wealth – This includes AXA + Winterthur's Bonds + Individual Pensions, AXA Distribution Services who offer the Elevate wrap platform and Architas.
Corporate Business – AXA + Winterthur's Group Pensions. AXA intend to create a "Market Leading" group pension proposition using Winterthur's 'Embassy' IT platform.
Protection – This business aims to market AXA's Protection Account as AXA continues to build on its presence in this area with the intention of becoming a leading protection provider.
Traditional Business – Concentrating on policies which are still in force but no longer actively marketed.
SunLife[16] – This business focuses solely on selling protection & savings products directly to those in the UK.
Bancassurance – This business is responsible for an advisory and sales force that sell AXAs products and propositions.

AXA sold AXA Sun Life Holdings Ltd to Resolution Limited in autumn 2010,[17][18] whilst retaining AXA Wealth (including Architas and the Elevate wrap platform), SunLife and Bancassurance business units. Closure of the Bancassurance arm was announced in April 2013.[19]
AXA PPP healthcare[edit]
AXA PPP healthcare is a UK private medical insurance provider.
AXA PPP healthcare was originally known as The London Association of Hospital Services, which was set up in 1938 as a private healthcare scheme for people of middle income in London.
The company has its headquarters in the town of Tunbridge Wells in Kent, England, and is the town’s largest private sector employer. AXA PPP healthcare provides individual private medical insurance for individuals and business as well as employee assistance programmes.
In 2009, AXA PPP International was created, catering for the expatriate health cover market.
On the Isle of Man[edit]
AXA Isle of Man Limited was originally created as a subsidiary of AXA Sun Life in the United Kingdom, but since the Isle of Man is not a part of the United Kingdom it is regulated instead by the laws of the Isle of Man. AXA Isle of Man Limited advertises itself as a repository for citizens of the United Kingdom and the Channel Islands who seek to shelter their assets from taxation.
While the company trades upon the AXA logo, name and group advertising which promotes the total wealth of the group, the assets of the Isle of Man company are limited to those of the Isle of Man company itself.
AXA Schengen[edit]
AXA Schengen Travel Insurance provides insurance to travelers who need a visa to enter the Schengen Area.
In Canada[edit]
AXA Canada offers insurance services through a network of affiliates operating in the different Canadian regions such as Quebec, Ontario, Western Canada and Atlantic Canada. In 2009, the company had a total of approximately 2,300 employees and 4000 brokers and advisors. The head office is in Montreal, Quebec. In 2011, AXA's Canadian operations were acquired by Intact Financial Corp. for C$2.6 billion.[20]
In the United States[edit]
The American arm of AXA is AXA Financial, inc., which is known mainly through its subsidiaries such as AXA Advisors, LLC, AXA Equitable Life Insurance, AXA Network, MONY (former Mutual of New York), US Financial Life, and AllianceBernstein.[21] The Equitable was acquired in 1991; MONY was acquired in 2004.[22][23]
On December 15, 2006, AXA Advisors, LLC entered into agreements with LPL (Linsco Private Ledger), the country's largest independent broker-dealer. LPL agreed to provide brokerage, clearing and custody services on a fully disclosed basis. The terms of the agreements are five years, subject to additional 24-month extensions. Services began in August 2007.
In Gulf and Middle East[edit]
AXA is present in GCC countries as AXA Insurance (Gulf) B.S.C. Present in the region for more than 60 years, AXA is the largest insurer in the GCC with branches across Bahrain, Oman, UAE and Turkey. In Saudi Arabia AXA is known as AXA Cooperative Insurance. It offers insurance for individuals and businesses with Health, Motor, Home, Travel, Personal and Group Accident, Fire, Engineering, Life and various other products.[24]
AXA is present in Lebanon as AXA Middle East. In 2000, AXA group acquired 51% of SLF’ capital and the Nasnas & Hanemoglou’s Group the remaining 49% to start the operations in Middle East.
AXA has also started operations in Egypt in the year 2015.[25]
In Mexico[edit]
In July 2008, AXA acquired ING Insurance Mexico, offering essentially the same services that ING offered. AXA then sued an ING Groep NV subsidiary over alleged misrepresentations in the $1.5 billion sale stating it suffered “tens (if not hundreds) of millions of dollars in damages.”[26]
In Asia Pacific[edit]
AXA Asia - Based in Hong Kong, AXA Asia is the Regional Office of AXA in Asia, with operating businesses across Life Insurance in 8 markets (Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, India, Thailand, and the Philippines) and General Insurance in 7 markets (Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, India and Thailand)

Beside having two joint ventures in life and general with Bank Mandiri, AXA also has direct business without strategic joint venture in life (as AXA Financial Indonesia and AXA Life Indonesia) and general (as Asuransi AXA Indonesia).
In Africa[edit]
In April 2016 AXA unveiled a partnership with Lloyd's of London insurer Chaucer Holdings to enter the growing market of speciality insurance in Africa. AXA Africa Specialty Risks helps to mitigate risks through its coverholder, Chaucer Syndicate 1084 and AXA Africa Specialty Risks 6130.

Headquarters[edit]
AXA headquarters is located in the 8th arrondissement of Paris.[29] AXA, which already owned 23 Avenue Matignon, acquired the former Hotel de La Vaupalière, an 18th-century building, in the late 1990s. Architect Ricardo Bofill integrated the facade of the hotel with a modern glass building that covers the courtyard that the hotel also occupies. The complex serves as AXA's head office.[30]
Philanthropy[edit]
Besides its artistic and social philanthropic initiatives (AXA Heart in action),[31] AXA created the AXA Research Fund in 2008. Endowed with €100 million, it provides support for research focused on understanding and preventing the risks threatening the environment, human life and society.[32]
256 basic-research projects were funded within three years, including 230 young researchers, PhDs or in postdoctoral year, working in laboratories all around the world. AXA also gathers every year the young fellows to meet a world-class researcher, exchange best practices and network.
The Fund has also awarded 11 endowments for several million euros supporting research institutions of excellence (HEC Paris, NUS, University of Bristol, LSE, MetOffice, INSERM, IHES...). These Research and Education Chairs intend to attract the best scientists. For example, the AXA - Polytechnique Chair in Cellular Cardiovascular Engineering,[33] held by Abdul Barakat, aims to promote research on cardiovascular diseases, but also to train and develop young researchers through extended educational programs.
The 256 research projects funded as of today are implemented in 22 countries with researchers of 42 different nationalities. The Scientific Board is chaired by Ezra Suleiman and composed of eminent members of the academic world and AXA Group representatives Pascale Cossart, Brian Hoskins, José Scheinkman, member of the Scientific Board and James Vaupel.

AXA is a French multinational insurance firm headquartered in the 8th arrondissement of Paris that engages in global insurance, investment management, and other financial services.
AXA joined the top 3 global financial services brands in 2016. The AXA Group operates primarily in Western Europe, North America, the Asia Pacific region, and the Middle East, with presence also in Africa. AXA is a conglomerate of independently run businesses, operated according to the laws and regulations of many different countries. The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[3]
According to a 2011 paper by Vitali et al., AXA was the second most powerful transnational corporation in terms of ownership and thus corporate control over global financial stability and market competition with Barclays and State Street Corporation taking the 1st and 3rd position, respectively.[4][5]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1816 as Mutuelle de L'assurance contre L'incendie (the Ancienne Mutuelle).[6] It acquired Compagnie Parisienne de Garantie in 1978 and became Mutuelles Unies.[7] It went on to buy the Drouot Group in 1982, becoming Mutuelles Unies/Drouot. It adopted the AXA name in 1985.[7] The takeover of the American insurance company The Equitable, came in 1991.[7] It bought Union des Assurances De Paris (UAP), France's largest insurer, in 1996 becoming AXA-UAP for a while before reverting to the name AXA in 1999.[8] Then in February 1999 AXA acquired Guardian Royal Exchange.[9] In May 2000 AXA acquired all shares it did not already own in Sun Life & Provincial Holdings.[10] On 14 June 2006 AXA acquired the leading Swiss insurance company Winterthur Group from Credit Suisse for approximately €9 billion.[11]
During May 2016 it announced it was to stop investing in tobacco shares and bonds and allow its portfolio of tobacco-related bonds to run off.[12]
The AXA name[edit]
Despite being written in upper case, "AXA" is not an acronym, but was chosen because its name can be pronounced easily by people who speak any language. After acquiring the Drouot Group in 1982, Chairman and CEO Claude Bébéar hired an outside consultant to conduct a computer-aided search for a new name. Bébéar wanted a short and snappy name to convey vitality and could be pronounced the same way in every language, consistent with the group's desire for an international presence. Initially, "Elan" was the top choice, but Canadian executives balked because "elan" is the French word for a moose or elk. In 1985, Bébéar chose the name AXA.[13]

Operations[edit]
In the United Kingdom[edit]
AXA trades in the United Kingdom as AXA UK using a number of subsidiaries such as AXA Sun Life, AXA Insurance, AXA Investment Managers, AXA Wealth and AXA PPP Healthcare. AXA PPP Healthcare was created when AXA bought Guardian Royal Exchange (GRE), though it subsequently sold the other parts of GRE to Aegon. The company also owns the online insurer Swiftcover, distribution business Bluefin and fund manager Architas. In January 2007 AXA was reorganised into "strategic business units" (SBU's) aimed at competing within their specific markets.
In September 2013, AXA Wealth was fined £1.8m by the FCA for failing to ensure it gave suitable investment advice to its customers. The regulator says it found “serious defects” in the way AXA advisers in Clydesdale Bank, Yorkshire Bank and the West Bromwich Building Society advised customers on investments.[14]
AXA run its investment branch through AXA Investment Managers (IM).
AXA Sun Life[edit]
AXA Sun Life was created following the merger between AXA Equity & Law and Sun Life Assurance Society PLC. In 2006 Winterthur Life in the UK was absorbed although AXA continue to use the Winterthur brand for high-net-worth wealth management business. The business units are:[15]

AXA Wealth – This includes AXA + Winterthur's Bonds + Individual Pensions, AXA Distribution Services who offer the Elevate wrap platform and Architas.
Corporate Business – AXA + Winterthur's Group Pensions. AXA intend to create a "Market Leading" group pension proposition using Winterthur's 'Embassy' IT platform.
Protection – This business aims to market AXA's Protection Account as AXA continues to build on its presence in this area with the intention of becoming a leading protection provider.
Traditional Business – Concentrating on policies which are still in force but no longer actively marketed.
SunLife[16] – This business focuses solely on selling protection & savings products directly to those in the UK.
Bancassurance – This business is responsible for an advisory and sales force that sell AXAs products and propositions.

AXA sold AXA Sun Life Holdings Ltd to Resolution Limited in autumn 2010,[17][18] whilst retaining AXA Wealth (including Architas and the Elevate wrap platform), SunLife and Bancassurance business units. Closure of the Bancassurance arm was announced in April 2013.[19]
AXA PPP healthcare[edit]
AXA PPP healthcare is a UK private medical insurance provider.
AXA PPP healthcare was originally known as The London Association of Hospital Services, which was set up in 1938 as a private healthcare scheme for people of middle income in London.
The company has its headquarters in the town of Tunbridge Wells in Kent, England, and is the town’s largest private sector employer. AXA PPP healthcare provides individual private medical insurance for individuals and business as well as employee assistance programmes.
In 2009, AXA PPP International was created, catering for the expatriate health cover market.
On the Isle of Man[edit]
AXA Isle of Man Limited was originally created as a subsidiary of AXA Sun Life in the United Kingdom, but since the Isle of Man is not a part of the United Kingdom it is regulated instead by the laws of the Isle of Man. AXA Isle of Man Limited advertises itself as a repository for citizens of the United Kingdom and the Channel Islands who seek to shelter their assets from taxation.
While the company trades upon the AXA logo, name and group advertising which promotes the total wealth of the group, the assets of the Isle of Man company are limited to those of the Isle of Man company itself.
AXA Schengen[edit]
AXA Schengen Travel Insurance provides insurance to travelers who need a visa to enter the Schengen Area.
In Canada[edit]
AXA Canada offers insurance services through a network of affiliates operating in the different Canadian regions such as Quebec, Ontario, Western Canada and Atlantic Canada. In 2009, the company had a total of approximately 2,300 employees and 4000 brokers and advisors. The head office is in Montreal, Quebec. In 2011, AXA's Canadian operations were acquired by Intact Financial Corp. for C$2.6 billion.[20]
In the United States[edit]
The American arm of AXA is AXA Financial, inc., which is known mainly through its subsidiaries such as AXA Advisors, LLC, AXA Equitable Life Insurance, AXA Network, MONY (former Mutual of New York), US Financial Life, and AllianceBernstein.[21] The Equitable was acquired in 1991; MONY was acquired in 2004.[22][23]
On December 15, 2006, AXA Advisors, LLC entered into agreements with LPL (Linsco Private Ledger), the country's largest independent broker-dealer. LPL agreed to provide brokerage, clearing and custody services on a fully disclosed basis. The terms of the agreements are five years, subject to additional 24-month extensions. Services began in August 2007.
In Gulf and Middle East[edit]
AXA is present in GCC countries as AXA Insurance (Gulf) B.S.C. Present in the region for more than 60 years, AXA is the largest insurer in the GCC with branches across Bahrain, Oman, UAE and Turkey. In Saudi Arabia AXA is known as AXA Cooperative Insurance. It offers insurance for individuals and businesses with Health, Motor, Home, Travel, Personal and Group Accident, Fire, Engineering, Life and various other products.[24]
AXA is present in Lebanon as AXA Middle East. In 2000, AXA group acquired 51% of SLF’ capital and the Nasnas & Hanemoglou’s Group the remaining 49% to start the operations in Middle East.
AXA has also started operations in Egypt in the year 2015.[25]
In Mexico[edit]
In July 2008, AXA acquired ING Insurance Mexico, offering essentially the same services that ING offered. AXA then sued an ING Groep NV subsidiary over alleged misrepresentations in the $1.5 billion sale stating it suffered “tens (if not hundreds) of millions of dollars in damages.”[26]
In Asia Pacific[edit]
AXA Asia - Based in Hong Kong, AXA Asia is the Regional Office of AXA in Asia, with operating businesses across Life Insurance in 8 markets (Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, India, Thailand, and the Philippines) and General Insurance in 7 markets (Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, India and Thailand)

Thailand as Krungthai-AXA Life Insurance

Beside having two joint ventures in life and general with Bank Mandiri, AXA also has direct business without strategic joint venture in life (as AXA Financial Indonesia and AXA Life Indonesia) and general (as Asuransi AXA Indonesia).
In Africa[edit]
In April 2016 AXA unveiled a partnership with Lloyd's of London insurer Chaucer Holdings to enter the growing market of speciality insurance in Africa. AXA Africa Specialty Risks helps to mitigate risks through its coverholder, Chaucer Syndicate 1084 and AXA Africa Specialty Risks 6130.
AXA ASR focuses on Specialty & Corporate lines, with coverage and an on-the-ground presence across Africa.

Headquarters[edit]
AXA headquarters is located in the 8th arrondissement of Paris.[29] AXA, which already owned 23 Avenue Matignon, acquired the former Hotel de La Vaupalière, an 18th-century building, in the late 1990s. Architect Ricardo Bofill integrated the facade of the hotel with a modern glass building that covers the courtyard that the hotel also occupies. The complex serves as AXA's head office.[30]
Philanthropy[edit]
Besides its artistic and social philanthropic initiatives (AXA Heart in action),[31] AXA created the AXA Research Fund in 2008. Endowed with €100 million, it provides support for research focused on understanding and preventing the risks threatening the environment, human life and society.[32]
256 basic-research projects were funded within three years, including 230 young researchers, PhDs or in postdoctoral year, working in laboratories all around the world. AXA also gathers every year the young fellows to meet a world-class researcher, exchange best practices and network.
The Fund has also awarded 11 endowments for several million euros supporting research institutions of excellence (HEC Paris, NUS, University of Bristol, LSE, MetOffice, INSERM, IHES...). These Research and Education Chairs intend to attract the best scientists. For example, the AXA - Polytechnique Chair in Cellular Cardiovascular Engineering,[33] held by Abdul Barakat, aims to promote research on cardiovascular diseases, but also to train and develop young researchers through extended educational programs.
The 256 research projects funded as of today are implemented in 22 countries with researchers of 42 different nationalities. The Scientific Board is chaired by Ezra Suleiman and composed of eminent members of the academic world and AXA Group representatives Pascale Cossart, Brian Hoskins, José Scheinkman, member of the Scientific Board and James Vaupel.

AXA is a French multinational insurance firm headquartered in the 8th arrondissement of Paris that engages in global insurance, investment management, and other financial services.
AXA joined the top 3 global financial services brands in 2016. The AXA Group operates primarily in Western Europe, North America, the Asia Pacific region, and the Middle East, with presence also in Africa. AXA is a conglomerate of independently run businesses, operated according to the laws and regulations of many different countries. The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[3]
According to a 2011 paper by Vitali et al., AXA was the second most powerful transnational corporation in terms of ownership and thus corporate control over global financial stability and market competition with Barclays and State Street Corporation taking the 1st and 3rd position, respectively.[4][5]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1816 as Mutuelle de L'assurance contre L'incendie (the Ancienne Mutuelle).[6] It acquired Compagnie Parisienne de Garantie in 1978 and became Mutuelles Unies.[7] It went on to buy the Drouot Group in 1982, becoming Mutuelles Unies/Drouot. It adopted the AXA name in 1985.[7] The takeover of the American insurance company The Equitable, came in 1991.[7] It bought Union des Assurances De Paris (UAP), France's largest insurer, in 1996 becoming AXA-UAP for a while before reverting to the name AXA in 1999.[8] Then in February 1999 AXA acquired Guardian Royal Exchange.[9] In May 2000 AXA acquired all shares it did not already own in Sun Life & Provincial Holdings.[10] On 14 June 2006 AXA acquired the leading Swiss insurance company Winterthur Group from Credit Suisse for approximately €9 billion.[11]
During May 2016 it announced it was to stop investing in tobacco shares and bonds and allow its portfolio of tobacco-related bonds to run off.[12]
The AXA name[edit]
Despite being written in upper case, "AXA" is not an acronym, but was chosen because its name can be pronounced easily by people who speak any language. After acquiring the Drouot Group in 1982, Chairman and CEO Claude Bébéar hired an outside consultant to conduct a computer-aided search for a new name. Bébéar wanted a short and snappy name to convey vitality and could be pronounced the same way in every language, consistent with the group's desire for an international presence. Initially, "Elan" was the top choice, but Canadian executives balked because "elan" is the French word for a moose or elk. In 1985, Bébéar chose the name AXA.[13]

Operations[edit]
In the United Kingdom[edit]
AXA trades in the United Kingdom as AXA UK using a number of subsidiaries such as AXA Sun Life, AXA Insurance, AXA Investment Managers, AXA Wealth and AXA PPP Healthcare. AXA PPP Healthcare was created when AXA bought Guardian Royal Exchange (GRE), though it subsequently sold the other parts of GRE to Aegon. The company also owns the online insurer Swiftcover, distribution business Bluefin and fund manager Architas. In January 2007 AXA was reorganised into "strategic business units" (SBU's) aimed at competing within their specific markets.
In September 2013, AXA Wealth was fined £1.8m by the FCA for failing to ensure it gave suitable investment advice to its customers. The regulator says it found “serious defects” in the way AXA advisers in Clydesdale Bank, Yorkshire Bank and the West Bromwich Building Society advised customers on investments.[14]
AXA run its investment branch through AXA Investment Managers (IM).
AXA Sun Life[edit]
AXA Sun Life was created following the merger between AXA Equity & Law and Sun Life Assurance Society PLC. In 2006 Winterthur Life in the UK was absorbed although AXA continue to use the Winterthur brand for high-net-worth wealth management business. The business units are:[15]

AXA Wealth – This includes AXA + Winterthur's Bonds + Individual Pensions, AXA Distribution Services who offer the Elevate wrap platform and Architas.
Corporate Business – AXA + Winterthur's Group Pensions. AXA intend to create a "Market Leading" group pension proposition using Winterthur's 'Embassy' IT platform.
Protection – This business aims to market AXA's Protection Account as AXA continues to build on its presence in this area with the intention of becoming a leading protection provider.
Traditional Business – Concentrating on policies which are still in force but no longer actively marketed.
SunLife[16] – This business focuses solely on selling protection & savings products directly to those in the UK.
Bancassurance – This business is responsible for an advisory and sales force that sell AXAs products and propositions.

AXA sold AXA Sun Life Holdings Ltd to Resolution Limited in autumn 2010,[17][18] whilst retaining AXA Wealth (including Architas and the Elevate wrap platform), SunLife and Bancassurance business units. Closure of the Bancassurance arm was announced in April 2013.[19]
AXA PPP healthcare[edit]
AXA PPP healthcare is a UK private medical insurance provider.
AXA PPP healthcare was originally known as The London Association of Hospital Services, which was set up in 1938 as a private healthcare scheme for people of middle income in London.
The company has its headquarters in the town of Tunbridge Wells in Kent, England, and is the town’s largest private sector employer. AXA PPP healthcare provides individual private medical insurance for individuals and business as well as employee assistance programmes.
In 2009, AXA PPP International was created, catering for the expatriate health cover market.
On the Isle of Man[edit]
AXA Isle of Man Limited was originally created as a subsidiary of AXA Sun Life in the United Kingdom, but since the Isle of Man is not a part of the United Kingdom it is regulated instead by the laws of the Isle of Man. AXA Isle of Man Limited advertises itself as a repository for citizens of the United Kingdom and the Channel Islands who seek to shelter their assets from taxation.
While the company trades upon the AXA logo, name and group advertising which promotes the total wealth of the group, the assets of the Isle of Man company are limited to those of the Isle of Man company itself.
AXA Schengen[edit]
AXA Schengen Travel Insurance provides insurance to travelers who need a visa to enter the Schengen Area.
In Canada[edit]
AXA Canada offers insurance services through a network of affiliates operating in the different Canadian regions such as Quebec, Ontario, Western Canada and Atlantic Canada. In 2009, the company had a total of approximately 2,300 employees and 4000 brokers and advisors. The head office is in Montreal, Quebec. In 2011, AXA's Canadian operations were acquired by Intact Financial Corp. for C$2.6 billion.[20]
In the United States[edit]
The American arm of AXA is AXA Financial, inc., which is known mainly through its subsidiaries such as AXA Advisors, LLC, AXA Equitable Life Insurance, AXA Network, MONY (former Mutual of New York), US Financial Life, and AllianceBernstein.[21] The Equitable was acquired in 1991; MONY was acquired in 2004.[22][23]
On December 15, 2006, AXA Advisors, LLC entered into agreements with LPL (Linsco Private Ledger), the country's largest independent broker-dealer. LPL agreed to provide brokerage, clearing and custody services on a fully disclosed basis. The terms of the agreements are five years, subject to additional 24-month extensions. Services began in August 2007.
In Gulf and Middle East[edit]
AXA is present in GCC countries as AXA Insurance (Gulf) B.S.C. Present in the region for more than 60 years, AXA is the largest insurer in the GCC with branches across Bahrain, Oman, UAE and Turkey. In Saudi Arabia AXA is known as AXA Cooperative Insurance. It offers insurance for individuals and businesses with Health, Motor, Home, Travel, Personal and Group Accident, Fire, Engineering, Life and various other products.[24]
AXA is present in Lebanon as AXA Middle East. In 2000, AXA group acquired 51% of SLF’ capital and the Nasnas & Hanemoglou’s Group the remaining 49% to start the operations in Middle East.
AXA has also started operations in Egypt in the year 2015.[25]
In Mexico[edit]
In July 2008, AXA acquired ING Insurance Mexico, offering essentially the same services that ING offered. AXA then sued an ING Groep NV subsidiary over alleged misrepresentations in the $1.5 billion sale stating it suffered “tens (if not hundreds) of millions of dollars in damages.”[26]
In Asia Pacific[edit]
AXA Asia - Based in Hong Kong, AXA Asia is the Regional Office of AXA in Asia, with operating businesses across Life Insurance in 8 markets (Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, India, Thailand, and the Philippines) and General Insurance in 7 markets (Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, India and Thailand)

Thailand as Krungthai-AXA Life Insurance

Beside having two joint ventures in life and general with Bank Mandiri, AXA also has direct business without strategic joint venture in life (as AXA Financial Indonesia and AXA Life Indonesia) and general (as Asuransi AXA Indonesia).
In Africa[edit]
In April 2016 AXA unveiled a partnership with Lloyd's of London insurer Chaucer Holdings to enter the growing market of speciality insurance in Africa. AXA Africa Specialty Risks helps to mitigate risks through its coverholder, Chaucer Syndicate 1084 and AXA Africa Specialty Risks 6130.
AXA ASR focuses on Specialty & Corporate lines, with coverage and an on-the-ground presence across Africa.

Headquarters[edit]
AXA headquarters is located in the 8th arrondissement of Paris.[29] AXA, which already owned 23 Avenue Matignon, acquired the former Hotel de La Vaupalière, an 18th-century building, in the late 1990s. Architect Ricardo Bofill integrated the facade of the hotel with a modern glass building that covers the courtyard that the hotel also occupies. The complex serves as AXA's head office.[30]
Philanthropy[edit]
Besides its artistic and social philanthropic initiatives (AXA Heart in action),[31] AXA created the AXA Research Fund in 2008. Endowed with €100 million, it provides support for research focused on understanding and preventing the risks threatening the environment, human life and society.[32]
256 basic-research projects were funded within three years, including 230 young researchers, PhDs or in postdoctoral year, working in laboratories all around the world. AXA also gathers every year the young fellows to meet a world-class researcher, exchange best practices and network.
The Fund has also awarded 11 endowments for several million euros supporting research institutions of excellence (HEC Paris, NUS, University of Bristol, LSE, MetOffice, INSERM, IHES...). These Research and Education Chairs intend to attract the best scientists. For example, the AXA - Polytechnique Chair in Cellular Cardiovascular Engineering,[33] held by Abdul Barakat, aims to promote research on cardiovascular diseases, but also to train and develop young researchers through extended educational programs.
The 256 research projects funded as of today are implemented in 22 countries with researchers of 42 different nationalities. The Scientific Board is chaired by Ezra Suleiman and composed of eminent members of the academic world and AXA Group representatives Pascale Cossart, Brian Hoskins, José Scheinkman, member of the Scientific Board and James Vaupel.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 02/04/1937
            

                BBB has determined that AXA Financial, Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards.

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                                    4. explains why any relief sought by the complainant cannot or should not be granted.
                                





                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

                        AXA Financial, Inc. has received 3.68 out of 5 stars based on 6 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, the lender will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow the lender to identify you. The lender may also ask to see your driver's license and other identifying documents.
*Disclaimer:24/7 Lending Group is not a lender and does not represent lenders as a loan broker or in any other capacity other than as a loan matching referral service, offering free rate quotes with no impact to your credit. 24/7 Lending Group does not run your credit and is not acting as a credit services agent for you. Lenders may perform a soft pull of your credit during the free rate quote process. Soft credit pulls have no impact to your credit scores or rating. You must select a rate quote and then finalize your loan directly with the lender with which you have selected. Any credit product for which you apply is solely the product of the lender. Most lenders will perform a hard credit check under the Fair Credit Reporting Act in order to evaluate your request promptly and adequately. Your permission will be asked for prior to any hard credit inquiry being performed. Final rates, terms and fees will be based on your individual credit history and underwritten by the lender NOT 24/7 Lending Group. 24/7 Lending Group cannot guarantee final terms, rates or repayments as they vary by lender. Providing your information on this Website does not guarantee approval for a product offering.  There is no charge to use 24/7 Lending Group service. 24/7 Lending Group may receive compensation from a lender in certain circumstances.
  Rate quotes provided to customers will be no greater than 35.99% APR (APRs include 0-5% origination fees), with terms from 12 to 72 months and available borrowing amounts of $1,000 to $35,000. Representative Personal Loan Example: For a $5,000 36-month loan at an interest rate of 6.03% with a 1.11% origination fee of $55.50, you will receive a loan amount of $4,944.50 and will make 36 monthly payments of about $152.18 at a 6.78% APR. Total loan cost would be $5,478.48.

We’ve come a long way from the days when a computer was the size of a large room. In 1946, a computer needed an estimated 174 kilowatts to run; a modern 13-inch Apple MacBook Pro uses 43 watts—a more than 400,000% change. A tablet consumes even less.
As size and energy consumption have decreased, variety has increased. Businesses and consumers now have myriad options at their fingertips, with new features emerging every year. Need something portable? Try a notebook computer. Want something desk-bound but space-saving? You can browse all-in-one desktop computers or even thin clients. Just looking for something light? Try an ultrabook for a balance of power and weight. 
CDW knows your business has specific needs, which is why we carry a wide selection of computers from the industry’s top brands, including Apple,  Lenovo and HP. And don’t forget to check out our Deal of the Week for special discounts on everything from workstations to tablet PCs.

CDW sells a large variety of servers and accessories for servers for organizations of all sizes. Within Servers, you will find different types of x86 servers for business as well as RISC-based-servers. No matter your organizational requirements, CDW can assist you in finding a server that meets and exceeds the requirements and expectations of your institution whether it's choosing the best server for enterprise, exchange server, or a server for small business.
Rack-mountable and tower servers are servers that conform to different-sized enclosures for mounting servers of varying form factors such as 1U, 2U, 3U and 4U. With CDW's search functionality, it's never been easier to find a rack-mountable server that meets your business needs. 
CDW also sells blade servers which have been known to save space and energy in conjunction with a blade server enclosure. For more information on saving space and energy by implementing a blade server solution, contact a CDW storage management solutions specialist.
Having trouble locating an HP server for your needs? Check out CDW's new Server Advisor tool. The Server Advisor asks you some basic questions about expected server uses, how many users will connect to your server as well as where it's going to be located and your expected organizational growth. All of these variables are taken into consideration and then an optimal HP server is identified and recommended for your business needs, whether it's the best server for small business or a large-scale server deployment in a dedicated data center.
For more complex server decisions such as whether or not to virtualize, what the best servers for virtualization are and what servers are good for cloud computing, you should consult a CDW solutions specialist to assist you in a virtualization or cloud computing solution for your specific needs.
