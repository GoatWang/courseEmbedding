Should You Get Life Insurance for Your Children




				Whether you are just starting a family, or already have children, there are several important decisions that you may be thinking about.        
				
Whether you are just starting a family, or already have children, there are several important decisions that you may be thinking about. Can your home accommodate growing children? Do you make enough money to support your children? What schools would you like them to go to and how will you be able to afford their future education?
These are just a few of the things that parents consider about their child or children. One thing that you may not think about immediately however, is life insurance for your children.










Many new parents don’t want to think about the serious aspects of life insurance and instead want to enjoy the new additions to their family without the thought of what may happen. However, it may be in your child’s best interest to look into the many benefits of life insurance.

Life insurance is frequently purchased by older adults, or young parents themselves thinking about the well-being of their children should something happen to them. But what you may not realize is that having life insurance for your children can be a great benefit to them for many reasons.
First of all, purchasing a life insurance policy for your child can help protect them should an illness or injury prevent them from getting coverage in the future. Young, healthy children aren’t typically seen as needing life insurance. However, having that coverage in place could help prevent you and them from future financial burdens should an accident or illness occur.
Secondly, many people see life insurance for children as a great gift because of it gives them a financial head start. Purchasing life insurance for your child will enable that policy to accumulate cash value, which can be used for whatever need may arise in their future.
For example, buying a life insurance policy for your child when they are young can allow that policy to mature and can be used to help with their continuing education when get older.
Many people that buy life insurance for children are actually the grandparents, because older adults especially understand the importance and long-term value of life insurance.
Whether you are a grandparent, parent or are just starting a family, life insurance for your children is something that you should research and get information about before you buy.
There are numerous resources available on the Internet that can help guide you to information about this. If you are looking for information on life insurance for yourself as well, it may be advised to find a company that can offer affordable life insurance for you as well as your children.
Do some research, talk to your family and then decide what’s right for your family.

E&O Plus




















E&O Plus was created in 1986 by Assurex Global and The Council of Insurance Agents & Brokers (CIAB) when the standard market for errors and omissions coverage wasn’t sufficient for many large independent agencies and brokers who were not only expanding, but also becoming more complex.
Over the last three decades, E&O Plus has grown to include over 60 insureds from across the United States.
The Quality Management Program from E&O Plus provides insureds with a proactive approach to operational efficiency — from professional development and employee satisfaction to workflow and client service.
E&O Plus provides exceptional client service to its insureds, which in turn helps them to provide exceptional service to their clients. Because when quality permeates every department, it has a direct impact on E&O exposure.

Building a Commitment to Workplace Safety – A White Paper for Construction Contractors


Since 1970, the rate of death for construction workers has dropped by 67 percent. However, one death on the job is still one death too many. According to “Building a Commitment to Workplace Safety,” a white paper from our Partners at Assurex Global, there is more to safety then simply applying hardware like hard hats, protective eye wear, and gloves. Safety is a mental and behavioral-based commitment that workers and their managers make every day.

Over the past two decades, an increasing number of Americans are transferring personal ownership of residential property to trusts, LLCs, limited liability partnerships (LLPs) and other asset-protection or tax-advantaged entities.

Defending Against an Invisible Threat: Pragmatic Cybersecurity for the Interconnected Business


Think your business is reasonably safe from a cyber attack? Think again. The threat is so widespread that there is an entire black market built to arm hackers with the tools they need to breach your systems. Even worse, 50 percent of online traffic is automated. It does not sleep. It is ever-present, and it can be searching for your data—or your client’s data at any moment. Should a hacker gain access into your business’ network, the results could be devastating in terms of lost assets, lost credibility, and a tarnished reputation.

Use Content to Serve Consumers as an Expert Resource


To contrast our greater value with those working to commoditize our business, we’ve recently examined the importance of demonstrating to consumers how protection varies among different personal insurance policies and clearly defining the “something more” a risk adviser provides. In this third and final installment on providing consumers a more valuable client experience, we examine the need to also serve consumers as an expert resource by providing helpful content to enhance their protection from many personal risks.
As personal risk advisers, we know our true value to consumers is far greater than functioning solely as an intermediary to procure insurance coverage. To broaden our positive impact, we have previously examined how to help consumers reduce their exposure to many risks through the many risk management services available by a select group of insurers (“Personal Risk Management Services: More Than Just Insurance“). Meanwhile, if we rely only on the risk management services provided by insurers to add value, at least some consumers will rightly question who is providing them with value.

The Future of Integrated Risk Management




The landscape of property and casualty insurance has changed. Insurers view risk more holistically, including data points never previously considered, such as how a company administers healthcare benefits when making underwriting assumptions. The trend began in the transportation industry—fueled by a $50 million settlement in a wrongful death suit.
This case study looks at the landmark settlement and how it impacts employers. It also presents how one progressive transportation company aggregated formerly disparate silos of human capital data to more aggressively manage risk across the enterprise.


















Insider Secrets to Successful Volunteer Management




How can volunteer managers recruit and retain the best people as well as protect their company from risks? This white paper answers these questions and highlights the critical role that insurance plays for nonprofit organizations.


















Six Steps for Effective Volunteer Management




This infographic serves as a teaser for the white paper, Insider Secrets to Successful Volunteer Management, presenting the information in a quick hit, highly-visual format.


















Exposed, Targeted and Breached: The Risk of Cyber Crime




Though the mainstream media typically reports on cyber attacks of large corporations like Sony, Target and others, all businesses are at risk—no matter the size. And the attacks will keep coming. According to a study from Juniper Research, the cost of data breaches will reach $2.1 trillion globally by 2019. This white paper will cover the four common cyber attacks aimed at business and the two types of cyber liability coverage your company should consider.


















4 Misconceptions About Cyber Attacks




According to the 2015 Travelers Business Risk Index, 29 percent of businesses list cyber threats as one of the risks they are least prepared to face. Every business could be a target for cyber crime, yet many businesses only have traditional insurance for protection. This infographic, based off of the Exposed, Targeted and Breached: The Risk of Cyber Crime white paper, covers the four misconceptions surrounding cyber attacks.


















Aviation General Liability




Many risks that airports face can be managed by insurance, risk management, or a combination of both. A General Liability Policy is the foundation of any business insurance program—it protects your business in the event a third party claims property damage or bodily injury against you because of your negligence. However, since most General Liability Policies have an airport and aircraft exclusion, it is critical that airports purchase their liability policy from an aviation specialty insurer.


















Identity Fraud: Taking the Necessary Steps to Prevent this Common Crime




In 2015 alone, over 13 million Americans fell victim to identity fraud, resulting in damages of more than $15 billion. While it is impossible to prevent fraud entirely (your data is often in the hands of others—banks, hospitals, online stores, etc.), there are steps you can take to lower the risk of exposure.


















The Effects of Marijuana Legalization in the U.S. Workplace




Marijuana remains illegal under U.S. federal law, but the Schedule 1 drug is increasingly becoming legalized throughout the states. In fact, four states and the District of Columbia have legalized the medical and recreational use of marijuana. This conflict between state and federal government has impacted the workplaces within all states.


















Avoid Temporary Worker OSHA Citations




In 2016, OSHA will increase its workplace safety violation penalties for the first time in 25 years. The initial hike will raise fines by approximately 80 percent. To educate contractors on how to avoid a citation, we developed an infographic, Avoid Temporary Worker OSHA Citations. By reading the infographic, you’ll learn about the four employee classifications, four tests to determine employee type, and seven methods for avoiding an OSHA audit.


















Drone Insurance: A Market on the Rise




It wasn’t too long ago that the word “drone” conjured up images of stealth military strikes in war-torn countries around the globe. And while military applications still prevail—the Pentagon has an arsenal of approximately 7,000 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)—commercial and personal drones are gaining in popularity.


















Online Privacy Guide: Handling Online Privacy the Right Way




In order to help our associates, partners and clients protect their digital footprints, Assurex Global asked our “go-to” resource for digital forensics and cybersecurity, LIFARS, for advice. What follows is a sampling of questions it commonly hears from clients and its advice for handling online privacy the right way.


















Risk Management Considerations for Temporary Workers




The increase in fines, along with OSHA’s long-standing multi-employer citation policy and newer Temporary Employee Initiative, raise concerns for construction companies that use temporary and leased employees. Huggett shared insight on related risk management considerations at a webinar for Assurex Global’s Construction Practice Group. His views and advice form the basis of this white paper.


















Crowdfunding: The Future of Equity Investing




In this white paper, we will cover the risks and explore best practices to help investors protect and potentially grow their assets with equity crowdfunding.
















A White Paper for Construction Contractors


Deconstructing Construction Defect Claims




This white paper discusses the primary categories of construction defects, the concept of construction defects as an “occurrence,” general liability coverage for construction defects and risk management solutions. It’s based on the Assurex Global Construction Practice Group meeting hosted by member company Oswald Companies in Cleveland in October 2015.
















Important tips and considerations while on the web


Cybersecurity Privacy and Security




Like a thief cuts through a bike lock, hackers can override your technology’s security measures. To keep us mindful of security best practices, Assurex Global’s “go to” resource for digital forensics and cybersecurity, LIFARS, has answered questions we should all be asking.


















Workplace Impacts of Marijuana Legalization




In 2012, Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize the recreational use and sale of marijuana. Since then, two other states and the District of Columbia have followed suit, while 18 others have legalized medical marijuana. Proponents tout the advantages of being able to regulate, tax and test marijuana. But what’s the impact on companies, particularly in relation to drug-free workplace policies?
















Making Sense of Data to Make More Informed Benefit Plan Decisions


Health Plan Secret Weapon: Integrated Data Analytics




This white paper from Assurex Global will show you the difference between reporting  and analysis. It is based on information and insights provided by Denise Mirtich, Analytics Leader and Co-Chair of Oswald Companies’ Women’s Leadership Council. The firm is an Assurex Global Partner and thought leader in Employee Benefits. The following details the steps you can take to make data—and your benefits plan—work for both your company and your employees.


















Subcontractor Prequalification




While the U.S. economy has turned around, landing construction projects for subcontractors remains as competitive as ever. Whether you are an excavator or an HVAC specialist, general contractors will look closely at your company to judge your fiscal health, reputability and reliability. One of the primary methods general contractors use to evaluate potential partners is subcontractor prequalification.
















A White Paper for Construction Contractors


Building A Commitment to Workplace Safety




This white paper encompasses views on building a commitment to workplace safety posited by D.J. Moran, Ph.D., who specializes in behavior-based safety (BBS) approaches. “Behavior-based safety has a legacy of helping people lead better and more healthful lives,” says Moran, owner of Pickslyde™ Consulting. Applying BBS approaches, which hinge on behavioral psychology, can double specific voluntary safety behaviors among construction workers, says Moran. That should make all general contractors sit up and take notice when you consider OSHA’s statistics on the construction industry.
















Important tips and considerations while on the go


Cybersecurity While Traveling




How often do you travel for work or pleasure? The majority of us do so quite frequently, and yet we give little thought to how we keep our identity and data safe while doing so. To keep us informed and vigilant during our travels, Assurex Global asked its “go to” resource for digital forensics and cyber security, LIFARS, to answer some questions all of us should be asking—but often don’t think to consider—regarding our digital security while on the road.
















Pragmatic Cybersecurity for the Interconnected Business


Defending Against an Invisible Threat




This white paper is based on a presentation from Mr. Chris Ensey, COO of Dunbar CyberSecurity. By reading it, you will learn what constitutes a cyber-attack and the associated tactics. You will also learn about preventative measures that you can take to strengthen your company’s security.

Independent insurance agents and brokers frequently find that families with substantial assets who insure their homes, autos, watercraft, and valuable collections with mass-market, heavily advertised carriers overpay for protection that still leaves them exposed to severe financial loss.

In these highly uncertain economic times, the issue of disparities in wealth, income, and taxation has become the subject of heated debate. As the controversy deepens and proliferates, newly released research by Chubb, the high net worth personal insurance business of Chubb, shows that many high net worth families are concerned this environment is heightening the risk they will be the target of a high-stakes liability lawsuit. Their wealth, they increasingly fear, can attract lawsuits. Aside from the financial impact, high net worth individuals fear the stress of protracted legal proceedings and risk damage to their reputations and ability to earn an income.
















A White Paper for Construction Contractors


Boosting Profitability with Flexible Overhead




The Great Recession of 2007 shed a painful light on the inadequacies of the construction industry’s typical business model. Because of the highly cyclical nature of the business, contractors can no longer measure success on how much revenue growth they experience, how much equipment they own or how big their jobs are.

Description

 



 
 


1943 was a milestone year for the J. B. Boda Group. It was in this year that Late Mr. Jagmohandas Bhagwandas Boda set out from the small coastal town of Porbandar in Gujarat to Mumbai, the commercial hub of India. In this city of dreams, he started a Reinsurance Broking operation with his brother Late Mr. Dhirajlal Bhagwandas Boda. These visionaries opened a Subsidiary Company in Hong Kong in 1965 and a Liaison Office in London in 1967. The J. B. Boda Group ventured into the African Continent in 1965. Our growing popularity and base then led to the opening of an Associate Company in Singapore in 1981. In 1986, a U.K. registered Company was formed. On 6th December 2001, it received Accreditation as Lloyd’s Broker. With this achievement, J. B. Boda became the first Indian Broker at Lloyd’s. Continued growing relationship and opportunities in different regions encouraged the Group to open Representative Offices in Dubai, Nepal and Kenya. In 2013, the J. B. Boda Group celebrated the 70th Anniversary of its founding, a milestone made possible thanks to the longstanding support of our employees and clients throughout the years. 
With 72 years of experience in insurance and reinsurance, the J. B. Boda Group has built a long-standing reputation for rendering professional services. As a successful brand, we build a long term relationship with clients that grows with time, further strengthening the bond of trust.

Assurex Global Forms Captive

October 23, 2003

Article
Comments


Columbus, Ohio-based brokerage Assurex Global announced the formation of Assurex Global Reinsurance Ltd., a captive insurance company to provide risk management solutions to corporate customers around the world.
The new entity was announced by Assurex Global Board Chairman Greg Collins, president of Seattle-based Parker, Smith & Feek, an Assurex Global Partner. A captive is an insurer formed by a corporation to insure the risks of the owner and/or closely related third parties. Captives provide alternative funding mechanisms to commercial insurance markets.
Assurex Global Re is one of a newer breed of entities that allows for multiple captives, which are segregated cells for insuring heterogeneous or industry-specific groups, according to Collins.
“Assurex Global Re will be client focused — providing group solutions for the corporate clients of our independent broker Partners,” he said in a statement. “The initial cell will be focused on heterogeneous corporate clients, who are dedicated to proactive management of their insurance needs. Future cells are expected to address more difficult commercial classes, such as medical malpractice, assisted living, California workers compensation, small commercial accounts, and construction.”
Assurex Global Re will be based in Bermuda and managed by HSBC Insurance Solutions Ltd., an Assurex Global Partner. Discover Re Managers, the alternative risk subsidiary of the St. Paul Insurance Group, will underwrite the first program to be reinsured by the company. Innovative Risk Management, based in Irving, Texas, will provide program management services, while claims will be managed by Columbus-based Frank Gates Service Co.
Assurex Global generated annual premiums in excess of $19 billion.

Should You Get Life Insurance for Your Children




				Whether you are just starting a family, or already have children, there are several important decisions that you may be thinking about.        
				
Whether you are just starting a family, or already have children, there are several important decisions that you may be thinking about. Can your home accommodate growing children? Do you make enough money to support your children? What schools would you like them to go to and how will you be able to afford their future education?
These are just a few of the things that parents consider about their child or children. One thing that you may not think about immediately however, is life insurance for your children.










Many new parents don’t want to think about the serious aspects of life insurance and instead want to enjoy the new additions to their family without the thought of what may happen. However, it may be in your child’s best interest to look into the many benefits of life insurance.

Life insurance is frequently purchased by older adults, or young parents themselves thinking about the well-being of their children should something happen to them. But what you may not realize is that having life insurance for your children can be a great benefit to them for many reasons.
First of all, purchasing a life insurance policy for your child can help protect them should an illness or injury prevent them from getting coverage in the future. Young, healthy children aren’t typically seen as needing life insurance. However, having that coverage in place could help prevent you and them from future financial burdens should an accident or illness occur.
Secondly, many people see life insurance for children as a great gift because of it gives them a financial head start. Purchasing life insurance for your child will enable that policy to accumulate cash value, which can be used for whatever need may arise in their future.
For example, buying a life insurance policy for your child when they are young can allow that policy to mature and can be used to help with their continuing education when get older.
Many people that buy life insurance for children are actually the grandparents, because older adults especially understand the importance and long-term value of life insurance.
Whether you are a grandparent, parent or are just starting a family, life insurance for your children is something that you should research and get information about before you buy.
There are numerous resources available on the Internet that can help guide you to information about this. If you are looking for information on life insurance for yourself as well, it may be advised to find a company that can offer affordable life insurance for you as well as your children.
Do some research, talk to your family and then decide what’s right for your family.
