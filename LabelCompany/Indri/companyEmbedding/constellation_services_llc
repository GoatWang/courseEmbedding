Making Energy Work For You 


Constellation, an Exelon company, is a leading competitive energy company providing power, natural gas, renewable energy, and energy management products and services for homes and businesses across the continental United States. We provide integrated energy solutions—from electricity and natural gas procurement and renewable energy supply to energy efficiency and distributed energy solutions—that help customers strategically buy, manage and use energy.
But Constellation is about more than providing energy. We know that the energy landscape is constantly changing and care about being a good environmental steward. To that end, in addition to traditional energy sources, we work hard to offer renewable energy options wherever possible.
We know as well that a company is only as good as its service and reputation. Maintaining stellar customer service, competitive pricing, and working with and within the communities we serve to help those in need, therefore, is a critical part of our mission. We regularly work with groups such as Habitat for Humanity to come up with affordable and renewable energy solutions for projects across America. Through our E2 Energy to Educate program and Community Champions Program we also offer grants for education in schools and to local community organizations.
Today, approximately 2.5 million residential, public sector and business customers, including two-thirds of Fortune 100 companies, rely on our commitment to innovation, dependability, transparency and service. That is the kind of value you and your communities can expect from Constellation.
