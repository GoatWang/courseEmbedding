Within the last year the company has taken tremendous strides to improve the company culture and operations previously destroyed by the prior CEO, which is typically an ingredient to the downfall of most startups. The onboarding of the new CEO was a game changer and has been a breath of fresh air. Having been a part of Atlatl Software 1.0 and now 2.0, having the opportunity to work here is a once in a lifetime learning experience and dream come true. The amount of talent in this company is extraordinary and we each take the time to learn from one another and craft skill sets that we would have never had the opportunity to learn in another company. Every employee is willing to be fluid to responsibilities and tasks that may be outside the scope of their job description but that in the long term will benefit the company as a whole. The culture is one of real people, creating real solutions for real problems. We operate on a people buy from people business and extend that to our customers through true business relationship building. It is a privilege to work with such intelligent people, creating something that is going to change the manufacturing and technology industry. If you are looking to join a company that is unlike any other, with a technology unlike any other and a vision for changing the industry like no other, then you need to check out Atlatl Software as your next career opportunity.ConsWorking at any startup can be very difficult, time consuming outside of normal business hours, and you must be willing to be agile in many situations. While I don't see this as a con, if you are not accustomed to this type of environment, then any startup company isn't for you.Advice to ManagementContinue to craft a culture that produces excellent product by enabling the abilities, talents, skills and visions of excellent people.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Atlatl Software Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Atlatl Software 2017-07-14 08:31 PDT Jun 3, 2017"The Iron Price"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Technical Lead in Charleston, SCFormer Employee - Technical Lead in Charleston, SCRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI worked at Atlatl Software full-time (More than a year)ProsUnder new management, cool office location, free coffee and occasionally lunchConsAtlatl Software went through severe growing pains when expanding the company from a small startup years ago. They have a new CEO and he was quite frankly appalled at how the company was operating. He reached out to all of the former employees that were laid off or fired in questionable ways, offered his sincerest apology, and asked for forgiveness. Furthermore, they removed the individuals that were causing all the problems. I truly believe them when they say they have changed and want the world to see they are not the same company as years ago.Advice to ManagementBe careful who you promote. Personality and people skills are important, but if you continue advancing individuals who have better soft skills than technical you will have another game of thrones situation on your hands.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Atlatl Software Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Atlatl Software 2017-06-03 12:33 PDT Join the Atlatl Software team See Our Latest Jobs Mar 23, 2017"Tremendous Shift"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Charleston, SCCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Charleston, SCRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Atlatl Software full-time (More than 3 years)ProsThe new outlook on our company with a new CEO and business plan as a whole has led to a tremendous amount of positive vibes throughout the company. We are well on our way to becoming a successful company and with CEO Marc Murphy at the helm there is no doubt that we will get there with his proven success. In a short amount of time we as a company were able to identify where our processes needed to change and implement these changes rapidly. We are constantly changing these processes to evolve Atlatl and learning from our mistakes which has been instrumental in re-building a great company. With the new leadership change and shift in the organization we are moving forward rapidly. Atlatl is becoming a successful software startup company with a great culture and collaborative team that I would encourage people to be a part of.ConsAs with any startup we have experienced growing pains which have not always been positive, however Atlatl is poised to become something great in Charleston. There are times that communication is broken amongst the ranks and the intended message is not always delivered appropriately to the staff, but this can be said for almost every rapidly growing company.Advice to ManagementContinue to improve on communication as this is instrumental in the growth and success for a company of Atlatl's size.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Atlatl Software Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Atlatl Software 2017-03-23 08:28 PDT Mar 15, 2017 Helpful (1)"Constantly Improving"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI worked at Atlatl Software full-timeProsWith the relatively recent change of leadership at Atlatl, the company's situation has started to improve drastically. The culture has begun to shift to a more positive and excited experience. People are genuinely excited about the future and that translates into a drive to do great work. Given the top quality talent that Atlatl has in every department and the proven track record that Marc Murphy brings to the table, I have every confidence that Atlatl will continue to grow and become a mainstay of the Charleston digital scene.ConsThe tumultuous past of the company can loom over some, but the bad memories are quickly being replaced by positive ones. As the company continues its growing process, there will undoubtedly be stressful moments and long hours, but that can be said of any startup.Advice to ManagementListen to your people, keep them happy and create an environment where egos are checked at the door.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Atlatl Software Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Atlatl Software 2017-03-15 08:00 PDT Sep 15, 2016 Helpful (1)"Exciting Possibility"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Charleston, SCCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Charleston, SCRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Atlatl Software (More than 3 years)ProsWith the previous CEO of Sparc taking the reigns Atlatl is showing a lot of promise as a budding technology company with a bright future. If you're looking to get the experiential latitude common among young start ups to grow your skill set Atlatl is fantastic. With a large funding round last year and a mindset for hiring and rewarding talent much of the risk inherent in start ups is mitigated.ConsIf you're the kind of person who has to stick to a rigorously defined work environment and have a strong disdain for rapid project change then Atlatl probably isn't for you.Advice to ManagementThere have been several large shifts in management over the years and each one has been dramatically better. This current track shows a focus on work life balance and technological innovation, stick with it.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Atlatl Software Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Atlatl Software 2016-09-15 15:22 PDT Jul 11, 2016 Helpful (2)"The Best Job I've Every Had"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Marketing in Charleston, SCCurrent Employee - Marketing in Charleston, SCRecommendsPositive OutlookI have been working at Atlatl Software full-time (More than 3 years)ProsGreat people.

The chance to work with really cool technology and with extremely bright people makes this a very rewarding place to work.ConsThere is some risk that the business model won’t be successful in the long term but I remember when people said that about Google. The company is very lean and the expected surge of new business could require some periods of overtime.Advice to ManagementContinue to focus on employee retention and recruitment.

1981 Company Founded
  Atlatl, Inc. was founded in 1981 and operated under the name of Accu-Rater, Inc. until January 3, 2000. Our initial product was a personal computer based comparison rating program for North Carolina insurance agencies. 
1983 Choice of Partners Puts Emphasis on Technology
  In 1983, the founders of Atlatl brought in two partners. These partners were both from EDS. The choice of partners set Atlatl on a course of emphasizing technology. This pattern has been a constant. Atlatl sees itself as a technology company and our growth philosophy has been development using new technologies as opposed to geographic expansion of a static product. 
1985 First Proprietary Point of Sale Program
  In 1985, Atlatl released its first proprietary point of sale software rating system. This was a North Carolina rating program with application completion and printing for Integon. These products added value by embedding consistent underwriting rules behind the rating process to more accurately qualify insureds. They also cut the cost of issuing a policy by reducing mailing costs. 
1988-1991 Point of Sale Enhancements
  In the late 80's and early 90's, Atlatl continued to add improvements to the growing base of proprietary point of sale systems. These improvements included features such as electronic upload of business, payments, and endorsements, as well as field issuance of policies. These products added value by reducing the costs incurred in processing transactions. 
1991 First Windows Product
  In 1991, Atlatl completed its first rate and issue policy management system for use in The Travelers operation centers. These also became the first products Atlatl designed for Windows. 
1993 Download of Policy Databases
  Download of complete agency policy databases from the insurance company to the agency was implemented on a national basis in the mid 90's. These products added value by reducing the cost of communicating with the agency force. Now the agent did not have to call the company service representatives to find out payment or policy status. 
 
	

1995 Third Party Vendor Access
  A major focus of projects was the ability to transfer data to and receive data from a wide variety of third party programs. These included outside report providers for comparison rating vendors, state insurance departments, state motor vehicle departments, and back office processing and financial systems. These products add value by providing more decision making information at the point of sale, by reducing the re-entry of information by agents, and by reducing processing cost to the insurance company. 
1998 Built-in User Maintenance Features and the Internet
  Atlatl concentrated development on two areas. First, we have focused on building tools around our products that allow our customers to maintain many functions themselves. This is an opportunity for the customer to be more self reliant and to save in the long run. Second, we have developed World Wide Web products. In 1998 Atlatl released its first real-time rating products on the Internet which add value by reducing the time to market for program changes. With these products, the insurance company can have a presence on the World Wide Web. 
2000 JAVA and the World Wide Web 
  Currently, Atlatl is focusing on a range of new products for the World Wide Web. These products feature Java based objects. Programs are written using ODBC and XML data elements. These products are both business-to-business and business-to-consumer products. 
2003 Acrobat Fillable Forms
  Acrobat forms offer a wide varierty of fascinating capabilities. Their interactive abilities with databases is a feature that most companies are just beginning to recognize. The widespread use of the free Acrobat Reader, and its platform independence are rapidly making this a valuable tool. The ability to run custom javascripts has even allowed us to incorporate complete rating, application completion and data upload into a single Acrobat form.

 Atlatl has in depth experience in providing downloadable forms for your agents. Atlatl can have the Acrobat forms interact with databases to prefill information before the download of the form and to submit updated data to databases after the agent has completed the form.
