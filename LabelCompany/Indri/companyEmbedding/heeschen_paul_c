Title: Board of Trustees Member
               Company: St. Margaret's Episcopal School
Job Details
               Three years ago, St. Margaret's welcomed our family with open arms, and since then, we continue to be amazed and grateful with all of the opportunities St. Margaret's offers our children. We both believe strongly in the mission of our school and feel the need to support the school both financially and with our time by volunteering. As a result, when asked, we were honored and thrilled to be the new co-chairs of the Building on the Promise capital campaign and to be taking over the reins from a very dedicated Stacey Nicholas, who will continue to be involved as a member of the Campaign Cabinet. This year we have made great progress raising funds for this important project. With $5 million raised since September 2009, we now have over $16.4 million toward our $30 million goal. The Board of Trustees is confident that the momentum is on our side and now is the time to move forward with planning for construction. The goal is to move ahead with the building of the Middle School and Performing Arts Center simultaneously. This will enable the fastest construction completion timeline and allow us to leverage significant cost savings. 1. The actual cost of construction is 20-25 percent lower than levels in 2008 when we originally bid the project. 2. We will realize an approximate $1 million in savings by building both buildings at the same time. One important factor is raising additional funds to support simultaneous construction. Many families have already extended their generous support, and we are eager to broaden the base of those who believe in this important endeavor and are willing to lend a hand. During the summer and fall, we will continue to work aggressively toward this goal by reaching out to the St. Margaret's community asking for support. If you have any questions, or would like to arrange a meeting to discuss the campaign, please feel free to contact us or Lara Farhadi, Executive Director of Advancement, 661-0108 x353. Let's all join together and capture this moment of growth, finishing our campus and strengthening the educational opportunities for our children. It promises to be an exciting and fruitful experience for all of us.
