Spin-off will help portfolio companies improve their growth potential and create more value for shareholders

The spin-off of CSW Industrials from Capital Southwest Corporation enhances opportunities for the company to invest in the growth projects of portfolio companies and deliver more shareholder value. At launch, the six companies comprising the CSWI portfolio include:
















































“These
are strong companies with excellent potential for continued growth,” said CSW Industrials’
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Joseph B. Armes. “Capital Southwest faced
significant regulatory hurdles in making the investments necessary to help these
companies achieve their potential. CSW Industrials doesn’t face those hurdles.
We’ll be able to put more focus on the portfolio companies and have the flexibility
to make the investments that ultimately can reward shareholders. ”Taken separately, CSW Industrials’ net revenues
and operating income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 were $261.8
million and $44.0 million, respectively. This represented 13.0% growth in
revenues and 16.1% growth in operating income. These results do not include Strathmore, which
was acquired effective April 1, 2015. Strathmore is a leading manufacturer of
specialized industrial coating products, including urethanes, epoxies, acrylics
and alkyds. Strathmore’s net revenues and operating income for fiscal year
ended December 31, 2014 were $63.2 million and $8.2 million, respectively.
