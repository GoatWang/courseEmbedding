Former AT&T Wireless Mobility Services President and CEO Mohan
    Gyani Joins RingCentral Board of Directors
 

Telecom Veteran to Support Cloud Computing Business
    Telecommunication Services Leader As Industry Goes Through Massive
    and Disruptive Technology Change
  San Mateo, Calif. - April 7, 2009 - RingCentral,
  a cloud computing-based hosted business phone services provider,
  announced today that Mohan Gyani, former president and CEO of AT&T
  Wireless Mobility Services, has joined RingCentral’s Board of
  Directors.  “In my career, I have tried to lead my
  businesses into new frontiers by anticipating the impact of technology
  shifts and by being prepared to deliver on the fundamental changes
  this would have on customers’ needs,” said Mohan Gyani. “Cloud
  computing is dramatically changing how business communication
  applications are delivered, especially due to the massive adoption of
  wireless phones. In RingCentral, I see an industry leader that is
  driving this disruptive technology change and delivering tremendous
  value that expensive legacy systems are incapable of delivering.
  RingCentral has built a unique and proven cloud computing-based
  technology platform and is a company that has a clear vision of the
  future of this industry. I look forward to working with their
  experienced management team to make this vision a reality.”
 Mr. Gyani’s extensive previous experience in the
  telecommunications industry includes:
 President and CEO of AT&T Wireless Mobility Services,
    where he led the rollout of the next generation GSM network and the
    $10.6 Billion IPO of AT&T Wireless in 2000. CFO and
    Executive Vice President of AirTouch, where he played a strategic
    role in the company’s growth from IPO to a $70 Billion global
    company within five years. Key leader in the merger of
    AirTouch and Vodafone and the subsequent joint venture with Bell
    Atlantic that resulted in the creation of Verizon Wireless.
Board of Director and head of Strategy and Corporate Development
    of Vodafone AirTouch PLC following the merger of Vodafone and
  AirTouch. Board of Director of GSM Association and CTIA
    (Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association). 
 
Vlad Shmunis, chairman and CEO of RingCentral said, “Mohan Gyani is
  one of the most respected veterans of the telecommunications industry
  and his expertise and reputation are unparalleled. This is a
  remarkable time for our industry—cloud computing is reshaping the
  business telecommunication services industry and RingCentral is
  leading this massive and disruptive technology change. Mohan’s
  addition to the Board strengthens the company’s potential and we are
  looking forward to the value and perspective he will bring as
  RingCentral accelerates its growth.”  In addition to his
  new board position with RingCentral, Mr. Gyani also serves on the
  board of directors of Keynote Systems, Mobile TeleSystems OJSC,
  Safeway, SIRF Technology Holdings, and Union Bank of California as
  well as certain private companies.  About RingCentral

– USA, TX – Digital Turbine, Inc. (Nasdaq: APPS), a global mobile software company working to deliver the right app to the right person at the right time, today announced the appointment of Mohan Gyani as an independent director, replacing Jud Bowman following his appointment as President and CEO of Sift Media, Inc., in which Digital Turbine holds a stake. Mr. Gyani will also serve on the company’s Compensation Committee. Mr. Gyani was selected to serve based on his broad knowledge of the wireless industry, extensive industry relationships, and deep experience serving on public and private company boards.
“Mohan’s more than 30 years of global experience across the telecom and wireless industries will add a valuable perspective to our Board of Directors,” said Rob Deutschman, Chairman of Digital Turbine. “As mobile operators and OEMs expand their participation in the explosive growth of applications, Mohan’s experience and counsel will be invaluable in helping Digital Turbine to capitalize on this enormous opportunity.”
“In my career, I have concentrated on leading businesses into new frontiers by anticipating the impact of technology shifts and by being prepared to deliver on the fundamental changes these would have on customers’ needs,” said Mohan Gyani. “The growth in mobile applications is dramatically changing how consumers live their lives, especially considering the massive adoption of smartphones and tablets. In Digital Turbine, I see an industry leader that is at the intersection of this trend, connecting the mobile operators and OEMs to application providers through their proprietary software. I look forward to working with the board and management team to make this vision a reality.”
Concluded Mr. Deutschman, “We also thank Jud for his considerable contributions to Digital Turbine as a member of the board. Given the demands of his time at Sift, we mutually agreed that this is the right time to effect a transition. We wish him every success in his new endeavor.”
“I want to thank Rob and the other members of the board and management team for the opportunity to serve on the Digital Turbine board,” said Jud Bowman. “As the CEO of Sift Media, our Sift investors thought it best that I focus 100% of my efforts on our new venture. I continue to be a large Digital Turbine shareholder and remain fully supportive of the company’s strategy and prospects. I look forward to collaborating with Digital Turbine through its board membership and meaningful interest in my new venture.”
Mr. Gyani is a private investor and an advisor at Primera Capital, a venture capital firm that helps build sustainable, successful companies that focus on innovative products, services and technologies. His career includes serving as the President and Chief Executive Officer of AT&T Wireless Mobility Services from 2000 until his retirement from that company in 2003, and as a senior advisor to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AT&T Wireless through December 2004. From 1995 through 1999, he was the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of AirTouch Communications, a wireless telephone services provider. Upon the acquisition of AirTouch by Vodafone, Mr. Gyani served as executive Director on the board of Vodafone AirTouch and as its head of strategy and M&A until July 1999. Prior to AirTouch Communications, Mr. Gyani spent 15 years with Pacific Telesis Group, Inc., parent of Pacific Bell, a telecommunications company, where he held various financial and operational positions.
Mr. Gyani currently serves as Vice Chairman of Mobileum, Inc., which designs and develops roaming services and telco big data analytics solutions to mobile network operators in the United States and internationally, and is currently a member of the boards of Ruckus Wireless, Inc., a Wi-Fi technology company; Blackhawk Network Holdings, Inc., a provider of prepaid payments products; IDEA Cellular, a wireless service provider; and MUFG Union Bank, N.A and its financial holding company, MUFG Americas Holdings Corporation, as well as the boards of other private companies that are in the wireless mobile space. Mr. Gyani has also held board positions at Mobile Telesystems (MTS), a cell phone operator, from June 2007 to June 2010. From March 2002 to August 2013, he served on the board of directors of Keynote Systems, Inc., a mobile and web cloud testing and monitoring company, and from October 2004 to February 2015, he served on the board of directors of Safeway, Inc., a retail food and drug company.

                        Calif., San Jose, United States
                    








                                            Roamware, a leading provider of voice and data roaming products for global mobile networks, today announced it has appointed Mohan Gyani as chief executive officer and chairman. The company will be holding a press conference with Gyani in Mumbai, India on Tuesday, May 3 at 10 AM (Monday, 9:30 PM PT / Tuesday, 5:00 AM GMT) to discuss the news. In a separate release today, the company also announced the acquisition of its 100th customer, Orange Slovakia. 

Gyani joins the company as it enters the next phase of expansion in the global mobile roaming market, a market which is estimated to be worth $50 billion in annual revenues. Currently providing a range of enhanced roaming and valued added services to 100 network operators across 63 countries worldwide, Roamware products help mobile operators to maximize revenue, increase operational efficiency, and reduce subscriber churn. 

"Roamware is ready to move to the next stage of growth. I am delighted to be joining such a vibrant company at such a pivotal stage in the development of the roaming market. Mobile operators worldwide are looking for new revenue streams, increased customer loyalty and higher returns on investment -- Roamware and its services deliver all that and more," said Gyani. 

A widely-respected veteran of the industry, Gyani played key roles in the $1.6 billion initial public offering of AirTouch in 1993 and the $10.6 billion IPO of AT&T Wireless in 2000. 

Gyani has already stepped into his new role at Roamware. Previously, he was the former president and CEO of AT&T Wireless Mobility Services, where he was responsible for all aspects of its US wireless carrier operations. During his tenure he was instrumental in driving significant revenue, customer and profitability growth, while also building out a new national GSM Network. 

Current Roamware Chairman Ori Sasson, who will continue as co-chairman with Gyani, said, "Mohan brings the business strengths and experience that we need in order to execute the next level of our strategy. He was instrumental in transforming some of the best-known names in telecommunications, and we look forward to him adding significant value to the Roamware team." 

"Roamware has delivered a compelling ROI for mobile operators around the world", said investor and board member, Rob Theis, a general partner from DCM -- Doll Capital Management. "We believe the future for Roamware extends far beyond roaming services. Mohan has the strategic insight and proven execution skills to expand the product platform and capture new markets with value added offerings in data, content and multi-network deployments." 

Gyani joined AT &T Wireless in 2000 from Vodafone AirTouch PLC. Following the merger of Vodafone and AirTouch in 1999, Gyani was head of strategy and corporate development and a member of the board of directors for Vodafone AirTouch. 

Prior to the merger with Vodafone, he was executive vice president and chief financial officer of AirTouch, where he played a major operational and strategic role in the company's growth from an IPO to a $70 billion global company in five years. He was a key leader in the $120 billion merger of AirTouch and Vodafone and the subsequent $70 billion joint venture with Bell Atlantic that resulted in the creation of Verizon Wireless. 

"Mohan's joining the company is the strongest possible endorsement of Roamware and its market opportunities," said Bahram Nour-Omid, board member and a general partner at Shelter Capital Partners, an investor in Roamware. "His vast knowledge of the industry, together with a unique combination of financial skills and in-depth wireless operations experience, makes him a natural choice to lead the company. 

Gyani began his career in 1978 with Pacific Telesis Group/Pacific Bell, holding a number of financial and operational positions. He is a member of the boards of Epiphany, Keynote Systems, and Safeway as well as a board member of private firms and non-profit organizations. He is a former member of the board of directors of the GSM Association and of CTIA (Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association). Born in India, he settled in San Francisco in 1970 and holds an MBA in finance from San Francisco State University.
