Orla Processing Plant and Delaware System Expansion

Creates large integrated G&P platform across the most active acreage in the Delaware Basin
Crestwood and First Reserve, via a joint venture focused on developing, owning and operating midstream infrastructure in the Delaware Basin, has sanctioned the construction of a 200 MMcf/d cryogenic processing plant in Orla, TX. The initial project scope will include a 33 mile, 20 inch high pressure line (the “Orla Express Pipeline”) connecting the existing Willow Lake gathering system in Eddy county, NM to the Orla plant in Reeves county, TX. The Orla plant will offer full liquids handling and multiple residue and NGL interconnects. Once the plant is placed into service, Crestwood anticipates several expansion projects to capture production growth in the basin, including connecting the plant to the joint venture’s Nautilus gas gathering system  and building additional laterals to gather incremental volumes for offset producers.
Initial project capital is expected to be approximately $170 million with a targeted in-service date in the second half of 2018.

Nautilus Gas Gathering System

Located in the core of the Delaware-Permian
Crestwood has entered into a long-term agreement with SWEPI LP (“SWEPI”), a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell plc, to construct, own and operate a natural gas gathering system in Shell’s premier position in the Delaware-Permian Basin. SWEPI has dedicated to Crestwood approximately 100,000 acres and gathering rights for SWEPI gas production across Loving, Reeves and Ward counties, Texas.
The initial gathering system is designed for gas production of approximately 250 million cubic feet per day and will include 194 miles of low pressure gathering lines, 36 miles of high pressure trunklines, and centralized compression facilities which are expandable over time as production increases. Crestwood will provide gathering, dehydration, compression and liquids handling services on a fixed fee basis.
The system was placed into service on June 6, 2017.

Bear Den Processing Plant

New Bakken processing plant to support accelerated Arrow gathering volumes
Crestwood has begun construction on a new 30 MMcf/d processing plant (“Bear Den”) in Watford City, ND to support accelerated development on Crestwood’s Arrow gathering system on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in the Bakken Shale. The Arrow gathering system will supply the Bear Den plant via a new 25 mile pipeline. The plant will have connections into NGL and residue outlets including COLT Hub’s rail loading via Crestwood’s trucking fleet. The project is expected to cost approximately $115 million and be in-service by fourth quarter 2017.

Delta Pipeline

The Delaware take-away crude pipeline system (“Delta”) is a proposed ~200 mile, 20-inch crude oil and condensate pipeline header system originating near Orla, TX (Reeves County) in the Delaware Basin. Based on shipper feedback from a non-binding open season, Delta will have potential connections to multiple downstream pipelines that provide shippers access to attractive demand markets, including Midland, Cushing, Houston and Corpus Christi. As designed, Delta will have the capacity to batch both crude and condensate, and initially transport over 200,000 barrels per day. A binding open season is anticipated during summer 2016, and Delta is expected to be operational in third quarter of 2018.

Ex-Dividend Reminder: Crestwood Midstream Partners, Capital Product Partners and Regency Energy Partners

Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at
Dividend
Channel

, on 2/4/15, Crestwood Midstream Partners LP (Symbol: CMLP),
Capital Product Partners L.P. (Symbol: CPLP), and Regency Energy
Partners LP (Symbol: RGP) will all trade ex-dividend for their
respective upcoming dividends. Crestwood Midstream Partners LP will
pay its quarterly dividend of $0.41 on 2/13/15, Capital Product
Partners L.P. will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.2325 on
2/13/15, and Regency Energy Partners LP will pay its quarterly
dividend of $0.5025 on 2/13/15. As a percentage of CMLP's recent
stock price of $15.28, this dividend works out to approximately
2.68%, so look for shares of Crestwood Midstream Partners LP to
trade 2.68% lower - all else being equal - when CMLP shares open
for trading on 2/4/15. Similarly, investors should look for CPLP to
open 2.53% lower in price and for RGP to open 1.92% lower, all else
being equal.



Below are dividend history charts for CMLP, CPLP, and RGP, showing
historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared.


Crestwood Midstream Partners LP (Symbol: CMLP)

:






Capital Product Partners L.P. (Symbol: CPLP)

:








Regency Energy Partners LP (Symbol: RGP)

:









In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups
and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due
diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going
forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability
over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent
dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do
continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be
10.73% for Crestwood Midstream Partners LP , 10.12% for Capital
Product Partners L.P., and 7.66% for Regency Energy Partners LP.



In Monday trading, Crestwood Midstream Partners LP shares are
currently down about 0.5%, Capital Product Partners L.P. shares are
up about 0.3%, and Regency Energy Partners LP shares are up about
2.3% on the day.
