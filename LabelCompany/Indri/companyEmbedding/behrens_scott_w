Howard Behrens Art Prints
Expressionist Howard Behrens is America’s leading palette knife artist. An avid traveler, he captures the radiant essence of the world’s most romantic destinations through shadow, light and color. Influenced by Monet and Van Gogh, among others, Behrens is also adept at integrating the spontaneity of Impressionists. Behrens has held over 150 one-man shows and he was an official artist of the 2002 Winter Olympics.

Frame and Mat Options
All of the frames at FulcrumGallery are individually fit per order.  Each frame has a different quality but those with wider 
			depths and widths tend to be more sturdy.  For larger pieces of art, choose a thicker frame to ensure quality and satisfaction.  For a small piece of 
			framed art, selecting a thinner, smaller frame is a great lightweight solution that won't overpower your art masterpiece.  We've sorted our frames by 
			color below for your convenience.  Please be sure to read the frame description for your frame choice to get details on the depth, width and material.  
			For any other specific questions on our frames, please contact Customer Service at 
1-800-644-1278 or via email at 
			support@fulcrumgallery.com.  All artwork purchases are backed by our 100% Satisfaction Guarantee and 
			come with a 30-Day Return Policy.

Summer Art
Like a breath of fresh air, summer art and wall decor infuses color and beauty over winter-clad rooms.  And the good news is that you don’t have to change everything to give your room a fresh look. Adding a few key summer art pieces with fun, pictures of summer may be all you need.  Not only can it pull the room together, but choice framed art or art on canvas creates a style uniquely your own.  
Consider pictures of breathtaking beach scenes, irresistible summer flower prints, spectacular sunset photos, or calming summer framed art.  Even bright and funky abstract prints look great in a summer themed room.  Stay consistent with your color scheme, but don’t be afraid to try a different angle. For example, brighten neutral and subdued color walls by adding art with yellows, reds, and other coordinating colors.  Think about the mood you’re creating in the room.
