(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  Overview  Table of Contents   Home Entertainment. Home Entertainment revenues are derived from the sale or rental of our film productions and acquired or licensed films (including theatrical and direct-to-video releases) and certain television programs, to retail stores and through digital media platforms. In addition, we have revenue sharing arrangements with certain digital media platforms which generally provide that, in exchange for a nominal or no upfront sales price, we share in the rental or sales revenues generated by the platform on a title-by-title basis. We categorize our Home Entertainment revenue as follows:   Packaged media revenue: Packaged media revenue consists of the sale or rental of DVDs and Blu-ray discs. Digital media revenue: Digital media revenue consists of revenues generated from pay-per-view and video-on-demand platforms, electronic sell-through ("EST"), and digital rental. Television. Television revenues are primarily derived from the licensing of our theatrical productions and acquired films to the domestic cable, satellite, and free and pay television markets. International. International revenues are derived from the licensing of our productions, acquired films, our catalog product and libraries of acquired titles from our international subsidiaries, and revenues from our distribution to international sub-distributors, on a territory-by-territory basis. International revenues also includes revenues from the direct distribution of our productions, acquired films, and our catalog product and libraries of acquired titles in the United Kingdom. Motion Pictures - Other. Other revenues are derived from, among others, our interactive ventures and games division, our global franchise management and strategic partnerships division, the sales and licensing of music from the theatrical exhibition of our films and the television broadcast of our productions, and from the licensing of our films and television programs to ancillary markets.  Television Production. Our Television Production segment includes revenues derived from the following:   International. International television revenues are derived from the licensing and syndication to international markets of one-hour and half-hour series, television movies, mini-series and non-fiction programming.   Home Entertainment. Home entertainment revenues are derived from the sale or rental of television production movies or series to retail stores and through digital media platforms. Home entertainment revenue consists of packaged media revenue and digital media revenue.   Television Production - Other. Other revenues are derived from, among others, product integration in our television episodes and programs, the sales and licensing of music from the television broadcasts of our productions, and from the licensing of our television programs to ancillary markets. For additional information, see Motion Pictures - Other above.  Expenses  Table of Contents  General and administration expenses include salaries and other overhead.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Table of Contents  Revenue Recognition. Revenue from the theatrical release of feature films is recognized at the time of exhibition based on our participation in box office receipts. Revenue from the sale of DVDs and Blu-ray discs in the retail market, net of an allowance for estimated returns and other allowances, is recognized on the later of receipt by the customer or "street date" (when it is available for sale by the customer). Under revenue sharing arrangements, including digital and EST arrangements, such as download-to-own, download-to-rent, video-on-demand, and subscription video-on-demand, revenue is recognized when we are entitled to receipts and such receipts are determinable. Revenues from television or digital licensing for fixed fees are recognized when the feature film or television program is available to the licensee for telecast. For television licenses that include separate availability "windows" during the license period, revenue is allocated over the "windows." Revenue from sales to international territories are recognized when access to the feature film or television program has been granted or delivery has occurred, as required under the sales contract, and the right to exploit the feature film or television program has commenced. For multiple media rights contracts with a fee for a single film or television program where the contract provides for media holdbacks (defined as contractual media release restrictions), the fee is allocated to the various media based on our assessment of the relative fair value of the rights to exploit each media and is recognized as each holdback is released. For multiple-title contracts with a fee, the fee is allocated on a title-by-title basis, based on our assessment of the relative fair value of each title. The primary estimate requiring the most subjectivity and judgment involving revenue recognition is the estimate of sales returns associated with our revenue from the sale of DVDs/Blu-ray discs in the retail market which is discussed separately below under the caption "Sales Returns Allowance." Sales Returns Allowance. Revenues are recorded net of estimated returns and other allowances. We estimate reserves for DVD/Blu-ray returns based on previous returns experience, point-of-sale data available from certain retailers, current economic trends, and projected future sales of the title to the consumer based on the actual performance of similar titles on a title-by-title basis in each of the DVD/Blu-ray businesses. Factors affecting actual returns include, among other factors, limited retail shelf space at various times of the year, success of advertising or other sales promotions, and the near term release of competing titles. We believe that our estimates have been materially accurate in the past; however, due to the judgment involved in establishing reserves, we may have adjustments to our historical estimates in the future. Our estimate of future returns affects reported revenue and operating income. If we underestimate the impact of future returns in a particular period, then we may record less revenue in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amounts. If we overestimate the impact of future returns in a particular period, then we may record additional revenue in later periods when returns are less than estimated. An incremental change of 1% in our estimated sales returns rate (i.e., provisions for returns divided by gross sales of related product) for home entertainment products would have had an impact of approximately $1.3 million and $3.2 million on our total revenue in the three and nine months ended December 31, 2015 (2014  Table of Contents  Our quarterly income tax provision (benefit) and our corresponding annual effective tax rate are based on expected income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. For interim financial reporting, except in circumstances as described in the following paragraph, we estimate the annual effective tax rate based on projected taxable income for the full year and record a quarterly tax provision in accordance with the expected annual effective tax rate. As the year progresses, we refine the estimates of the year's taxable income as new information becomes available, including year-to-date financial results. This continual estimation process often results in a change to our expected annual effective tax rate for the year. When this occurs, we adjust our income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year-to-date income tax provision reflects the expected annual effective tax rate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions.  When a small change in our estimated pretax results would create a large change in our expected annual effective rate such that a reliable estimate of the expected annual effective tax rate cannot be made, as was the case for the quarter ended December 31, 2015, we calculate the income tax provision (benefit) using the cut-off method.  Consolidation. We consolidate entities in which we own more than 50% of the voting common stock and control operations and also variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. Investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own more than 20% of the voting common stock or otherwise exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, but not control of the nonconsolidated affiliate, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own less than 20% of the voting common stock are accounted for using the cost method of accounting.  Business Combinations. We account for our business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recognized and measured as of the acquisition date at fair value. Goodwill is recognized to the extent by which the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree exceeds the recognized basis of the identifiable assets acquired, net of assumed liabilities. Determining the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest requires management's judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash flows, discount rates and asset lives among other items.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  Table of Contents  In September 2015, the FASB issued new guidance on adjustments to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination, which are currently recognized on a retrospective basis. Under the new requirements, adjustments will be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined. The effects of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income arising from changes to the provisional amounts, if any, are included in earnings of the reporting period in which the adjustments to the provisional amounts are determined. An entity is also required to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The guidance is effective for our fiscal year beginning April 1, 2016, with early adoption permitted, and is required to be implemented on a prospective basis. We adopted the new guidance effective October 1, 2015, and it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.  Table of Contents  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Three Months Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Three Months Ended December 31, 2014   Three Months Ended December 31, 2015 2014 Increase (Decrease) % of Segment % of Segment Amount Revenues Amount Revenues Amount Percent (Amounts in millions) . . .

Item
8.01.     Other Events.

 

This
Current Report on Form 8-K is being filed in connection with a
stipulation of settlement (the “Stipulation”) regarding
the settlement of certain litigation relating to the proposed
merger (the “Merger”) of Orion Arm Acquisition Inc.
(“Merger Sub”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Lions Gate
Entertainment Corp. (“Lions Gate”), with and into
Starz, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
June 30, 2016, by and among Lions Gate, Starz and Merger Sub (as
amended, the “Merger Agreement”).

 

The
litigation to which the Stipulation relates is a purported class
action lawsuit, captioned Levy v. Malone, et al ., Index No.
607759/2016 (the “Action”), filed on October 7, 2016 in
New York state court by a purported Lions Gate stockholder against
Lions Gate and the members of its board of directors. The Action
alleges, among other things, that the members of the Lions Gate
board of directors breached fiduciary duties owed to Lions Gate
stockholders and/or aided and abetted breaches of fiduciary duties
by others in connection with the proposed Merger, and that Lions
Gate and the members of its board of directors failed to disclose
material information in the joint proxy statement/prospectus filed
on September 7, 2016 on Form S-4 in connection with the proposed
Merger.

 

On
November 23, 2016, Lions Gate and the other defendants in the
Action entered into the Stipulation with the plaintiff providing
for the settlement of the Action. The Stipulation contemplates,
among other things, that Lions Gate will make certain supplemental
disclosures relating to the proposed Merger, all of which are set
forth below. Although Lions Gate and the other defendants deny the
allegations made in the Action and believe that no supplemental
disclosure is required under applicable laws, in order to avoid the
burden and expense of further litigation, Lions Gate agreed to make
such supplemental disclosures pursuant to the terms of the
Stipulation.

 

The
Stipulation is subject to customary conditions, including court
approval following notice to Lions Gate’s stockholders. A
hearing will be scheduled at which the New York state court will
consider the fairness, reasonableness and adequacy of the
settlement. If the settlement is finally approved by the court, it
will resolve and release all claims by stockholders of Lions Gate
challenging any aspect of the proposed Merger, the Merger Agreement
and any disclosure made in connection therewith, pursuant to terms
that will be disclosed to stockholders prior to final approval of
the settlement. There can be no assurance that the court will
approve the settlement contemplated by the Stipulation. In such
event, the proposed settlement as contemplated by the Stipulation
may be terminated and the defendants would continue to vigorously
defend against the allegations in the Action.

 

SUPPLEMENTAL
DISCLOSURES

 

The
following information supplements the definitive joint proxy
statement/prospectus dated November 4, 2016 (the “Proxy
Statement”) and should be read in conjunction with the Proxy
Statement, which should be read in its entirety. Terms used below
have the meanings set forth in the Proxy Statement.

 

The
following information supplements the disclosure on page 46 of the
Proxy Statement:

 

The
Strategic Advisory Committee is a standing committee of the Lions
Gate board of directors. Messrs. Crawford, Rachesky and Simmons
have been members of the Strategic Advisory Committee since 2013,
2010, and 2008, respectively, and were selected to serve on the
committee at such times due to their expertise and skill in
evaluating strategic and financing opportunities for Lions Gate.
Issues discussed at the September 3, 2014 meeting of the Strategic
Advisory Committee of the Lions Gate board of directors included,
but were not limited to, the current market environment with
respect to potential opportunities available to Lions Gate, given
significant consolidation in distribution and content production in
the industry; the benefits of acquiring Starz; financial and
strategic considerations relating to a proposed acquisition of
Starz; regulatory approvals required for a potential acquisition of
Starz; and the terms of the draft preliminary non-binding proposal
to Starz.

 

The
following information supplements the disclosure on page 76 of the
Proxy Statement:

 

In
addition, a discretionary fee may be payable to PJT Partners at the
discretion of Lions Gate, taking into consideration, among other
factors, PJT Partners’ quality of work, value added, and
contribution towards a successful outcome, as well as any change in
scope of PJT Partners’ engagement.

 

 




 



 




  

 

The
following information supplements the disclosure on page 77 of the
Proxy Statement:

 

In the
ordinary course of business, PJT Partners and its affiliates may
actively trade the securities, or related derivative securities, or
financial instruments of Lions Gate, Starz and their respective
affiliates, for its own account and for the accounts of its
customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short
position in such securities or instruments. As of June 30, 2016,
the date PJT Partners rendered its opinion to the Lions Gate board
of directors, PJT Partners did not hold any securities, related
derivative securities, or financial instruments of Lions Gate,
Starz or their respective affiliates, for its own account or the
account of any customer.

 

The
following information supplements the disclosure on page 80 of the
Proxy Statement:

 

PJT
Partners also performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the
expected synergies (both expected operating savings and expected
financial savings) of the merger. In performing this analysis, PJT
Partners calculated estimated present value of the annual after-tax
operating and financial synergies, net of the cost to achieve such
synergies (estimated by Lions Gate and Starz management to be $25
million over two years), referred to as net synergies in this
discussion of PJT Partners’ opinion, for the period from
fiscal year 2017 through fiscal year 2021. The terminal value of
the net operating synergies at the end of the forecast
period was estimated by using terminal value multiples ranging
from 8.5x to 10.0x and the terminal value of the net financial
synergies was estimated assuming a zero perpetual growth rate. The
net operating synergies and terminal values were then discounted to
present value using discount rates ranging from 7.0% to 8.0%, which
range was selected using the methodologies and assumptions
described above, and the net financial synergies were discounted to
present value using discount rates ranging from 8.5% to 9.5%. This
range of discount rates was determined based on PJT Partners’
analysis of Starz’s estimated cost of equity. Based on the
discounted cash flow analyses PJT Partners performed on Starz and
the synergies, PJT Partners calc

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  Overview  Starz Transaction  Table of Contents  On October 27, 2016, the Company closed a private offering of $520 million of senior notes due 2024 (the "5.875% Notes"). The 5.875% Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.875% per annum. The 5.875% Notes replace the $520 million unsecured bridge facility mentioned in the preceding paragraph.  Table of Contents  when it would otherwise be required because of a failure to receive the debt financing and (4) a termination fee of $175 million if (a) an alternative transaction proposal is made to Lions Gate, (b) thereafter the Merger Agreement is terminated (i) by either party for failure to consummate the Merger by the outside date (at such time as Lions Gate's stockholders have failed to approve the transactions and such termination does not result in the payment of a termination fee by Starz), (ii) by either party because Lions Gate's stockholders fail to approve the transactions or (iii) by Starz because Lions Gate has breached its representations or covenants in a way that prevents satisfaction of a closing condition, subject to a cure period, and (c) within 18 months of such termination, Lions Gate enters into or consummates an alternative transaction.   Home Entertainment. Home Entertainment revenues are derived from the sale or rental of our film productions and acquired or licensed films and certain television programs (including theatrical and direct-to-video releases) on packaged media and through digital media platforms. In addition, we have revenue sharing arrangements with certain digital media platforms which generally provide that, in exchange for a nominal or no upfront sales price, we share in the rental or sales revenues generated by the platform on a title-by-title basis. We categorize our Home Entertainment revenue as follows:   Packaged media revenue: Packaged media revenue consists of the sale or rental of DVDs and Blu-ray discs. Digital media revenue: Digital media revenue consists of revenues generated from pay-per-view and video-on-demand platforms, electronic sell-through ("EST"), and digital rental. Television. Television revenues are primarily derived from the licensing of our theatrical productions and acquired films to the linear pay, basic cable and free television markets. International. International revenues are derived from the licensing of our productions, acquired films, our catalog product and libraries of acquired titles from our international subsidiaries to international distributors, on a territory-by-territory basis. International revenues also includes revenues from the direct distribution of our productions, acquired films, and our catalog product and libraries of acquired titles in the United Kingdom. Motion Pictures - Other. Other revenues are derived from, among others, our interactive ventures and games division, our global franchise management and strategic partnerships division (which includes location-based entertainment), the sales and licensing of music from the theatrical exhibition of our films and the television broadcast of our productions, and from the licensing of our films and television programs to ancillary markets.  Television Production   International. International revenues are derived from the licensing and syndication to international markets of one-hour and half-hour scripted and unscripted series, television movies, mini-series and non-fiction programming.  Table of Contents   Home Entertainment. Home entertainment revenues are derived from the sale or rental of television production movies or series on packaged media and through digital media platforms. Home entertainment revenue consists of packaged media revenue and digital media revenue.   Television Production - Other. Other revenues are derived from, among others, product integration in our television episodes and programs, the sales and licensing of music from the television broadcasts of our productions, and from the licensing of our television programs to ancillary markets.  Expenses  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Table of Contents  in the normal course of our business, some films and titles are more successful than anticipated and some are less successful than anticipated. Our management regularly reviews and revises when necessary its ultimate revenue and cost estimates, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization of film costs and participations and residuals and/or write-down of all or a portion of the unamortized costs of the film or television program to its estimated fair value. Our management estimates the ultimate revenue based on experience with similar titles or title genre, the general public appeal of the cast, actual performance (when available) at the box office or in markets currently being exploited, and other factors such as the quality and acceptance of motion pictures or programs that our competitors release into the marketplace at or near the same time, critical reviews, general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors, many of which we do not control and which may change.  Table of Contents  total revenue in the three and six months ended September 30, 2016, respectively (2015 - $1.3 million and $2.2 million, respectively).
