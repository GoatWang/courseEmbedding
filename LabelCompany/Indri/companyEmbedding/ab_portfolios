The performance shown represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance information shown. The investment return and principal value of an investment in the Portfolio will fluctuate, so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes.
Performance for AB Sustainable Global Thematic Fund reflects a 4.33% increase in NAV on June 8, 2016 for all share classes as a result of the Fund recording a receivable on its books and records in connection with the distribution by the Alliance Fair Fund.   

Performance for AB Large Cap Growth Fund reflects a 0.38% increase in NAV on June 8, 2016 for all share classes as a result of the Fund recording a receivable on its books and records in connection with the distribution by the Alliance Fair Fund.   

Performance for AB Growth and Income Fund reflects a 0.18% increase in NAV on June 8, 2016 for all share classes as a result of the Fund recording a receivable on its books and records in connection with the distribution by the Alliance Fair Fund.   

Performance for AB Discovery Growth Fund reflects a 0.13% increase in NAV on June 8, 2016 for all share classes as a result of the Fund recording a receivable on its books and records in connection with the distribution by the Alliance Fair Fund.   

Performance for AB Growth Fund reflects a 0.22% increase in NAV on June 8, 2016 for all share classes as a result of the Fund recording a receivable on its books and records in connection with the distribution by the Alliance Fair Fund.   

Net Expense Ratio reflects the Adviser’s contractual waiver of a portion of its advisory fee and/or reimbursement of a portion of the Fund’s operating expenses.  This waiver and/or reimbursement extends through a particular date as specified in the Fund’s current prospectus, and may be further extended or terminated by the Adviser as set forth in the prospectus.  Absent waivers and/or reimbursements, performance would have been lower.


Performance for Classes R, K, I, Z and Advisor shares prior to the share class’ inception date is simulated based on the historical performance of the Class A shares, adjusted for typical estimated expenses. Please note the inception dates for the Funds. As of January 31, 2009, Class B shares are no longer available for purchase by new investors. For additional information, see the Fund’s current prospectus.

If applicable, please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.
Fund returns are annualized for periods longer than one year. The NAV does not take into account any sales charges that may apply when shares are purchased or redeemed; if sales charges were reflected, the Fund’s quoted performance would be lower. Class A annualized returns with sales charge reflect the deduction of the maximum sales charge: 3.00% for municipal fixed income funds; 4.25% for all other funds. Prior to October 1, 2009 the maximum front-end sales charge for Class A shares of the municipal fixed income funds was 4.25%. If the Class A annualized returns for the municipal income funds reflected the deduction of the former maximum sales charge, their returns would be lower. Class B shares of Equity Funds and the Unconstrained Bond Fund are subject to a contingent deferred sales charge equal to 4% in year 1, 3% in year 2, 2% in year 3, and 1% in year 4 (or, for Fixed Income Funds, except Unconstrained Bond, 3% in year 1, 2% in year 2 and 1% in year 3). Class C shares of all Funds are subject to a 1-year, 1% contingent deferred sales charge. Returns for Advisor Class, Class R, Class K, Class Z, Class I and Class 2 are at NAV and carry no front-end or contingent deferred sales charges. Returns for Class R shares are without the imposition of a sales charge that would apply if shares were purchased outside of a group retirement plan.



The net asset value (NAV) price is the value of one share of the Portfolio as of the date listed. The NAV does not take into account any initial sales charges that may apply when shares are purchased or redemption charges when shares are sold; if these sales charges were reflected, the Portfolio's quoted performance would be lower. The NAV change is the change in value of one share of the Portfolio from the prior day's value.

Distribution yield is calculated on a 30-day rolling basis by annualizing the average of the dividends distributed over the most recent 30 day period, and dividing that figure by the current NAV. For the AB Bond Inflation Strategy Fund and the AB Municipal Bond Inflation Strategy Fund, distribution yield is calculated by annualizing the most recent monthly dividend distribution and dividing that figure by the current NAV. The distribution yield calculation does not include long-term or short-term capital gains distributions.
A Word About Risk: Because each Fund pursues its own unique investment objectives, each Fund has its own set of risks which are fully discussed in its prospectus. In order to achieve their investment objectives, some Funds may at times use certain types of investment derivatives, such as options, futures, forwards and swaps. These instruments involve risks different from, and in certain cases, greater than, the risks presented by more traditional investments. For Funds that can invest in foreign securities, which may include emerging markets securities, risks may be magnified due to changes in foreign exchange rates and the possibility of substantial volatility due to political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries. Portfolios that hold a smaller number of securities may be more volatile than more diversified portfolios. 
Funds that invest in small-cap and mid-cap stocks are often more volatile than large-cap stocks—smaller companies generally face higher risks due to their limited product lines, markets and financial resources. Funds that invest in real estate are subject to a variety of factors affecting the real estate market, such as economic conditions, mortgage rates and availability, which can cause the value of such investments to decline. REITs may have additional risks due to limited diversification and the impact of tax law changes.
Funds that invest in fixed income securities are subject to decreasing bond prices as interest rates rise and increasing bond prices as interest rates fall. The values of mortgage related securities and asset-backed securities are particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates due to prepayment risk. In addition, a bond’s credit rating reflects the issuer’s ability to make timely payments of interest or principal—the lower the rating, the higher the risk of default. If the issuer’s financial strength deteriorates, the issuer’s rating may be lowered and the bond’s value may decline. Funds that invest in debt securities issued by state or local governments may be subject to special political, legal, economic and market factors that can have a significant effect on the portfolio’s yield or value.
Lipper rankings are based on total returns at net asset value, without the imposition of a sales charge which would reduce total return figures.

Lipper averages represent the average returns of funds contained in the Lipper universe. Funds in the Lipper averages generally have similar investment objectives to the Funds, although some may have different investment policies. Investors can’t invest directly in indices or averages, and their returns don’t represent the performance of any AllianceBernstein mutual fund.
Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund/Portfolio carefully before investing. For copies of our prospectus or summary prospectus, which contain this and other information, click here or contact your AB representative. Please read the prospectus and/or summary prospectus carefully before investing. 

AllianceBernstein Investments, Inc. (ABI) is the distributor of the AB family of mutual funds. ABI is a member of  FINRA  and is an affiliate of AllianceBernstein L.P., the manager of the funds.

The annualized asset-based fees for each of the Education Strategies portfolios is based on each portfolio’s total estimated operating expenses plus a weighted average of the expense ratios of the mutual funds in which it invests. Each Education Strategies portfolio’s actual expenses may be higher or lower depending on its actual operating expenses, its allocation percentages among various mutual funds (for the Age-Based and Fixed Allocation portfolios), and the actual expenses of the underlying mutual funds, each of which is likely to change over time.

Portfolio returns are annualized for periods longer than one year.  The NAV does not take into account any initial sales charges that may apply when shares are purchased or redemption charges when shares are sold; if these sales charges were reflected, the Portfolio’s quoted performance would be lower.

If applicable, please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.

Sales Charges: 1y, 3y, 5y, 10y and Since Inception returns include fees, expenses and reinvested distributions and payment of the maximum initial sales charge or contingent redemption charge. The maximum initial sales charge applicable to Alternative A (Class A) shares is 4.25%. The redemption charge applicable to Alternative B (Class B) shares varies according to the number of years from the time a contribution was made until its withdrawal as follows: year one, 4%; year two, 3%; year three, 2%; year four, 1%; year five or later, 0%. The redemption charge applicable to Alternative C (Class C) shares is 1% for the first year after a contribution is made. The maximum initial sales charge applicable to Alternative RZ (Class RZ) shares is 4.00%.

The performance for Class RI shares prior to 8/27/10, the share class’s inception date, reflects Class R share performance, adjusted for differences in total annual asset-based fees. The inception date for Class R shares is referenced in the table above.
If you are invested in an Age-Based Portfolio, please refer to the performance of the portfolio that corresponds with the beneficiary’s date of birth.

Special note: The share class designation for accounts established prior to February 8, 2002 as well as certain accounts established after February 8, 2002 has changed. These “old” A, B and C share classes have been renamed AX, BX and CX, respectively. Please refer to your most recent account statement or contact CollegeBoundfund at (888) 324-5057 to determine which class of shares you own.
Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of CollegeBoundfund carefully before investing. For a copy of the Program Description, which contains this and other information, click here, or call your financial representative or AB at (888) 324-5057. Please read the Program Description carefully before investing.

If you are not a Rhode Island resident or if you have taxable income in another state, please note that depending on the laws of your or your beneficiary’s home state, favorable state tax treatment or other benefits offered by such a home state for investing in 529 college savings plans may be available only for investments in the home state’s 529 plan. Any state-based benefit offered with respect to this plan should be one of many appropriately weighted factors to be considered before making an investment decision. Please consult your financial, tax or other adviser to learn more about how state-based benefits (including any limitations) would apply to your specific circumstances. You may also wish to contact your home state or another state’s 529 plan to learn more about its features, benefits and limitations before investing. Statements in this material concerning taxation are not offered as individual tax advice.

The investments in CollegeBoundfund are not guaranteed by the State of Rhode Island, the office of the General Treasurer of Rhode Island, the Rhode Island State Investment Commission (which oversees the investments of the assets of CollegeBoundfund), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any instrumentality thereof. CollegeBoundfund is managed by AllianceBernstein L.P. and distributed by AllianceBernstein Investments, Inc., member FINRA.
Investors should consider many factors before deciding which 529 plan is most appropriate for their situation. Some of these include: the Plan’s investment options and the historical investment performance of these options, the Plan’s flexibility and features, the reputation and expertise of the Plan’s investment manager, Plan contribution limits and the federal and state tax benefits associated with an investment in the Plan. Some states, for example, offer favorable tax treatment and other benefits to their residents only if they invest in the state’s own qualified tuition program. Investors should consult with their financial and tax advisor before investing in any 529 plan or contact their state tax division for more information. 
AB mutual funds may be offered only to persons in the United States and by way of a prospectus. This website should not be considered a solicitation or offering of any investment products or services to investors residing outside of the United States. 


Net Expense Ratio reflects the Adviser’s contractual waiver of a portion of its advisory fee and/or reimbursement of a portion of the Fund’s operating expenses. This waiver and/or reimbursement extends through a particular date as specified in the Fund’s most recent Annual or Semi-Annual Shareholder Report. Absent waivers and/or reimbursements, performance would have been lower.

The Market Price is the price at which a Fund’s shares are traded on an exchange. Because a closed-end exchange-traded fund’s shares trade in the stock market based on investor demand, the fund may trade at a price higher or lower than its NAV. An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount that you invest. Your investment in a Fund's shares represents an indirect investment in the securities owned by the Fund, substantially all of which are traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter markets. The value of these securities, like other market investments, may move up or down, sometimes unpredictably. Your exchange-traded shares at any point in time may be worth less than your original investment, even after taking into account the reinvestment of Fund dividends and distributions.


A Word About Risk: Because each Fund pursues its own unique investment objectives, each Fund has its own set of risks. Fixed income Funds invest principally in bonds and other fixed income securities, in order to achieve their investment objectives, the Funds may at times use certain types of investment derivatives, such as options, futures, forwards and swaps. These instruments involve risks different from, and in certain cases, greater than, the risks presented by investments that are more traditional. Funds may at times use financial leverage for investment purposes. Leverage tries to enhance investment returns by borrowing money or using other leverage tools—magnify both gains and losses, resulting in greater volatility. The Funds may use Auction Rate Preferred Stocks as well as TOBs, which result in leverage and therefore higher risk. For Funds that can invest in foreign securities, which may include emerging markets securities, risks may be magnified due to changes in foreign exchange rates and the possibility of substantial volatility due to political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries.

AB 1305 and 2016 Carrier Product PortfoliosSeptember 9, 2016Catrina Reyes, J.D., M.P.A., Policy Analyst and Compliance ManagerAt the end of 2015, a number of carriers announced that they will be removing certain plans from their 2016 product portfolio due to the passage of Assembly Bill (AB) 1305 on October 8, 2015. AB 1305 provides that “an individual within a family shall not have a maximum out-of-pocket limit that is greater than the maximum out-of-pocket limit for individual coverage for that product.” If the plan “includes a deductible, an individual within a family shall not have a deductible that is greater than the deductible limit for individual coverage for that product.” If the plan is a high deductible health plan, the plan shall include a deductible for each individual covered by the family plan that is either the minimum annual deductible for family coverage established by the IRS for the applicable plan year or the deductible for individual coverage under the plan contract, whichever is greater.
It used to be that deductibles and maximum out-of-pocket limits for family coverage could be structured in two ways. Some plans have aggregate family deductibles and/or maximum out-of-pocket limits. This means the family deductible and/or maximum out-of-pocket limit must be met before the plan pays in part or in whole for covered services for any individual family member. For example, if a plan has a $6,500 maximum out-of-pocket limit for individual coverage and a $13,000 maximum out-of-pocket limit for family coverage, an individual in a family plan that incurs $8,000 in cost-sharing expenses would be responsible for paying the $8,000, because the $13,000 family maximum out-of-pocket limit has not yet been met.
In contrast, most other plans have individual embedded deductibles and maximum out-of-pocket limits for individuals enrolled in family coverage. Under this plan design, each covered family member only needs to meet the individual deductible and/or maximum out-of-pocket limit before the plan pays in part or in whole for covered services for that family member. Using the same example above, the individual in the family plan would only be responsible for the individual maximum out-of-pocket limit of $6,500 as opposed to having to meet the $13,000 family maximum out-of-pocket limit.
With the passage of AB 1305, all plans must now have individual embedded deductibles and out-of-pocket limits for individuals enrolled in family coverage, which is consistent with federal regulations. This change went into effect on January 1, 2016. The provisions related to deductibles will go into effect for large group market plans on January 1, 2017.
According to the Department of Managed Healthcare (DMHC), the Director of DMHC can exempt plans from compliance with AB 1305 “upon a showing by the plan that compliance with these provisions would be disruptive for enrollees and would cause unexpected cost share increases or health care service contract withdrawals. The Director’s exemption will be made on a product by product, case by case, basis, and will extend until December 31, 2016, requiring health care service contracts issued, amended or renewed on and after January 1, 2017 to comply with AB 1305.”
An analysis done by the California Health Benefits Review Program found that most of the health plans in California already have individual embedded deductibles and maximum out-of-pocket limits. Only a small number of high-deductible health plans have aggregate deductibles and maximum out-of-pocket limits and thus can no longer be offered unless exempted by DMHC.
To learn which plans have been removed by each carrier due to AB 1305 and which plans have been modified to comply with AB 1305, view our summary.

What is a 'Product Portfolio'
A product portfolio is the collection of all the products or services offered by a company. Product portfolio analysis can provide nuanced views on stock type, company growth prospects, profit margin drivers, income contributions, market leadership and operational risk. This is essential for investors conducting equity research by investors or analysts supporting internal corporate financial planning.!--break--Product portfolio is an important element of financial analysis, because it provides context and granularity. Investors can distinguish between long-term value stocks and short term growth opportunities. Portfolio analysis also allows investors to nail down specific drivers of financial performance, which is necessary for effective modeling.Product Portfolio and Mature CompaniesMature companies often have diversified product portfolios. Internal product development and acquisitions contribute to portfolio size over time, and larger enterprises have the infrastructure to support the marketing of a broader offering. Geographic expansion can also augment a product portfolio, with products varying in popularity among cities or countries. Diversification tends to limit growth potential while reducing downside risk, so mature firms tend to exhibit less operational volatility. This reduces the amount of speculation in equity valuation. The Proctor & Gamble Company is an example of such a company, with 65 different, well-known personal and household goods brands including Bounty, Crest and Tide.Product Portfolio and Growth CompaniesYounger firms with small portfolios are more exposed to the performance of their main products, which can lead to greater operational volatility. More risk and higher growth potential lead to more speculative equity valuation. The various components in a product portfolio often have disparate margins because they have different price dynamics, production costs or marketing demands.Portfolio and ProfitabilityThe various components of a portfolio also face different market dynamics and can contribute inconsistently to the bottom line. A firm's market share can vary among the parts of its offering, with more dominant products generally requiring different strategies than high-growth portions of the portfolio that are managed to gain share. Shifting sales mix can have significant consequences for the bottom line when margins vary across the portfolio.Companies often rebrand or restructure underperforming and unprofitable products, a strategy that requires portfolio analysis. Products that contribute the most income are generally the most important for short-term financial analysis, and alterations to these flagship elements of the portfolio impact performance more substantially. Apple, Inc., is known for offering several electronic devices, but the iPhone is the most important driver of top line and bottom line results. The smartphone contributed nearly 67% of total company sales as of July 2016, meaning its performance is more meaningful than that of the laptops, the iPad or the App Store.

What is Product portfolio - Product portfolio explained

Home » Marketing management articles » What is Product portfolioWhat is Product portfolio
By Hitesh Bhasin April 14, 2017 







A product portfolio is comprised of all the products which an organization has. A product portfolio may comprise of different categories of products, different product lines and finally the individual product itself. Management is needed on all the three levels of a product portfolio. You need managers for managing individual products, managing product lines and finally the top level management which manages the complete portfolio.


Lets look at an organization from a macro angle. An organization is comprised of a number of different departments, all focused towards one goal – the betterment of the organization. In the same manner, your product portfolio should be such that each and every product in the portfolio is focused towards one goal – Bringing the organization on top by optimally using the resources available.
As an organization is comprised of different products, it becomes difficult to manage all of them. Thus there needs to be a hierarchy. This is where product portfolio management steps in.
How do we classify the products in a product portfolio?
Product classification is done on the basis of the BCG matrix. The BCG matrix classifies products on the basis of the market share of the product as well as the growth rate which a product may have. On the basis of this classification, a product manager can decide what level of investments a particular product might need and what would be the returns from such a product. As the other goal of product portfolio management is cash flow management, the BCG matrix propagates balancing the cash flow between all products equally. In harsh words –  no extra revenue should be given to products which cant give the revenue back to the organization.







The number of products you have today determines the strength of your organization tomorrow. This is why the field of product portfolio management is gaining importance. Although product portfolio management is not an important task for small businessmen, portfolio management is a must for enterprises and it leads to a strong organization with planned goals and optimum resource allocation.

Hitesh Bhasin says 


These are two very different things and a corporate needs both. Product portfolio is needed to have multiple products in the product line and therefore to capture a higher market share. A Customer portfolio on the other hand constitutes of your most important customers or customers who can give you the most business. Product portfolio is from the Marketing and strategy point of view whereas Customer portfolio comes from the Sales and Selling point of view. So a corporate needs both – customer portfolio and product portfolio. The corporate which is strong in both will likely be one of the leading corporates in its industry.

durability and quiet, reliable operation make Bindertek�s One Touch 3-ring binders superior to the competition. These sturdy but attractive binders are easy to use, with a fluid one-touch mechanism that opens and closes smoothly. 

Our 3-ring binders use D-rings, so the pages align correctly and close securely without snagging, and also have steel-reinforced edges to withstand years of wear and use.

But for all their practicality, One Touch 3-ring binders have a sense of style. The Classic One-Touch binders feature linen-textured covers, while our elegant Barrister Binders look right at home on any law firm�s bookshelf. Our One-Touch View Binders have a clear non-stick front cover and spine that you can personalize with your own inserts.

The portfolio that's best for a job interview or client presentation might not be suited to the wear and tear of everyday use.
