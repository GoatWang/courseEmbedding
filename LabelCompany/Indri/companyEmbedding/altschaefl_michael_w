			Michael W. Altschaefl, 58, was appointed as our chief executive officer on May 25, 2017 and has served as a director since October 2009. Mr. Altschaefl has served as our board chair since August 2016. Prior to his appointment as our chief executive officer, Mr. Altschaefl served as the president of Still Water Partners, Inc., a private investment firm, since August 2013 and as president of E-S Plastic Products LLC, a custom manufacturer of plastic injection parts, since November 2013. In connection with his appointment as our chief executive officer, Mr. Altschaefl transitioned to the role of chairman at both Still Water Partners, Inc. and E-S Plastic Products LLC. Previously, Mr. Altschaefl served as the vice president-strategy and business development of Shiloh Industries, Inc., a public company and leading independent manufacturer of advanced metal product solutions for high volume applications in the North American automotive, heavy truck, trailer and consumer markets from January 2013 until October 2013. Mr. Altschaefl was an owner and chief executive officer of Albany-Chicago Company LLC, a custom die cast and machined components company when Shiloh Industries purchased the company in December 2012. Mr. Altschaefl is a certified public accountant. Prior to acquiring Albany-Chicago Company LLC in 2008, Mr. Altschaefl worked for 27 years with two international independent registered public accounting firms, including 16 years as a partner. We believe that Mr. Altschaefl's experience in leadership positions at manufacturing companies and his background as an accountant qualify him for service as our chief executive officer, director and board chair.
