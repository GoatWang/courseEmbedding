			Scott S. Ingraham has served as a member of our Board since February 2012 and as a member of our Audit Committee and our Nominating and Governance Committee since February 2012. Mr. Ingraham is presently the co-founder and Principal of Zuma Capital, Inc., a private investment firm. He co-founded and served as the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Rent.com, an Internet residential real estate listing site, from 1999 until its acquisition by eBay in February 2005. Prior to founding Rent.com, Mr. Ingraham was the CEO, president and co-founder of Oasis Residential, a NYSE-traded apartment REIT which merged into Camden Property Trust in 1998. Mr. Ingraham is on the Board of Trust Managers of Camden Property Trust, a real estate investment trust focused on the development and ownership of apartment properties. Camden Property Trust is one our larger customers. Mr. Ingraham also serves as a director of Kilroy Realty Corporation, a publicly held real estate investment trust focused on the development and ownership of office and industrial properties. Mr. Ingraham served as a director of Loopnet, a wholly owned subsidiary of CoStar Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSGP), from August 2006 through April 2012. Mr. Ingraham graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a BBA in Finance. We believe Mr. Ingraham's qualifications to sit on our Board include his substantial financial and business expertise as the chief executive officer of several companies in the real estate industry and his significant experience serving on boards of other publicly traded companies.
