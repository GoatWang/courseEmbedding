          Company Information        













BioRestorative Therapies, Inc. (www.biorestorative.com) develops therapeutic products and medical therapies using cell and tissue protocols, primarily involving adult stem cells.  Our two core programs, as described below, relate to the treatment of disc/spine disease and metabolic disorders:
 
• Disc/Spine Program: Our lead cell therapy candidate, brtxDISC™ (Disc Implanted Stem Cells), is a product formulated from autologous (or a person’s own) cultured mesenchymal stem cells collected from the patient’s bone marrow. We intend that the product will be used for the non-surgical treatment of protruding and bulging lumbar discs in patients suffering from chronic lumbar disc disease. The treatment involves collecting a patient’s own stem cells, culturing and cryopreserving the cells, and then having a physician inject brtxDISC™ into the patient’s damaged disc in an outpatient procedure. The treatment is intended for patients whose pain has not been alleviated by non-invasive procedures and who potentially face the prospect of surgery.
• Metabolic Program (ThermoStem®): We are developing an allogeneic cell-based therapy to target obesity and metabolic disorders using brown adipose (fat) derived stem cells to generate brown adipose tissue (“BAT”). BAT is intended to mimic naturally occurring brown adipose depots that regulate metabolic homeostasis in humans. Initial preclinical research indicates that increased amounts of brown fat in the body may be responsible for additional caloric burning as well as reduced glucose and lipid levels. Researchers have found that people with higher levels of brown fat may have a reduced risk for obesity and diabetes.

Company Information  
BioRestorative Therapies, Inc. ("BRT"), develops products and medical therapies using cell and tissue protocols, primarily involving adult stem cells, including:
 
• brtxDISC™ (Disc Implanted Stem Cells), BRT’s lead therapeutic product, is a mesenchymal stem cell product derived from autologous human bone marrow. It is to be used in an investigational non-surgical treatment for protruding and bulging lumbar discs in patients suffering from chronic lumbar disc disease and is intended for patients who have failed non-invasive procedures and potentially face the prospect of surgery. The treatment, utilizing brtxDISC™, involves culturing a patient’s own stem cells and then delivering them to the damaged disc in an outpatient procedure.
 
• ThermoStem® is a treatment using brown fat stem cells that is under development for metabolic disorders including diabetes and obesity. Initial preclinical research indicates that increased amounts of brown fat in the body may be responsible for additional caloric burning as well as reduced glucose and lipid levels.

BioRestorative Therapies To Present At 6th Annual Marcum MicroCap Conference






GlobeNewswire



Jun 14, 2017 9:45 AM EDT













 


















































 MELVILLE, N.Y., June 14, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BioRestorative Therapies, Inc. ("BioRestorative" or the "Company") (OTCBB:BRTX), a life sciences company focused on stem cell-based therapies, today announced that Mark Weinreb, the Company's CEO, will present a Company overview at the 6 th Annual Marcum MicroCap Conference on Thursday, June 15, 2017 in New York City at the Grand Hyatt Hotel.  The Company's presentation is scheduled between 10:30-11:00 AM ET. BioRestorative Therapies, Inc. ( www.biorestorative.com ) develops therapeutic products using cell and tissue protocols, primarily involving adult stem cells.  The Company's two core programs relate to the treatment of disc/spine disease and metabolic disorders.  The Company has received clearance from the Food and Drug Administration to commence a Phase 2 clinical trial using BRTX-100, its lead cell therapy candidate, to treat chronic lower back pain due to degenerative disc disease related to protruding/bulging discs. The annual Marcum MicroCap Conference is a nationally recognized forum for publicly traded companies with less than $500 million in market capitalization to network with fund managers and high net worth investors who focus on small cap equities. Mark Weinreb, CEO of BioRestorative, commented about the Company's attendance, "The Marcum MicroCap Conference provides a welcome forum to highlight the exciting advancements in our Disc/Spine and Metabolic Programs.  We consider it a privilege to be selected to present the ongoing progress of our business."

BioRestorative Therapies Submits IND Application to FDA to Treat Patients with Degenerative Disc Disease




















January 09, 2017 09:45 ET

 | Source: BioRestorative Therapies, Inc.






MELVILLE, N.Y., Jan.  09, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BioRestorative Therapies, Inc. ("BRT" or the “Company") (OTCBB:BRTX), a life sciences company focused on stem cell-based therapies, today announced that it has submitted an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to seek clearance to commence a clinical trial using its lead cell therapy candidate, BRTX-100, to treat chronic lower back pain due to degenerative disc disease related to protruding/bulging discs. BRTX-100 is a product formulated using a patient’s own cell population (autologous), which consists of hypoxic cultured mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that are optimized for specific use for a non-surgical, conservative intradiscal procedure that can be performed in a physician’s office. "We are pleased to have this IND under review by the FDA," said Mark Weinreb, President and Chief Executive Officer of BioRestorative Therapies, “This marks the beginning of a new era for BRT as we look forward to entering the clinical phase of our cell therapy development.“ “The current non-surgical options, including physical therapy, steroids, and narcotic pain medication, provide limited relief of symptoms, and many patients are faced with disc/spine surgery as their only alternative for continued treatment. We believe that BRTX-100 has the potential to become the standard of care for the conservative, non-surgical treatment of protruding and bulging lumbar discs.” About BioRestorative Therapies, Inc. BioRestorative Therapies, Inc. (www.biorestorative.com) develops therapeutic products using cell and tissue protocols, primarily involving adult stem cells.  Our two core programs, as described below, relate to the treatment of disc/spine disease and metabolic disorders: • Disc/Spine Program (brtxDISC™): Our lead cell therapy candidate, BRTX-100, is a product formulated from autologous (or a person’s own) cultured mesenchymal stem cells collected from the patient’s bone marrow. We intend that the product will be used for the non-surgical treatment of protruding and bulging lumbar discs in patients suffering from chronic lumbar disc disease. The BRTX-100 production process involves collecting a patient’s bone marrow, isolating and culturing stem cells from the bone marrow and cryopreserving the cells.  In an outpatient procedure, BRTX-100 is to be injected by a physician into the patient’s damaged disc. The treatment is intended for patients whose pain has not been alleviated by non-invasive procedures and who potentially face the prospect of surgery. • Metabolic Program (ThermoStem®): We are developing a cell-based therapy to target obesity and metabolic disorders using brown adipose (fat) derived stem cells to generate brown adipose tissue (“BAT”). BAT is intended to mimic naturally occurring brown adipose depots that regulate metabolic homeostasis in humans.

BioRestorative Therapies, Inc. Announces Opening of New Headquarters 
      and Laboratory Facility in New York






April 14, 2015 07:45 AM Eastern Daylight Time



MELVILLE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BioRestorative Therapies, Inc. ("BRT" or “the Company”) (OTCBB:BRTX), a 
      life sciences company focused on adult stem cell-based therapies for 
      various personal medical applications, announced today that the Company 
      has relocated its corporate, administrative and laboratory operations to 
      Melville, Long Island, New York.
    


      The Company had previously announced a relocation incentive program 
      offered by New York State and Suffolk County that helped enable BRT to 
      establish a new facility in New York for its corporate headquarters and 
      cell biology laboratory. BRT has closed and vacated its former location 
      in Jupiter, Florida, and has commenced operations at its new location.
    

      In addition to consolidating corporate activities in one location, BRT 
      has established a new laboratory facility allowing for increased 
      capabilities for the further development of possible additional 
      cell-based treatments, products and protocols, stem cell-related 
      intellectual property and translational research applications. BRT 
      intends to expand its laboratory to include a cGMP (current Good 
      Manufacturing Practices) facility, within the new location, that will 
      enable the Company to formulate brtxDISC™, the Company’s lead 
      therapeutic product for its Disc/Spine program.
    

      “We are very excited to start laboratory operations in our new facility 
      to advance our research programs and begin preparations for the clinical 
      phase of our Disc/Spine program,” commented Mark Weinreb, BioRestorative 
      Therapies’ Chief Executive Officer. “We have begun speaking with many 
      local medical, scientific and academic institutions, and look forward to 
      establishing important collaborations and relationships on Long Island 
      and in the Tri-State area.”
    

About BioRestorative Therapies, Inc.


      BioRestorative Therapies, Inc. (www.biorestorative.com) 
      develops products and medical therapies using cell and tissue protocols, 
      primarily involving adult stem cells, including:
    


Disc/Spine Program: Our lead cell therapy 
        candidate, brtxDISC™ (Disc Implanted Stem 
        Cells), is a product formulated from autologous (or a person’s 
        own) cultured mesenchymal stem cells collected from the patient’s bone 
        marrow. We intend that the product will be used for the non-surgical 
        treatment of protruding and bulging lumbar discs in patients suffering 
        from chronic lumbar disc disease. The treatment involves 
        collecting a patient’s own stem cells, culturing and cryopreserving 
        the cells, and then having a physician inject brtxDISC™ 
        into the patient’s damaged disc in an outpatient procedure. The 
        treatment is intended for patients whose pain has not been alleviated 
        by non-invasive procedures and who potentially face the prospect of 
        surgery.
      

ThermoStem® Program: We 
        are developing an allogeneic cell-based therapy to target obesity and 
        metabolic disorders using brown adipose (fat) derived stem cells to 
        generate brown adipose tissue (“BAT”). BAT is intended to mimic 
        naturally occurring brown adipose depots that regulate metabolic 
        homeostasis in humans. Initial preclinical research indicates that 
        increased amounts of brown fat in the body may be responsible for 
        additional caloric burning as well as reduced glucose and lipid 
        levels. Researchers have found that people with higher levels of brown 
        fat may have a reduced risk for obesity and diabetes.

MELVILLE, N.Y., June  14, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BioRestorative Therapies, Inc. ("BioRestorative" or the “Company") (OTCBB:BRTX), a life sciences company focused on stem cell-based therapies, today announced that Mark Weinreb, the Company’s CEO, will present a Company overview at the 6th Annual Marcum MicroCap Conference on Thursday, June 15, 2017 in New York City at the Grand Hyatt Hotel.  The Company’s presentation is scheduled between 10:30-11:00 AM ET. BioRestorative Therapies, Inc. (www.biorestorative.com) develops therapeutic products using cell and tissue protocols, primarily involving adult stem cells.  The Company’s two core programs relate to the treatment of disc/spine disease and metabolic disorders.  The Company has received clearance from the Food and Drug Administration to commence a Phase 2 clinical trial using BRTX-100, its lead cell therapy candidate, to treat chronic lower back pain due to degenerative disc disease related to protruding/bulging discs. The annual Marcum MicroCap Conference is a nationally recognized forum for publicly traded companies with less than $500 million in market capitalization to network with fund managers and high net worth investors who focus on small cap equities. Mark Weinreb, CEO of BioRestorative, commented about the Company’s attendance, “The Marcum MicroCap Conference provides a welcome forum to highlight the exciting advancements in our Disc/Spine and Metabolic Programs.  We consider it a privilege to be selected to present the ongoing progress of our business.” About BioRestorative Therapies, Inc.
