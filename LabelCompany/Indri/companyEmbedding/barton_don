Our History


Barton is proud of its heritage and invites you to browse some key dates in the history of the company.
1948 - Whitstable Shipwright and boat builder Ron Barton establishes R.S.J. Barton. He was one of the first to use a fabric based laminated plastic called Tufnol and stainless steel to manufacture yachting blocks which were much lighter and stronger than previously achievable. 








1960 - Sees the introduction of GRP boats, bringing sailing to a larger audience. Demand for Barton's innovative, lightweight and cost effective products continues to grow. Ron realised that Tufnol was too labour intensive and costly so set about re-designing the entire Barton product range to become the first marine company to use a new plastic injection moulding process using revolutionary fibre glass reinforced plastic materials. RSJ Barton now becomes a limited company.

1988 - Barton attends the first METS trade fair in 1988, this proves to be the launch pad into the global marine market. Barton today supplies 35 distributors in 32 countries.

BARTON Abrasive Removal Tool – BART
Remove spent garnet abrasive easily with the BARTON Abrasive Removal Tool
 

The BARTON Abrasive Removal Tool – BART® has revolutionized the way our customers remove spent garnet from their waterjet equipment. First introduced in 2009, BART is an easy to use, inexpensive and totally portable garnet abrasive removal system. Since then, hundreds of waterjet operators have used this remarkably convenient, efficient, versatile, cost-effective piece of equipment.

Powered by a common pressure washer, the durable stainless steel BART Wand is designed to fit between the waterjet table’s slats and can be operated while the waterjet is running, reducing downtime for cleaning.
The BART system is:

Simple to assemble
Easy to operate
Convenient and portable for use on multiple machines
Effective – achieves garnet removal rates greater than 3,000 pounds an hour

No Downtime — Maximize Cutting
Simply place the BART Wand between the slats to pump garnet from the recovery tank while continuing to cut parts on the table.
Easy to Use
Simple to assemble and easy to operate—requires a 2.5 – 3.0 gpm, 2500 – 3000 psi pressure washer.
Efficient design combined with effective technology works hard so you don’t have to.
Low Maintenance
No moving parts, pumps or filters; a single wear part—the replaceable Jet Nozzle.
The garnet never comes in contact with the pressure washer; the abrasive media is pulled up the wand and discharged to a holding tank through the hose.
Portable—Use on Multiple Machines
Lightweight and portable, the system can be used on multiple machines.
 ® BART is a registered trademark of BARTON Mines Corporation
U.S and foreign patents pending
