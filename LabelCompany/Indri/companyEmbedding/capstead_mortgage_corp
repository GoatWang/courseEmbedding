Corporate Overview

Company Summary

Founded in 1985 and based in Dallas, Texas, Capstead is the oldest publicly-traded residential mortgage REIT.
Our sole focus is on managing a leveraged portfolio of short-duration* agency-guaranteed (i.e. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae) residential adjustable-rate mortgage ("ARM") securities that is appropriately hedged and can earn attractive risk-adjusted returns over the long term, with little, if any, credit risk.

Proven Strategy of Efficiently Managing a Leveraged Portfolio of Short-Duration Agency-Guaranteed ARM Securities
Our short-duration strategy differentiates us from our peers because the adjustable-rate mortgages underlying our portfolio reset to more current interest rates within a relatively short period of time:
    
allowing us to benefit from a potential recovery in financing spreads that typically contract during periods of rising interest rates, and 
resulting in smaller fluctuations in portfolio values from changes in interest rates compared to portfolios containing a significant amount of longer-duration ARM or fixed-rate mortgage securities.


By virtue of being internally-managed and with our sole focus on agency-guaranteed securities, we are arguably the most efficient mortgage REIT in the industry.

Experienced Management Team Aligned with Stockholders

Our top three executive officers have a combined 75 years of mortgage finance industry experience.
We are internally-managed with low operating costs and a strong focus on performance-based compensation.
This structure greatly enhances the alignment of management interests with those of our stockholders.

Straight-forward Investment Strategy and Transparent Reporting

This singular and straight-forward investment strategy, together with our use of cash flow hedge accounting allows for easily understood, transparent financial reporting, with limited use of non-GAAP financial measures.
Additional transparency is evident by virtue of our internally-managed structure – our compensation-related decisions and costs are fully disclosed and subject to annual say-on-pay approvals.
We make every effort to provide additional analysis in our earnings reports, SEC filings and analyst presentations that tells our story in a complete and straight-forward fashion.

* Duration is a measure of market price sensitivity to interest rate movements. A shorter duration generally indicates less interest rate risk.

        ($0.07)


Since year-end, book value decreased by $0.13, including $0.08 in 
        dividends in excess of earnings, which together with $0.42 in common 
        dividends produce an annualized economic return of 5.3%


Net interest margins declined by $4.3 million as benefits of 
        portfolio growth and higher cash yields were outstripped by higher 
        mortgage prepayment levels and higher borrowing costs


Agency-guaranteed residential ARM portfolio and leverage ended the 
        quarter at $13.60 billion and 9.27 times long-term investment capital, 
        respectively


Operating costs averaged 0.92% of long-term investment capital on 
        an annualized basis



Second Quarter Earnings and Related Discussion


      Capstead reported net income of $17.5 million or $0.14 per diluted 
      common share for the quarter ended June 30, 2017. This compares to net 
      income of $22.7 million or $0.20 per diluted common share for the 
      quarter ended March 31, 2017. The Company paid a second quarter 2017 
      dividend of $0.21 per common share on July 20, 2017.
    

      For the quarter ended June 30, 2017, Capstead reported net interest 
      margins of $20.6 million compared to $24.9 million for the quarter ended 
      March 31, 2017. The decrease in net interest margins was largely 
      attributable to the effects of higher mortgage prepayment levels and 
      higher borrowing costs. Higher borrowing costs were partially offset by 
      higher coupon interest rates on adjustable-rate mortgages underlying the 
      Company’s residential mortgage investments. The Company earns income 
      from investing in a leveraged portfolio of residential adjustable-rate 
      mortgage pass-through securities, referred to as ARM securities, issued 
      and guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises, either Fannie Mae or 
      Freddie Mac, or by an agency of the federal government, Ginnie Mae. At 
      June 30, 2017, over 50% of the Company’s ARM securities portfolio will 
      reset in rate in less than 18 months, allowing the Company’s cash yields 
      to continue benefiting from higher prevailing interest rates in future 
      quarters.
    

      Portfolio yields averaged 1.66% during the second quarter of 2017, one 
      basis point lower than the 1.67% reported for the first quarter. Cash 
      yields (yields on the portfolio before investment premium amortization) 
      increased six basis points to average 2.66% during the second quarter, 
      benefiting from mortgage loans underlying the portfolio resetting to 
      higher rates based on higher prevailing six- and 12-month interest rate 
      indices. Yield adjustments for investment premium amortization increased 
      seven basis points to average a negative 1.00% for the second quarter 
      primarily as a result of higher mortgage prepayment levels. Mortgage 
      prepayment rates for the second quarter averaged an annualized constant 
      prepayment rate, or CPR, of 24.69% compared to 22.93% CPR reported for 
      the first quarter.
    

      The following table illustrates the progression of Capstead’s portfolio 
      of residential mortgage investments for the quarter and six months ended 
      June 30, 2017 (dollars in thousands):

Residential mortgage investments typically are acquired at a 
            premium to the securities’ unpaid principal balances. Investment 
            premiums are recognized in earnings as portfolio yield adjustments 
            using the interest method over the estimated lives of the related 
            investments. As such, the level of mortgage prepayments impacts 
            how quickly investment premiums are amortized.







           
        



      Rates on Capstead’s $12.45 billion in secured borrowings, after 
      adjusting for hedging activities, averaged 15 basis points higher at 
      1.08% during the second quarter of 2017, compared to 0.93% for the first 
      quarter. The increase is largely attributable to higher interest rates 
      primarily resulting from Federal Reserve actions to raise the Federal 
      Funds Rate a total of 75 basis points since December 2016. Average 
      unhedged secured borrowing rates increased 20 basis points during the 
      second quarter, while related hedged borrowing rates increased 12 basis 
      points as older, lower-rate interest rate swap agreements expired and 
      new swaps were entered into at higher current rates. The Company uses 
      two- and three-year term interest rate swap agreements, supplemented 
      with longer-maturity secured borrowings when available at attractive 
      rates and terms, to help mitigate exposure to rising short-term interest 
      rates. The Company held $8.60 billion notional amount of portfolio 
      financing-related swap agreements with contract expirations occurring at 
      various dates through the first quarter of 2020 and a weighted average 
      expiration of 14 months.
    

      Operating costs expressed as an annualized percentage of long-term 
      investment capital averaged 0.92% during the second quarter of 2017. 
      Capstead is a leader in terms of operating cost efficiency among its 
      mortgage REIT peers.
    

Long-Term Investment Capital, Portfolio Leverage and Book Value per 
      Common Share


      Capstead’s long-term investment capital, which consists of common and 
      perpetual preferred stockholders’ equity and $98 million of long-term 
      unsecured borrowings, decreased by $15 million during the second quarter 
      of 2017 to $1.34 billion as a result of declines in portfolio and swap 
      values and dividend distributions in excess of earnings, partially 
      offset by issuances of Series E preferred stock. Portfolio leverage 
      (secured borrowings divided by long-term investment capital) increased 
      to 9.27 to one at June 30, 2017 from 9.04 to one at March 31, 2017 
      primarily as a result of an increase in secured borrowings to support a 
      larger portfolio and the decrease in long-term investment capital.
    

      The following table illustrates the progression of the Company’s book 
      value per common share (total stockholders’ equity, less preferred share 
      liquidation preferences, divided by shares of common stock outstanding)

      Nearly all of Capstead’s residential mortgage investments and all 
      interest rate swap agreements are reflected at fair value on the 
      Company’s balance sheet and related unrealized gains and losses are 
      included in the calculation of book value per common share. The 
      Company’s borrowings, however, are not reflected at fair value on the 
      balance sheet.
    

      Fair value is impacted by market conditions, including changes in 
      interest rates, and the availability of financing at reasonable rates 
      and leverage levels, among other factors. The Company’s investment 
      strategy attempts to mitigate these risks by focusing on investments in 
      agency-guaranteed residential mortgage pass-through securities, which 
      are considered to have little, if any, credit risk and are 
      collateralized by ARM loans with interest rates that reset periodically 
      to more current levels, generally within five years. Because of these 
      characteristics, the fair value of the Company’s portfolio is expected 
      to be less vulnerable to significant pricing declines caused by credit 
      concerns or rising interest rates compared to leveraged portfolios 
      containing a significant amount of non-agency-guaranteed securities or 
      agency-guaranteed securities backed by longer-duration ARM or fixed-rate 
      loans. Duration is a common measure of market price sensitivity to 
      interest rate movements. A shorter duration generally indicates less 
      interest rate risk.
    

Management Remarks


      Commenting on current operating and market conditions, Phillip A. 
      Reinsch, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Second quarter 
      earnings were negatively affected by higher mortgage prepayment levels 
      and higher borrowing costs, while benefiting from higher cash yields and 
      higher average portfolio balances.
    

      “Because average mortgage prepayment levels were higher this quarter by 
      1.76% CPR (an increase of 7.7%, compared to a decline in the first 
      quarter of 10.4%), we recorded an additional $2.3 million in investment 
      premium amortization. The second quarter increase in prepayments is 
      attributable to a number of factors, including seasonality and a 
      flattening of the yield curve as longer term rates have not increased in 
      tandem with shorter term rates since year-end. This can create 
      refinancing opportunities, particularly for borrowers whose loans have 
      recently reset to higher levels. Given current market conditions, we 
      anticipate quarterly prepayment levels may increase further in the third 
      quarter before declining in the fourth quarter.
    

      “Borrowing and hedging costs were up appreciably in the second quarter 
      as the markets absorbed the effects of three 25 basis point Federal 
      Funds Rate increases since December 2016. During the second quarter 
      average unhedged secured borrowing rates increased 20 basis points over 
      the first quarter to 1.09%, while related hedged borrowing rates 
      increased 12 basis points to average 1.08%. On a combined basis, secured 
      borrowing rates were up 15 basis points. In the current rate 
      environment, older, lower-rate swaps are expiring and new, higher-rate 
      swaps are being entered into in order to provide important balance sheet 
      and future financing spread protection, particularly as it pertains to 
      additions to the longer-to-reset portion of our ARM securities portfolio.
    

      “Importantly, higher borrowing costs were partially offset by a six 
      basis point increase in overall cash yields largely attributable to 
      periodic coupon interest rate resets on mortgage loans underlying the 
      currently-resetting portion of our portfolio. This key feature of our 
      short duration ARM strategy should continue to benefit cash yields in 
      the coming quarters.
    

      “Given our current opportunity for continued increases in cash yields 
      and our prudent hedging posture, we believe that our short duration 
      agency-guaranteed residential ARM portfolio is well positioned to 
      generate attractive risk-adjusted returns over the long term. Key to our 
      near-term success will be mortgage prepayment levels and the pace of 
      future increases in short-term interest rates.”

About Capstead


      Capstead is a self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, for 
      federal income tax purposes. The Company earns income from investing in 
      a leveraged portfolio of short-duration agency-guaranteed ARM 
      securities. This strategy differentiates the Company from its mortgage 
      REIT peers because the ARM loans underlying its investment portfolio 
      reset to more current interest rates within a relatively short period of 
      time. As a result, the Company is positioned to benefit from future 
      recoveries in financing spreads that typically contract during periods 
      of rising interest rates and to experience smaller fluctuations in 
      portfolio values compared to portfolios containing a significant amount 
      of longer-duration ARM or fixed-rate mortgage securities. Duration is a 
      common measure of market price sensitivity to interest rate movements. A 
      shorter duration generally indicates less interest rate risk.

Beginning in 2017, exchange-traded swap agreements are deemed 
            to be settled daily in accordance with recent legal 
            interpretations. As a result, the fair value of exchange traded 
            swap agreements held as cash flow hedges of Secured borrowings is 
            calculated including related accrued interest and net of variation 
            margin amounts received or paid through the exchange, resulting in 
            separately presenting on the balance sheet a significantly reduced 
            fair value amount representing the unsettled fair value of these 
            derivatives. Non-exchange traded swap agreements held as cash flow 
            hedges of Unsecured borrowings were not affected by these legal 
            interpretations and continue to be reported at fair value 
            calculated excluding accrued interest and variation margin. At 
            June 30, 2017, Cash collateral receivable from interest rate swap 
            counterparties includes initial margin for all swap agreements and 
            variation margin for non-exchange traded swap agreements. Accrued 
            interest for non-exchange traded swap agreements is included in 
            Accounts payable and accrued expenses. This change in presentation 
            has had no further impact on the Company’s accounting for 
            derivatives.

(a)






All interest-earning assets include residential mortgage 
            investments, overnight investments and cash collateral receivable 
            from interest rate swap counterparties. All interest-paying 
            liabilities include unsecured borrowings and cash collateral 
            payable to interest rate swap counterparties.









           
        




(b)






Cash yields are based on the cash component of interest income. 
            Investment premium amortization is determined using the interest 
            method which incorporates actual and anticipated future mortgage 
            prepayments. Both are expressed as a percentage calculated on 
            average amortized cost basis for the indicated periods.









           
        




(c)






Unhedged borrowing rates represent average rates on secured 
            borrowings, before consideration of related currently-paying 
            interest rate swap agreements. Hedged borrowing rates represent 
            the average fixed-rate payments made on currently-paying interest 
            rate swap agreements held for portfolio hedging purposes adjusted 
            for differences between LIBOR-based variable-rate payments 
            received on these swaps and unhedged borrowing rates, as well as 
            the effects of any hedge ineffectiveness. Average fixed-rate swap 
            payments were 1.02% and 0.89% for the second and first quarters of 
            2017, respectively, while the variable-rate payment adjustments 
            equated to 0.06% and 0.07% on average currently-paying swap 
            notional amounts outstanding for the same periods. During 2016, 
            fixed-rate swap payments averaged 0.74% while variable-rate 
            payment adjustments averaged 0.20% on average notional amounts 
            outstanding.





      Financing spreads on residential mortgage investments, a non-GAAP 
      financial measure, differ from total financing spreads, an all-inclusive 
      GAAP measure, that is based on all interest-earning assets and all 
      interest-paying liabilities. Management believes that presenting 
      financing spreads on residential mortgage investments provides useful 
      information for evaluating the performance of the Company’s portfolio. 
      The following reconciles these two measures:

Other interest-earning assets consist of overnight investments 
            and cash collateral receivable from interest rate swap 
            counterparties. Other interest-paying liabilities consist of 
            unsecured borrowings (at average borrowing rates of 7.74% and 
            7.71% for the second and first quarters of 2017, respectively) 
            and, at times, cash collateral payable to interest rate swap 
            counterparties.

(a)






Unrealized gains and losses on residential mortgage securities 
            classified as available-for-sale are recorded as a component of 
            Accumulated other comprehensive income in Stockholders’ equity. 
            Gains or losses are generally recognized in earnings only if sold. 
            Residential mortgage securities classified as held-to-maturity 
            with a cost basis of $2 million and unsecuritized investments in 
            residential mortgage loans with a cost basis of $2 million are not 
            subject to fair value accounting and therefore have been excluded 
            from this analysis. Capstead segregates its residential ARM 
            securities based on the average length of time until the loans 
            underlying each security reset to more current rates.









           
        




(b)






To help mitigate exposure to higher interest rates, Capstead 
            uses one- and three-month LIBOR-indexed, pay-fixed, 
            receive-variable interest rate swap agreements supplemented with 
            longer-maturity secured borrowings when available at attractive 
            rates and terms. The Company has also entered into $100 million 
            notional amount of swap agreements with terms coinciding with the

After consideration of portfolio financing-related swap 
            positions, Capstead’s residential mortgage investments and related 
            secured borrowings had durations as of June 30, 2017 of 
            approximately 11¼ and 9¼ months, respectively, for a net duration 
            gap of approximately 2 months. Duration is a measure of market 
            price sensitivity to changes in interest rates. A shorter duration 
            generally indicates less interest rate risk.

(a)






Amortized cost basis represents the Company’s investment 
            (unpaid principal balance plus unamortized investment premiums) 
            before unrealized gains and losses. At June 30, 2017, the ratio of 
            amortized cost basis to unpaid principal balance for the Company’s 
            ARM holdings was 103.16. This table excludes $3 million in 
            fixed-rate agency-guaranteed mortgage pass-through securities, 
            residential mortgage loans and private residential mortgage 
            pass-through securities held as collateral for structured 
            financings.









           
        




(b)






Net WAC, or weighted average coupon, is the weighted average 
            interest rate of the mortgage loans underlying the indicated 
            investments, net of servicing and other fees as of the indicated 
            date. Net WAC is expressed as a percentage calculated on an 
            annualized basis on the unpaid principal balances of the mortgage 
            loans underlying these investments. As such, it is similar to the 
            cash yield on the portfolio which is calculated using amortized 
            cost basis. Fully indexed WAC represents the weighted average 
            coupon upon one or more resets using interest rate indexes and net 
            margins as of the indicated date. Average net margins represent 
            the weighted average levels over the underlying indexes that the 
            portfolio can adjust to upon reset, usually subject to initial, 
            periodic and/or lifetime caps on the amount of such adjustments 
            during any single interest rate adjustment period and over the 
            contractual term of the underlying loans. ARM securities with 
            initial fixed-rate periods of five years or longer typically have 
            either 200 or 500 basis point initial caps with 200 basis point 
            periodic caps. Additionally, certain ARM securities held by the 
            Company are subject only to lifetime caps or are not subject to a 
            cap. For presentation purposes, average periodic caps in the table 
            above reflect initial caps until after an ARM security has reached 
            its initial reset date and lifetime caps, less the current net 
            WAC, for ARM securities subject only to lifetime caps. At 
            quarter-end, 80% of current-reset ARMs were subject to periodic 
            caps averaging 1.75%; 13% were subject to initial caps averaging 
            3.33%; and 7% were subject to lifetime caps averaging 7.27%. All 
            longer-to-reset ARM securities at June 30, 2017 were subject to 
            initial caps.









           
        




(c)






Capstead classifies its ARM securities based on the average 
            length of time until the loans underlying each security reset to 
            more current rates (“months-to-roll”) (less than 18 months for 
            “current-reset” ARM securities, and 18 months or greater for 
            “longer-to-reset” ARM securities). After consideration of any 
            applicable initial fixed-rate periods, at June 30, 2017 
            approximately 91%, 6% and 3% of the Company’s ARM securities were 
            backed by mortgage loans that reset annually, semi-annually and 
            monthly, respectively. Approximately 87% of the Company’s 
            current-reset ARM securities have reached an initial coupon reset 
            date, while none of its longer-to-reset ARM securities have 
            reached an initial coupon reset date.









           
        




(d)






Gross WAC is the weighted average interest rate of the mortgage 
            loans underlying the indicated investments, including servicing 
            and other fees paid by borrowers, as of the indicated balance 
            sheet date.
