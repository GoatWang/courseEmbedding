Elizabeth Blanchard Chess's Experience
Title: Executive Director and Board Member
               Company: New West Symphony
Job Details
               Founded in 1995, the New West Symphony is a professional orchestra that draws its players from the rich talent pool of professional Los Angeles-area musicians. Led by music director Marcelo Lehninger, the Symphony is the resident company of the Oxnard Performing Arts Center, the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza, and Barnum Hall in Santa Monica. It presents six Masterpiece Series concerts annually, performing major works from the symphonic repertoire with internationally-acclaimed artists as guest soloists. The Symphony also provides quality outreach and educational opportunities for the communities it serves through its annual Symphonic Adventures concert programs for youth, its traveling Music Van, and its partnership with New West Symphony Harmony Project of Ventura County, a year-round music and leadership program for underserved students. The New West Symphony Association is registered as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.
Title: Editor and Publisher
               Company: Ventura County , Inc.
Job Details
               VCFB promotes the long term vitality of commercial agriculture in Ventura County. In general, we favor maintaining agricultural land without deed restrictions to provide agricultural owners with the maximum ability to manage their resources. However, we realize in an urbanizing environment it is sometimes practical to allow deed restrictions in order to provide for continued commercial agriculture. As such, we support programs such as voluntary conservation easements and development rights transference, and more importantly, the property tax benefits as provided under the Land Conservation (Williamson) Act, in order to maintain the long term economic agricultural productivity of farmland.  Agricultural land trusts have proven useful vehicles in other counties for holding property restrictions and provide an additional estate planning tool for farmers. VCFB supports the Ventura County Agricultural Land Trust provided no mandatory government programs are associated with it and provided no taxes are imposed on agriculture in its support. Participation in a VCALT program must be voluntary and not conditioned upon permit approval, property transfer, estate planning execution or any other right normally associated with property ownership.  VCFB believes VCALT, in conjunction with the urban communities, has an important role to play in preserving agricultural productivity in farm areas under pressures of urbanization, provided the prime motivation remains the economic viability of agriculture and not the provision of inexpensive open space to the urban dweller.
