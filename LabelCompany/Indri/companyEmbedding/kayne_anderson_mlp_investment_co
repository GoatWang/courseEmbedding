7. Based on U.S. Plan Sponsor rankings in Pensions & Investments as of 12/31/16.
Morningstar rankings are based on total return, do not include the effects of sales charges, and are calculated against all funds in each fund's respective Morningstar category. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance by share class may vary.
Star ratings shown are for Class Z shares, which are available to individual investors through certain retirement and wrap fee programs, and to institutions at an investment minimum of $5,000,000. Performance by share class may vary. In addition to the ones shown above, other classes, which contain either a sales load or a contingent deferred sales charge, are also available. These expenses will generally lower total fund return. Please see the prospectus for additional information about fees, expenses and investor eligibility requirements.
The risks associated with investing in these funds include but are not limited to: derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; short sales, which involve costs and the risk of potentially unlimited losses; leveraging, which may magnify losses; high yield (“junk”) bonds, which are subject to greater market risks; small/mid cap stocks which may be subject to more erratic market movements than large cap stocks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; real estate, which poses certain risks related to overall and specific economic conditions as well as risks related to individual property, credit and interest-rate fluctuations; and mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment and extension risks. Sector funds and Specialty funds may not be suitable for all investors. Such funds are non-diversified, so a loss resulting from a particular security will have greater impact on the Fund's return. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund's respective prospectus. There is no guarantee a fund's objectives will be achieved.
Some Morningstar Ratings may not be customarily based on adjusted historical returns. If so, an investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric is compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
For the overall, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, respectively, as of 3/31/17: Prudential Balanced Fund was rated 5 stars out of 721 funds, 5 stars out of 721 funds, and 5 stars out of 616 funds, and 4 out of 424 funds, respectively; Prudential High Yield Fund was rated 5 stars out of 596 funds, 5 stars out of 596 funds, 4 stars out of 471 funds, and 5 stars out of 318 funds, respectively; Prudential Short-Term Corporate Bond Fund, Inc. was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 359 funds, and 5 stars out of 257 funds, respectively; Prudential Total Return Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 750 funds, and 5 stars out of 538 funds, respectively; Prudential California Municipal Income Fund was rated 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 65 funds, and 5 stars out of 52 funds, respectively; Prudential National Muni Fund was rated 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 224 funds, and 5 stars out of 150 funds, respectively; Prudential QMA Small-Cap Value Fund was rated 5 stars out of 353 funds, 5 stars out of 353 funds, 4 stars out of 309 funds, and 5 stars out of 199 funds, respectively; Prudential Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, and 5 stars out of 444 funds, respectively.

Objective

KYN is a closed-end fund that invests principally in equity securities of energy-related master limited partnerships (MLPs). KYN's objective is to obtain high after tax total returns for its shareholders. MLPs are publicly traded limited partnerships. Energy-related MLPs own domestic infrastructure assets that are used in the gathering, processing, transportation, storage, refining and distribution of energy-related commodities.



Investment Merits

MLP Sector Opportunity
MLPs provide steady distributions with attractive growth profiles. MLPs are expanding their asset bases to meet growing needs for energy infrastructure in the U.S.
Attractive Fund Structure
- KYN issues a Form 1099 (as opposed to K-1s issued by MLPs).- Suitable for IRAs, foundations and tax-exempt accounts, because unlike direct holdings in MLPs, KYN does not generate unrelated business taxable income (UBTI).
Access to Private Investments.
KYN provides access to private investment opportunities not available to retail investors.

Quarterly Distributions per Share
   View the complete Distribution History for KYN.
Information on Tax Character of Distributions
Our distributions are treated as a taxable dividend (qualified dividends) to our common stockholders to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. If the distribution exceeds our current or accumulated earnings and profits, the distribution will be treated as a return of capital to our common stockholders to the extent of each stockholder’s basis in our common stock, and then the amount of a distribution in excess of such stockholder’s basis would be taxed as capital gain. Common stockholders will receive a Form 1099 from us and will recognize dividend income only to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Because the cash distributions received from the MLPs in our portfolio are expected to exceed the earnings and profits associated with owning such MLPs, a portion of our distributions may be paid from sources other than our current and accumulated earnings and profits. The table below summarizes the tax character of our distributions since inception. Sample Form 1099-DIV for each year can be found at www.kaynefunds.com/kyn/tax-information.

This table illustrates the growth of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund's common shares beginning on the inception date with all distributions reinvested through the Dividend Reinvestment Program (DRIP). Ending values as of the dates shown in the table. Performance does not reflect transaction fees or broker commissions. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.





1) Payable on 7/14/17 (ex-date 7/6/17) for the quarter ended 5/31/17. (See "Information on Tax Character of Distributions" on Distributions tab)2) Assumes that distributions have been reinvested through the Dividend Reinvestment Program (DRIP).3) As of May 31, 2017, this estimate is based on our estimated earnings and profits for fiscal 2017, which does not include a projection for any gains or losses on the sale of securities during the remainder of fiscal 2017. The final determination of the tax character of our distributions will be made after our fiscal year-end when we can determine our actual earnings and profits for the full year. The final tax status of our distributions is dependent on our earnings and profits (including gains and losses on the sale of securities) for the remainder of our fiscal year and may differ substantially from this preliminary information.
This material shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation to buy, nor shall there be any sale of the securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer or sale is not permitted. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. An investment in the fund could suffer loss. Current performance may be lower or higher than that shown based on market fluctuations from the end of the reported period. Before making an investment in the fund, you should consider the investment objective, risks, charges and expenses of the fund, which, together with and other important information are included in the fund's most recent prospectus and other filings with the SEC. There can be no assurance that the fund's investment objectives will be attained. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is below their net asset value. Leverage creates risks which may adversely affect return, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of common shares, and fluctuations in dividend rates on any preferred shares.

Objective

KYE is a closed-end fund that invests principally in equity and debt securities of companies in the energy industry, such as energy-related master limited partnerships (MLPs), midstream corporations, marine transportation and energy-related debt. KYE’s objective is to obtain a high total return with an emphasis on current income.



Investment Merits

Diversified Portfolio of Energy Investments
KYE targets a diversified investment portfolio across multiple energy sub-sectors – MLPs, midstream corporations, marine transportation and energy-related debt. This multi-sector strategy allows KYE to reduce the portfolio’s volatility.
Positive Long-Term Outlook for Energy Industry
Global demand for energy continues to increase, largely driven by global population increases and continued growth from developing economies. KYE believes that demand growth will increase the need for additional energy infrastructure assets and create growth opportunities for KYE's portfolio investments.
Attractive Fund Structure
- KYE issues a Form 1099 (as opposed to K-1s issued by MLPs).- Suitable for IRAs, foundations and tax-exempt accounts, because unlike direct holdings in MLPs, KYE does not generate unrelated business taxable income (UBTI).

Quarterly Distributions per Share
   View the complete Distribution History for KYE.

Information on Tax Character of Distributions
Our distributions are generally taxable as ordinary income (a portion of which may be qualified dividends) or capital gains. Distributions of our ordinary income plus net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits. If our distributions exceed our current or accumulated earnings and profits, the distributions will be treated as a return of capital to our common stockholders to the extent of each stockholder’s basis in our common stock, and then the amount distributed in excess of such stockholder’s basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Common stockholders will receive a Form 1099 from us and will recognize ordinary income only to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Because the cash distributions received from the MLPs in our portfolio are expected to exceed the earnings and profits associated with owning such MLPs, a portion of our distributions may be paid from sources other than our current and accumulated earnings and profits. The table below summarizes the tax character of our distributions since inception. Sample Form 1099-DIV for each year can be found at www.kaynefunds.com/kye/tax-information.

Kayne Anderson MLP Investment Company - A Value Play With A 12% Yield - Kayne Anderson MLP Investment (NYSE:KYN) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Kayne Anderson MLP Investment Company - A Value Play With A 12% YieldOct.28.15 | About: Kayne Anderson (KYN) James Jenckes Dividend growth investing, dividend investing, portfolio strategy, valueSummaryThe fund claims to invest at least 85% of total assets in energy-related master limited partnerships.It currently pays a dividend in the 12% range.The fund as a consistent track record of 11 years.If you recently sold the Kayne Anderson MLP Investment Company (KYN), I wouldn't blame you. It seems like the thing to do at this point. The MLP space has been beat up, bloodied, and stomped into the dirt. Overall, the oil & gas storage and transportation sector has fallen more than 30% in the past 12 months. The situation looks ugly and may get worse. So, why put any money into this space? Well, let's see what it has to offer.
Fund Strategy
KYN seeks high total returns by investing in energy-related master limited partnerships (MLPs) and their affiliates and in other companies that operate assets used in the gathering, transporting, processing, storing, refining, distributing, and mining of marketing natural gas, natural gas liquids, crude oil, refined petroleum products or coal. Basically, companies that store and/or transport petroleum products.

Portfolio as of 9/30/15

Data taken from the fund's website
Value Proposition
These companies, along with their massive infrastructure investments carry the life blood of this country. They have created a complex web of pipelines and storage facilities that reach every corner of the continental United States. These companies deliver about 26.6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas annually throughout the U.S. so we can keep our lights on, keep our homes warm, and power our industries. Also, much of the crude oil and refined products consumed must be moved and stored throughout the country. Pipelines have become the most cost-efficient way to move these products. Producers of oil and gas as well as customers of these products are equally dependent on the infrastructure investments made by the oil & gas storage and transportation sector companies. In other words, these infrastructure companies are a vital and an integral component of our modern society.

Also, consider this. Further investments in our oil & gas storage and transportation infrastructure are continually needed to provide conduits for new oil & gas production and refined products. These new materials and products would be stranded without expansion of the infrastructure. Because of this fact, there is literally tens of billions of dollars' worth of backlog for new infrastructure projects.
Therefore, companies that operate in this space are not likely to be going out of business anytime soon. KYN allows you to invest in many of the companies easily and without the hassle of the dreaded K-1. And right now, there is a sale going on in the MLP sector. KYN is now selling at 50% of its price from November 2014. I think with so many choices out there in the MLP space, it makes sense to let someone else do the picking and save yourself the headache that goes with the K-1s.
Risks
However, investing in KYN is not for the timid. It is a Closed Ended Investment Company or CEF. If you are not familiar with these, it would be best if you did some research before investing in them. See CEF Connect for further research. This type of fund often uses leverage to enhance its returns. In the case of KYN, its leverage is about 32%. With that, you will notice that these types of funds typical exhibit more volatility than the overall market. It can be as high as twice the S&P 500's typical volatility.
Outlook
So, where is KYN headed? In my opinion, we haven't seen the bottom yet. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't have this stock on your radar. Today's dog is tomorrow's champion. Keep an eye on stocks like EPD, ETP, and KMI. These are the top three holdings in KYN. All but KMI appear to forming a bottoming pattern. Watch for the momentum indicators to begin to turn higher. This should indicate the bottom is in. Then, it's time to start scaling in. Build a position over a few months. Be patient and let it come in.
Here's a recent chart of EPD showing its price consolidating around the $25 area. Also, it shows the RSI indicator in an up-trend. These are signs that the stock is bottoming and a trend reversal should soon follow.

Why Invest?
If you are looking for a good value play that will pay you to wait, KYN may be what you looking for. At the moment, this stock is paying a dividend in the 12% neighborhood. It also has a good record of increasing dividends. According to one source, Dividend Stocks, KYN's 5-year dividend growth rate is over 9%. And according to Kayne Anderson's fact sheet, funds invested at inception, i.e., September 2004, would have doubled by September 2015. That works out to be about 6.75% annual return. Not too bad when you also consider the increasing dividend stream you would have had during that time. There was only a slight decrease in dividends during the 2009-2010 period. Of course, it all depends on what your goals are. Are you looking for a steady stream of dependable dividends? I believe that KYN has proved it can do that.
Conclusion
One final thought I will throw in for free! KYN is not for everybody, but think about this. Money on the sidelines, for all practical purposes, is not earning anything in this low interest rate environment. That goes for all of us small-time retail investors as well as the large hedge funds and institutional investors. Stocks in the MLP space will not fall forever. Sooner or later, they will be noticed by the value hunters. Money will then flow to where there is value. And I believe the value of the MLP space is getting very compelling.

Why Shares of Kayne Anderson MLP Investment Co. Dropped Today
Shares of MLPs are getting hit hard as oil falls below $40 per barrel, and leveraged funds that invest in the industry are getting hit even harder.











                Jordan Wathen
            

                (TMFValueMagnet)



            
            Dec 7, 2015 at 4:35PM
            
            






What: Shares of Kayne Anderson MLP Investment Co. (NYSE:KYN) fell by 15.2% at their nadir today, but have slightly recovered to a 10.5% loss as of 3:40 p.m. EST.
Oil fell below $40 a barrel on Monday, pushing MLP unit prices broadly lower in active trading.
So what: Kayne Anderson MLP Investment Co. is a closed-end fund that held a portfolio of 56 MLP stocks on Oct. 31, concentrating its holdings in publicly traded master limited partnerships. Unlike mutual funds or exchange-traded funds, Kayne Anderson MLP uses leverage to increase its returns, up and down, but the consequence is higher volatility.
The company last reported leverage of nearly 1 times equity when its deferred income taxes are accounted for. The fund had a net asset value (book value) of $19.20 per share when it reported its results on Nov. 30.
The fund's three-largest positions, Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD), Energy Transfer Partners (NYSE:ETP), and Williams Partners were down 4.4%, 7.5%, 13% today, respectively, on a rout in oil prices.





Now what: Kayne Anderson MLP is only as good as the MLPs backing the fund. Until mid-November, the fund traded at a persistent premium to book value. According to data from Morningstar, that changed on Nov. 16, when the fund's share price fell below net asset value for the first time since 2014.
Given the fund holds MLPs with an added dose of leverage on top, investors are clearly rethinking whether or not it's prudent to have leveraged exposure to an asset class that is already levered to highly volatile oil prices.

Kayne Anderson MLP Investment Company Announces Distribution Of $0.45 Per Share For Q2 2017






Business Wire




Jun 30, 2017 6:20 PM EDT













 




























































  Kayne Anderson MLP Investment Company (the "Company") (NYSE:KYN) announced today its quarterly distribution of $0.45 per share for the quarter ended May 31, 2017.  The distribution will be payable on July 14, 2017 to common stockholders of record on July 10, 2017, with an ex-dividend date of July 6, 2017. The Company estimates that 100% of its distribution for the quarter ended May 31, 2017 will be treated as a return of capital for tax purposes. This estimate is based on the Company's anticipated earnings and profits for fiscal 2017 (including gains and losses on sales of securities during the six months ended May 31, 2017) and its accumulated earnings and profits as of May 31, 2017. The Company's estimate does not include a projection of gains or losses on the sale of securities for the remainder of fiscal 2017. The final determination of the tax character of the distribution will be made in early 2018 when the Company can determine its actual earnings and profits for the full year (including gains and losses on the sale of securities for the remainder of fiscal 2017) and may differ substantially from this preliminary information.  Kayne Anderson MLP Investment Company is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, whose common stock is traded on the NYSE. The Company's investment objective is to obtain a high after-tax total return by investing at least 85% of its total assets in energy-related master limited partnerships and their affiliates (collectively, "MLPs"), and in other companies that, as their principal business, operate assets used in the gathering, transporting, processing, storing, refining, distributing, mining or marketing natural gas, natural gas liquids (including propane), crude oil, refined petroleum products or coal.  CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS: This press release contains "forward-looking statements" as defined under the U.S. federal securities laws. Generally, the words "believe," "expect," "intend," "estimate," "anticipate," "project," "will" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. Forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the Company's historical experience and its present expectations or projections indicated in any forward-looking statements. These risks include, but are not limited to, changes in economic and political conditions; regulatory and legal changes; MLP industry risk; leverage risk; valuation risk; interest rate risk; tax risk; and other risks discussed in the Company's filings with the SEC. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements made herein.

Source: Morningstar as of 3/31/17.
5. 9 out of 10 fixed income funds. Ranking based on Class Z share fixed income funds with 10-year history. Rankings for Class Z share fixed income funds that rank top 50% or better within their respective Morningstar Categories over the trailing 1-, 3-, & 5-year periods are 12/18 funds, 14/15 funds, and 11/13 funds, respectively. Source: Morningstar as of 3/31/17.
6. P&I/Towers Watson Top 300 Pension Funds ranking as of 12/31/16, published 9/30/16.
7. Based on U.S. Plan Sponsor rankings in Pensions & Investments as of 12/31/16.
Morningstar rankings are based on total return, do not include the effects of sales charges, and are calculated against all funds in each fund's respective Morningstar category. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance by share class may vary.
Star ratings shown are for Class Z shares, which are available to individual investors through certain retirement and wrap fee programs, and to institutions at an investment minimum of $5,000,000. Performance by share class may vary. In addition to the ones shown above, other classes, which contain either a sales load or a contingent deferred sales charge, are also available. These expenses will generally lower total fund return. Please see the prospectus for additional information about fees, expenses and investor eligibility requirements.
The risks associated with investing in these funds include but are not limited to: derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; short sales, which involve costs and the risk of potentially unlimited losses; leveraging, which may magnify losses; high yield (“junk”) bonds, which are subject to greater market risks; small/mid cap stocks which may be subject to more erratic market movements than large cap stocks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; real estate, which poses certain risks related to overall and specific economic conditions as well as risks related to individual property, credit and interest-rate fluctuations; and mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment and extension risks. Sector funds and Specialty funds may not be suitable for all investors. Such funds are non-diversified, so a loss resulting from a particular security will have greater impact on the Fund's return. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund's respective prospectus. There is no guarantee a fund's objectives will be achieved.
Some Morningstar Ratings may not be customarily based on adjusted historical returns. If so, an investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric is compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
For the overall, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, respectively, as of 3/31/17: Prudential Balanced Fund was rated 5 stars out of 721 funds, 5 stars out of 721 funds, and 5 stars out of 616 funds, and 4 out of 424 funds, respectively; Prudential High Yield Fund was rated 5 stars out of 596 funds, 5 stars out of 596 funds, 4 stars out of 471 funds, and 5 stars out of 318 funds, respectively; Prudential Short-Term Corporate Bond Fund, Inc. was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 359 funds, and 5 stars out of 257 funds, respectively; Prudential Total Return Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 750 funds, and 5 stars out of 538 funds, respectively; Prudential California Municipal Income Fund was rated 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 65 funds, and 5 stars out of 52 funds, respectively; Prudential National Muni Fund was rated 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 224 funds, and 5 stars out of 150 funds, respectively; Prudential QMA Small-Cap Value Fund was rated 5 stars out of 353 funds, 5 stars out of 353 funds, 4 stars out of 309 funds, and 5 stars out of 199 funds, respectively; Prudential Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, and 5 stars out of 444 funds, respectively.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
