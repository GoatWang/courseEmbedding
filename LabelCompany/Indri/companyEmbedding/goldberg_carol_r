The Real Reason Why Increasing Productivity in Professional Services is Such a Challenge
Nowadays, everyone is all about trying to optimize their productivity. In an increasingly fast-paced business world, you can’t afford not to do everything you can to be as productive as possible.
Unfortunately, this is far easier said than done, and it’s a lot hard for some than others – for example, in the service industry. Here’s why.
1. Professional services tend to be labor intensive.
While there’s certainly plenty of aspects besides labor, it’s definitely the crux of professional services – and this makes it pretty difficult to optimize. Unlike trimming excess organizational bloat, or improving communication systems, improving the productivity of labor itself can be an abstract task.
2. Increasing quantity can come at the cost of quality.
It’s especially tricky when you realize that quality and quantity are too often at opposite ends – and this can be disastrous for services. It’s a mistake to think that having more clients necessarily means you’re more productive if it means that the quality of your work is dipping. Service is all about customer experience, and if you’re not giving a good customer experience, they’ll probably be a one-time client.
3. It’s difficult to measure service productivity in a meaningful way
Take, for example, two salesman. One of them services only one customer in the time the other services five. It’s pretty easy to say that the first salesman is unproductive compared to the other – but what if that one customer spent $200 dollars while the five only spent $20 a piece?
What metric do you use to judge productivity in this case? It’s even harder to decide when you account for the many variables in service. Say the second salesman did make more money in sales than the first – but what if that one customer was so flattered by the attention he got that he’ll return tomorrow, while the five others felt they were rushed and won’t return again?
This just shows that services is too nuanced to make sweeping statements on what is and isn’t productive. So what can you do to improve productivity if you can’t apply hard and fast rules and practices?
It’s simple – talk it out. Communication is key in services, so once you stop thinking of productivity as a numbers game and embrace its unique, abstract nature, it becomes far easier to become more productive. Talk with your employees and coworkers on what could make the job easier. Get customer feedback on what they think would make your service better. Productivity is more than just trimming fat – it’s seasoning and cooking to perfection.

Top 3 Dating Hookup Apps


These 3 Dating Apps Are Making Hookups Happen Like Never Before
Online dating has become all the rage today, conveniently matching you with people you’re actually likely to be interested in, rather than dealing with the uncertainty that can come with trying to meet people in person.
Unfortunately, there are a lot of different apps out there, and it can be hard to sort through the noise to find one that works for you. So we’ve made it easy – here’s a breakdown of the biggest dating apps.
Cupid.ly
This one’s an old classic that works. cupid.ly uses a comprehensive profile system that pairs you based on common interests and algorithms designed to match you with people you’re more likely to like. This emphasis on compatibility makes cupid.ly one of the better options if you’re looking for a serious relationship, as the site gives you an unmatched ability to know a lot about your matches because the profile and questions are so in-depth.
Tinder
Tinder is pretty much the gold standard of dating apps right now, as its interface has proven very influential in the recent dating app boom. The yin to OkCupid’s yang, Tinder eschews the in-depth profile and match-making system for a simpler approach – you swipe through pictures and stripped-down bios and choose “yes” or “no.” If two people say yes to each other, it’s a match. It’s got its downsides – it’s popularity means there’s a lot of bots – but one definite plus is that you can only be messaged by your matches, as opposed to anyone.
Bumble
Dating apps are great, but they do have the tendency to bring out the worst in some men, who can be gratuitous and sometimes downright creepy with their messages, as many women who have used dating sites can attest. Bumble is a Tinder variation that puts the power in women’s hands – you use the swiping method, but once you match, the women are the only one’s that can send the first message, meaning the issue of creepy guys is cut down drastically.
Hinge
Hinge is a dating app that also functions similarly to Tinder, but with a twist – rather than matching you with anyone in your geographic location, the app only matches you with friends of friends, keeping matches limited to people in your social network. This way, rather than just going in blind, you can talk to your friends about them, humanizing the whole online dating approach in a very welcome way.
This is a list of some of the more popular options, so it’s possible that you’ve already tried these apps and found them to not be up to snuff. If that’s the case, check out FlirtSwipe, the new app that young professionals are using to streamline the matchmaking process.

                        "Still, cheaper than a power suit—and probably more effective."
                        
                    Corporate insiders Driscoll and Goldberg (president of Driscoll Associates and the Avcar Group Ltd., respectively) assess the obstacles that women face in business and, based on interviews with women executives, recommend the best techniques for overcoming them.

                    In this stimulating and comprehensive essay collection (originally published as the Summer 1990 issue of Daedalus, which Graubard edits), distinguished American and Japanese scholars debate the significance of the ``Showa'' era—the reign of Emperor Hirohito, from 1925 to 1989—in Japanese history.

                        "By turns comic and tragic, readers must form their own opinions about what truly constitutes sanity in an insane world."
                        
                    Clinical psychologist Goldberg's first novel explores the twin concepts of outsider status and insanity, with a mathematical twist.

                    If certain story collections resemble novels without connective tissue, this debut volume (parts of which appeared in Ploughshares and the Massachusetts Review) reads like autobiography torn apart and reconstructed by a sharp, active wit.

                        "As in the film A Beautiful Mind, our deepening awareness of the hero's madness is the main plot. But Paul is not Russell Crowe, and our ties with him weaken the more we learn. Still, strong stuff as the world wavers."
                        
                    Goldberg rises above the sleazy glamour of his well-received debut (Fake Liar Cheat, 2000) and takes a far deeper cut into his material.

                    Picking up the current concerns about bullying and "mean girls," Goldberg (Wickett's Remedy, 2005, etc.) follows a young woman tracking down a guilty memory from her childhood.

CARL GOLDBERG MODELS AND LANIER R/C BECOME PART OF THE GREAT PLANES FAMILY

























 



















CARL GOLDBERG MODELS AND LANIER R/C BECOME PART OF THE GREAT PLANES FAMILY
Urbana, Illinois, August 24, 2007 � Great Planes Model Manufacturing announced today that it has acquired the Lanier R/C and Carl Goldberg product lines. Both companies are currently located in Oakwood, GA but will soon relocate to Great Planes' headquarters in Champaign-Urbana, IL.
Carl Goldberg Models Inc. was founded over 50 years ago by hobby pioneer and legend, Carl Goldberg. The company is a cornerstone of the R/C airplane market and has enjoyed a legacy of well-known and respected products. The Goldberg product line was purchased five years ago by Bubba Spivey. Since that time, many of Goldberg's famous R/C kits were converted to almost-ready-to-fly models, gaining new success in the R/C market.
Lanier R/C was founded in 1964 by Len Purdy and was known as one of the first companies to offer almost ready-to-fly (ARF) R/C airplanes. In 1979, Lanier was acquired by the Spivey family.
Great Planes Model Manufacturing was founded in 1981 by Don Anderson. Great Planes quickly became the leading manufacturer of radio control kits in North America and is now a subsidiary of Hobbico, a 100% employee-owned company located in Champaign. Today, Great Planes continues to lead the industry with RC airplane kits, ARFs, building and field accessories, a full line of brushless motors and brushless speed controls as well as Real Flight, the industry's most popular R/C flight simulator. The company  manufactures airplanes from small indoor electrics to the largest aerobatic and scale models.
"Many R/C airplane enthusiasts became avid modelers by building a Carl Goldberg model airplane kit," says Don Anderson, Founder of Great Planes Model Manufacturing and Sr. Vice President of Product Development at Hobbico. "Success was virtually guaranteed with a Gentle Lady, Eagle or Eaglet kit as a first model, then moving on to one of the Falcons or Tigers once a modeler had learned to fly. Lanier R/C began innovating with ARF models long before the trend caught on."
Don Anderson goes on to say, "We are proud to welcome Carl Goldberg Models and Lanier R/C to the Great Planes family. We are looking forward to exciting growth opportunities that will arise by joining these companies with the Great Planes' market strength, manufacturing and distribution capabilities."
From the late 1960's through the 1970's Lanier R/C pioneered the concept of almost ready-to-fly airplane models, producing a line of ARF models primarily from plastic and foam. Sixteen different model types including the Comet (which became the longest, continuously-produced ARF on the market) made an impressive showing. In the late 1980's, Lanier R/C began producing balsa kits and eventually developed a line of balsa ARFs. The Stinger series, Shrike and giant scale kits and ARFs are among the most recognized names in the hobby industry.
"I am happy to have a quality company like Great Planes acquire Goldberg and Lanier," says Bubba Spivey. "I know Great Planes will continue with the traditions that have made these lines famous� and allow them to grow and introduce new and exciting products for many years to come."

Hulu: Frequently Asked Questions

  We put together this list of frequently asked questions about the Hulu subscription service. If you have a question
  that is not answered on this list, please feel free to contact our customer service team, 
  who will be more than happy to answer any questions you may have.  



What do I get with my Hulu subscription?

The Hulu subscription service streams current episodes, full seasons and a deep library of back seasons of hit
        TV shows from major broadcast and cable networks. We also have a wide assortment of kids programming, movies,
        Latino programming and much more. With a subscription, you can stream on a variety of connected devices, like
        TVs, tablets and phones, from almost anywhere with an Internet connection.
You can explore some complimentary programming on Hulu.com on the web, but for the full experience, including
        unlimited access to Hulu’s library of shows and access on all your devices, you will need a subscription.
If you have not previously subscribed to Hulu, you can sign up for a free trial of a Hulu subscription at
        www.hulu.com/start.



What is the difference between a Hulu subscription and the free Hulu service?

The free Hulu experience only has a limited number of episodes to watch, while a Hulu subscription offers
        unlimited access to our full library including current-season episodes from popular shows such as Scandal,
        Family Guy, Once Upon A Time, New Girl, Saturday Night Live, Modern Family
        and many more. You can also watch every episode from every season of shows like South Park, Empire,
        Sons of Anarchy, The Mindy Project, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Nashville,
        Law and Order: SVU and many more. We also offer a full range of Hulu Originals – unique series you can’t
        watch anywhere else. 
We’re adding new shows all the time – both popular hit shows and Hulu Originals, so you’ll never run out of
        things to watch on Hulu. With a subscription, you can watch Hulu on connected TVs, tablets, phones and PCs. To
        see a full list of everything you can watch with a Hulu subscription, please visit:
        www.hulu.com/start/content



Why are there are commercials on Hulu?

Commercials are included on Hulu in order to reduce the monthly subscription price of the service. We try our
        best to tailor advertising to your interests so that the advertising you see on Hulu is relevant and useful to
        you.



What happened to "Hulu Plus"?

We’ve streamlined everything to just call ourselves Hulu. Your Hulu subscription is exactly the same as what
        we used to call a Hulu Plus subscription. Same full access to our library. Same great experience. Same access
        across all your devices.
When we first launched a subscription service, we called it Hulu Plus to differentiate it from the free Hulu
        service. But gradually we realized that everyone just called us "Hulu." It’s as simple as that.  Although we
        offer different subscription plans and access points, you are always getting your content from Hulu, and we will
        always stand behind the quality of our service under one name - Hulu.



What devices can I use to watch Hulu?

Hulu is available with a subscription on connected TVs, tablets, phones and PCs. You can use a variety of
        connected devices to watch including Roku, Apple TV, PlayStation® 3 and 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Wii, Wii U
        and Internet-connected TVs and Blu-ray players from Sony, Samsung and Vizio. 
To see a list of currently supported devices, please visit our
        Device page 
We are constantly evaluating new platforms and technologies and will add more devices based on feedback from
        you - our viewers.



Does the same subscription work on every enabled device?

Yes, your subscription follows you to any Hulu-enabled device. For example, you can start an episode on your
        phone and finish it on your internet-connected TV or tablet. You’ll also notice that Watchlist, our helpful tool
        that helps you track your favorites, can be used across your devices.



How many devices can I watch on at one time with my Hulu subscription?

A Hulu subscription is intended as a personal account. While you can access Hulu through multiple devices with
        your account, only one stream is allowed at a time. 



Why are there so many variations in show availability?

We understand that content availability differences can be confusing, and at times frustrating for our viewers.
We do our best to be as transparent as possible about what content is available to our subscribers and
        non-subscribers. Our subscribers receive access to our entire library. Our viewers who use the free Hulu service
        get access to only a portion of our content. 
For some shows, we have licensed the entire series and are able to allow subscribers access to every episode.
        For other shows, our license only covers the current season of the show. There are also some shows for which our
        license only covers the five most recent episodes at one time.
There are also variations in our license agreements for connected devices (TVs, tablet and phones) as compared
        to our PC licensing agreements.
We always do our best to communicate the most up-to-date, accurate and complete availability information to
        our viewers at all times.



What are the system requirements for Hulu?

To find the system requirements for your PC or other devices, please visit our
        help article



Can I access Hulu outside of the US?

Hulu is only accessible within the U.S. and on certain U.S. overseas military installations at this time, as
        we only have streaming rights for our content in these regions.

Thanks for your interest.





      Sorry, currently our video library can only be watched from within the United States
    
Hulu is committed to making its content available worldwide.  To do so,
    we must work through a number of legal and business issues, including
    obtaining international streaming rights. Know that we are working to make
    this happen and will continue to do so.  Given the international background
    of the Hulu team, we have both a professional and personal interest in
    bringing Hulu to a global audience.
If you'd like, please leave us your email address and the country in
