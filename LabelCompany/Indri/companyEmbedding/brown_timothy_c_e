The record participation indicated the international community’s level of concern for the world today, as one crisis after another emerges.

2012 Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting

                  The mission of the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) is to turn ideas into action.

Established in 2005 by President Bill Clinton, the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) convenes global leaders to create and implement innovative solutions to the world's most pressing challenges. CGI Annual Meetings have brought together more than 150 heads of state, 20 Nobel Prize laureates, and hundreds of leading CEOs, heads of foundations and NGOs, major philanthropists, and members of the media. To date CGI members have made more than 2,300 commitments, which have improved the lives of over 400 million people in more than 180 countries. When fully funded and implemented, these commitments will be valued at more than $73.1 billion.

The CGI Annual Meeting is held each September in New York City. CGI also convenes CGI America, a meeting devoted to economic recovery and job creation in the United States, and CGI University (CGI U), which hosts an annual meeting for undergraduate and graduate students who are developing commitments in their communities and around the world.

2010 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting of the New Champions

                  At the Annual Meeting of the New Champions, the World Economic Forum brings together emerging global leaders and Mentors willing to share the knowledge and perception that only come with experience. It is this powerful mix of questioning, insight and resilience that makes the Summer Davos unique. This year’s Meeting focused on “Driving Growth through Sustainability”, an opportunity that confronts every business, government, civil society organization and individual. From the start of the three-day event, it was clear that participants understood the key factors needed to achieve this goal, especially in the post-crisis context. Throughout the Meeting, the nature of innovation and creativity in institutions, policies, systems and technologies was explored. To drive the innovation necessary to achieve balanced growth and sustainability requires many inputs, including a high degree of collaboration among all players, even rivals.

Item Description: The History Press Ltd, United Kingdom, 2013. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Language: English . Brand New Book. In 1903 the Wright Brothers achieved their dream of powered flight and from then on man s domination of the skies became a reality. The military potential of aircraft was obvious from the outset, first as a way of spying on the enemy with reconnaissance planes and balloons armed with early cameras, and then as a way of taking the battle into the skies, as planes became weapons of war. In Britain these early days of military aviation were pioneered by a group of enthusiastic civilians and military men who were based at Lark Hill, Wiltshire where the rolling plains became ideal flying grounds. Here, the first military aviation base came into existence. Flying with the Larks charts its early days and its influence on First World War aviation. Timothy Brown served in the Fleet Air Arm for many years. On moving to Wiltshire in 2006, he became fascinated with Salisbury Plain s aviation history, and involved in Lark Hill and the adjacent Stonehenge landscape.
