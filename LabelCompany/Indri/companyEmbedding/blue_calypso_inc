If Advertiser continues to use the Registered Services after Company changes these Advertiser Terms, then Advertiser accepts all such changes.
2. INFORMATION PROVISIONS.
2.1 CONFIDENTIALITY.

(g) Nothing in these Advertiser Terms will prevent Company or Company’s affiliates from complying with any applicable law (including any applicable privacy law).
(h) A breach or threatened breach of this Section 2.1 by Recipient may cause irreparable harm and injury to Discloser for which money damages are inadequate.

 Blue Calypso, Inc. (OTCQB:BCYP), an innovator of mobile consumer activation, engagement and social advocacy solutions for product brands and brick-and-mortar retailers, announced that Harold ‘Hal’ Brierley, chairman of the board of directors has stepped down from his role as chairman of the board and will transition to a senior advisory board member due to a recently announced commitment to the Brierley Institute for Customer Engagement at Southern Methodist University (SMU). Andrew Levi, founder and CEO will be appointed to chairman of the board.
“We appreciate the human and financial capital Hal has brought to Blue Calypso and understand his decision to oversee the nation’s first academic institute devoted to studying the ties that bind customers to services and products,” said Blue Calypso CEO, Andrew Levi.
“As a major shareholder, I will continue to support Blue Calypso in my advisory role and look forward to working with management to develop its customer engagement products,” said Brierley.
With this board change, Blue Calypso’s board is now comprised of four members, three of whom are independent directors.

Blue Calypso Files Form 15
Mar 30 17
Blue Calypso, Inc. has announced that it has filed a Form 15 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to voluntarily deregister its common stock, par value $0.0001 per share under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.


Blue Calypso To Explore Strategic Alternatives
Dec 20 16
Blue Calypso, Inc. (OTCPK:BCYP) has commenced a strategic and financial review with the objective to increase shareholder value. This review may result in Blue Calypso continuing to pursue value-enhancing initiatives as a standalone company, capital structure optimization, equity financing, secured or unsecured debt financing, a sale of the Company, a sale of certain assets of the Company or other business combination transaction. Blue Calypso's Board of Directors will be active in this process as will their legal counsel and other outside experts and advisors. Blue Calypso has not set a timetable for completion of its strategic review process but intends to update its shareholders as it deems necessary if any material developments occur. Blue Calypso provides no assurance, however, that the strategic review process will result in any transaction. "The board of directors is committed to increasing shareholder value," said Blue Calypso, Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Levi. "We have determined after careful consideration that this is an appropriate time to undertake a strategic and financial review of the business. In the most recent quarter, we aggressively reduced our monthly expenses which included significant cuts in sales, marketing, legal, public & investor relations expenses and a reduction in executive compensation. While the review is ongoing, the Company will remain focused on delivering improved financial performance by continuing to execute our strategic initiatives."


Blue Calypso, Inc. Reports Unaudited Consolidated Financial Results for the Third Quarter and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016
Nov 10 16
Blue Calypso, Inc. reported unaudited consolidated financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Revenue in the third quarter of 2016 decreased approximately 49% to $0.3 million versus $0.5 million in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in revenue is from its project based revenue which is subject to timing of development projects and as a result of licensing fees associated with related settlements. Net loss in the third quarter of 2016 totaled $1.1 million or $0.15 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $0.8 million or $0.16 per basic and diluted share in the same year-ago quarter. Loss from operations was $1,108,848 against $600,563 a year ago. The increase in net loss is primarily attributed to the result of share-based compensation, really the timing of that compensation.

For the nine-month period, the company reported revenues were $1,024,585 against $733,605 a year ago. Loss from operations was $2,565,022 against $1,903,781 a year ago. Net loss was $2,580,066 or $0.39 basic and diluted against $2,097,633 or $0.42 basic and diluted a year ago.

                                                                                                        BLUECALYPSO®   The idea for Blue Calypso was originated by Blue Calypso's founder, Andrew Levi, in early 2003. Mr. Levi's original idea was to allow people to become digital endorsers of brands, offerings or causes that they believe in by using their smartphones as a method of managing and distributing brand sponsorship through their personal relationships. Over the last five years, the world has seen social media, mobile technologies and digital advertising evolve dramatically and actually converge. Through this technological evolution, a sociological shift has occurred in how influential digital media can be when promoted within one's social circles, "friend-to-friend". The early success of Blue Calypso has confirmed the original concept that people will actively endorse products with which they have a strong emotional connection or brand loyalty - in fact it is our belief that people have always offered endorsement of products, services and brands for which they have an affinity.  The Blue Calypso platform leverages mobile and social technologies and rewards the endorsers for their loyalty and performance. Applications such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, FourSquare, Groupon, Living Social, Yelp and various blogs all incorporate this common idea, as people generally associate with people of like mind and they will willingly share their feelings about all types of experiences good or bad. This has always been an inherent part of social interaction of personal and professional relationships; however, today it has become an integral thread to message credibility and the establishment of an individual as an "influencer" within their social circles. Through these new mediums of communication and mobile technological improvements, Blue Calypso has been able to create a platform that solves advertisers' desires for more targeted and personal messaging and mobile subscribers' desire for content relevance.  The Blue Calypso platform enables advertisers' customers ("Endorsers") to personally endorse the brand within their social circles, delivering advertiser approved creative and interactive display campaigns and calls-to-action integrated with each endorsement. Using mobile and social media, everyone has their own audience and therefore can be considered a "micro-publisher". According to Facebook, the average user has 130 friends; Twitter states the average user has 300 followers; and on average an individual has 25 unique frequent contacts they communicate with weekly. Active participation in LinkedIn, Google+, Tumblr and/or a personal blog can further extend one's direct social reach significantly. As a result, individuals have the capability to immediately reach hundreds or even thousands of people through their direct personal and digital relationships.  With Blue Calypso, advertiser content is not bound by any single app, website, carrier or device. Once the message is shared by an Endorser it can be accessed via texts, Twitter "tweets" or LinkedIn or Facebook "posts". The Blue Calypso Network uses both the mobile web and location based services ("LBS"), allowing marketing messages to be distributed friend-to-friend regardless of device or carrier while remaining very targeted and relevant.  Our proprietary ad-rendering and delivery engine gives advertisers the ability to serve multiple creative display ads within the same campaign, targeting such specific conditions as geo-location, day-of-week, time-of-day, and even weather conditions. Our technology identifies the recipient's circumstance upon campaign view and delivers the right message with relevant creative content increasing campaign response rates. Implementation of multiple calls-to-action which go beyond links, including point-of-sale, geo-location specific offers, and metered mobile coupon redemptions, extend the capability of the Blue Calypso platform far beyond current digital or mobile advertising. The Blue Calypso system is comprised of two primary components. The Blue Calypso Network ("BCN") or back-end includes the data warehouse of ad and related content, the ad rendering engine, Endorser portal, brand portal, agency portal, administrative portal, and web services and communications clusters responsible for receipt and transmission of data and content. The second component is the mobile platforms, installed on Endorser smartphone devices and called Calyp (pronounced "klip"). Together the BCN and Calyp mobile applications (the "System") create smooth interaction and data flow between the Endorser community, brand advertisers, and Blue Calypso. The System is in its second generation of being publicly available with future releases of all components of the System planned for the foreseeable future. All revenue to date has been generated from use of the System. Endorsers are empowered to select how they would like to deliver campaign shares to their friends, choosing from texts (one-to-one), or through posts to their social media audience (one-to-many). When their audience clicks through to view a display campaign it is delivered in web and mobile web landing pages with desired calls-to-action and engaging interactivity Blue Calypso's powerful analytics and business intelligence capabilities provide advertisers (or their respective agencies on their behalf) the ability to see how campaigns are delivered, where they are getting the most traction, and which calls-to-action are seeing the most activity. The platform is also a great way to quickly test creative message response. Advertisers can launch multiple campaigns with the same calls-to-action, using real-time analytics to see which content getting a more viral response, and igniting the most conversation.                                                                                                        http://www.bluecalypso.com/Pages/news/news-and-press.aspx    	   CHICAGO, Sept. 23, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Mr. Ronald L.

Blue Calypso Expands IP Portfolio by Purchasing Mobile Gamification Technology    Pending patent broadens scope of existing patent family  New technology, branded DashTAGG, combines online and in-person gaming with physical locations and events  Partners prepare to beta test DashTAGG   DALLAS, TX — September 18, 2013 — Blue Calypso, Inc. (OTCBB: BCYP) developer of digital innovation products and services for the social media marketplace, increased its intellectual property portfolio by purchasing proprietary mobile gamification technology in an all-stock transaction for approximately $150,000.  Blue Calypso has already applied for one new patent based on the integration of this technology with its own platform. Management expects to further develop the intellectual property purchased as well as file a family of patent applications. This new family of patents combined with Blue Calypso’s existing patents, creates an unprecedented IP portfolio in the social media space.  The mobile technology which was purchased has been rebranded as DashTAGG™ which is a unique social mobile game of “tag” that requires both physical and digital participation. Games can be sponsored by one or more retailers, event sponsors or product manufacturers. To acquire “TAGGs,” players must visit participating retail locations and scan codes. While at these destinations, they may be presented with redeemable in-store offers. Top performers are rewarded for their participation with merchandise, points and badges.  “Adding gamification capabilities to our social amplification suite creates additional opportunities for product development and licensing,” stated Blue Calypso’s Founder and Chief Technology Officer Andrew Levi. “DashTAGG is similar to our other products as it targets entities that use social media and brand advocacy to influence brand awareness; therefore, we can leverage our existing sales and development infrastructure. We believe this transaction is an excellent example of our growth strategy at work and launches Blue Calypso into a unique un-tapped segment of influencer-driven marketing and advertising.”  “Our new technology bridges physical and digital gamification. We believe consumer-facing businesses, such as retailers, restaurants, media & entertainment, sports and major event planners, will seize the opportunity to use DashTAGG to increase in-store foot traffic, visitor-to-buyer conversion rates and influencer advocacy branding. Already, we have secured partners who are committed to beta version testing,” concluded Levi.    Blue Calypso, Inc. – Wed, Aug 21, 2013 1:24 PM EDT  	Blue Calypso, Inc. (BCYP) dismissed its patent infringement action against LivingSocial, Inc. pursuant to the terms of an otherwise confidential settlement and license agreement.  Bill Ogle, CEO of Blue Calypso, stated, “Blue Calypso develops IP that it patents, licenses and embeds in digital innovation products and services for the social media marketplace. Our proven, patented technology platform helps users launch content and promotions into social media channels. We intend to vigorously defend our patents and will continue to develop new products based upon our growing IP portfolio.”
