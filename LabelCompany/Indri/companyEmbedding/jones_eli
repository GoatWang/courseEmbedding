Dr. Eli G. Jones 



Dr. Eli G. Jones was an Eclectic physician
            whose main work was published in 1911. Over the course of his
            long career, he treated 20,000 patients with cancer. He claimed
            an 80% success rate. For the last several years, I have been
            working with various herbalists to recreate some of the products
            Jones used in his practice. These are available on an experimental
            basis and feedback on their use would be much appreciated. Effective
            June 1, 2002, these products have only been available through
            licensed practitioners. If interested in these products, please
            have your practitioner contact us.



Given the confidence Dr.
              Jones had in his "compound syrup scrophularia," this
              was the first product we developed. He left his recipe for
              posterity, saying: 

It has been the earnest study of my life
              to find such a combination which I could leave as a help to
              my brother physicians in their efforts to cure the more desperate
              forms of this disease. I have the utmost faith in the curative
              power of this combination . . . great care should be taken
              to get fresh herbs to make the syrup. 

Dr. Jones recommended that patients
            take one tablespoon of the syrup three times a day. It took two
            years to find quality sources of the herbs and make them exactly
            as Jones directed (using a steam displacement process.) We have
            now been producing this syrup for quite a few years; not surprisingly,
            it is my personal favorite of all the formulas we produce. I
            like it better than even my own formulas which include the much
            more popular Indigo Drops, Whale's Tears, and Feathered Turtle
            Crème.
 Besides tasting delicious, it
            seems, as the name would suggest, to offer great relief for conditions
            that are characterized by swelling and lumps. Scrofula was the
            word used in times past to describe lumps and bumps in the lymphatic
            system that were believed to be related to tuberculosis,
            other infections, and tumors, both benign and malignant.
It is my conviction that syrups
            such as this one are superior to tinctures and teas because the
            process used in making them assures that more parts of the herbs
            go into the medicine. Both the alcohol and water soluble constituents
            are captured; and the sweetness assures quick uptake into the
            bloodstream. Darkfield microscope examinations of the blood suggest
            that this as well as the trifolium
            syrup—our Sundance Elixir—are
            excellent blood purifiers.




The syrup is available
                in 16 oz. bottles. There is also an extract that does
                not contain any honey; it comes in 4 oz. bottles. It is produced
                under the name of Seneca Elixir.


For more information
                on this and other products based on the legacies of Dr. Eli
                Jones, see my book and the list below. Pages 103-120 of my book contain
                material on Jones and his methodology. His escharotic formulae,
                poultice powder, healing salve, and recipe for compound syrup
                scrophularia can be found in the appendix on pages 191-193.

He   claimed              an 80% success rate. Sacred Medicine Sanctuary has been working for many  years to recreate some of the   products              Jones used in his practice. 


 
 


 


Algonquin Drops, 2 oz.

This is the Eli Jones formula that he called "Cancer Drops" because it addresses some of what he regarded as the underlying causes of cancer, such as vaccine residuals, lymphatic congestion, and lowered immunity.

Algonquin Drops, 6 pages 

Alcohol: 56-58% 
Contents: Baptisia tinctoria (wild indigo), Phytolacca (poke root), and Thuja occidentalis (white cedar) in Organic Alcohol, Distilled Water, and Vegetable Glycerin. 
 
  $













Belladonna Crème, 30 ml.



Alcohol: none 
Contents: phytolacca, arnica, and belladonnain a base of olive oil with essential oils of lemon and lime as well as geranium. 
 
  $













Homeopathic Thuja 30X

Many use thuja to relieve the harmful side effects of vaccinations.

Alcohol: none 
Contents: Thuja 30X. 
 
  $













Phytolacca Ointment, 30 ml. 

Dr. Eli G. Jones recommended this for use on scar tissue related to breast cancer, but most people who have been using this product have also applied it on swollen lymph nodes. It requires perseverance, but professional massage therapists have been getting good results. This product has been reformulated and contains essential oils of lemon, lime, and bay laurel in addition to the poke root, olive oil, and beeswax. To protect the ointment from harmful light, this is packaged in violet glass.

Alcohol: none 
Contents: This product has been reformulated and contains essential oils of lemon, lime, and bay laurel in addition to the poke root, olive oil, and beeswax. 
 
  $













Phytolacca Syrup, 8 oz. 

Dr. Jones advised its use with older patients and those whose appetites are poor. He also suggested that people with breast cancer whose breast is hard "like old cheese" use this syrup. In addition, he prescribed it for patients with tumors of the throat, uterus, and rectum. For those with cancer of the tongue, he added potassium iodide to the basic tonic.

Alcohol: 18% 
Contents: fresh Phytolacca americana root, Gentiana lutea, fresh Taraxacum officinale root, and fresh Taraxacum officinale leaf in distilled water, organic grain alcohol, vegetable glycerin, honey, and essential oil of lemon. 
 
  $













Poultice Powder, 6 oz.

This is the original mixture of herbs as described by Dr. Eli G. Jones.  However, substitutions are possible.  The herbs are mixed with water, one application at a time, and gently placed over suppurating wounds. Depending on the amount of discharge, the poultices may have to be changed as often as every half hour or perhaps as little as twice a day.  They will absorb purulent matter, reduce odor, and help to disinfect the site.

Alcohol: 
Contents: powdered slippery elm bark, flax seed, lobelia seed, and bayberry bark.  
 
  $













Seneca Elixir, 16 oz.

At the end of a forty-year career of treating cancer patients, Dr. Eli G. Jones published a book describing his cancer treatments. His final gift to his "brother physicians" was the recipe for the elixir that he regarded as the most important item in his repertoire of treatments.
Our experience is that this product is also an excellent parasiticide.

Alcohol: 22% 
Contents: Proprietary formula containing concentrated extracts of: Scrophularia nodosa, Phytolacca americana, Rumex crispus, Celastrus scandens, Podophyllum peltatum, Juniperus communis, Corydalis formosa, Guaiacum officinale, and Xanthoxylum herculis in distilled water, organic grain alcohol, organic honey, glycerin, and essential oil of lemon. 
 
  $













Seneca Extract, 4 oz.

Based of the historic formula of Dr. Eli G. Jones called Compound Syrup Scrophularia
Proprietary formula containing concentrated extracts of: Scrophularia nodosa, Phytolacca americana, Rumex crispus, Celastrus scandens, Podophyllum peltatum, Juniperus communis, Corydalis formosa, Guaiacum officinale, and Xanthoxylum herculis in distilled water, organic grain alcohol, organic honey, glycerin, and essential oil of lemon. 

Alcohol: 48% 
Contents: Proprietary formula containing concentrated extracts of: Scrophularia nodosa whole plant, Phytolacca americana root, Rumex crispus root, Celastrus scandens root, Podophyllum peltatum root, Juniperus communis berry, Corydalis formosa tuber, Guaiacum officinale resin, and Xanthoxylum clava-herculis seed in distilled water, organic grain alcohol, organic honey, and glycerin.

Eli Jones
　　Eli Jones (1850-1933) was a medical doctor in the 19th-20th centuries who claimed to be able to treat cancer. He is the author of Cancer - Its Causes, Symptoms and Treatment -Giving the Results of over Forty Years' Experience in the Medical Treatment of this Disease and Definite Medication.
　　Jones studied conventional medicine and practiced for five years before deciding that the medicine of the day was harmful, due to its dependence upon harsh cathartics like calomel. He then turned to eclectic medicine, which relied upon herbal extracts including those of the Native Americans, went back to school, graduated, and practiced eclectic medicine for another five years. He decided to learn homeopathy, went back to school, and then practiced as a homeopath. He next turned to Physiomedicalism and, after studying, practiced that for another five years. And finally, he studied Dr. Willhelm Heinrich Schüssler's biochemic cell salts, which is similar to homeopathy, but relies upon salts found in the body and practiced that.  After his forays into the various medical schools of his time, Jones developed a syncretic practice using all the schools he had learned. He tended to use a low dosage herbal tinctures or homeopathic mother tinctures in high doses. His Definite Medication proposed ow dosage herbal extracts and engendered opposition from non-homeopaths.
　　Jones also published A Journal of Therapeutic Facts for the Busy Doctor, which gave doctors the pro and con experience of various treatments. The 1912 and 1913 issues have been transcribed by David Winston.

This study decomposes OC into its components and finds that OC based on a salesperson’s intrinsic values (normative commitment) does not drive effort, but OC that stems from excitement and emotion (affective commitment) does.Autores: Eli Jones, Willy Bolander, Ph.D., Frank Q.

Company profile[edit]




Eli Lilly and Company's global headquarters, in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States


A Fortune 500 corporation, Eli Lilly had revenues of $20 billion in 2008, making it the 148th largest company in the United States and the 10th largest corporation by global pharmaceutical sales. The company is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange and is a member of the S&P 500 stock index. Eli Lilly was one of the Nifty Fifty stocks that propelled the mid-twentieth-century bull market.[citation needed]
Eli Lilly is a full member of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA).[2]
According to Forbes, Lilly ranked as the 243rd largest public company in the world in 2016, with sales of US$20 billion and a market value of $86 billion.[3]
As of 1997 it was the largest corporation and the largest charitable benefactor in Indiana.[4]
History[edit]
Company founder[edit]
Main article: Eli Lilly
The company's founder was Colonel Eli Lilly, a pharmaceutical chemist and Union army veteran of the American Civil War.[5] Lilly served as the company president until his death in 1898.[6] A stylized version of his signature still appears in the company's red logo.[5]
In 1869, after working for drugstores in Greencastle and Indianapolis, Indiana, Lilly became a partner in a Paris, Illinois, drugstore with James W. Binford.[7] Although the drugstore was profitable, Lilly was more interested in medicinal manufacturing than running a pharmacy. He began formulating plans to create a company of his own. Lilly left the partnership with Binford in 1873 and returned to Indianapolis. Lilly opened a drug manufacturing operation called Johnston and Lilly with John F. Johnston as his partner in 1874, but dissolved the failing partnership on March 27, 1876. Lilly used his share of the assets, which amounted to an estimated $400 in merchandise (several pieces of equipment and a few gallons of unmixed chemicals) and about $1,000 in cash, to open his own pharmaceutical manufacturing business in Indianapolis in May 1876.[8][9] His new business venture became Eli Lilly and Company.




Colonel Eli Lilly (1838–1898), founder


Early days: 1870s–1900[edit]
On May 10, 1876, Lilly opened his own laboratory in a rented, two-story brick building (now demolished) at 15 West Pearl Street in Indianapolis, where he began to manufacture medicinal drugs. The sign outside, above the shop's door, read: "Eli Lilly, Chemist."[5][10][11] Lilly began his manufacturing venture with $1,400 ($31,163 in 2015 chained dollars) in working capital and three employees: Albert Hall (chief compounder), Caroline Kruger (bottler and product finisher), and Lilly's fourteen-year-old son, Josiah (J. K.), who had quit school to work with his father as an apprentice.[12][9]
One of the first medicines that Lilly began to produce was quinine, a drug used to treat malaria. The result was a "ten fold" increase in sales.[13] At the end of 1876, his first year of business, sales reached $4,470 ($99,499 in 2015 chained dollars).[13] At the end of 1877 sales reached $11,318 ($251,932 in 2015 chained dollars),[14] and by 1879 they had grown to $48,000 ($1,221,086 in 2015 chained dollars).[13] Lilly hired his brother, James, as his first full-time salesman in 1878. James and the subsequent sales team marketed the company's drugs nationally.[15]
The company outgrew its first location on Pearl Street, where it remained from 1876 to 1878, and moved to larger quarters at 36 South Meridian Street. In 1881 Lilly purchased a complex of buildings on property at McCarty and Alabama Streets and moved the company to its new headquarters in Indianapolis's south-side industrial area. Lilly later purchased additional facilities for research and production.[16][17]
Lilly committed himself to producing high-quality prescription drugs, in contrast to the common and often ineffective patent medicines. From its facilities in Indianapolis the company manufactured and sold "ethical drugs" for use by the medical profession. Lilly's medicines included labels that disclosed product ingredients.[5] Lilly's first innovation was gelatin-coating for pills and capsules. The company’s other early innovations included fruit flavorings and sugarcoated pills, which made the medicines easier to swallow.[12]
In 1881 Lilly formally incorporated the business as Eli Lilly and Company, elected a board of directors, and issued stock to family members and close associates.[15] Colonel Lilly's only son, Josiah (J. K.), a pharmaceutical chemist, graduated from the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy in 1882, and joined the family business as a superintendent of its laboratory after college. J. K. became company president in 1898.[18] In 1883 the company contracted to mix and sell Succus Alteran, its first widely successful product and one its best sellers. The product was marketed as a "blood purifier" and as a treatment for syphilis, some types of rheumatism, and skin diseases such as eczema and psoriasis.[17][19] Sales from this product provided funds for Lilly to expand its manufacturing and research facilities.[14] By the late 1880s Colonel Lilly was one of the Indianapolis area's leading businessmen, whose company had more than one-hundred employees and had $200,000 ($5,276,296 in 2015 chained dollars) in annual sales.[7]
As the Lilly company grew, other businesses set up operations near the plant on Indianapolis's near south side. The area developed into one of the city's major business and industrial hubs. Lilly's production, manufacturing, research, and administrative operations in Indianapolis eventually occupied a complex of more than two dozen buildings covering a fifteen-block area, as well as production plants along Kentucky Avenue.[20]

Around 1890 Colonel Lilly turned over the day-to-day management of the business to his son, J. K., who ran the company for thirty-four years. Although the 1890s were a tumultuous decade economically, the company flourished and came out stronger than ever.[7][21] In 1894 Lilly purchased a manufacturing plant to be used solely for creating capsules. The company also made several technological advances in the manufacturing process, including automating its capsule production. Over the next few years the company annually created tens of millions of capsules and pills.[22]
Until the turn of the century Lilly operated in Indianapolis and the surrounding area as many other pharmaceutical businesses did—manufacturing and selling "sugar-coated pills, fluid extracts, elixirs, and syrups."[19] The company used plants for its raw materials and produced its products by hand. One historian noted, "Although the Indianapolis firm was more careful in making and promoting drugs that the patent medicine men of the era, the company remained ambivalent about scientific research."[19]
In addition to Colonel Lilly, his brother, James, and son, Josiah (J. K.), the growing company employed other Lilly family. Colonel Lilly's cousin, Evan Lilly, was hired as a bookkeeper.[21] As young boys, Lilly's grandsons, Eli and Josiah Jr. (Joe), ran errands and performed other odd jobs. Eli and Joe joined the family business after college. Eventually, each grandson served as company president and chairman of the board.[23]
Josiah (J. K.), Colonel Lilly's son and Eli and Joe's father, inherited the company after Colonel Lilly died and became its president in 1898.[6] At the time of Colonel Lilly's death the company had a product line of 2,005 items and annual sales of more than $300,000 ($8,547,600 in 2015 chained dollars).[24] Colonel Lilly was a pioneer in the modern pharmaceutical industry, with many of his early innovations later becoming standard practice. His ethical reforms in a trade that was marked by outlandish claims of miracle medicines began a period of rapid advancement in the development of medicinal drugs.[25] J. K. Lilly continued to advocate for federal regulation on medicines.[26] Under J. K.'s leadership, the company introduced scientific management concepts, organized the company's research department, increased its sales force, and began international distribution of its products.[27] In addition J. K. oversaw a large expansion of the company. By 1905 the company reached sales of $1 million ($26,381,481 in 2015 chained dollars).[6]

Modernization:1900–40[edit]
Just before and after World War I, the Lilly company experienced rapid change.[19] Expansion of Lilly's manufacturing facilities at the McCarty Street plant improved production capacity with a new Science Building (Building 14), opened in 1911, and a new capsule plant (Building 15) in 1913.[28] The company also began constructions of the Lilly Biological Laboratories, a research and manufacturing plant on 150 acres near Greenfield, Indiana, in 1913.[29][30]
In addition to development of new medicines, the company achieved several technological advances, including automation of its production facilities. Lilly was also an innovator in pill capsule manufacturing. It was among the first manufacturers to insert medications into empty gelatin capsules, which provided a more exact dosage.[5] Lilly manufactured capsules for its own needs and sold its excess capacity to others.[31] A 1917 Scientific American article claimed the Lilly operation in Indianapolis was "the largest capsule factory in the world" and was "capable of producing 2.5 million capsules a day".[31] One of Lilly's innovations was fruit flavoring for medicines and sugar-coated pills to make their medicines easier to swallow.[12] Over the next few years the company began to create tens of millions of capsules and pills annually.[22]
Other advances improved plant efficiency and eliminated production errors. Eli Lilly, grandson of the company founder, introduced a method for blueprinting manufacturing tickets in 1909.[32] This process, which created multiples copies of a drug formula, helped eliminate manufacturing and transcription errors.[31] In the 1920s Eli introduced the new concept of straight-line production, where raw materials entered at one end of the facility and the finished product came out the other end, in the company’s manufacturing process. Under Eli’s supervision, the design for Building 22, a new 5-floor plant that opened in Indianapolis in 1926, implemented the straight-line concept to improve production efficiency and lower production costs.[33][34] One historian noted, "It was probably the most sophisticated production system in the American pharmaceutical industry."[34] This more efficient manufacturing process also allowed the company to hire a regular workforce. Instead of recalling workers at peak times and laying them off when production demand fell, Lilly's regular workforce produced less-costly medicines in off-peak times using the same manufacturing facilities.[23]
During the 1920s the introduction of new products also brought the company financial success.[19] In 1919 Josiah hired biochemist George Henry Alexander Clowes as director of biochemical research. In 1921 three University of Toronto scientists, J. J. R. Macleod, Frederick G. Banting, and Charles H. Best, were working on the development of insulin for treatment of diabetes.[35] Clowes and Eli Lilly met with the researchers in 1922 to negotiate an agreement with the University of Toronto scientists to mass-produce insulin.[36] The collaboration led to the first successful large-scale production of insulin.[37] In 1923 Lilly began selling Iletin (Insulin, Lilly), their tradename for the first commercially available insulin product in the U.S for the treatment of diabetes.[38] Banting and Macleod won a Nobel Prize in 1923 for their research. Insulin, "the most important drug" in the company’s history, did "more than any other" to make Lilly "one of the major pharmaceutical manufacturers in the world."[35]
The success of insulin enabled the company to attract well-respected scientists and, with them, make more medical advances. By its fiftieth anniversary in 1926 sales reached $9 million and the company produced more than 2,800 different items.[23] In 1928 Lilly introduced Liver Extract 343 for the treatment of pernicious anemia, a blood disorder, in a joint venture with two Harvard University scientists, George R. Minot and William P. Murphy. In 1930 Lilly introduced Liver Extract No. 55 in collaboration with George Whipple, a University of Rochester scientist.[39] Minot, Murphy, and Whipple won the 1934 Nobel Prize in medicine for their research.[40]
Despite the economic challenges of the Great Depression, Lilly's sales rose to $13 million in 1932.[41] That same year Eli Lilly, the eldest grandson of Col. Lilly, was named as the company's president to succeed his father, who remained as chairman of the board until 1948. Eli joined the family business in 1909.[6] In his early years at the company Eli was especially interested in improving production efficiency and introduced a number of labor-saving devices. He also introduced scientific management principles and implemented cost-savings measures that modernized the company.[42] In addition Eli was involved in expanding the company’s research efforts and collaborations with university researchers.[43]
In 1934 the firm opened two new facilities on the McCarty Street complex: a replica of Lilly’s 1876 laboratory and the new Lilly Research Laboratories, "one of the most fully equipped facilities in the world."[44] In the 1930s the company also continued expansion overseas.[45] In 1934 Eli Lilly and Company Limited, the company's first overseas subsidiary was established in England, with headquarters in London and a manufacturing plant in Basingstoke.[41][45]
Expansion: 1940–70[edit]
World War II brought production at Lilly to a new high with the manufacturing of Merthiolate and penicillin. During the war Lilly also cooperated with the American Red Cross to process blood plasma and by war's end the company had dried over two million pints of blood, "about 20 percent of the United States' total".[46] Merthiolate, first introduced in 1930, was an "anticeptic and germicide" that became a U.S. army "standard issue" during World War II.[47][48] In the early 1940s Lilly became one of the companies mass-producing penicillin.[49]
International operations expanded even further during World War II.[45] Eli Lilly International Corp. was formed in 1943 as a subsidiary to encourage business trade abroad. By 1948 Lilly employees worked in thirty-five countries, most of them as sales representatives in Latin America, Asia, and Africa.[45]
At the end of World War II the company continued to grow. In 1945 Lilly began a major expansion effort that would include two manufacturing operations in Indianapolis. The company purchased the massive Curtiss-Wright propeller plant on South Kentucky Avenue, west of the company's McCarty Street operation. When renovation was completed in mid-1947, the Kentucky Avenue location manufactured antibiotics and capsules and housed the company’s shipping department.[50] By 1948 Lilly employed nearly 7,000 people.[10]
Eli Lilly, who had served as the company's president since 1932, retired from active management of the company in 1948, became chairman of the board, and relinquished the presidency to his brother, Josiah K. Lilly, Jr. (Joe).[51] During Eli's sixteen-year presidency sales rose from $13 million in 1932 to $117 million in 1948. Joe joined the company in 1914 and concentrated on the company's personnel and marketing efforts.[24] He served as company president from 1948 to 1953, then became chairman of the board and remained in that capacity until his death in 1966.[52] In 1952 the company offered its first public shares of stock.[53] In 1953 Eugene N. Beesley was named the company's new president, the first non-family member to run the company.
Over the next several decades Lilly continued to develop and introduce new drugs to the marketplace. In the 1950s Lilly introduced two new antibiotics: vancomycin and erythromycin. In addition Lilly was heavily involved in production and distribution of Jonas Salk's poliomyelitis (polio) vaccine. In 1954 the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (NFIP) contracted with five pharmaceutical companies to produce Salk's polio vaccine for clinical trials. These included Lilly as well as Parke, Davis and Company, Cutter Laboratories, Wyeth Laboratories, and Pitman-Moore Company.[54] Lilly's selection to produce the vaccine was, in part, due to its previous experience in collaborations with university researchers.[55] Lilly manufactured 60 percent of the Salk vaccine in 1955.
During the mid-twentieth century Lilly continued to expand its production facilities outside of Indianapolis. In 1950 Lilly began Tippecanoe Laboratories in Lafayette, Indiana,[56] and increased antibiotic production with its patent on erythromycin. In 1954 Lilly formed Elanco Products Company for the production of veterinary pharmaceuticals. In 1969 the company opened a new plant in Clinton, Indiana.[56]
After a company reorganization and transition to non-family management in 1953, Lilly continued to expand its global presence. In the 1960s Lilly operated thirteen affiliate companies outside the United States.[57] In 1962, with an acquisition from Distillers Company, the company established a major factory in Liverpool, England. In 1968 Lilly built its first research facility, the Lilly Research Centre Limited, outside the United States near London, England.
1970– present[edit]
During the 1970s and 1980s, Eli Lilly and Company saw a flurry of drug production: an antibiotic, Keflex, in 1971; a heart drug, Dobutrex, in 1977; Ceclor, which would become the world's top selling oral antibiotic, in 1979; a leukemia drug, Eldisine; an antiarthritic, Oraflex; and an analgesic, Darvon. When generic drugs flooded the marketplace after the expiration of patents for drugs discovered in the 1950s and 1960s, Lilly diversified into other areas, most notably agricultural chemicals, animal-health products, cosmetics, and medical instruments.
To further diversify its product line, Lilly made an uncharacteristic, but ultimately profitable move in 1971, when it bought cosmetic manufacturer Elizabeth Arden, Inc. for $38 million. Although the subsidiary continued to lose money for five years after Lilly acquired it, executive management changes at Arden helped turn it into a financial success. By 1982 the subsidiary's "sales were up 90 percent from 1978, with profits doubling to nearly $30 million." Sixteen years after its acquisition, Lilly sold Arden to Fabergé in 1987 for $657 million.[58]
In 1977 Lilly ventured into medical instruments with the acquisition of IVAC Corporation, which manufactures vital signs and intravenous fluid infusion monitoring systems. Lilly also purchased Cardiac Pacemakers Incorporated, a manufacturer of heart pacemakers in 1977. In 1980 Lilly acquired Physio-Control Corporation. Other acquisitions included Advance Cardiovasular Systems Incorporated in 1984, Hybritech in 1986, and Devices for Vascular Intervention, Incorporated in 1989. Lilly acquired Pacific Biotech in 1990 and Origin Medsystems and Heart Rhythm Technologies, Incorporated in 1992. In the early 1990s Lilly combined these medical equipment companies into a Medical Devices and Diagnostics Division that "contributed about 20 percent" of Lilly’s annual revenues.
In 1989 a joint agri-chemical venture between Elanco Products Company and Dow Chemical created DowElanco. In 1997 Lilly sold its 40 percent share in the company to Dow Chemical for $1.2 billion and the name was changed to Dow AgroSciences.[59][60][61]
In 1994 Lilly acquired PCS Systems, a drug delivery business for Health Maintenance Organizations, and later added two similar organizations to its holdings.[62] Lilly purchased PCS, which was the largest U.S. prescription drug benefits manager at the time, for $4 billion.[63]
In 1991 Vaughn Bryson was named CEO of Eli Lilly. During his 20-month tenure, the company reported its first quarterly loss as a publicly traded company.[64] In 1993 Randall L. Tobias, a vice-chairman of AT&T Corporation and Lilly board member, was named Lilly's chairman, president, and CEO after "product and competitive pressures" had "steadily eroded Lilly's stock price since early 1992."[65] Tobias was the first president and CEO recruited from outside of the company. Under Tobias's leadership the company "cut costs and narrowed its mission".[66] Lilly sold companies in its Medical Device and Diagnostics Division, expanded international sales, made new acquisitions, and funded additional research and product development. Sidney Taurel, former chief operating officer of Lilly, was named CEO in 1998, replacing Tobias. Taurel was named chairman in January 1999. In 2000 Lilly reported $10.86 billion in net sales.




Eli Lilly's present day global manufacturing plants.


In 1998 Eli Lilly formed a joint venture with Icos Corporation (ICOS), a Bothell, Washington-based biotechnology company, to develop and commercialize Cialis, a product for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. In October 2006 Lilly announced its intention to acquire Icos for $2.1 billion, or $32 per share.[67] After its initial attempt to acquire Icos failed under pressure from large institutional shareholders, Lilly revised its offer to $34 per share. Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), a proxy advisory firm, advised Icos shareholders to reject the proposal as undervalued,[68][69] but the buyout was approved by Icos shareholders and Lilly completed its acquisition of the company on January 29, 2007.[70][71] Lilly closed Icos manufacturing operations, terminated nearly 500 Icos employees, and left 127 employees working at the biologics facility.[72] In December 2007 CMC Biopharmaceuticals A/S (CMC), a Copenhagen, Denmark-based provider of contract biomanufacturing services, bought the Bothell-based biologics facility from Lilly and retained the existing 127 employees.[69][72][73]
In January 2009, the largest criminal fine in U.S. history, totaling $1.415 billion was imposed on Lilly for illegal marketing of its best-selling product, the atypical antipsychotic medication, Zyprexa.[74]
In January 2011, Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly and Company announced their global agreement for the joint development and marketing of new APIs for diabetes therapy. Lilly could receive more than one billion dollars for their work on the project, while Boehringer Ingelheim could receive more than $800 million from development of the new drugs.[75] Oral anti-diabetic of Boehringer Ingelheim–Linagliptin and BI 10773–and two insulin analogs of Lilly–LY2605541 and LY2963016–were in phase II and III of clinical developmentat that time.[76]
In April 2014, Lilly announced plans to buy Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG's animal health business for $5.4 billion in cash to strengthen and diversify its Elanco unit. Lilly said it planned to fund the deal with about $3.4 billion of cash on hand and $2 billion of loans.[77] As a condition of the acquisition, the Sentinel heartworm treatment would be divested to Virbac in order to avoid a monopoly in a subsector of the heartworm treatment market.[78]
In March 2015, the company announced it would join Hanmi Pharmaceutical in developing and commercialising Hanmi's phase I Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor HM71224 in a deal which could yield $690 million.[79] A day later the company announced another deal with Innovent Biologics, Inc to co-develop and commercialise at least three of Innovents treatments over the next decade, in a deal which could generate up to $456 million. As part of the deal the company will contribute its c-Met monoclonal antibody whilst Innovent will contribute a monoclonal antibody which targets CD-20. The second compound from Innovent is a preclinical immuno-oncology molecule.[80] The following week the company announced it would restart its collaboration with Pfizer surrounding the Phase III trial of Tanezumab. Pfizer is expected to receive an upfront sum of $200 million from the company.[81] In April 2015, the company engaged CBRE Group to sell its biomanufacturing facility in Vacaville, California.[82] The facility resides on a 52 acres (0.21 km2) campus and is one of the largest biopharmaceutical manufacturing centers in the United States.[82]
In January 2017, the company announced it would acquire CoLucid Pharmaceuticals for $960 million, specifically gaining the late clinical-stage migraine therapy candidate, lasmiditan,[83] with the deal completing in March.[84] In march, the company also announced that it had completed the acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc's (a subsidiary of Boehringer Ingelheim) US feline, canine and rabies vaccines portfolio.[85]

Collaborative research[edit]
Further information: Lilly Research Laboratories
Eli Lilly and Company has a long history of collaboration with research scientists. In 1886 Ernest G. Eberhardt, a chemist, joined the company as its first full-time research scientist.[97] Lilly also hired two botanists, Walter H. Evans and John S. Wright, to join its early research efforts.[14][98] After World War I the company’s expanded production facilities and introduction of new management methods set the stage for Lilly's next crucial phase—its "aggressive entry into scientific research and development."[10] The first big step came in 1919 when Josiah Lilly hired biochemist George Henry Alexander Clowes as director of biochemical research.[99] Clowes had extensive medical research expertise and links to the scientific research community, which led to the company's collaborations with researchers in the U.S. and elsewhere.[100] Clowes's first major collaboration with researchers who developed insulin at the University of Toronto significantly impacted the company’s future.[100] Lilly’s success with insulin production secured the company's position as a leading research-based pharmaceutical manufacturer, allowing it to attract and hire more research scientists and to collaborate with other universities in additional medical research.[101] In 1934 the company built a new research laboratory in Indianapolis.[35] As part of its research and product development process Lilly also conducted clinical studies at Indianapolis City Hospital (Wishard Memorial Hospital). Lilly continues to conduct clinical studies to test medications before their introduction to the market.[102] In 1949 Eli Lilly actually went into partnership with the United States Army Reserve setting up a local Strategic Intelligence Research and Analysis (SIRA)Unit to allow employees to research company data for the Scientific Logistics and Eurasian fields of study (source: declassified Defense Intelligence Agency document MDR -0191-2008 dated 17 Sep 2012). In 1998 the company dedicated new laboratories for clinical research at the Indiana University Medical Center in Indianapolis.
Publicly funded research[edit]
In addition to internal research and development activities Lilly is also involved in publicly funded research projects with other industrial and academic partners. One example in the area of non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox, a collaboration with pharmaceutical companies, research organizations, and the European Commission to improve the safety of drugs.[103][104] In 2008 this consortium, which included Lilly S.A. (Switzerland), secured a €8 million budget for a 40-month project that was coordinated by the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), an organization who represents the research-based pharmaceutical industry and biotech companies operating in Europe.[104][105][106] In 2008 Lilly's activities included research projects within the framework of the Innovative Medicines Initiative, a public-private research initiative in Europe that is a joint effort of the EFPIA and the European Commission.[107][108][109]
Pharmaceutical brands[edit]
The company's most important products introduced prior to World War II included insulin, which Lilly marketed as Iletin (Insulin, Lilly), Amytal, Merthiolate, ephedrine, and liver extracts.[48] Introduced in 1923, Iletin (Insulin, Lilly) was Lilly's first commercial insulin product. In 2002 the company was the leading producer of products for those with diabetes.[citation needed]
During World War II Lilly produced penicillins and other antibiotics. In addition to penicillin, other wartime production included "antimalarials," blood plasma, encephalitis vaccine, typhus and influenza vaccine, gas gangrene antitoxin, Merthiolate, and Iletin (Insulin, Lilly).[110]
Among the company's more recent pharmaceutical developments are cephalosporin, erythromycin, and Prozac (fluoxetine), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for the treatment of clinical depression. Ceclor, introduced in the 1970s, was an oral cephalosporin antibiotic. Prozac, introduced in the 1980s, quickly became the company's best-selling product for treatment of depression, but Lilly lost its U.S. patent protection for this product in 2001. Among other distinctions, Lilly is the world's largest manufacturer and distributor of medications used in a broad range of psychiatric and mental health-related conditions, including clinical depression, generalized anxiety disorder, narcotic addiction, insomnia, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and others.
Cialis[edit]
Further information: Tadalafil
In 2003, Eli Lilly introduced Cialis (tadalafil), a competitor to Pfizer's blockbuster Viagra for erectile dysfunction. Cialis maintains an active period of 36 hours, causing it sometimes to be dubbed the "weekend pill". Cialis was developed in a partnership with biotechnology company Icos Corporation. On December 18, 2006, Lilly bought Icos in order to gain full control of the product.[111]
Cymbalta[edit]
Further information: Duloxetine
Another Lilly manufactured anti-depressant, Cymbalta, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor used predominantly in the treatment of major depressive disorders and generalized anxiety disorder, ranks with Prozac as one of the most financially successful pharmaceuticals in industry history. It is also used in the treatment of fibromyalgia, neuropathy, chronic pain and osteoarthritis.[citation needed]
Gemzar[edit]
Further information: Gemcitabine
In 1996 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Gemzar for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Gemzar is commonly used in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, usually in coordination with 5-FU chemotherapy and radiology. Gemzar also is routinely used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.
Methadone[edit]
Further information: Methadone
Eli Lilly was the first distributor of methadone, an analgesic used frequently in the treatment of heroin, opium and other opioid and narcotic drug addictions.[citation needed]
Prozac[edit]
Further information: Fluoxetine
Prozac was one of the first therapies in its class to treat clinical depression by blocking the uptake of serotonin within the human brain. It is prescribed to more than fifty-four million people worldwide.[citation needed] Prozac was approved by the U.S. FDA in 1987 for use in treating depression. In 2001 Lilly lost its U.S. patent protection for Prozac and in January 2002 the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Lilly's final appeal, a decision that allows other companies to make generic versions of the drug. Prozac has given rise to a number of comparably functioning therapies for the treatment of clinical depression and other central nervous system disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder, bulimia nervosa, and panic disorders.[citation needed]
Prozac in popular culture[edit]
Because of its wide appeal as a popular anti-depressant, references to Prozac have appeared in books, movies, and music. Prozac Nation (1994), an autobiographical book by Elizabeth Wurtzel, was turned into a film of the same name in 2001 and starred Christina Ricci. Listening to Prozac (1993), by Peter Kramer, was a generally analytical look at Prozac and its uses, not only to treat disorders but to diagnose them as well. Talking Back to Prozac (1994), by psychiatrist Peter Breggin, focuses on Prozac's side effects. Rapper Jay-Z referenced Prozac in the song, "Nigga What, Nigga Who" (1998). In HBO's fictional series, The Sopranos, Tony Soprano's use of Prozac is periodically referenced.[citation needed]
Secobarbital[edit]
Further information: Secobarbital
Eli Lilly has manufactured Secobarbital, a barbiturate derivative with anaesthetic, anticonvulsant, sedative and hypnotic properties. Lilly marketed Secobarbital under the brand name Seconal. Secobarbital is indicated for the treatment of epilepsy, temporary insomnia and as a pre-operative medication to produce anaesthesia and anxiolysis in short surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures which are minimally painful. With the onset of new therapies for the treatment of these conditions, Secobarbital has been less utilized, and Lilly ceased manufacturing it in 2001.[citation needed]
Secobarbital overdoses[edit]
Secobarbital gained considerable attention during the 1970s, when it gained wide popularity as a recreational drug. On September 18, 1970, rock guitarist legend Jimi Hendrix died from a secobarbital overdose. On June 22, 1969, secobarbital overdose was the cause of death of actress Judy Garland. The drug was a central part of the plot of the hugely popular novel Valley of the Dolls (1966) by Jacqueline Susann in which three highly successful Hollywood women each fall victim, in various ways, to the drug. The novel was later released as a film by the same name.[citation needed]
Thimerosal[edit]
Further information: Thiomersal
Eli Lilly has developed the vaccine preservative thiomersal (also called merthiolate and thimerosal). Thiomersal is effective by causing susceptible bacteria to autolyze. Launched in 1930, merthiolate was a mercury-based antiseptic and germicide that "had been formulated at the University of Maryland with support of a Lilly research fellowship."[48]
Zyprexa[edit]
Zyprexa (for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, as well as off-label uses) Released in 1996, and as of 2010, Lilly's best-selling drug of all time[112]

Personnel[edit]
After three generations of Lilly family leadership under company founder, Col. Eli Lilly, his son, Josiah K. Lilly Sr., and two grandsons, Eli Lilly Jr. and Josiah K. Lilly Jr., the company announced a reorganization in 1944 that prepared the way for future expansion and the eventual separation of company management from its ownership.[115] The large, complex corporation was divided into smaller groups headed by vice presidents and in 1953 Eugene N. Beesley was named the first non-family member to become the company’s president.[57]
Although Lilly family members continued to serve as chairman of the board until 1969, Beesley's appointment began the transition to non-family management.[57] In 1972 Richard D. Wood became Lilly's president and CEO after the retirement of Burton E. Beck.[116] In 1991 Vaughn Bryson became president and Wood became board chairman.[117] During Bryson's 20-month tenure as Lilly's president and CEO, the company reported its first quarterly loss as a publicly traded company.[64]
Randall L. Tobias, a vice chairman of AT&T Corporation, was named chairman, president, and CEO in June 1993. Tobias, a Lilly board member since 1986, was recruited from outside the company's executive ranks to replace Lilly's president, Vaughn Bryson, and board chairman, Richard Wood.[64] Tobias later became the U.S. director of Foreign Assistance and administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), with the rank of ambassador.[118]
Sidney Taurel, former chief operating officer of Lilly, was named CEO in July 1998 to replace Tobias, who retired. Taurel became chairman of the board in January 1999.[119] Taurel retired as CEO on March 31, 2008, but remained as chairman of the board until December 31, 2008. John Lechleiter was elected as Lilly’s CEO and president, effective April 1, 2008. Lechleiter had served as Lilly's president and chief operating officer since October 2005.[120] In July 2016 Dave Ricks, who also had a long career at Lily, was appointed CEO.[121]
A number of global leaders in the fields of health policy, management, and scientific research have worked at Lilly, including:

Ernesto Bustamante, Peruvian scientist.
Jose F. Caro, American physician, scientist, and educator most notable for his research in obesity and diabetes.
Richard DiMarchi, Chief Scientific Officer, Marcadia Biotech.
Mitch Daniels, current president of Purdue University, former Governor of Indiana and director of the Office of Management and Budget for President George W. Bush.
Roald Hoffmann, Nobel Prize-winning chemist.
Michael Johns, former White House speechwriter and Heritage Foundation policy analyst.
Claude H. Nash, CEO, ViroPharma.
Peter Nicholas, co-founder of Boston Scientific.

Prominent Lilly board members have included:

George H. W. Bush, former President and Vice President of the United States of America.
Martin Feldstein, economist, Harvard University.
Kenneth Lay, former CEO, Enron.
William Verity Jr., former U.S. Secretary of Commerce.

Accolades[edit]
In 2006 Fortune magazine named Eli Lilly and Company one of the top 100 companies in the United States for which to work. Also in 2006, Barron's Magazine named the company among the top 500 best managed companies in the U.S.
In 2012 Working Mothers magazine named Lilly one of the "100 Best Companies for Working Mothers" for the eighteenth consecutive year. Working Mother reported that in 2012 forty-eight percent of Lilly’s U.S. employees and thirty-four percent of its U.S. managers and executives were women.[122][123]
Community service[edit]
The Lilly family as well as Eli Lilly and Company has a long history of community service. Around 1890 Col. Lilly turned over operation of the family business to his son, Josiah, who ran the company for the next several decades.[14] Col. Lilly remained active in civic affairs and assisted a number of local organizations, including the Commercial Club of Indianapolis, which later became the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce,[124] and the Charity Organization Society, a forerunner to the Family Services Association of Central Indiana, an organization supported by United Way.[14][125] Josiah’s sons, Eli and Joe, were also philanthropists who supported numerous cultural and educational organizations.[126]
It was Josiah Sr. who continued his father's civic mindedness and began the company tradition of sending aid to disaster victims.[6] Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the company sent much needed medicine to support recovery efforts and provided relief after the 1936 Johnstown Flood.[6]
In 1917 Lilly Field Hospital 32, named in Josiah’s honor, was equipped in Indianapolis and moved overseas to Contrexville, France, during World War I, where it remained in operation until 1919.[6] Throughout World War II, Lilly manufactured more than two hundred products for military use, including aviator survival kits and seasickness medications for the D-Day invasion.[41] In addition Lilly dried more than two million pints of blood plasma by the war’s end.[46]
Lilly Endowment[edit]
Main article: Lilly Endowment
In 1937 Josiah K. Lilly Sr. and his two sons, Eli and Joe, founded the Lilly Endowment, a private charitable foundation, with gifts of Lilly stock.[127]
Eli Lilly and Company Foundation[edit]
The Eli Lilly and Company Foundation, which is separate from the Lilly Endowment, operates as a tax-exempt private charitable foundation that the company established in 1968. The Foundation is funded through Lilly’s corporate profits.[128]
Controversy[edit]
See also: List of largest pharmaceutical settlements
Eli Lilly has been involved in several controversies, including political and medical ethics controversies. Eli Lilly is now the sole manufacturer of BGH having purchased the rights to manufacture the drug from Monsanto.
NAFTA Suit[edit]
In September 2013, Eli Lilly sued Canada for violating its obligations to foreign investors under the North American Free Trade Agreement by allowing its courts to invalidate patents for two of its drugs. The company sought damages in the amount of $500 million for lost potential profits.[129]
Criminal prosecution[edit]
See also: Olanzapine § Controversy, lawsuits and settlements; and James Gottstein § Eli Lilly memos
In 2009, four sales representatives for Eli Lilly filed separate qui tam lawsuits against the company for illegally marketing the drug Zyprexa for uses not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Eli Lilly pleaded guilty to actively promoting Zyprexa for off-label uses, particularly for the treatment of dementia in the elderly. The $1.415 billion penalty included an $800 million civil settlement and a $515 million criminal fine. The U.S. Justice Department said the criminal fine of $515 million was the largest ever in a health care case, and the largest criminal fine for an individual corporation ever imposed in a U.S. criminal prosecution of any kind.[130][131] "That was a blemish for us," John C. Lechleiter, CEO of Lilly, told The New York Times. "We don’t ever want that to happen again. We put measures in place to assure that not only do we have the right intentions in integrity and compliance, but we have systems in place to support that."[132] In an internal email, Lechleiter had stated "we must seize the opportunity to expand our work with Zyprexa in this same child-adolescent population" (for off-label use.)[133]

Eli Lilly and Company's global headquarters, in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States


A Fortune 500 corporation, Eli Lilly had revenues of $20 billion in 2008, making it the 148th largest company in the United States and the 10th largest corporation by global pharmaceutical sales. The company is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange and is a member of the S&P 500 stock index. Eli Lilly was one of the Nifty Fifty stocks that propelled the mid-twentieth-century bull market.[citation needed]
Eli Lilly is a full member of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA).[2]
According to Forbes, Lilly ranked as the 243rd largest public company in the world in 2016, with sales of US$20 billion and a market value of $86 billion.[3]
As of 1997 it was the largest corporation and the largest charitable benefactor in Indiana.[4]
History[edit]
Company founder[edit]
Main article: Eli Lilly
The company's founder was Colonel Eli Lilly, a pharmaceutical chemist and Union army veteran of the American Civil War.[5] Lilly served as the company president until his death in 1898.[6] A stylized version of his signature still appears in the company's red logo.[5]
In 1869, after working for drugstores in Greencastle and Indianapolis, Indiana, Lilly became a partner in a Paris, Illinois, drugstore with James W. Binford.[7] Although the drugstore was profitable, Lilly was more interested in medicinal manufacturing than running a pharmacy. He began formulating plans to create a company of his own. Lilly left the partnership with Binford in 1873 and returned to Indianapolis. Lilly opened a drug manufacturing operation called Johnston and Lilly with John F. Johnston as his partner in 1874, but dissolved the failing partnership on March 27, 1876. Lilly used his share of the assets, which amounted to an estimated $400 in merchandise (several pieces of equipment and a few gallons of unmixed chemicals) and about $1,000 in cash, to open his own pharmaceutical manufacturing business in Indianapolis in May 1876.[8][9] His new business venture became Eli Lilly and Company.




Colonel Eli Lilly (1838–1898), founder


Early days: 1870s–1900[edit]
On May 10, 1876, Lilly opened his own laboratory in a rented, two-story brick building (now demolished) at 15 West Pearl Street in Indianapolis, where he began to manufacture medicinal drugs. The sign outside, above the shop's door, read: "Eli Lilly, Chemist."[5][10][11] Lilly began his manufacturing venture with $1,400 ($31,163 in 2015 chained dollars) in working capital and three employees: Albert Hall (chief compounder), Caroline Kruger (bottler and product finisher), and Lilly's fourteen-year-old son, Josiah (J. K.), who had quit school to work with his father as an apprentice.[12][9]
One of the first medicines that Lilly began to produce was quinine, a drug used to treat malaria. The result was a "ten fold" increase in sales.[13] At the end of 1876, his first year of business, sales reached $4,470 ($99,499 in 2015 chained dollars).[13] At the end of 1877 sales reached $11,318 ($251,932 in 2015 chained dollars),[14] and by 1879 they had grown to $48,000 ($1,221,086 in 2015 chained dollars).[13] Lilly hired his brother, James, as his first full-time salesman in 1878. James and the subsequent sales team marketed the company's drugs nationally.[15]
The company outgrew its first location on Pearl Street, where it remained from 1876 to 1878, and moved to larger quarters at 36 South Meridian Street. In 1881 Lilly purchased a complex of buildings on property at McCarty and Alabama Streets and moved the company to its new headquarters in Indianapolis's south-side industrial area. Lilly later purchased additional facilities for research and production.[16][17]
Lilly committed himself to producing high-quality prescription drugs, in contrast to the common and often ineffective patent medicines. From its facilities in Indianapolis the company manufactured and sold "ethical drugs" for use by the medical profession. Lilly's medicines included labels that disclosed product ingredients.[5] Lilly's first innovation was gelatin-coating for pills and capsules. The company’s other early innovations included fruit flavorings and sugarcoated pills, which made the medicines easier to swallow.[12]
In 1881 Lilly formally incorporated the business as Eli Lilly and Company, elected a board of directors, and issued stock to family members and close associates.[15] Colonel Lilly's only son, Josiah (J. K.), a pharmaceutical chemist, graduated from the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy in 1882, and joined the family business as a superintendent of its laboratory after college. J. K. became company president in 1898.[18] In 1883 the company contracted to mix and sell Succus Alteran, its first widely successful product and one its best sellers. The product was marketed as a "blood purifier" and as a treatment for syphilis, some types of rheumatism, and skin diseases such as eczema and psoriasis.[17][19] Sales from this product provided funds for Lilly to expand its manufacturing and research facilities.[14] By the late 1880s Colonel Lilly was one of the Indianapolis area's leading businessmen, whose company had more than one-hundred employees and had $200,000 ($5,276,296 in 2015 chained dollars) in annual sales.[7]
As the Lilly company grew, other businesses set up operations near the plant on Indianapolis's near south side. The area developed into one of the city's major business and industrial hubs. Lilly's production, manufacturing, research, and administrative operations in Indianapolis eventually occupied a complex of more than two dozen buildings covering a fifteen-block area, as well as production plants along Kentucky Avenue.[20]

Around 1890 Colonel Lilly turned over the day-to-day management of the business to his son, J. K., who ran the company for thirty-four years. Although the 1890s were a tumultuous decade economically, the company flourished and came out stronger than ever.[7][21] In 1894 Lilly purchased a manufacturing plant to be used solely for creating capsules. The company also made several technological advances in the manufacturing process, including automating its capsule production. Over the next few years the company annually created tens of millions of capsules and pills.[22]
Until the turn of the century Lilly operated in Indianapolis and the surrounding area as many other pharmaceutical businesses did—manufacturing and selling "sugar-coated pills, fluid extracts, elixirs, and syrups."[19] The company used plants for its raw materials and produced its products by hand. One historian noted, "Although the Indianapolis firm was more careful in making and promoting drugs that the patent medicine men of the era, the company remained ambivalent about scientific research."[19]
In addition to Colonel Lilly, his brother, James, and son, Josiah (J. K.), the growing company employed other Lilly family. Colonel Lilly's cousin, Evan Lilly, was hired as a bookkeeper.[21] As young boys, Lilly's grandsons, Eli and Josiah Jr. (Joe), ran errands and performed other odd jobs. Eli and Joe joined the family business after college. Eventually, each grandson served as company president and chairman of the board.[23]
Josiah (J. K.), Colonel Lilly's son and Eli and Joe's father, inherited the company after Colonel Lilly died and became its president in 1898.[6] At the time of Colonel Lilly's death the company had a product line of 2,005 items and annual sales of more than $300,000 ($8,547,600 in 2015 chained dollars).[24] Colonel Lilly was a pioneer in the modern pharmaceutical industry, with many of his early innovations later becoming standard practice. His ethical reforms in a trade that was marked by outlandish claims of miracle medicines began a period of rapid advancement in the development of medicinal drugs.[25] J. K. Lilly continued to advocate for federal regulation on medicines.[26] Under J. K.'s leadership, the company introduced scientific management concepts, organized the company's research department, increased its sales force, and began international distribution of its products.[27] In addition J. K. oversaw a large expansion of the company. By 1905 the company reached sales of $1 million ($26,381,481 in 2015 chained dollars).[6]

Modernization:1900–40[edit]
Just before and after World War I, the Lilly company experienced rapid change.[19] Expansion of Lilly's manufacturing facilities at the McCarty Street plant improved production capacity with a new Science Building (Building 14), opened in 1911, and a new capsule plant (Building 15) in 1913.[28] The company also began constructions of the Lilly Biological Laboratories, a research and manufacturing plant on 150 acres near Greenfield, Indiana, in 1913.[29][30]
In addition to development of new medicines, the company achieved several technological advances, including automation of its production facilities. Lilly was also an innovator in pill capsule manufacturing. It was among the first manufacturers to insert medications into empty gelatin capsules, which provided a more exact dosage.[5] Lilly manufactured capsules for its own needs and sold its excess capacity to others.[31] A 1917 Scientific American article claimed the Lilly operation in Indianapolis was "the largest capsule factory in the world" and was "capable of producing 2.5 million capsules a day".[31] One of Lilly's innovations was fruit flavoring for medicines and sugar-coated pills to make their medicines easier to swallow.[12] Over the next few years the company began to create tens of millions of capsules and pills annually.[22]
Other advances improved plant efficiency and eliminated production errors. Eli Lilly, grandson of the company founder, introduced a method for blueprinting manufacturing tickets in 1909.[32] This process, which created multiples copies of a drug formula, helped eliminate manufacturing and transcription errors.[31] In the 1920s Eli introduced the new concept of straight-line production, where raw materials entered at one end of the facility and the finished product came out the other end, in the company’s manufacturing process. Under Eli’s supervision, the design for Building 22, a new 5-floor plant that opened in Indianapolis in 1926, implemented the straight-line concept to improve production efficiency and lower production costs.[33][34] One historian noted, "It was probably the most sophisticated production system in the American pharmaceutical industry."[34] This more efficient manufacturing process also allowed the company to hire a regular workforce. Instead of recalling workers at peak times and laying them off when production demand fell, Lilly's regular workforce produced less-costly medicines in off-peak times using the same manufacturing facilities.[23]
During the 1920s the introduction of new products also brought the company financial success.[19] In 1919 Josiah hired biochemist George Henry Alexander Clowes as director of biochemical research. In 1921 three University of Toronto scientists, J. J. R. Macleod, Frederick G. Banting, and Charles H. Best, were working on the development of insulin for treatment of diabetes.[35] Clowes and Eli Lilly met with the researchers in 1922 to negotiate an agreement with the University of Toronto scientists to mass-produce insulin.[36] The collaboration led to the first successful large-scale production of insulin.[37] In 1923 Lilly began selling Iletin (Insulin, Lilly), their tradename for the first commercially available insulin product in the U.S for the treatment of diabetes.[38] Banting and Macleod won a Nobel Prize in 1923 for their research. Insulin, "the most important drug" in the company’s history, did "more than any other" to make Lilly "one of the major pharmaceutical manufacturers in the world."[35]
The success of insulin enabled the company to attract well-respected scientists and, with them, make more medical advances. By its fiftieth anniversary in 1926 sales reached $9 million and the company produced more than 2,800 different items.[23] In 1928 Lilly introduced Liver Extract 343 for the treatment of pernicious anemia, a blood disorder, in a joint venture with two Harvard University scientists, George R. Minot and William P. Murphy. In 1930 Lilly introduced Liver Extract No. 55 in collaboration with George Whipple, a University of Rochester scientist.[39] Minot, Murphy, and Whipple won the 1934 Nobel Prize in medicine for their research.[40]
Despite the economic challenges of the Great Depression, Lilly's sales rose to $13 million in 1932.[41] That same year Eli Lilly, the eldest grandson of Col. Lilly, was named as the company's president to succeed his father, who remained as chairman of the board until 1948. Eli joined the family business in 1909.[6] In his early years at the company Eli was especially interested in improving production efficiency and introduced a number of labor-saving devices. He also introduced scientific management principles and implemented cost-savings measures that modernized the company.[42] In addition Eli was involved in expanding the company’s research efforts and collaborations with university researchers.[43]
In 1934 the firm opened two new facilities on the McCarty Street complex: a replica of Lilly’s 1876 laboratory and the new Lilly Research Laboratories, "one of the most fully equipped facilities in the world."[44] In the 1930s the company also continued expansion overseas.[45] In 1934 Eli Lilly and Company Limited, the company's first overseas subsidiary was established in England, with headquarters in London and a manufacturing plant in Basingstoke.[41][45]
Expansion: 1940–70[edit]
World War II brought production at Lilly to a new high with the manufacturing of Merthiolate and penicillin. During the war Lilly also cooperated with the American Red Cross to process blood plasma and by war's end the company had dried over two million pints of blood, "about 20 percent of the United States' total".[46] Merthiolate, first introduced in 1930, was an "anticeptic and germicide" that became a U.S. army "standard issue" during World War II.[47][48] In the early 1940s Lilly became one of the companies mass-producing penicillin.[49]
International operations expanded even further during World War II.[45] Eli Lilly International Corp. was formed in 1943 as a subsidiary to encourage business trade abroad. By 1948 Lilly employees worked in thirty-five countries, most of them as sales representatives in Latin America, Asia, and Africa.[45]
At the end of World War II the company continued to grow. In 1945 Lilly began a major expansion effort that would include two manufacturing operations in Indianapolis. The company purchased the massive Curtiss-Wright propeller plant on South Kentucky Avenue, west of the company's McCarty Street operation. When renovation was completed in mid-1947, the Kentucky Avenue location manufactured antibiotics and capsules and housed the company’s shipping department.[50] By 1948 Lilly employed nearly 7,000 people.[10]
Eli Lilly, who had served as the company's president since 1932, retired from active management of the company in 1948, became chairman of the board, and relinquished the presidency to his brother, Josiah K. Lilly, Jr. (Joe).[51] During Eli's sixteen-year presidency sales rose from $13 million in 1932 to $117 million in 1948. Joe joined the company in 1914 and concentrated on the company's personnel and marketing efforts.[24] He served as company president from 1948 to 1953, then became chairman of the board and remained in that capacity until his death in 1966.[52] In 1952 the company offered its first public shares of stock.[53] In 1953 Eugene N. Beesley was named the company's new president, the first non-family member to run the company.
Over the next several decades Lilly continued to develop and introduce new drugs to the marketplace. In the 1950s Lilly introduced two new antibiotics: vancomycin and erythromycin. In addition Lilly was heavily involved in production and distribution of Jonas Salk's poliomyelitis (polio) vaccine. In 1954 the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (NFIP) contracted with five pharmaceutical companies to produce Salk's polio vaccine for clinical trials. These included Lilly as well as Parke, Davis and Company, Cutter Laboratories, Wyeth Laboratories, and Pitman-Moore Company.[54] Lilly's selection to produce the vaccine was, in part, due to its previous experience in collaborations with university researchers.[55] Lilly manufactured 60 percent of the Salk vaccine in 1955.
During the mid-twentieth century Lilly continued to expand its production facilities outside of Indianapolis. In 1950 Lilly began Tippecanoe Laboratories in Lafayette, Indiana,[56] and increased antibiotic production with its patent on erythromycin. In 1954 Lilly formed Elanco Products Company for the production of veterinary pharmaceuticals. In 1969 the company opened a new plant in Clinton, Indiana.[56]
After a company reorganization and transition to non-family management in 1953, Lilly continued to expand its global presence. In the 1960s Lilly operated thirteen affiliate companies outside the United States.[57] In 1962, with an acquisition from Distillers Company, the company established a major factory in Liverpool, England. In 1968 Lilly built its first research facility, the Lilly Research Centre Limited, outside the United States near London, England.
1970– present[edit]
During the 1970s and 1980s, Eli Lilly and Company saw a flurry of drug production: an antibiotic, Keflex, in 1971; a heart drug, Dobutrex, in 1977; Ceclor, which would become the world's top selling oral antibiotic, in 1979; a leukemia drug, Eldisine; an antiarthritic, Oraflex; and an analgesic, Darvon. When generic drugs flooded the marketplace after the expiration of patents for drugs discovered in the 1950s and 1960s, Lilly diversified into other areas, most notably agricultural chemicals, animal-health products, cosmetics, and medical instruments.
To further diversify its product line, Lilly made an uncharacteristic, but ultimately profitable move in 1971, when it bought cosmetic manufacturer Elizabeth Arden, Inc. for $38 million. Although the subsidiary continued to lose money for five years after Lilly acquired it, executive management changes at Arden helped turn it into a financial success. By 1982 the subsidiary's "sales were up 90 percent from 1978, with profits doubling to nearly $30 million." Sixteen years after its acquisition, Lilly sold Arden to Fabergé in 1987 for $657 million.[58]
In 1977 Lilly ventured into medical instruments with the acquisition of IVAC Corporation, which manufactures vital signs and intravenous fluid infusion monitoring systems. Lilly also purchased Cardiac Pacemakers Incorporated, a manufacturer of heart pacemakers in 1977. In 1980 Lilly acquired Physio-Control Corporation. Other acquisitions included Advance Cardiovasular Systems Incorporated in 1984, Hybritech in 1986, and Devices for Vascular Intervention, Incorporated in 1989. Lilly acquired Pacific Biotech in 1990 and Origin Medsystems and Heart Rhythm Technologies, Incorporated in 1992. In the early 1990s Lilly combined these medical equipment companies into a Medical Devices and Diagnostics Division that "contributed about 20 percent" of Lilly’s annual revenues.
In 1989 a joint agri-chemical venture between Elanco Products Company and Dow Chemical created DowElanco. In 1997 Lilly sold its 40 percent share in the company to Dow Chemical for $1.2 billion and the name was changed to Dow AgroSciences.[59][60][61]
In 1994 Lilly acquired PCS Systems, a drug delivery business for Health Maintenance Organizations, and later added two similar organizations to its holdings.[62] Lilly purchased PCS, which was the largest U.S. prescription drug benefits manager at the time, for $4 billion.[63]
In 1991 Vaughn Bryson was named CEO of Eli Lilly. During his 20-month tenure, the company reported its first quarterly loss as a publicly traded company.[64] In 1993 Randall L. Tobias, a vice-chairman of AT&T Corporation and Lilly board member, was named Lilly's chairman, president, and CEO after "product and competitive pressures" had "steadily eroded Lilly's stock price since early 1992."[65] Tobias was the first president and CEO recruited from outside of the company. Under Tobias's leadership the company "cut costs and narrowed its mission".[66] Lilly sold companies in its Medical Device and Diagnostics Division, expanded international sales, made new acquisitions, and funded additional research and product development. Sidney Taurel, former chief operating officer of Lilly, was named CEO in 1998, replacing Tobias. Taurel was named chairman in January 1999. In 2000 Lilly reported $10.86 billion in net sales.




Eli Lilly's present day global manufacturing plants.


In 1998 Eli Lilly formed a joint venture with Icos Corporation (ICOS), a Bothell, Washington-based biotechnology company, to develop and commercialize Cialis, a product for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. In October 2006 Lilly announced its intention to acquire Icos for $2.1 billion, or $32 per share.[67] After its initial attempt to acquire Icos failed under pressure from large institutional shareholders, Lilly revised its offer to $34 per share. Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), a proxy advisory firm, advised Icos shareholders to reject the proposal as undervalued,[68][69] but the buyout was approved by Icos shareholders and Lilly completed its acquisition of the company on January 29, 2007.[70][71] Lilly closed Icos manufacturing operations, terminated nearly 500 Icos employees, and left 127 employees working at the biologics facility.[72] In December 2007 CMC Biopharmaceuticals A/S (CMC), a Copenhagen, Denmark-based provider of contract biomanufacturing services, bought the Bothell-based biologics facility from Lilly and retained the existing 127 employees.[69][72][73]
In January 2009, the largest criminal fine in U.S. history, totaling $1.415 billion was imposed on Lilly for illegal marketing of its best-selling product, the atypical antipsychotic medication, Zyprexa.[74]
In January 2011, Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly and Company announced their global agreement for the joint development and marketing of new APIs for diabetes therapy. Lilly could receive more than one billion dollars for their work on the project, while Boehringer Ingelheim could receive more than $800 million from development of the new drugs.[75] Oral anti-diabetic of Boehringer Ingelheim–Linagliptin and BI 10773–and two insulin analogs of Lilly–LY2605541 and LY2963016–were in phase II and III of clinical developmentat that time.[76]
In April 2014, Lilly announced plans to buy Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG's animal health business for $5.4 billion in cash to strengthen and diversify its Elanco unit. Lilly said it planned to fund the deal with about $3.4 billion of cash on hand and $2 billion of loans.[77] As a condition of the acquisition, the Sentinel heartworm treatment would be divested to Virbac in order to avoid a monopoly in a subsector of the heartworm treatment market.[78]
In March 2015, the company announced it would join Hanmi Pharmaceutical in developing and commercialising Hanmi's phase I Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor HM71224 in a deal which could yield $690 million.[79] A day later the company announced another deal with Innovent Biologics, Inc to co-develop and commercialise at least three of Innovents treatments over the next decade, in a deal which could generate up to $456 million. As part of the deal the company will contribute its c-Met monoclonal antibody whilst Innovent will contribute a monoclonal antibody which targets CD-20. The second compound from Innovent is a preclinical immuno-oncology molecule.[80] The following week the company announced it would restart its collaboration with Pfizer surrounding the Phase III trial of Tanezumab. Pfizer is expected to receive an upfront sum of $200 million from the company.[81] In April 2015, the company engaged CBRE Group to sell its biomanufacturing facility in Vacaville, California.[82] The facility resides on a 52 acres (0.21 km2) campus and is one of the largest biopharmaceutical manufacturing centers in the United States.[82]
In January 2017, the company announced it would acquire CoLucid Pharmaceuticals for $960 million, specifically gaining the late clinical-stage migraine therapy candidate, lasmiditan,[83] with the deal completing in March.[84] In march, the company also announced that it had completed the acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc's (a subsidiary of Boehringer Ingelheim) US feline, canine and rabies vaccines portfolio.[85]

Collaborative research[edit]
Further information: Lilly Research Laboratories
Eli Lilly and Company has a long history of collaboration with research scientists. In 1886 Ernest G. Eberhardt, a chemist, joined the company as its first full-time research scientist.[97] Lilly also hired two botanists, Walter H. Evans and John S. Wright, to join its early research efforts.[14][98] After World War I the company’s expanded production facilities and introduction of new management methods set the stage for Lilly's next crucial phase—its "aggressive entry into scientific research and development."[10] The first big step came in 1919 when Josiah Lilly hired biochemist George Henry Alexander Clowes as director of biochemical research.[99] Clowes had extensive medical research expertise and links to the scientific research community, which led to the company's collaborations with researchers in the U.S. and elsewhere.[100] Clowes's first major collaboration with researchers who developed insulin at the University of Toronto significantly impacted the company’s future.[100] Lilly’s success with insulin production secured the company's position as a leading research-based pharmaceutical manufacturer, allowing it to attract and hire more research scientists and to collaborate with other universities in additional medical research.[101] In 1934 the company built a new research laboratory in Indianapolis.[35] As part of its research and product development process Lilly also conducted clinical studies at Indianapolis City Hospital (Wishard Memorial Hospital). Lilly continues to conduct clinical studies to test medications before their introduction to the market.[102] In 1949 Eli Lilly actually went into partnership with the United States Army Reserve setting up a local Strategic Intelligence Research and Analysis (SIRA)Unit to allow employees to research company data for the Scientific Logistics and Eurasian fields of study (source: declassified Defense Intelligence Agency document MDR -0191-2008 dated 17 Sep 2012). In 1998 the company dedicated new laboratories for clinical research at the Indiana University Medical Center in Indianapolis.
Publicly funded research[edit]
In addition to internal research and development activities Lilly is also involved in publicly funded research projects with other industrial and academic partners. One example in the area of non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox, a collaboration with pharmaceutical companies, research organizations, and the European Commission to improve the safety of drugs.[103][104] In 2008 this consortium, which included Lilly S.A. (Switzerland), secured a €8 million budget for a 40-month project that was coordinated by the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), an organization who represents the research-based pharmaceutical industry and biotech companies operating in Europe.[104][105][106] In 2008 Lilly's activities included research projects within the framework of the Innovative Medicines Initiative, a public-private research initiative in Europe that is a joint effort of the EFPIA and the European Commission.[107][108][109]
Pharmaceutical brands[edit]
The company's most important products introduced prior to World War II included insulin, which Lilly marketed as Iletin (Insulin, Lilly), Amytal, Merthiolate, ephedrine, and liver extracts.[48] Introduced in 1923, Iletin (Insulin, Lilly) was Lilly's first commercial insulin product. In 2002 the company was the leading producer of products for those with diabetes.[citation needed]
During World War II Lilly produced penicillins and other antibiotics. In addition to penicillin, other wartime production included "antimalarials," blood plasma, encephalitis vaccine, typhus and influenza vaccine, gas gangrene antitoxin, Merthiolate, and Iletin (Insulin, Lilly).[110]
Among the company's more recent pharmaceutical developments are cephalosporin, erythromycin, and Prozac (fluoxetine), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for the treatment of clinical depression. Ceclor, introduced in the 1970s, was an oral cephalosporin antibiotic. Prozac, introduced in the 1980s, quickly became the company's best-selling product for treatment of depression, but Lilly lost its U.S. patent protection for this product in 2001. Among other distinctions, Lilly is the world's largest manufacturer and distributor of medications used in a broad range of psychiatric and mental health-related conditions, including clinical depression, generalized anxiety disorder, narcotic addiction, insomnia, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and others.
Cialis[edit]
Further information: Tadalafil
In 2003, Eli Lilly introduced Cialis (tadalafil), a competitor to Pfizer's blockbuster Viagra for erectile dysfunction. Cialis maintains an active period of 36 hours, causing it sometimes to be dubbed the "weekend pill". Cialis was developed in a partnership with biotechnology company Icos Corporation. On December 18, 2006, Lilly bought Icos in order to gain full control of the product.[111]
Cymbalta[edit]
Further information: Duloxetine
Another Lilly manufactured anti-depressant, Cymbalta, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor used predominantly in the treatment of major depressive disorders and generalized anxiety disorder, ranks with Prozac as one of the most financially successful pharmaceuticals in industry history. It is also used in the treatment of fibromyalgia, neuropathy, chronic pain and osteoarthritis.[citation needed]
Gemzar[edit]
Further information: Gemcitabine
In 1996 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Gemzar for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Gemzar is commonly used in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, usually in coordination with 5-FU chemotherapy and radiology. Gemzar also is routinely used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.
Methadone[edit]
Further information: Methadone
Eli Lilly was the first distributor of methadone, an analgesic used frequently in the treatment of heroin, opium and other opioid and narcotic drug addictions.[citation needed]
Prozac[edit]
Further information: Fluoxetine
Prozac was one of the first therapies in its class to treat clinical depression by blocking the uptake of serotonin within the human brain. It is prescribed to more than fifty-four million people worldwide.[citation needed] Prozac was approved by the U.S. FDA in 1987 for use in treating depression. In 2001 Lilly lost its U.S. patent protection for Prozac and in January 2002 the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Lilly's final appeal, a decision that allows other companies to make generic versions of the drug. Prozac has given rise to a number of comparably functioning therapies for the treatment of clinical depression and other central nervous system disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder, bulimia nervosa, and panic disorders.[citation needed]
Prozac in popular culture[edit]
Because of its wide appeal as a popular anti-depressant, references to Prozac have appeared in books, movies, and music. Prozac Nation (1994), an autobiographical book by Elizabeth Wurtzel, was turned into a film of the same name in 2001 and starred Christina Ricci. Listening to Prozac (1993), by Peter Kramer, was a generally analytical look at Prozac and its uses, not only to treat disorders but to diagnose them as well. Talking Back to Prozac (1994), by psychiatrist Peter Breggin, focuses on Prozac's side effects. Rapper Jay-Z referenced Prozac in the song, "Nigga What, Nigga Who" (1998). In HBO's fictional series, The Sopranos, Tony Soprano's use of Prozac is periodically referenced.[citation needed]
Secobarbital[edit]
Further information: Secobarbital
Eli Lilly has manufactured Secobarbital, a barbiturate derivative with anaesthetic, anticonvulsant, sedative and hypnotic properties. Lilly marketed Secobarbital under the brand name Seconal. Secobarbital is indicated for the treatment of epilepsy, temporary insomnia and as a pre-operative medication to produce anaesthesia and anxiolysis in short surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures which are minimally painful. With the onset of new therapies for the treatment of these conditions, Secobarbital has been less utilized, and Lilly ceased manufacturing it in 2001.[citation needed]
Secobarbital overdoses[edit]
Secobarbital gained considerable attention during the 1970s, when it gained wide popularity as a recreational drug. On September 18, 1970, rock guitarist legend Jimi Hendrix died from a secobarbital overdose. On June 22, 1969, secobarbital overdose was the cause of death of actress Judy Garland. The drug was a central part of the plot of the hugely popular novel Valley of the Dolls (1966) by Jacqueline Susann in which three highly successful Hollywood women each fall victim, in various ways, to the drug. The novel was later released as a film by the same name.[citation needed]
Thimerosal[edit]
Further information: Thiomersal
Eli Lilly has developed the vaccine preservative thiomersal (also called merthiolate and thimerosal). Thiomersal is effective by causing susceptible bacteria to autolyze. Launched in 1930, merthiolate was a mercury-based antiseptic and germicide that "had been formulated at the University of Maryland with support of a Lilly research fellowship."[48]
Zyprexa[edit]
Zyprexa (for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, as well as off-label uses) Released in 1996, and as of 2010, Lilly's best-selling drug of all time[112]
Additional Eli Lilly drugs[edit]

Personnel[edit]
After three generations of Lilly family leadership under company founder, Col. Eli Lilly, his son, Josiah K. Lilly Sr., and two grandsons, Eli Lilly Jr. and Josiah K. Lilly Jr., the company announced a reorganization in 1944 that prepared the way for future expansion and the eventual separation of company management from its ownership.[115] The large, complex corporation was divided into smaller groups headed by vice presidents and in 1953 Eugene N. Beesley was named the first non-family member to become the company’s president.[57]
Although Lilly family members continued to serve as chairman of the board until 1969, Beesley's appointment began the transition to non-family management.[57] In 1972 Richard D. Wood became Lilly's president and CEO after the retirement of Burton E. Beck.[116] In 1991 Vaughn Bryson became president and Wood became board chairman.[117] During Bryson's 20-month tenure as Lilly's president and CEO, the company reported its first quarterly loss as a publicly traded company.[64]
Randall L. Tobias, a vice chairman of AT&T Corporation, was named chairman, president, and CEO in June 1993. Tobias, a Lilly board member since 1986, was recruited from outside the company's executive ranks to replace Lilly's president, Vaughn Bryson, and board chairman, Richard Wood.[64] Tobias later became the U.S. director of Foreign Assistance and administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), with the rank of ambassador.[118]
Sidney Taurel, former chief operating officer of Lilly, was named CEO in July 1998 to replace Tobias, who retired. Taurel became chairman of the board in January 1999.[119] Taurel retired as CEO on March 31, 2008, but remained as chairman of the board until December 31, 2008. John Lechleiter was elected as Lilly’s CEO and president, effective April 1, 2008. Lechleiter had served as Lilly's president and chief operating officer since October 2005.[120] In July 2016 Dave Ricks, who also had a long career at Lily, was appointed CEO.[121]
A number of global leaders in the fields of health policy, management, and scientific research have worked at Lilly, including:

Ernesto Bustamante, Peruvian scientist.
Jose F. Caro, American physician, scientist, and educator most notable for his research in obesity and diabetes.
Richard DiMarchi, Chief Scientific Officer, Marcadia Biotech.
Mitch Daniels, current president of Purdue University, former Governor of Indiana and director of the Office of Management and Budget for President George W. Bush.
Roald Hoffmann, Nobel Prize-winning chemist.
Michael Johns, former White House speechwriter and Heritage Foundation policy analyst.
Claude H. Nash, CEO, ViroPharma.
Peter Nicholas, co-founder of Boston Scientific.

Prominent Lilly board members have included:

George H. W. Bush, former President and Vice President of the United States of America.
Martin Feldstein, economist, Harvard University.
Kenneth Lay, former CEO, Enron.
William Verity Jr., former U.S. Secretary of Commerce.

Accolades[edit]
In 2006 Fortune magazine named Eli Lilly and Company one of the top 100 companies in the United States for which to work. Also in 2006, Barron's Magazine named the company among the top 500 best managed companies in the U.S.
In 2012 Working Mothers magazine named Lilly one of the "100 Best Companies for Working Mothers" for the eighteenth consecutive year. Working Mother reported that in 2012 forty-eight percent of Lilly’s U.S. employees and thirty-four percent of its U.S. managers and executives were women.[122][123]
Community service[edit]
The Lilly family as well as Eli Lilly and Company has a long history of community service. Around 1890 Col. Lilly turned over operation of the family business to his son, Josiah, who ran the company for the next several decades.[14] Col. Lilly remained active in civic affairs and assisted a number of local organizations, including the Commercial Club of Indianapolis, which later became the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce,[124] and the Charity Organization Society, a forerunner to the Family Services Association of Central Indiana, an organization supported by United Way.[14][125] Josiah’s sons, Eli and Joe, were also philanthropists who supported numerous cultural and educational organizations.[126]
It was Josiah Sr. who continued his father's civic mindedness and began the company tradition of sending aid to disaster victims.[6] Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the company sent much needed medicine to support recovery efforts and provided relief after the 1936 Johnstown Flood.[6]
In 1917 Lilly Field Hospital 32, named in Josiah’s honor, was equipped in Indianapolis and moved overseas to Contrexville, France, during World War I, where it remained in operation until 1919.[6] Throughout World War II, Lilly manufactured more than two hundred products for military use, including aviator survival kits and seasickness medications for the D-Day invasion.[41] In addition Lilly dried more than two million pints of blood plasma by the war’s end.[46]
Lilly Endowment[edit]
Main article: Lilly Endowment
In 1937 Josiah K. Lilly Sr. and his two sons, Eli and Joe, founded the Lilly Endowment, a private charitable foundation, with gifts of Lilly stock.[127]
Eli Lilly and Company Foundation[edit]
The Eli Lilly and Company Foundation, which is separate from the Lilly Endowment, operates as a tax-exempt private charitable foundation that the company established in 1968. The Foundation is funded through Lilly’s corporate profits.[128]
Controversy[edit]
See also: List of largest pharmaceutical settlements
Eli Lilly has been involved in several controversies, including political and medical ethics controversies. Eli Lilly is now the sole manufacturer of BGH having purchased the rights to manufacture the drug from Monsanto.
NAFTA Suit[edit]
In September 2013, Eli Lilly sued Canada for violating its obligations to foreign investors under the North American Free Trade Agreement by allowing its courts to invalidate patents for two of its drugs. The company sought damages in the amount of $500 million for lost potential profits.[129]
Criminal prosecution[edit]
See also: Olanzapine § Controversy, lawsuits and settlements; and James Gottstein § Eli Lilly memos
In 2009, four sales representatives for Eli Lilly filed separate qui tam lawsuits against the company for illegally marketing the drug Zyprexa for uses not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Eli Lilly pleaded guilty to actively promoting Zyprexa for off-label uses, particularly for the treatment of dementia in the elderly. The $1.415 billion penalty included an $800 million civil settlement and a $515 million criminal fine. The U.S. Justice Department said the criminal fine of $515 million was the largest ever in a health care case, and the largest criminal fine for an individual corporation ever imposed in a U.S. criminal prosecution of any kind.[130][131] "That was a blemish for us," John C. Lechleiter, CEO of Lilly, told The New York Times. "We don’t ever want that to happen again. We put measures in place to assure that not only do we have the right intentions in integrity and compliance, but we have systems in place to support that."[132] In an internal email, Lechleiter had stated "we must seize the opportunity to expand our work with Zyprexa in this same child-adolescent population" (for off-label use.)[133]

A Fortune 500 corporation, Eli Lilly had revenues of $20 billion in 2008, making it the 148th largest company in the United States and the 10th largest corporation by global pharmaceutical sales. The company is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange and is a member of the S&P 500 stock index. Eli Lilly was one of the Nifty Fifty stocks that propelled the mid-twentieth-century bull market.[citation needed]
Eli Lilly is a full member of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA).[2]
According to Forbes, Lilly ranked as the 243rd largest public company in the world in 2016, with sales of US$20 billion and a market value of $86 billion.[3]
As of 1997 it was the largest corporation and the largest charitable benefactor in Indiana.[4]
History[edit]
Company founder[edit]
Main article: Eli Lilly
The company's founder was Colonel Eli Lilly, a pharmaceutical chemist and Union army veteran of the American Civil War.[5] Lilly served as the company president until his death in 1898.[6] A stylized version of his signature still appears in the company's red logo.[5]
In 1869, after working for drugstores in Greencastle and Indianapolis, Indiana, Lilly became a partner in a Paris, Illinois, drugstore with James W. Binford.[7] Although the drugstore was profitable, Lilly was more interested in medicinal manufacturing than running a pharmacy. He began formulating plans to create a company of his own. Lilly left the partnership with Binford in 1873 and returned to Indianapolis. Lilly opened a drug manufacturing operation called Johnston and Lilly with John F. Johnston as his partner in 1874, but dissolved the failing partnership on March 27, 1876. Lilly used his share of the assets, which amounted to an estimated $400 in merchandise (several pieces of equipment and a few gallons of unmixed chemicals) and about $1,000 in cash, to open his own pharmaceutical manufacturing business in Indianapolis in May 1876.[8][9] His new business venture became Eli Lilly and Company.




Colonel Eli Lilly (1838–1898), founder


Early days: 1870s–1900[edit]
On May 10, 1876, Lilly opened his own laboratory in a rented, two-story brick building (now demolished) at 15 West Pearl Street in Indianapolis, where he began to manufacture medicinal drugs. The sign outside, above the shop's door, read: "Eli Lilly, Chemist."[5][10][11] Lilly began his manufacturing venture with $1,400 ($31,163 in 2015 chained dollars) in working capital and three employees: Albert Hall (chief compounder), Caroline Kruger (bottler and product finisher), and Lilly's fourteen-year-old son, Josiah (J. K.), who had quit school to work with his father as an apprentice.[12][9]
One of the first medicines that Lilly began to produce was quinine, a drug used to treat malaria. The result was a "ten fold" increase in sales.[13] At the end of 1876, his first year of business, sales reached $4,470 ($99,499 in 2015 chained dollars).[13] At the end of 1877 sales reached $11,318 ($251,932 in 2015 chained dollars),[14] and by 1879 they had grown to $48,000 ($1,221,086 in 2015 chained dollars).[13] Lilly hired his brother, James, as his first full-time salesman in 1878. James and the subsequent sales team marketed the company's drugs nationally.[15]
The company outgrew its first location on Pearl Street, where it remained from 1876 to 1878, and moved to larger quarters at 36 South Meridian Street. In 1881 Lilly purchased a complex of buildings on property at McCarty and Alabama Streets and moved the company to its new headquarters in Indianapolis's south-side industrial area. Lilly later purchased additional facilities for research and production.[16][17]
Lilly committed himself to producing high-quality prescription drugs, in contrast to the common and often ineffective patent medicines. From its facilities in Indianapolis the company manufactured and sold "ethical drugs" for use by the medical profession. Lilly's medicines included labels that disclosed product ingredients.[5] Lilly's first innovation was gelatin-coating for pills and capsules. The company’s other early innovations included fruit flavorings and sugarcoated pills, which made the medicines easier to swallow.[12]
In 1881 Lilly formally incorporated the business as Eli Lilly and Company, elected a board of directors, and issued stock to family members and close associates.[15] Colonel Lilly's only son, Josiah (J. K.), a pharmaceutical chemist, graduated from the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy in 1882, and joined the family business as a superintendent of its laboratory after college. J. K. became company president in 1898.[18] In 1883 the company contracted to mix and sell Succus Alteran, its first widely successful product and one its best sellers. The product was marketed as a "blood purifier" and as a treatment for syphilis, some types of rheumatism, and skin diseases such as eczema and psoriasis.[17][19] Sales from this product provided funds for Lilly to expand its manufacturing and research facilities.[14] By the late 1880s Colonel Lilly was one of the Indianapolis area's leading businessmen, whose company had more than one-hundred employees and had $200,000 ($5,276,296 in 2015 chained dollars) in annual sales.[7]
As the Lilly company grew, other businesses set up operations near the plant on Indianapolis's near south side. The area developed into one of the city's major business and industrial hubs. Lilly's production, manufacturing, research, and administrative operations in Indianapolis eventually occupied a complex of more than two dozen buildings covering a fifteen-block area, as well as production plants along Kentucky Avenue.[20]

Around 1890 Colonel Lilly turned over the day-to-day management of the business to his son, J. K., who ran the company for thirty-four years. Although the 1890s were a tumultuous decade economically, the company flourished and came out stronger than ever.[7][21] In 1894 Lilly purchased a manufacturing plant to be used solely for creating capsules. The company also made several technological advances in the manufacturing process, including automating its capsule production. Over the next few years the company annually created tens of millions of capsules and pills.[22]
Until the turn of the century Lilly operated in Indianapolis and the surrounding area as many other pharmaceutical businesses did—manufacturing and selling "sugar-coated pills, fluid extracts, elixirs, and syrups."[19] The company used plants for its raw materials and produced its products by hand. One historian noted, "Although the Indianapolis firm was more careful in making and promoting drugs that the patent medicine men of the era, the company remained ambivalent about scientific research."[19]
In addition to Colonel Lilly, his brother, James, and son, Josiah (J. K.), the growing company employed other Lilly family. Colonel Lilly's cousin, Evan Lilly, was hired as a bookkeeper.[21] As young boys, Lilly's grandsons, Eli and Josiah Jr. (Joe), ran errands and performed other odd jobs. Eli and Joe joined the family business after college. Eventually, each grandson served as company president and chairman of the board.[23]
Josiah (J. K.), Colonel Lilly's son and Eli and Joe's father, inherited the company after Colonel Lilly died and became its president in 1898.[6] At the time of Colonel Lilly's death the company had a product line of 2,005 items and annual sales of more than $300,000 ($8,547,600 in 2015 chained dollars).[24] Colonel Lilly was a pioneer in the modern pharmaceutical industry, with many of his early innovations later becoming standard practice. His ethical reforms in a trade that was marked by outlandish claims of miracle medicines began a period of rapid advancement in the development of medicinal drugs.[25] J. K. Lilly continued to advocate for federal regulation on medicines.[26] Under J. K.'s leadership, the company introduced scientific management concepts, organized the company's research department, increased its sales force, and began international distribution of its products.[27] In addition J. K. oversaw a large expansion of the company. By 1905 the company reached sales of $1 million ($26,381,481 in 2015 chained dollars).[6]

Modernization:1900–40[edit]
Just before and after World War I, the Lilly company experienced rapid change.[19] Expansion of Lilly's manufacturing facilities at the McCarty Street plant improved production capacity with a new Science Building (Building 14), opened in 1911, and a new capsule plant (Building 15) in 1913.[28] The company also began constructions of the Lilly Biological Laboratories, a research and manufacturing plant on 150 acres near Greenfield, Indiana, in 1913.[29][30]
In addition to development of new medicines, the company achieved several technological advances, including automation of its production facilities. Lilly was also an innovator in pill capsule manufacturing. It was among the first manufacturers to insert medications into empty gelatin capsules, which provided a more exact dosage.[5] Lilly manufactured capsules for its own needs and sold its excess capacity to others.[31] A 1917 Scientific American article claimed the Lilly operation in Indianapolis was "the largest capsule factory in the world" and was "capable of producing 2.5 million capsules a day".[31] One of Lilly's innovations was fruit flavoring for medicines and sugar-coated pills to make their medicines easier to swallow.[12] Over the next few years the company began to create tens of millions of capsules and pills annually.[22]
Other advances improved plant efficiency and eliminated production errors. Eli Lilly, grandson of the company founder, introduced a method for blueprinting manufacturing tickets in 1909.[32] This process, which created multiples copies of a drug formula, helped eliminate manufacturing and transcription errors.[31] In the 1920s Eli introduced the new concept of straight-line production, where raw materials entered at one end of the facility and the finished product came out the other end, in the company’s manufacturing process. Under Eli’s supervision, the design for Building 22, a new 5-floor plant that opened in Indianapolis in 1926, implemented the straight-line concept to improve production efficiency and lower production costs.[33][34] One historian noted, "It was probably the most sophisticated production system in the American pharmaceutical industry."[34] This more efficient manufacturing process also allowed the company to hire a regular workforce. Instead of recalling workers at peak times and laying them off when production demand fell, Lilly's regular workforce produced less-costly medicines in off-peak times using the same manufacturing facilities.[23]
During the 1920s the introduction of new products also brought the company financial success.[19] In 1919 Josiah hired biochemist George Henry Alexander Clowes as director of biochemical research. In 1921 three University of Toronto scientists, J. J. R. Macleod, Frederick G. Banting, and Charles H. Best, were working on the development of insulin for treatment of diabetes.[35] Clowes and Eli Lilly met with the researchers in 1922 to negotiate an agreement with the University of Toronto scientists to mass-produce insulin.[36] The collaboration led to the first successful large-scale production of insulin.[37] In 1923 Lilly began selling Iletin (Insulin, Lilly), their tradename for the first commercially available insulin product in the U.S for the treatment of diabetes.[38] Banting and Macleod won a Nobel Prize in 1923 for their research. Insulin, "the most important drug" in the company’s history, did "more than any other" to make Lilly "one of the major pharmaceutical manufacturers in the world."[35]
The success of insulin enabled the company to attract well-respected scientists and, with them, make more medical advances. By its fiftieth anniversary in 1926 sales reached $9 million and the company produced more than 2,800 different items.[23] In 1928 Lilly introduced Liver Extract 343 for the treatment of pernicious anemia, a blood disorder, in a joint venture with two Harvard University scientists, George R. Minot and William P. Murphy. In 1930 Lilly introduced Liver Extract No. 55 in collaboration with George Whipple, a University of Rochester scientist.[39] Minot, Murphy, and Whipple won the 1934 Nobel Prize in medicine for their research.[40]
Despite the economic challenges of the Great Depression, Lilly's sales rose to $13 million in 1932.[41] That same year Eli Lilly, the eldest grandson of Col. Lilly, was named as the company's president to succeed his father, who remained as chairman of the board until 1948. Eli joined the family business in 1909.[6] In his early years at the company Eli was especially interested in improving production efficiency and introduced a number of labor-saving devices. He also introduced scientific management principles and implemented cost-savings measures that modernized the company.[42] In addition Eli was involved in expanding the company’s research efforts and collaborations with university researchers.[43]
In 1934 the firm opened two new facilities on the McCarty Street complex: a replica of Lilly’s 1876 laboratory and the new Lilly Research Laboratories, "one of the most fully equipped facilities in the world."[44] In the 1930s the company also continued expansion overseas.[45] In 1934 Eli Lilly and Company Limited, the company's first overseas subsidiary was established in England, with headquarters in London and a manufacturing plant in Basingstoke.[41][45]
Expansion: 1940–70[edit]
World War II brought production at Lilly to a new high with the manufacturing of Merthiolate and penicillin. During the war Lilly also cooperated with the American Red Cross to process blood plasma and by war's end the company had dried over two million pints of blood, "about 20 percent of the United States' total".[46] Merthiolate, first introduced in 1930, was an "anticeptic and germicide" that became a U.S. army "standard issue" during World War II.[47][48] In the early 1940s Lilly became one of the companies mass-producing penicillin.[49]
International operations expanded even further during World War II.[45] Eli Lilly International Corp. was formed in 1943 as a subsidiary to encourage business trade abroad. By 1948 Lilly employees worked in thirty-five countries, most of them as sales representatives in Latin America, Asia, and Africa.[45]
At the end of World War II the company continued to grow. In 1945 Lilly began a major expansion effort that would include two manufacturing operations in Indianapolis. The company purchased the massive Curtiss-Wright propeller plant on South Kentucky Avenue, west of the company's McCarty Street operation. When renovation was completed in mid-1947, the Kentucky Avenue location manufactured antibiotics and capsules and housed the company’s shipping department.[50] By 1948 Lilly employed nearly 7,000 people.[10]
Eli Lilly, who had served as the company's president since 1932, retired from active management of the company in 1948, became chairman of the board, and relinquished the presidency to his brother, Josiah K. Lilly, Jr. (Joe).[51] During Eli's sixteen-year presidency sales rose from $13 million in 1932 to $117 million in 1948. Joe joined the company in 1914 and concentrated on the company's personnel and marketing efforts.[24] He served as company president from 1948 to 1953, then became chairman of the board and remained in that capacity until his death in 1966.[52] In 1952 the company offered its first public shares of stock.[53] In 1953 Eugene N. Beesley was named the company's new president, the first non-family member to run the company.
Over the next several decades Lilly continued to develop and introduce new drugs to the marketplace. In the 1950s Lilly introduced two new antibiotics: vancomycin and erythromycin. In addition Lilly was heavily involved in production and distribution of Jonas Salk's poliomyelitis (polio) vaccine. In 1954 the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (NFIP) contracted with five pharmaceutical companies to produce Salk's polio vaccine for clinical trials. These included Lilly as well as Parke, Davis and Company, Cutter Laboratories, Wyeth Laboratories, and Pitman-Moore Company.[54] Lilly's selection to produce the vaccine was, in part, due to its previous experience in collaborations with university researchers.[55] Lilly manufactured 60 percent of the Salk vaccine in 1955.
During the mid-twentieth century Lilly continued to expand its production facilities outside of Indianapolis. In 1950 Lilly began Tippecanoe Laboratories in Lafayette, Indiana,[56] and increased antibiotic production with its patent on erythromycin. In 1954 Lilly formed Elanco Products Company for the production of veterinary pharmaceuticals. In 1969 the company opened a new plant in Clinton, Indiana.[56]
After a company reorganization and transition to non-family management in 1953, Lilly continued to expand its global presence. In the 1960s Lilly operated thirteen affiliate companies outside the United States.[57] In 1962, with an acquisition from Distillers Company, the company established a major factory in Liverpool, England. In 1968 Lilly built its first research facility, the Lilly Research Centre Limited, outside the United States near London, England.
1970– present[edit]
During the 1970s and 1980s, Eli Lilly and Company saw a flurry of drug production: an antibiotic, Keflex, in 1971; a heart drug, Dobutrex, in 1977; Ceclor, which would become the world's top selling oral antibiotic, in 1979; a leukemia drug, Eldisine; an antiarthritic, Oraflex; and an analgesic, Darvon. When generic drugs flooded the marketplace after the expiration of patents for drugs discovered in the 1950s and 1960s, Lilly diversified into other areas, most notably agricultural chemicals, animal-health products, cosmetics, and medical instruments.
To further diversify its product line, Lilly made an uncharacteristic, but ultimately profitable move in 1971, when it bought cosmetic manufacturer Elizabeth Arden, Inc. for $38 million. Although the subsidiary continued to lose money for five years after Lilly acquired it, executive management changes at Arden helped turn it into a financial success. By 1982 the subsidiary's "sales were up 90 percent from 1978, with profits doubling to nearly $30 million." Sixteen years after its acquisition, Lilly sold Arden to Fabergé in 1987 for $657 million.[58]
In 1977 Lilly ventured into medical instruments with the acquisition of IVAC Corporation, which manufactures vital signs and intravenous fluid infusion monitoring systems. Lilly also purchased Cardiac Pacemakers Incorporated, a manufacturer of heart pacemakers in 1977. In 1980 Lilly acquired Physio-Control Corporation. Other acquisitions included Advance Cardiovasular Systems Incorporated in 1984, Hybritech in 1986, and Devices for Vascular Intervention, Incorporated in 1989. Lilly acquired Pacific Biotech in 1990 and Origin Medsystems and Heart Rhythm Technologies, Incorporated in 1992. In the early 1990s Lilly combined these medical equipment companies into a Medical Devices and Diagnostics Division that "contributed about 20 percent" of Lilly’s annual revenues.
In 1989 a joint agri-chemical venture between Elanco Products Company and Dow Chemical created DowElanco. In 1997 Lilly sold its 40 percent share in the company to Dow Chemical for $1.2 billion and the name was changed to Dow AgroSciences.[59][60][61]
In 1994 Lilly acquired PCS Systems, a drug delivery business for Health Maintenance Organizations, and later added two similar organizations to its holdings.[62] Lilly purchased PCS, which was the largest U.S. prescription drug benefits manager at the time, for $4 billion.[63]
In 1991 Vaughn Bryson was named CEO of Eli Lilly. During his 20-month tenure, the company reported its first quarterly loss as a publicly traded company.[64] In 1993 Randall L. Tobias, a vice-chairman of AT&T Corporation and Lilly board member, was named Lilly's chairman, president, and CEO after "product and competitive pressures" had "steadily eroded Lilly's stock price since early 1992."[65] Tobias was the first president and CEO recruited from outside of the company. Under Tobias's leadership the company "cut costs and narrowed its mission".[66] Lilly sold companies in its Medical Device and Diagnostics Division, expanded international sales, made new acquisitions, and funded additional research and product development. Sidney Taurel, former chief operating officer of Lilly, was named CEO in 1998, replacing Tobias. Taurel was named chairman in January 1999. In 2000 Lilly reported $10.86 billion in net sales.




Eli Lilly's present day global manufacturing plants.


In 1998 Eli Lilly formed a joint venture with Icos Corporation (ICOS), a Bothell, Washington-based biotechnology company, to develop and commercialize Cialis, a product for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. In October 2006 Lilly announced its intention to acquire Icos for $2.1 billion, or $32 per share.[67] After its initial attempt to acquire Icos failed under pressure from large institutional shareholders, Lilly revised its offer to $34 per share. Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), a proxy advisory firm, advised Icos shareholders to reject the proposal as undervalued,[68][69] but the buyout was approved by Icos shareholders and Lilly completed its acquisition of the company on January 29, 2007.[70][71] Lilly closed Icos manufacturing operations, terminated nearly 500 Icos employees, and left 127 employees working at the biologics facility.[72] In December 2007 CMC Biopharmaceuticals A/S (CMC), a Copenhagen, Denmark-based provider of contract biomanufacturing services, bought the Bothell-based biologics facility from Lilly and retained the existing 127 employees.[69][72][73]
In January 2009, the largest criminal fine in U.S. history, totaling $1.415 billion was imposed on Lilly for illegal marketing of its best-selling product, the atypical antipsychotic medication, Zyprexa.[74]
In January 2011, Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly and Company announced their global agreement for the joint development and marketing of new APIs for diabetes therapy. Lilly could receive more than one billion dollars for their work on the project, while Boehringer Ingelheim could receive more than $800 million from development of the new drugs.[75] Oral anti-diabetic of Boehringer Ingelheim–Linagliptin and BI 10773–and two insulin analogs of Lilly–LY2605541 and LY2963016–were in phase II and III of clinical developmentat that time.[76]
In April 2014, Lilly announced plans to buy Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG's animal health business for $5.4 billion in cash to strengthen and diversify its Elanco unit. Lilly said it planned to fund the deal with about $3.4 billion of cash on hand and $2 billion of loans.[77] As a condition of the acquisition, the Sentinel heartworm treatment would be divested to Virbac in order to avoid a monopoly in a subsector of the heartworm treatment market.[78]
In March 2015, the company announced it would join Hanmi Pharmaceutical in developing and commercialising Hanmi's phase I Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor HM71224 in a deal which could yield $690 million.[79] A day later the company announced another deal with Innovent Biologics, Inc to co-develop and commercialise at least three of Innovents treatments over the next decade, in a deal which could generate up to $456 million. As part of the deal the company will contribute its c-Met monoclonal antibody whilst Innovent will contribute a monoclonal antibody which targets CD-20. The second compound from Innovent is a preclinical immuno-oncology molecule.[80] The following week the company announced it would restart its collaboration with Pfizer surrounding the Phase III trial of Tanezumab. Pfizer is expected to receive an upfront sum of $200 million from the company.[81] In April 2015, the company engaged CBRE Group to sell its biomanufacturing facility in Vacaville, California.[82] The facility resides on a 52 acres (0.21 km2) campus and is one of the largest biopharmaceutical manufacturing centers in the United States.[82]
In January 2017, the company announced it would acquire CoLucid Pharmaceuticals for $960 million, specifically gaining the late clinical-stage migraine therapy candidate, lasmiditan,[83] with the deal completing in March.[84] In march, the company also announced that it had completed the acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc's (a subsidiary of Boehringer Ingelheim) US feline, canine and rabies vaccines portfolio.[85]

Collaborative research[edit]
Further information: Lilly Research Laboratories
Eli Lilly and Company has a long history of collaboration with research scientists. In 1886 Ernest G. Eberhardt, a chemist, joined the company as its first full-time research scientist.[97] Lilly also hired two botanists, Walter H. Evans and John S. Wright, to join its early research efforts.[14][98] After World War I the company’s expanded production facilities and introduction of new management methods set the stage for Lilly's next crucial phase—its "aggressive entry into scientific research and development."[10] The first big step came in 1919 when Josiah Lilly hired biochemist George Henry Alexander Clowes as director of biochemical research.[99] Clowes had extensive medical research expertise and links to the scientific research community, which led to the company's collaborations with researchers in the U.S. and elsewhere.[100] Clowes's first major collaboration with researchers who developed insulin at the University of Toronto significantly impacted the company’s future.[100] Lilly’s success with insulin production secured the company's position as a leading research-based pharmaceutical manufacturer, allowing it to attract and hire more research scientists and to collaborate with other universities in additional medical research.[101] In 1934 the company built a new research laboratory in Indianapolis.[35] As part of its research and product development process Lilly also conducted clinical studies at Indianapolis City Hospital (Wishard Memorial Hospital). Lilly continues to conduct clinical studies to test medications before their introduction to the market.[102] In 1949 Eli Lilly actually went into partnership with the United States Army Reserve setting up a local Strategic Intelligence Research and Analysis (SIRA)Unit to allow employees to research company data for the Scientific Logistics and Eurasian fields of study (source: declassified Defense Intelligence Agency document MDR -0191-2008 dated 17 Sep 2012). In 1998 the company dedicated new laboratories for clinical research at the Indiana University Medical Center in Indianapolis.
Publicly funded research[edit]
In addition to internal research and development activities Lilly is also involved in publicly funded research projects with other industrial and academic partners. One example in the area of non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox, a collaboration with pharmaceutical companies, research organizations, and the European Commission to improve the safety of drugs.[103][104] In 2008 this consortium, which included Lilly S.A. (Switzerland), secured a €8 million budget for a 40-month project that was coordinated by the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), an organization who represents the research-based pharmaceutical industry and biotech companies operating in Europe.[104][105][106] In 2008 Lilly's activities included research projects within the framework of the Innovative Medicines Initiative, a public-private research initiative in Europe that is a joint effort of the EFPIA and the European Commission.[107][108][109]
Pharmaceutical brands[edit]
The company's most important products introduced prior to World War II included insulin, which Lilly marketed as Iletin (Insulin, Lilly), Amytal, Merthiolate, ephedrine, and liver extracts.[48] Introduced in 1923, Iletin (Insulin, Lilly) was Lilly's first commercial insulin product. In 2002 the company was the leading producer of products for those with diabetes.[citation needed]
During World War II Lilly produced penicillins and other antibiotics. In addition to penicillin, other wartime production included "antimalarials," blood plasma, encephalitis vaccine, typhus and influenza vaccine, gas gangrene antitoxin, Merthiolate, and Iletin (Insulin, Lilly).[110]
Among the company's more recent pharmaceutical developments are cephalosporin, erythromycin, and Prozac (fluoxetine), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for the treatment of clinical depression. Ceclor, introduced in the 1970s, was an oral cephalosporin antibiotic. Prozac, introduced in the 1980s, quickly became the company's best-selling product for treatment of depression, but Lilly lost its U.S. patent protection for this product in 2001. Among other distinctions, Lilly is the world's largest manufacturer and distributor of medications used in a broad range of psychiatric and mental health-related conditions, including clinical depression, generalized anxiety disorder, narcotic addiction, insomnia, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and others.
Cialis[edit]
Further information: Tadalafil
In 2003, Eli Lilly introduced Cialis (tadalafil), a competitor to Pfizer's blockbuster Viagra for erectile dysfunction. Cialis maintains an active period of 36 hours, causing it sometimes to be dubbed the "weekend pill". Cialis was developed in a partnership with biotechnology company Icos Corporation. On December 18, 2006, Lilly bought Icos in order to gain full control of the product.[111]
Cymbalta[edit]
Further information: Duloxetine
Another Lilly manufactured anti-depressant, Cymbalta, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor used predominantly in the treatment of major depressive disorders and generalized anxiety disorder, ranks with Prozac as one of the most financially successful pharmaceuticals in industry history. It is also used in the treatment of fibromyalgia, neuropathy, chronic pain and osteoarthritis.[citation needed]
Gemzar[edit]
Further information: Gemcitabine
In 1996 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Gemzar for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Gemzar is commonly used in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, usually in coordination with 5-FU chemotherapy and radiology. Gemzar also is routinely used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.
Methadone[edit]
Further information: Methadone
Eli Lilly was the first distributor of methadone, an analgesic used frequently in the treatment of heroin, opium and other opioid and narcotic drug addictions.[citation needed]
Prozac[edit]
Further information: Fluoxetine
Prozac was one of the first therapies in its class to treat clinical depression by blocking the uptake of serotonin within the human brain. It is prescribed to more than fifty-four million people worldwide.[citation needed] Prozac was approved by the U.S. FDA in 1987 for use in treating depression. In 2001 Lilly lost its U.S. patent protection for Prozac and in January 2002 the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Lilly's final appeal, a decision that allows other companies to make generic versions of the drug. Prozac has given rise to a number of comparably functioning therapies for the treatment of clinical depression and other central nervous system disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder, bulimia nervosa, and panic disorders.[citation needed]
Prozac in popular culture[edit]
Because of its wide appeal as a popular anti-depressant, references to Prozac have appeared in books, movies, and music. Prozac Nation (1994), an autobiographical book by Elizabeth Wurtzel, was turned into a film of the same name in 2001 and starred Christina Ricci. Listening to Prozac (1993), by Peter Kramer, was a generally analytical look at Prozac and its uses, not only to treat disorders but to diagnose them as well. Talking Back to Prozac (1994), by psychiatrist Peter Breggin, focuses on Prozac's side effects. Rapper Jay-Z referenced Prozac in the song, "Nigga What, Nigga Who" (1998). In HBO's fictional series, The Sopranos, Tony Soprano's use of Prozac is periodically referenced.[citation needed]
Secobarbital[edit]
Further information: Secobarbital
Eli Lilly has manufactured Secobarbital, a barbiturate derivative with anaesthetic, anticonvulsant, sedative and hypnotic properties. Lilly marketed Secobarbital under the brand name Seconal. Secobarbital is indicated for the treatment of epilepsy, temporary insomnia and as a pre-operative medication to produce anaesthesia and anxiolysis in short surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures which are minimally painful. With the onset of new therapies for the treatment of these conditions, Secobarbital has been less utilized, and Lilly ceased manufacturing it in 2001.[citation needed]
Secobarbital overdoses[edit]
Secobarbital gained considerable attention during the 1970s, when it gained wide popularity as a recreational drug. On September 18, 1970, rock guitarist legend Jimi Hendrix died from a secobarbital overdose. On June 22, 1969, secobarbital overdose was the cause of death of actress Judy Garland. The drug was a central part of the plot of the hugely popular novel Valley of the Dolls (1966) by Jacqueline Susann in which three highly successful Hollywood women each fall victim, in various ways, to the drug. The novel was later released as a film by the same name.[citation needed]
Thimerosal[edit]
Further information: Thiomersal
Eli Lilly has developed the vaccine preservative thiomersal (also called merthiolate and thimerosal). Thiomersal is effective by causing susceptible bacteria to autolyze. Launched in 1930, merthiolate was a mercury-based antiseptic and germicide that "had been formulated at the University of Maryland with support of a Lilly research fellowship."[48]
Zyprexa[edit]
Zyprexa (for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, as well as off-label uses) Released in 1996, and as of 2010, Lilly's best-selling drug of all time[112]

Personnel[edit]
After three generations of Lilly family leadership under company founder, Col. Eli Lilly, his son, Josiah K. Lilly Sr., and two grandsons, Eli Lilly Jr. and Josiah K. Lilly Jr., the company announced a reorganization in 1944 that prepared the way for future expansion and the eventual separation of company management from its ownership.[115] The large, complex corporation was divided into smaller groups headed by vice presidents and in 1953 Eugene N. Beesley was named the first non-family member to become the company’s president.[57]
Although Lilly family members continued to serve as chairman of the board until 1969, Beesley's appointment began the transition to non-family management.[57] In 1972 Richard D. Wood became Lilly's president and CEO after the retirement of Burton E. Beck.[116] In 1991 Vaughn Bryson became president and Wood became board chairman.[117] During Bryson's 20-month tenure as Lilly's president and CEO, the company reported its first quarterly loss as a publicly traded company.[64]
Randall L. Tobias, a vice chairman of AT&T Corporation, was named chairman, president, and CEO in June 1993. Tobias, a Lilly board member since 1986, was recruited from outside the company's executive ranks to replace Lilly's president, Vaughn Bryson, and board chairman, Richard Wood.[64] Tobias later became the U.S. director of Foreign Assistance and administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), with the rank of ambassador.[118]
Sidney Taurel, former chief operating officer of Lilly, was named CEO in July 1998 to replace Tobias, who retired. Taurel became chairman of the board in January 1999.[119] Taurel retired as CEO on March 31, 2008, but remained as chairman of the board until December 31, 2008. John Lechleiter was elected as Lilly’s CEO and president, effective April 1, 2008. Lechleiter had served as Lilly's president and chief operating officer since October 2005.[120] In July 2016 Dave Ricks, who also had a long career at Lily, was appointed CEO.[121]
A number of global leaders in the fields of health policy, management, and scientific research have worked at Lilly, including:

Ernesto Bustamante, Peruvian scientist.
Jose F. Caro, American physician, scientist, and educator most notable for his research in obesity and diabetes.
Richard DiMarchi, Chief Scientific Officer, Marcadia Biotech.
Mitch Daniels, current president of Purdue University, former Governor of Indiana and director of the Office of Management and Budget for President George W. Bush.
Roald Hoffmann, Nobel Prize-winning chemist.
Michael Johns, former White House speechwriter and Heritage Foundation policy analyst.
Claude H. Nash, CEO, ViroPharma.
Peter Nicholas, co-founder of Boston Scientific.

Prominent Lilly board members have included:

George H. W. Bush, former President and Vice President of the United States of America.
Martin Feldstein, economist, Harvard University.
Kenneth Lay, former CEO, Enron.
William Verity Jr., former U.S. Secretary of Commerce.

Accolades[edit]
In 2006 Fortune magazine named Eli Lilly and Company one of the top 100 companies in the United States for which to work. Also in 2006, Barron's Magazine named the company among the top 500 best managed companies in the U.S.
In 2012 Working Mothers magazine named Lilly one of the "100 Best Companies for Working Mothers" for the eighteenth consecutive year. Working Mother reported that in 2012 forty-eight percent of Lilly’s U.S. employees and thirty-four percent of its U.S. managers and executives were women.[122][123]
Community service[edit]
The Lilly family as well as Eli Lilly and Company has a long history of community service. Around 1890 Col. Lilly turned over operation of the family business to his son, Josiah, who ran the company for the next several decades.[14] Col. Lilly remained active in civic affairs and assisted a number of local organizations, including the Commercial Club of Indianapolis, which later became the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce,[124] and the Charity Organization Society, a forerunner to the Family Services Association of Central Indiana, an organization supported by United Way.[14][125] Josiah’s sons, Eli and Joe, were also philanthropists who supported numerous cultural and educational organizations.[126]
It was Josiah Sr. who continued his father's civic mindedness and began the company tradition of sending aid to disaster victims.[6] Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the company sent much needed medicine to support recovery efforts and provided relief after the 1936 Johnstown Flood.[6]
In 1917 Lilly Field Hospital 32, named in Josiah’s honor, was equipped in Indianapolis and moved overseas to Contrexville, France, during World War I, where it remained in operation until 1919.[6] Throughout World War II, Lilly manufactured more than two hundred products for military use, including aviator survival kits and seasickness medications for the D-Day invasion.[41] In addition Lilly dried more than two million pints of blood plasma by the war’s end.[46]
Lilly Endowment[edit]
Main article: Lilly Endowment
In 1937 Josiah K. Lilly Sr. and his two sons, Eli and Joe, founded the Lilly Endowment, a private charitable foundation, with gifts of Lilly stock.[127]
Eli Lilly and Company Foundation[edit]
The Eli Lilly and Company Foundation, which is separate from the Lilly Endowment, operates as a tax-exempt private charitable foundation that the company established in 1968. The Foundation is funded through Lilly’s corporate profits.[128]
Controversy[edit]
See also: List of largest pharmaceutical settlements
Eli Lilly has been involved in several controversies, including political and medical ethics controversies. Eli Lilly is now the sole manufacturer of BGH having purchased the rights to manufacture the drug from Monsanto.
NAFTA Suit[edit]
In September 2013, Eli Lilly sued Canada for violating its obligations to foreign investors under the North American Free Trade Agreement by allowing its courts to invalidate patents for two of its drugs. The company sought damages in the amount of $500 million for lost potential profits.[129]
Criminal prosecution[edit]
See also: Olanzapine § Controversy, lawsuits and settlements; and James Gottstein § Eli Lilly memos
In 2009, four sales representatives for Eli Lilly filed separate qui tam lawsuits against the company for illegally marketing the drug Zyprexa for uses not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Eli Lilly pleaded guilty to actively promoting Zyprexa for off-label uses, particularly for the treatment of dementia in the elderly. The $1.415 billion penalty included an $800 million civil settlement and a $515 million criminal fine. The U.S. Justice Department said the criminal fine of $515 million was the largest ever in a health care case, and the largest criminal fine for an individual corporation ever imposed in a U.S. criminal prosecution of any kind.[130][131] "That was a blemish for us," John C. Lechleiter, CEO of Lilly, told The New York Times. "We don’t ever want that to happen again. We put measures in place to assure that not only do we have the right intentions in integrity and compliance, but we have systems in place to support that."[132] In an internal email, Lechleiter had stated "we must seize the opportunity to expand our work with Zyprexa in this same child-adolescent population" (for off-label use.)[133]

Company profile[edit]




Eli Lilly and Company's global headquarters, in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States


A Fortune 500 corporation, Eli Lilly had revenues of $20 billion in 2008, making it the 148th largest company in the United States and the 10th largest corporation by global pharmaceutical sales. The company is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange and is a member of the S&P 500 stock index. Eli Lilly was one of the Nifty Fifty stocks that propelled the mid-twentieth-century bull market.[citation needed]
Eli Lilly is a full member of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA).[2]
According to Forbes, Lilly ranked as the 243rd largest public company in the world in 2016, with sales of US$20 billion and a market value of $86 billion.[3]
As of 1997 it was the largest corporation and the largest charitable benefactor in Indiana.[4]
History[edit]
Company founder[edit]
Main article: Eli Lilly
The company's founder was Colonel Eli Lilly, a pharmaceutical chemist and Union army veteran of the American Civil War.[5] Lilly served as the company president until his death in 1898.[6] A stylized version of his signature still appears in the company's red logo.[5]
In 1869, after working for drugstores in Greencastle and Indianapolis, Indiana, Lilly became a partner in a Paris, Illinois, drugstore with James W. Binford.[7] Although the drugstore was profitable, Lilly was more interested in medicinal manufacturing than running a pharmacy. He began formulating plans to create a company of his own. Lilly left the partnership with Binford in 1873 and returned to Indianapolis. Lilly opened a drug manufacturing operation called Johnston and Lilly with John F. Johnston as his partner in 1874, but dissolved the failing partnership on March 27, 1876. Lilly used his share of the assets, which amounted to an estimated $400 in merchandise (several pieces of equipment and a few gallons of unmixed chemicals) and about $1,000 in cash, to open his own pharmaceutical manufacturing business in Indianapolis in May 1876.[8][9] His new business venture became Eli Lilly and Company.




Colonel Eli Lilly (1838–1898), founder


Early days: 1870s–1900[edit]
On May 10, 1876, Lilly opened his own laboratory in a rented, two-story brick building (now demolished) at 15 West Pearl Street in Indianapolis, where he began to manufacture medicinal drugs. The sign outside, above the shop's door, read: "Eli Lilly, Chemist."[5][10][11] Lilly began his manufacturing venture with $1,400 ($31,163 in 2015 chained dollars) in working capital and three employees: Albert Hall (chief compounder), Caroline Kruger (bottler and product finisher), and Lilly's fourteen-year-old son, Josiah (J. K.), who had quit school to work with his father as an apprentice.[12][9]
One of the first medicines that Lilly began to produce was quinine, a drug used to treat malaria. The result was a "ten fold" increase in sales.[13] At the end of 1876, his first year of business, sales reached $4,470 ($99,499 in 2015 chained dollars).[13] At the end of 1877 sales reached $11,318 ($251,932 in 2015 chained dollars),[14] and by 1879 they had grown to $48,000 ($1,221,086 in 2015 chained dollars).[13] Lilly hired his brother, James, as his first full-time salesman in 1878. James and the subsequent sales team marketed the company's drugs nationally.[15]
The company outgrew its first location on Pearl Street, where it remained from 1876 to 1878, and moved to larger quarters at 36 South Meridian Street. In 1881 Lilly purchased a complex of buildings on property at McCarty and Alabama Streets and moved the company to its new headquarters in Indianapolis's south-side industrial area. Lilly later purchased additional facilities for research and production.[16][17]
Lilly committed himself to producing high-quality prescription drugs, in contrast to the common and often ineffective patent medicines. From its facilities in Indianapolis the company manufactured and sold "ethical drugs" for use by the medical profession. Lilly's medicines included labels that disclosed product ingredients.[5] Lilly's first innovation was gelatin-coating for pills and capsules. The company’s other early innovations included fruit flavorings and sugarcoated pills, which made the medicines easier to swallow.[12]
In 1881 Lilly formally incorporated the business as Eli Lilly and Company, elected a board of directors, and issued stock to family members and close associates.[15] Colonel Lilly's only son, Josiah (J. K.), a pharmaceutical chemist, graduated from the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy in 1882, and joined the family business as a superintendent of its laboratory after college. J. K. became company president in 1898.[18] In 1883 the company contracted to mix and sell Succus Alteran, its first widely successful product and one its best sellers. The product was marketed as a "blood purifier" and as a treatment for syphilis, some types of rheumatism, and skin diseases such as eczema and psoriasis.[17][19] Sales from this product provided funds for Lilly to expand its manufacturing and research facilities.[14] By the late 1880s Colonel Lilly was one of the Indianapolis area's leading businessmen, whose company had more than one-hundred employees and had $200,000 ($5,276,296 in 2015 chained dollars) in annual sales.[7]
As the Lilly company grew, other businesses set up operations near the plant on Indianapolis's near south side. The area developed into one of the city's major business and industrial hubs. Lilly's production, manufacturing, research, and administrative operations in Indianapolis eventually occupied a complex of more than two dozen buildings covering a fifteen-block area, as well as production plants along Kentucky Avenue.[20]

Around 1890 Colonel Lilly turned over the day-to-day management of the business to his son, J. K., who ran the company for thirty-four years. Although the 1890s were a tumultuous decade economically, the company flourished and came out stronger than ever.[7][21] In 1894 Lilly purchased a manufacturing plant to be used solely for creating capsules. The company also made several technological advances in the manufacturing process, including automating its capsule production. Over the next few years the company annually created tens of millions of capsules and pills.[22]
Until the turn of the century Lilly operated in Indianapolis and the surrounding area as many other pharmaceutical businesses did—manufacturing and selling "sugar-coated pills, fluid extracts, elixirs, and syrups."[19] The company used plants for its raw materials and produced its products by hand. One historian noted, "Although the Indianapolis firm was more careful in making and promoting drugs that the patent medicine men of the era, the company remained ambivalent about scientific research."[19]
In addition to Colonel Lilly, his brother, James, and son, Josiah (J. K.), the growing company employed other Lilly family. Colonel Lilly's cousin, Evan Lilly, was hired as a bookkeeper.[21] As young boys, Lilly's grandsons, Eli and Josiah Jr. (Joe), ran errands and performed other odd jobs. Eli and Joe joined the family business after college. Eventually, each grandson served as company president and chairman of the board.[23]
Josiah (J. K.), Colonel Lilly's son and Eli and Joe's father, inherited the company after Colonel Lilly died and became its president in 1898.[6] At the time of Colonel Lilly's death the company had a product line of 2,005 items and annual sales of more than $300,000 ($8,547,600 in 2015 chained dollars).[24] Colonel Lilly was a pioneer in the modern pharmaceutical industry, with many of his early innovations later becoming standard practice. His ethical reforms in a trade that was marked by outlandish claims of miracle medicines began a period of rapid advancement in the development of medicinal drugs.[25] J. K. Lilly continued to advocate for federal regulation on medicines.[26] Under J. K.'s leadership, the company introduced scientific management concepts, organized the company's research department, increased its sales force, and began international distribution of its products.[27] In addition J. K. oversaw a large expansion of the company. By 1905 the company reached sales of $1 million ($26,381,481 in 2015 chained dollars).[6]

Modernization:1900–40[edit]
Just before and after World War I, the Lilly company experienced rapid change.[19] Expansion of Lilly's manufacturing facilities at the McCarty Street plant improved production capacity with a new Science Building (Building 14), opened in 1911, and a new capsule plant (Building 15) in 1913.[28] The company also began constructions of the Lilly Biological Laboratories, a research and manufacturing plant on 150 acres near Greenfield, Indiana, in 1913.[29][30]
In addition to development of new medicines, the company achieved several technological advances, including automation of its production facilities. Lilly was also an innovator in pill capsule manufacturing. It was among the first manufacturers to insert medications into empty gelatin capsules, which provided a more exact dosage.[5] Lilly manufactured capsules for its own needs and sold its excess capacity to others.[31] A 1917 Scientific American article claimed the Lilly operation in Indianapolis was "the largest capsule factory in the world" and was "capable of producing 2.5 million capsules a day".[31] One of Lilly's innovations was fruit flavoring for medicines and sugar-coated pills to make their medicines easier to swallow.[12] Over the next few years the company began to create tens of millions of capsules and pills annually.[22]
Other advances improved plant efficiency and eliminated production errors. Eli Lilly, grandson of the company founder, introduced a method for blueprinting manufacturing tickets in 1909.[32] This process, which created multiples copies of a drug formula, helped eliminate manufacturing and transcription errors.[31] In the 1920s Eli introduced the new concept of straight-line production, where raw materials entered at one end of the facility and the finished product came out the other end, in the company’s manufacturing process. Under Eli’s supervision, the design for Building 22, a new 5-floor plant that opened in Indianapolis in 1926, implemented the straight-line concept to improve production efficiency and lower production costs.[33][34] One historian noted, "It was probably the most sophisticated production system in the American pharmaceutical industry."[34] This more efficient manufacturing process also allowed the company to hire a regular workforce. Instead of recalling workers at peak times and laying them off when production demand fell, Lilly's regular workforce produced less-costly medicines in off-peak times using the same manufacturing facilities.[23]
During the 1920s the introduction of new products also brought the company financial success.[19] In 1919 Josiah hired biochemist George Henry Alexander Clowes as director of biochemical research. In 1921 three University of Toronto scientists, J. J. R. Macleod, Frederick G. Banting, and Charles H. Best, were working on the development of insulin for treatment of diabetes.[35] Clowes and Eli Lilly met with the researchers in 1922 to negotiate an agreement with the University of Toronto scientists to mass-produce insulin.[36] The collaboration led to the first successful large-scale production of insulin.[37] In 1923 Lilly began selling Iletin (Insulin, Lilly), their tradename for the first commercially available insulin product in the U.S for the treatment of diabetes.[38] Banting and Macleod won a Nobel Prize in 1923 for their research. Insulin, "the most important drug" in the company’s history, did "more than any other" to make Lilly "one of the major pharmaceutical manufacturers in the world."[35]
The success of insulin enabled the company to attract well-respected scientists and, with them, make more medical advances. By its fiftieth anniversary in 1926 sales reached $9 million and the company produced more than 2,800 different items.[23] In 1928 Lilly introduced Liver Extract 343 for the treatment of pernicious anemia, a blood disorder, in a joint venture with two Harvard University scientists, George R. Minot and William P. Murphy. In 1930 Lilly introduced Liver Extract No. 55 in collaboration with George Whipple, a University of Rochester scientist.[39] Minot, Murphy, and Whipple won the 1934 Nobel Prize in medicine for their research.[40]
Despite the economic challenges of the Great Depression, Lilly's sales rose to $13 million in 1932.[41] That same year Eli Lilly, the eldest grandson of Col. Lilly, was named as the company's president to succeed his father, who remained as chairman of the board until 1948. Eli joined the family business in 1909.[6] In his early years at the company Eli was especially interested in improving production efficiency and introduced a number of labor-saving devices. He also introduced scientific management principles and implemented cost-savings measures that modernized the company.[42] In addition Eli was involved in expanding the company’s research efforts and collaborations with university researchers.[43]
In 1934 the firm opened two new facilities on the McCarty Street complex: a replica of Lilly’s 1876 laboratory and the new Lilly Research Laboratories, "one of the most fully equipped facilities in the world."[44] In the 1930s the company also continued expansion overseas.[45] In 1934 Eli Lilly and Company Limited, the company's first overseas subsidiary was established in England, with headquarters in London and a manufacturing plant in Basingstoke.[41][45]
Expansion: 1940–70[edit]
World War II brought production at Lilly to a new high with the manufacturing of Merthiolate and penicillin. During the war Lilly also cooperated with the American Red Cross to process blood plasma and by war's end the company had dried over two million pints of blood, "about 20 percent of the United States' total".[46] Merthiolate, first introduced in 1930, was an "anticeptic and germicide" that became a U.S. army "standard issue" during World War II.[47][48] In the early 1940s Lilly became one of the companies mass-producing penicillin.[49]
International operations expanded even further during World War II.[45] Eli Lilly International Corp. was formed in 1943 as a subsidiary to encourage business trade abroad. By 1948 Lilly employees worked in thirty-five countries, most of them as sales representatives in Latin America, Asia, and Africa.[45]
At the end of World War II the company continued to grow. In 1945 Lilly began a major expansion effort that would include two manufacturing operations in Indianapolis. The company purchased the massive Curtiss-Wright propeller plant on South Kentucky Avenue, west of the company's McCarty Street operation. When renovation was completed in mid-1947, the Kentucky Avenue location manufactured antibiotics and capsules and housed the company’s shipping department.[50] By 1948 Lilly employed nearly 7,000 people.[10]
Eli Lilly, who had served as the company's president since 1932, retired from active management of the company in 1948, became chairman of the board, and relinquished the presidency to his brother, Josiah K. Lilly, Jr. (Joe).[51] During Eli's sixteen-year presidency sales rose from $13 million in 1932 to $117 million in 1948. Joe joined the company in 1914 and concentrated on the company's personnel and marketing efforts.[24] He served as company president from 1948 to 1953, then became chairman of the board and remained in that capacity until his death in 1966.[52] In 1952 the company offered its first public shares of stock.[53] In 1953 Eugene N. Beesley was named the company's new president, the first non-family member to run the company.
Over the next several decades Lilly continued to develop and introduce new drugs to the marketplace. In the 1950s Lilly introduced two new antibiotics: vancomycin and erythromycin. In addition Lilly was heavily involved in production and distribution of Jonas Salk's poliomyelitis (polio) vaccine. In 1954 the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (NFIP) contracted with five pharmaceutical companies to produce Salk's polio vaccine for clinical trials. These included Lilly as well as Parke, Davis and Company, Cutter Laboratories, Wyeth Laboratories, and Pitman-Moore Company.[54] Lilly's selection to produce the vaccine was, in part, due to its previous experience in collaborations with university researchers.[55] Lilly manufactured 60 percent of the Salk vaccine in 1955.
During the mid-twentieth century Lilly continued to expand its production facilities outside of Indianapolis. In 1950 Lilly began Tippecanoe Laboratories in Lafayette, Indiana,[56] and increased antibiotic production with its patent on erythromycin. In 1954 Lilly formed Elanco Products Company for the production of veterinary pharmaceuticals. In 1969 the company opened a new plant in Clinton, Indiana.[56]
After a company reorganization and transition to non-family management in 1953, Lilly continued to expand its global presence. In the 1960s Lilly operated thirteen affiliate companies outside the United States.[57] In 1962, with an acquisition from Distillers Company, the company established a major factory in Liverpool, England. In 1968 Lilly built its first research facility, the Lilly Research Centre Limited, outside the United States near London, England.
1970– present[edit]
During the 1970s and 1980s, Eli Lilly and Company saw a flurry of drug production: an antibiotic, Keflex, in 1971; a heart drug, Dobutrex, in 1977; Ceclor, which would become the world's top selling oral antibiotic, in 1979; a leukemia drug, Eldisine; an antiarthritic, Oraflex; and an analgesic, Darvon. When generic drugs flooded the marketplace after the expiration of patents for drugs discovered in the 1950s and 1960s, Lilly diversified into other areas, most notably agricultural chemicals, animal-health products, cosmetics, and medical instruments.
To further diversify its product line, Lilly made an uncharacteristic, but ultimately profitable move in 1971, when it bought cosmetic manufacturer Elizabeth Arden, Inc. for $38 million. Although the subsidiary continued to lose money for five years after Lilly acquired it, executive management changes at Arden helped turn it into a financial success. By 1982 the subsidiary's "sales were up 90 percent from 1978, with profits doubling to nearly $30 million." Sixteen years after its acquisition, Lilly sold Arden to Fabergé in 1987 for $657 million.[58]
In 1977 Lilly ventured into medical instruments with the acquisition of IVAC Corporation, which manufactures vital signs and intravenous fluid infusion monitoring systems. Lilly also purchased Cardiac Pacemakers Incorporated, a manufacturer of heart pacemakers in 1977. In 1980 Lilly acquired Physio-Control Corporation. Other acquisitions included Advance Cardiovasular Systems Incorporated in 1984, Hybritech in 1986, and Devices for Vascular Intervention, Incorporated in 1989. Lilly acquired Pacific Biotech in 1990 and Origin Medsystems and Heart Rhythm Technologies, Incorporated in 1992. In the early 1990s Lilly combined these medical equipment companies into a Medical Devices and Diagnostics Division that "contributed about 20 percent" of Lilly’s annual revenues.
In 1989 a joint agri-chemical venture between Elanco Products Company and Dow Chemical created DowElanco. In 1997 Lilly sold its 40 percent share in the company to Dow Chemical for $1.2 billion and the name was changed to Dow AgroSciences.[59][60][61]
In 1994 Lilly acquired PCS Systems, a drug delivery business for Health Maintenance Organizations, and later added two similar organizations to its holdings.[62] Lilly purchased PCS, which was the largest U.S. prescription drug benefits manager at the time, for $4 billion.[63]
In 1991 Vaughn Bryson was named CEO of Eli Lilly. During his 20-month tenure, the company reported its first quarterly loss as a publicly traded company.[64] In 1993 Randall L. Tobias, a vice-chairman of AT&T Corporation and Lilly board member, was named Lilly's chairman, president, and CEO after "product and competitive pressures" had "steadily eroded Lilly's stock price since early 1992."[65] Tobias was the first president and CEO recruited from outside of the company. Under Tobias's leadership the company "cut costs and narrowed its mission".[66] Lilly sold companies in its Medical Device and Diagnostics Division, expanded international sales, made new acquisitions, and funded additional research and product development. Sidney Taurel, former chief operating officer of Lilly, was named CEO in 1998, replacing Tobias. Taurel was named chairman in January 1999. In 2000 Lilly reported $10.86 billion in net sales.




Eli Lilly's present day global manufacturing plants.


In 1998 Eli Lilly formed a joint venture with Icos Corporation (ICOS), a Bothell, Washington-based biotechnology company, to develop and commercialize Cialis, a product for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. In October 2006 Lilly announced its intention to acquire Icos for $2.1 billion, or $32 per share.[67] After its initial attempt to acquire Icos failed under pressure from large institutional shareholders, Lilly revised its offer to $34 per share. Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), a proxy advisory firm, advised Icos shareholders to reject the proposal as undervalued,[68][69] but the buyout was approved by Icos shareholders and Lilly completed its acquisition of the company on January 29, 2007.[70][71] Lilly closed Icos manufacturing operations, terminated nearly 500 Icos employees, and left 127 employees working at the biologics facility.[72] In December 2007 CMC Biopharmaceuticals A/S (CMC), a Copenhagen, Denmark-based provider of contract biomanufacturing services, bought the Bothell-based biologics facility from Lilly and retained the existing 127 employees.[69][72][73]
In January 2009, the largest criminal fine in U.S. history, totaling $1.415 billion was imposed on Lilly for illegal marketing of its best-selling product, the atypical antipsychotic medication, Zyprexa.[74]
In January 2011, Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly and Company announced their global agreement for the joint development and marketing of new APIs for diabetes therapy. Lilly could receive more than one billion dollars for their work on the project, while Boehringer Ingelheim could receive more than $800 million from development of the new drugs.[75] Oral anti-diabetic of Boehringer Ingelheim–Linagliptin and BI 10773–and two insulin analogs of Lilly–LY2605541 and LY2963016–were in phase II and III of clinical developmentat that time.[76]
In April 2014, Lilly announced plans to buy Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG's animal health business for $5.4 billion in cash to strengthen and diversify its Elanco unit. Lilly said it planned to fund the deal with about $3.4 billion of cash on hand and $2 billion of loans.[77] As a condition of the acquisition, the Sentinel heartworm treatment would be divested to Virbac in order to avoid a monopoly in a subsector of the heartworm treatment market.[78]
In March 2015, the company announced it would join Hanmi Pharmaceutical in developing and commercialising Hanmi's phase I Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor HM71224 in a deal which could yield $690 million.[79] A day later the company announced another deal with Innovent Biologics, Inc to co-develop and commercialise at least three of Innovents treatments over the next decade, in a deal which could generate up to $456 million. As part of the deal the company will contribute its c-Met monoclonal antibody whilst Innovent will contribute a monoclonal antibody which targets CD-20. The second compound from Innovent is a preclinical immuno-oncology molecule.[80] The following week the company announced it would restart its collaboration with Pfizer surrounding the Phase III trial of Tanezumab. Pfizer is expected to receive an upfront sum of $200 million from the company.[81] In April 2015, the company engaged CBRE Group to sell its biomanufacturing facility in Vacaville, California.[82] The facility resides on a 52 acres (0.21 km2) campus and is one of the largest biopharmaceutical manufacturing centers in the United States.[82]
In January 2017, the company announced it would acquire CoLucid Pharmaceuticals for $960 million, specifically gaining the late clinical-stage migraine therapy candidate, lasmiditan,[83] with the deal completing in March.[84] In march, the company also announced that it had completed the acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc's (a subsidiary of Boehringer Ingelheim) US feline, canine and rabies vaccines portfolio.[85]

Collaborative research[edit]
Further information: Lilly Research Laboratories
Eli Lilly and Company has a long history of collaboration with research scientists. In 1886 Ernest G. Eberhardt, a chemist, joined the company as its first full-time research scientist.[97] Lilly also hired two botanists, Walter H. Evans and John S. Wright, to join its early research efforts.[14][98] After World War I the company’s expanded production facilities and introduction of new management methods set the stage for Lilly's next crucial phase—its "aggressive entry into scientific research and development."[10] The first big step came in 1919 when Josiah Lilly hired biochemist George Henry Alexander Clowes as director of biochemical research.[99] Clowes had extensive medical research expertise and links to the scientific research community, which led to the company's collaborations with researchers in the U.S. and elsewhere.[100] Clowes's first major collaboration with researchers who developed insulin at the University of Toronto significantly impacted the company’s future.[100] Lilly’s success with insulin production secured the company's position as a leading research-based pharmaceutical manufacturer, allowing it to attract and hire more research scientists and to collaborate with other universities in additional medical research.[101] In 1934 the company built a new research laboratory in Indianapolis.[35] As part of its research and product development process Lilly also conducted clinical studies at Indianapolis City Hospital (Wishard Memorial Hospital). Lilly continues to conduct clinical studies to test medications before their introduction to the market.[102] In 1949 Eli Lilly actually went into partnership with the United States Army Reserve setting up a local Strategic Intelligence Research and Analysis (SIRA)Unit to allow employees to research company data for the Scientific Logistics and Eurasian fields of study (source: declassified Defense Intelligence Agency document MDR -0191-2008 dated 17 Sep 2012). In 1998 the company dedicated new laboratories for clinical research at the Indiana University Medical Center in Indianapolis.
Publicly funded research[edit]
In addition to internal research and development activities Lilly is also involved in publicly funded research projects with other industrial and academic partners. One example in the area of non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox, a collaboration with pharmaceutical companies, research organizations, and the European Commission to improve the safety of drugs.[103][104] In 2008 this consortium, which included Lilly S.A. (Switzerland), secured a €8 million budget for a 40-month project that was coordinated by the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), an organization who represents the research-based pharmaceutical industry and biotech companies operating in Europe.[104][105][106] In 2008 Lilly's activities included research projects within the framework of the Innovative Medicines Initiative, a public-private research initiative in Europe that is a joint effort of the EFPIA and the European Commission.[107][108][109]
Pharmaceutical brands[edit]
The company's most important products introduced prior to World War II included insulin, which Lilly marketed as Iletin (Insulin, Lilly), Amytal, Merthiolate, ephedrine, and liver extracts.[48] Introduced in 1923, Iletin (Insulin, Lilly) was Lilly's first commercial insulin product. In 2002 the company was the leading producer of products for those with diabetes.[citation needed]
During World War II Lilly produced penicillins and other antibiotics. In addition to penicillin, other wartime production included "antimalarials," blood plasma, encephalitis vaccine, typhus and influenza vaccine, gas gangrene antitoxin, Merthiolate, and Iletin (Insulin, Lilly).[110]
Among the company's more recent pharmaceutical developments are cephalosporin, erythromycin, and Prozac (fluoxetine), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for the treatment of clinical depression. Ceclor, introduced in the 1970s, was an oral cephalosporin antibiotic. Prozac, introduced in the 1980s, quickly became the company's best-selling product for treatment of depression, but Lilly lost its U.S. patent protection for this product in 2001. Among other distinctions, Lilly is the world's largest manufacturer and distributor of medications used in a broad range of psychiatric and mental health-related conditions, including clinical depression, generalized anxiety disorder, narcotic addiction, insomnia, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and others.
Cialis[edit]
Further information: Tadalafil
In 2003, Eli Lilly introduced Cialis (tadalafil), a competitor to Pfizer's blockbuster Viagra for erectile dysfunction. Cialis maintains an active period of 36 hours, causing it sometimes to be dubbed the "weekend pill". Cialis was developed in a partnership with biotechnology company Icos Corporation. On December 18, 2006, Lilly bought Icos in order to gain full control of the product.[111]
Cymbalta[edit]
Further information: Duloxetine
Another Lilly manufactured anti-depressant, Cymbalta, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor used predominantly in the treatment of major depressive disorders and generalized anxiety disorder, ranks with Prozac as one of the most financially successful pharmaceuticals in industry history. It is also used in the treatment of fibromyalgia, neuropathy, chronic pain and osteoarthritis.[citation needed]
Gemzar[edit]
Further information: Gemcitabine
In 1996 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Gemzar for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Gemzar is commonly used in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, usually in coordination with 5-FU chemotherapy and radiology. Gemzar also is routinely used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.
Methadone[edit]
Further information: Methadone
Eli Lilly was the first distributor of methadone, an analgesic used frequently in the treatment of heroin, opium and other opioid and narcotic drug addictions.[citation needed]
Prozac[edit]
Further information: Fluoxetine
Prozac was one of the first therapies in its class to treat clinical depression by blocking the uptake of serotonin within the human brain. It is prescribed to more than fifty-four million people worldwide.[citation needed] Prozac was approved by the U.S. FDA in 1987 for use in treating depression. In 2001 Lilly lost its U.S. patent protection for Prozac and in January 2002 the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Lilly's final appeal, a decision that allows other companies to make generic versions of the drug. Prozac has given rise to a number of comparably functioning therapies for the treatment of clinical depression and other central nervous system disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder, bulimia nervosa, and panic disorders.[citation needed]
Prozac in popular culture[edit]
Because of its wide appeal as a popular anti-depressant, references to Prozac have appeared in books, movies, and music. Prozac Nation (1994), an autobiographical book by Elizabeth Wurtzel, was turned into a film of the same name in 2001 and starred Christina Ricci. Listening to Prozac (1993), by Peter Kramer, was a generally analytical look at Prozac and its uses, not only to treat disorders but to diagnose them as well. Talking Back to Prozac (1994), by psychiatrist Peter Breggin, focuses on Prozac's side effects. Rapper Jay-Z referenced Prozac in the song, "Nigga What, Nigga Who" (1998). In HBO's fictional series, The Sopranos, Tony Soprano's use of Prozac is periodically referenced.[citation needed]
Secobarbital[edit]
Further information: Secobarbital
Eli Lilly has manufactured Secobarbital, a barbiturate derivative with anaesthetic, anticonvulsant, sedative and hypnotic properties. Lilly marketed Secobarbital under the brand name Seconal. Secobarbital is indicated for the treatment of epilepsy, temporary insomnia and as a pre-operative medication to produce anaesthesia and anxiolysis in short surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures which are minimally painful. With the onset of new therapies for the treatment of these conditions, Secobarbital has been less utilized, and Lilly ceased manufacturing it in 2001.[citation needed]
Secobarbital overdoses[edit]
Secobarbital gained considerable attention during the 1970s, when it gained wide popularity as a recreational drug. On September 18, 1970, rock guitarist legend Jimi Hendrix died from a secobarbital overdose. On June 22, 1969, secobarbital overdose was the cause of death of actress Judy Garland. The drug was a central part of the plot of the hugely popular novel Valley of the Dolls (1966) by Jacqueline Susann in which three highly successful Hollywood women each fall victim, in various ways, to the drug. The novel was later released as a film by the same name.[citation needed]
Thimerosal[edit]
Further information: Thiomersal
Eli Lilly has developed the vaccine preservative thiomersal (also called merthiolate and thimerosal). Thiomersal is effective by causing susceptible bacteria to autolyze. Launched in 1930, merthiolate was a mercury-based antiseptic and germicide that "had been formulated at the University of Maryland with support of a Lilly research fellowship."[48]
Zyprexa[edit]
Zyprexa (for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, as well as off-label uses) Released in 1996, and as of 2010, Lilly's best-selling drug of all time[112]

Personnel[edit]
After three generations of Lilly family leadership under company founder, Col. Eli Lilly, his son, Josiah K. Lilly Sr., and two grandsons, Eli Lilly Jr. and Josiah K. Lilly Jr., the company announced a reorganization in 1944 that prepared the way for future expansion and the eventual separation of company management from its ownership.[115] The large, complex corporation was divided into smaller groups headed by vice presidents and in 1953 Eugene N. Beesley was named the first non-family member to become the company’s president.[57]
Although Lilly family members continued to serve as chairman of the board until 1969, Beesley's appointment began the transition to non-family management.[57] In 1972 Richard D. Wood became Lilly's president and CEO after the retirement of Burton E. Beck.[116] In 1991 Vaughn Bryson became president and Wood became board chairman.[117] During Bryson's 20-month tenure as Lilly's president and CEO, the company reported its first quarterly loss as a publicly traded company.[64]
Randall L. Tobias, a vice chairman of AT&T Corporation, was named chairman, president, and CEO in June 1993. Tobias, a Lilly board member since 1986, was recruited from outside the company's executive ranks to replace Lilly's president, Vaughn Bryson, and board chairman, Richard Wood.[64] Tobias later became the U.S. director of Foreign Assistance and administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), with the rank of ambassador.[118]
Sidney Taurel, former chief operating officer of Lilly, was named CEO in July 1998 to replace Tobias, who retired. Taurel became chairman of the board in January 1999.[119] Taurel retired as CEO on March 31, 2008, but remained as chairman of the board until December 31, 2008. John Lechleiter was elected as Lilly’s CEO and president, effective April 1, 2008. Lechleiter had served as Lilly's president and chief operating officer since October 2005.[120] In July 2016 Dave Ricks, who also had a long career at Lily, was appointed CEO.[121]
A number of global leaders in the fields of health policy, management, and scientific research have worked at Lilly, including:

Ernesto Bustamante, Peruvian scientist.
Jose F. Caro, American physician, scientist, and educator most notable for his research in obesity and diabetes.
Richard DiMarchi, Chief Scientific Officer, Marcadia Biotech.
Mitch Daniels, current president of Purdue University, former Governor of Indiana and director of the Office of Management and Budget for President George W. Bush.
Roald Hoffmann, Nobel Prize-winning chemist.
Michael Johns, former White House speechwriter and Heritage Foundation policy analyst.
Claude H. Nash, CEO, ViroPharma.
Peter Nicholas, co-founder of Boston Scientific.

Prominent Lilly board members have included:

George H. W. Bush, former President and Vice President of the United States of America.
Martin Feldstein, economist, Harvard University.
Kenneth Lay, former CEO, Enron.
William Verity Jr., former U.S. Secretary of Commerce.

Accolades[edit]
In 2006 Fortune magazine named Eli Lilly and Company one of the top 100 companies in the United States for which to work. Also in 2006, Barron's Magazine named the company among the top 500 best managed companies in the U.S.
In 2012 Working Mothers magazine named Lilly one of the "100 Best Companies for Working Mothers" for the eighteenth consecutive year. Working Mother reported that in 2012 forty-eight percent of Lilly’s U.S. employees and thirty-four percent of its U.S. managers and executives were women.[122][123]
Community service[edit]
The Lilly family as well as Eli Lilly and Company has a long history of community service. Around 1890 Col. Lilly turned over operation of the family business to his son, Josiah, who ran the company for the next several decades.[14] Col. Lilly remained active in civic affairs and assisted a number of local organizations, including the Commercial Club of Indianapolis, which later became the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce,[124] and the Charity Organization Society, a forerunner to the Family Services Association of Central Indiana, an organization supported by United Way.[14][125] Josiah’s sons, Eli and Joe, were also philanthropists who supported numerous cultural and educational organizations.[126]
It was Josiah Sr. who continued his father's civic mindedness and began the company tradition of sending aid to disaster victims.[6] Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the company sent much needed medicine to support recovery efforts and provided relief after the 1936 Johnstown Flood.[6]
In 1917 Lilly Field Hospital 32, named in Josiah’s honor, was equipped in Indianapolis and moved overseas to Contrexville, France, during World War I, where it remained in operation until 1919.[6] Throughout World War II, Lilly manufactured more than two hundred products for military use, including aviator survival kits and seasickness medications for the D-Day invasion.[41] In addition Lilly dried more than two million pints of blood plasma by the war’s end.[46]
Lilly Endowment[edit]
Main article: Lilly Endowment
In 1937 Josiah K. Lilly Sr. and his two sons, Eli and Joe, founded the Lilly Endowment, a private charitable foundation, with gifts of Lilly stock.[127]
Eli Lilly and Company Foundation[edit]
The Eli Lilly and Company Foundation, which is separate from the Lilly Endowment, operates as a tax-exempt private charitable foundation that the company established in 1968. The Foundation is funded through Lilly’s corporate profits.[128]
Controversy[edit]
See also: List of largest pharmaceutical settlements
Eli Lilly has been involved in several controversies, including political and medical ethics controversies. Eli Lilly is now the sole manufacturer of BGH having purchased the rights to manufacture the drug from Monsanto.
NAFTA Suit[edit]
In September 2013, Eli Lilly sued Canada for violating its obligations to foreign investors under the North American Free Trade Agreement by allowing its courts to invalidate patents for two of its drugs. The company sought damages in the amount of $500 million for lost potential profits.[129]
Criminal prosecution[edit]
See also: Olanzapine § Controversy, lawsuits and settlements; and James Gottstein § Eli Lilly memos
In 2009, four sales representatives for Eli Lilly filed separate qui tam lawsuits against the company for illegally marketing the drug Zyprexa for uses not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Eli Lilly pleaded guilty to actively promoting Zyprexa for off-label uses, particularly for the treatment of dementia in the elderly. The $1.415 billion penalty included an $800 million civil settlement and a $515 million criminal fine. The U.S. Justice Department said the criminal fine of $515 million was the largest ever in a health care case, and the largest criminal fine for an individual corporation ever imposed in a U.S. criminal prosecution of any kind.[130][131] "That was a blemish for us," John C. Lechleiter, CEO of Lilly, told The New York Times. "We don’t ever want that to happen again. We put measures in place to assure that not only do we have the right intentions in integrity and compliance, but we have systems in place to support that."[132] In an internal email, Lechleiter had stated "we must seize the opportunity to expand our work with Zyprexa in this same child-adolescent population" (for off-label use.)[133]

Company profile[edit]




Eli Lilly and Company's global headquarters, in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States


A Fortune 500 corporation, Eli Lilly had revenues of $20 billion in 2008, making it the 148th largest company in the United States and the 10th largest corporation by global pharmaceutical sales. The company is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange and is a member of the S&P 500 stock index. Eli Lilly was one of the Nifty Fifty stocks that propelled the mid-twentieth-century bull market.[citation needed]
Eli Lilly is a full member of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA).[2]
According to Forbes, Lilly ranked as the 243rd largest public company in the world in 2016, with sales of US$20 billion and a market value of $86 billion.[3]
As of 1997 it was the largest corporation and the largest charitable benefactor in Indiana.[4]
History[edit]
Company founder[edit]
Main article: Eli Lilly
The company's founder was Colonel Eli Lilly, a pharmaceutical chemist and Union army veteran of the American Civil War.[5] Lilly served as the company president until his death in 1898.[6] A stylized version of his signature still appears in the company's red logo.[5]
In 1869, after working for drugstores in Greencastle and Indianapolis, Indiana, Lilly became a partner in a Paris, Illinois, drugstore with James W. Binford.[7] Although the drugstore was profitable, Lilly was more interested in medicinal manufacturing than running a pharmacy. He began formulating plans to create a company of his own. Lilly left the partnership with Binford in 1873 and returned to Indianapolis. Lilly opened a drug manufacturing operation called Johnston and Lilly with John F. Johnston as his partner in 1874, but dissolved the failing partnership on March 27, 1876. Lilly used his share of the assets, which amounted to an estimated $400 in merchandise (several pieces of equipment and a few gallons of unmixed chemicals) and about $1,000 in cash, to open his own pharmaceutical manufacturing business in Indianapolis in May 1876.[8][9] His new business venture became Eli Lilly and Company.




Colonel Eli Lilly (1838–1898), founder


Early days: 1870s–1900[edit]
On May 10, 1876, Lilly opened his own laboratory in a rented, two-story brick building (now demolished) at 15 West Pearl Street in Indianapolis, where he began to manufacture medicinal drugs. The sign outside, above the shop's door, read: "Eli Lilly, Chemist."[5][10][11] Lilly began his manufacturing venture with $1,400 ($31,163 in 2015 chained dollars) in working capital and three employees: Albert Hall (chief compounder), Caroline Kruger (bottler and product finisher), and Lilly's fourteen-year-old son, Josiah (J. K.), who had quit school to work with his father as an apprentice.[12][9]
One of the first medicines that Lilly began to produce was quinine, a drug used to treat malaria. The result was a "ten fold" increase in sales.[13] At the end of 1876, his first year of business, sales reached $4,470 ($99,499 in 2015 chained dollars).[13] At the end of 1877 sales reached $11,318 ($251,932 in 2015 chained dollars),[14] and by 1879 they had grown to $48,000 ($1,221,086 in 2015 chained dollars).[13] Lilly hired his brother, James, as his first full-time salesman in 1878. James and the subsequent sales team marketed the company's drugs nationally.[15]
The company outgrew its first location on Pearl Street, where it remained from 1876 to 1878, and moved to larger quarters at 36 South Meridian Street. In 1881 Lilly purchased a complex of buildings on property at McCarty and Alabama Streets and moved the company to its new headquarters in Indianapolis's south-side industrial area. Lilly later purchased additional facilities for research and production.[16][17]
Lilly committed himself to producing high-quality prescription drugs, in contrast to the common and often ineffective patent medicines. From its facilities in Indianapolis the company manufactured and sold "ethical drugs" for use by the medical profession. Lilly's medicines included labels that disclosed product ingredients.[5] Lilly's first innovation was gelatin-coating for pills and capsules. The company’s other early innovations included fruit flavorings and sugarcoated pills, which made the medicines easier to swallow.[12]
In 1881 Lilly formally incorporated the business as Eli Lilly and Company, elected a board of directors, and issued stock to family members and close associates.[15] Colonel Lilly's only son, Josiah (J. K.), a pharmaceutical chemist, graduated from the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy in 1882, and joined the family business as a superintendent of its laboratory after college. J. K. became company president in 1898.[18] In 1883 the company contracted to mix and sell Succus Alteran, its first widely successful product and one its best sellers. The product was marketed as a "blood purifier" and as a treatment for syphilis, some types of rheumatism, and skin diseases such as eczema and psoriasis.[17][19] Sales from this product provided funds for Lilly to expand its manufacturing and research facilities.[14] By the late 1880s Colonel Lilly was one of the Indianapolis area's leading businessmen, whose company had more than one-hundred employees and had $200,000 ($5,276,296 in 2015 chained dollars) in annual sales.[7]
As the Lilly company grew, other businesses set up operations near the plant on Indianapolis's near south side. The area developed into one of the city's major business and industrial hubs. Lilly's production, manufacturing, research, and administrative operations in Indianapolis eventually occupied a complex of more than two dozen buildings covering a fifteen-block area, as well as production plants along Kentucky Avenue.[20]

Around 1890 Colonel Lilly turned over the day-to-day management of the business to his son, J. K., who ran the company for thirty-four years. Although the 1890s were a tumultuous decade economically, the company flourished and came out stronger than ever.[7][21] In 1894 Lilly purchased a manufacturing plant to be used solely for creating capsules. The company also made several technological advances in the manufacturing process, including automating its capsule production. Over the next few years the company annually created tens of millions of capsules and pills.[22]
Until the turn of the century Lilly operated in Indianapolis and the surrounding area as many other pharmaceutical businesses did—manufacturing and selling "sugar-coated pills, fluid extracts, elixirs, and syrups."[19] The company used plants for its raw materials and produced its products by hand. One historian noted, "Although the Indianapolis firm was more careful in making and promoting drugs that the patent medicine men of the era, the company remained ambivalent about scientific research."[19]
In addition to Colonel Lilly, his brother, James, and son, Josiah (J. K.), the growing company employed other Lilly family. Colonel Lilly's cousin, Evan Lilly, was hired as a bookkeeper.[21] As young boys, Lilly's grandsons, Eli and Josiah Jr. (Joe), ran errands and performed other odd jobs. Eli and Joe joined the family business after college. Eventually, each grandson served as company president and chairman of the board.[23]
Josiah (J. K.), Colonel Lilly's son and Eli and Joe's father, inherited the company after Colonel Lilly died and became its president in 1898.[6] At the time of Colonel Lilly's death the company had a product line of 2,005 items and annual sales of more than $300,000 ($8,547,600 in 2015 chained dollars).[24] Colonel Lilly was a pioneer in the modern pharmaceutical industry, with many of his early innovations later becoming standard practice. His ethical reforms in a trade that was marked by outlandish claims of miracle medicines began a period of rapid advancement in the development of medicinal drugs.[25] J. K. Lilly continued to advocate for federal regulation on medicines.[26] Under J. K.'s leadership, the company introduced scientific management concepts, organized the company's research department, increased its sales force, and began international distribution of its products.[27] In addition J. K. oversaw a large expansion of the company. By 1905 the company reached sales of $1 million ($26,381,481 in 2015 chained dollars).[6]

Modernization:1900–40[edit]
Just before and after World War I, the Lilly company experienced rapid change.[19] Expansion of Lilly's manufacturing facilities at the McCarty Street plant improved production capacity with a new Science Building (Building 14), opened in 1911, and a new capsule plant (Building 15) in 1913.[28] The company also began constructions of the Lilly Biological Laboratories, a research and manufacturing plant on 150 acres near Greenfield, Indiana, in 1913.[29][30]
In addition to development of new medicines, the company achieved several technological advances, including automation of its production facilities. Lilly was also an innovator in pill capsule manufacturing. It was among the first manufacturers to insert medications into empty gelatin capsules, which provided a more exact dosage.[5] Lilly manufactured capsules for its own needs and sold its excess capacity to others.[31] A 1917 Scientific American article claimed the Lilly operation in Indianapolis was "the largest capsule factory in the world" and was "capable of producing 2.5 million capsules a day".[31] One of Lilly's innovations was fruit flavoring for medicines and sugar-coated pills to make their medicines easier to swallow.[12] Over the next few years the company began to create tens of millions of capsules and pills annually.[22]
Other advances improved plant efficiency and eliminated production errors. Eli Lilly, grandson of the company founder, introduced a method for blueprinting manufacturing tickets in 1909.[32] This process, which created multiples copies of a drug formula, helped eliminate manufacturing and transcription errors.[31] In the 1920s Eli introduced the new concept of straight-line production, where raw materials entered at one end of the facility and the finished product came out the other end, in the company’s manufacturing process. Under Eli’s supervision, the design for Building 22, a new 5-floor plant that opened in Indianapolis in 1926, implemented the straight-line concept to improve production efficiency and lower production costs.[33][34] One historian noted, "It was probably the most sophisticated production system in the American pharmaceutical industry."[34] This more efficient manufacturing process also allowed the company to hire a regular workforce. Instead of recalling workers at peak times and laying them off when production demand fell, Lilly's regular workforce produced less-costly medicines in off-peak times using the same manufacturing facilities.[23]
During the 1920s the introduction of new products also brought the company financial success.[19] In 1919 Josiah hired biochemist George Henry Alexander Clowes as director of biochemical research. In 1921 three University of Toronto scientists, J. J. R. Macleod, Frederick G. Banting, and Charles H. Best, were working on the development of insulin for treatment of diabetes.[35] Clowes and Eli Lilly met with the researchers in 1922 to negotiate an agreement with the University of Toronto scientists to mass-produce insulin.[36] The collaboration led to the first successful large-scale production of insulin.[37] In 1923 Lilly began selling Iletin (Insulin, Lilly), their tradename for the first commercially available insulin product in the U.S for the treatment of diabetes.[38] Banting and Macleod won a Nobel Prize in 1923 for their research. Insulin, "the most important drug" in the company’s history, did "more than any other" to make Lilly "one of the major pharmaceutical manufacturers in the world."[35]
The success of insulin enabled the company to attract well-respected scientists and, with them, make more medical advances. By its fiftieth anniversary in 1926 sales reached $9 million and the company produced more than 2,800 different items.[23] In 1928 Lilly introduced Liver Extract 343 for the treatment of pernicious anemia, a blood disorder, in a joint venture with two Harvard University scientists, George R. Minot and William P. Murphy. In 1930 Lilly introduced Liver Extract No. 55 in collaboration with George Whipple, a University of Rochester scientist.[39] Minot, Murphy, and Whipple won the 1934 Nobel Prize in medicine for their research.[40]
Despite the economic challenges of the Great Depression, Lilly's sales rose to $13 million in 1932.[41] That same year Eli Lilly, the eldest grandson of Col. Lilly, was named as the company's president to succeed his father, who remained as chairman of the board until 1948. Eli joined the family business in 1909.[6] In his early years at the company Eli was especially interested in improving production efficiency and introduced a number of labor-saving devices. He also introduced scientific management principles and implemented cost-savings measures that modernized the company.[42] In addition Eli was involved in expanding the company’s research efforts and collaborations with university researchers.[43]
In 1934 the firm opened two new facilities on the McCarty Street complex: a replica of Lilly’s 1876 laboratory and the new Lilly Research Laboratories, "one of the most fully equipped facilities in the world."[44] In the 1930s the company also continued expansion overseas.[45] In 1934 Eli Lilly and Company Limited, the company's first overseas subsidiary was established in England, with headquarters in London and a manufacturing plant in Basingstoke.[41][45]
Expansion: 1940–70[edit]
World War II brought production at Lilly to a new high with the manufacturing of Merthiolate and penicillin. During the war Lilly also cooperated with the American Red Cross to process blood plasma and by war's end the company had dried over two million pints of blood, "about 20 percent of the United States' total".[46] Merthiolate, first introduced in 1930, was an "anticeptic and germicide" that became a U.S. army "standard issue" during World War II.[47][48] In the early 1940s Lilly became one of the companies mass-producing penicillin.[49]
International operations expanded even further during World War II.[45] Eli Lilly International Corp. was formed in 1943 as a subsidiary to encourage business trade abroad. By 1948 Lilly employees worked in thirty-five countries, most of them as sales representatives in Latin America, Asia, and Africa.[45]
At the end of World War II the company continued to grow. In 1945 Lilly began a major expansion effort that would include two manufacturing operations in Indianapolis. The company purchased the massive Curtiss-Wright propeller plant on South Kentucky Avenue, west of the company's McCarty Street operation. When renovation was completed in mid-1947, the Kentucky Avenue location manufactured antibiotics and capsules and housed the company’s shipping department.[50] By 1948 Lilly employed nearly 7,000 people.[10]
Eli Lilly, who had served as the company's president since 1932, retired from active management of the company in 1948, became chairman of the board, and relinquished the presidency to his brother, Josiah K. Lilly, Jr. (Joe).[51] During Eli's sixteen-year presidency sales rose from $13 million in 1932 to $117 million in 1948. Joe joined the company in 1914 and concentrated on the company's personnel and marketing efforts.[24] He served as company president from 1948 to 1953, then became chairman of the board and remained in that capacity until his death in 1966.[52] In 1952 the company offered its first public shares of stock.[53] In 1953 Eugene N. Beesley was named the company's new president, the first non-family member to run the company.
Over the next several decades Lilly continued to develop and introduce new drugs to the marketplace. In the 1950s Lilly introduced two new antibiotics: vancomycin and erythromycin. In addition Lilly was heavily involved in production and distribution of Jonas Salk's poliomyelitis (polio) vaccine. In 1954 the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (NFIP) contracted with five pharmaceutical companies to produce Salk's polio vaccine for clinical trials. These included Lilly as well as Parke, Davis and Company, Cutter Laboratories, Wyeth Laboratories, and Pitman-Moore Company.[54] Lilly's selection to produce the vaccine was, in part, due to its previous experience in collaborations with university researchers.[55] Lilly manufactured 60 percent of the Salk vaccine in 1955.
During the mid-twentieth century Lilly continued to expand its production facilities outside of Indianapolis. In 1950 Lilly began Tippecanoe Laboratories in Lafayette, Indiana,[56] and increased antibiotic production with its patent on erythromycin. In 1954 Lilly formed Elanco Products Company for the production of veterinary pharmaceuticals. In 1969 the company opened a new plant in Clinton, Indiana.[56]
After a company reorganization and transition to non-family management in 1953, Lilly continued to expand its global presence. In the 1960s Lilly operated thirteen affiliate companies outside the United States.[57] In 1962, with an acquisition from Distillers Company, the company established a major factory in Liverpool, England. In 1968 Lilly built its first research facility, the Lilly Research Centre Limited, outside the United States near London, England.
1970– present[edit]
During the 1970s and 1980s, Eli Lilly and Company saw a flurry of drug production: an antibiotic, Keflex, in 1971; a heart drug, Dobutrex, in 1977; Ceclor, which would become the world's top selling oral antibiotic, in 1979; a leukemia drug, Eldisine; an antiarthritic, Oraflex; and an analgesic, Darvon. When generic drugs flooded the marketplace after the expiration of patents for drugs discovered in the 1950s and 1960s, Lilly diversified into other areas, most notably agricultural chemicals, animal-health products, cosmetics, and medical instruments.
To further diversify its product line, Lilly made an uncharacteristic, but ultimately profitable move in 1971, when it bought cosmetic manufacturer Elizabeth Arden, Inc. for $38 million. Although the subsidiary continued to lose money for five years after Lilly acquired it, executive management changes at Arden helped turn it into a financial success. By 1982 the subsidiary's "sales were up 90 percent from 1978, with profits doubling to nearly $30 million." Sixteen years after its acquisition, Lilly sold Arden to Fabergé in 1987 for $657 million.[58]
In 1977 Lilly ventured into medical instruments with the acquisition of IVAC Corporation, which manufactures vital signs and intravenous fluid infusion monitoring systems. Lilly also purchased Cardiac Pacemakers Incorporated, a manufacturer of heart pacemakers in 1977. In 1980 Lilly acquired Physio-Control Corporation. Other acquisitions included Advance Cardiovasular Systems Incorporated in 1984, Hybritech in 1986, and Devices for Vascular Intervention, Incorporated in 1989. Lilly acquired Pacific Biotech in 1990 and Origin Medsystems and Heart Rhythm Technologies, Incorporated in 1992. In the early 1990s Lilly combined these medical equipment companies into a Medical Devices and Diagnostics Division that "contributed about 20 percent" of Lilly’s annual revenues.
In 1989 a joint agri-chemical venture between Elanco Products Company and Dow Chemical created DowElanco. In 1997 Lilly sold its 40 percent share in the company to Dow Chemical for $1.2 billion and the name was changed to Dow AgroSciences.[59][60][61]
In 1994 Lilly acquired PCS Systems, a drug delivery business for Health Maintenance Organizations, and later added two similar organizations to its holdings.[62] Lilly purchased PCS, which was the largest U.S. prescription drug benefits manager at the time, for $4 billion.[63]
In 1991 Vaughn Bryson was named CEO of Eli Lilly. During his 20-month tenure, the company reported its first quarterly loss as a publicly traded company.[64] In 1993 Randall L. Tobias, a vice-chairman of AT&T Corporation and Lilly board member, was named Lilly's chairman, president, and CEO after "product and competitive pressures" had "steadily eroded Lilly's stock price since early 1992."[65] Tobias was the first president and CEO recruited from outside of the company. Under Tobias's leadership the company "cut costs and narrowed its mission".[66] Lilly sold companies in its Medical Device and Diagnostics Division, expanded international sales, made new acquisitions, and funded additional research and product development. Sidney Taurel, former chief operating officer of Lilly, was named CEO in 1998, replacing Tobias. Taurel was named chairman in January 1999. In 2000 Lilly reported $10.86 billion in net sales.




Eli Lilly's present day global manufacturing plants.


In 1998 Eli Lilly formed a joint venture with Icos Corporation (ICOS), a Bothell, Washington-based biotechnology company, to develop and commercialize Cialis, a product for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. In October 2006 Lilly announced its intention to acquire Icos for $2.1 billion, or $32 per share.[67] After its initial attempt to acquire Icos failed under pressure from large institutional shareholders, Lilly revised its offer to $34 per share. Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), a proxy advisory firm, advised Icos shareholders to reject the proposal as undervalued,[68][69] but the buyout was approved by Icos shareholders and Lilly completed its acquisition of the company on January 29, 2007.[70][71] Lilly closed Icos manufacturing operations, terminated nearly 500 Icos employees, and left 127 employees working at the biologics facility.[72] In December 2007 CMC Biopharmaceuticals A/S (CMC), a Copenhagen, Denmark-based provider of contract biomanufacturing services, bought the Bothell-based biologics facility from Lilly and retained the existing 127 employees.[69][72][73]
In January 2009, the largest criminal fine in U.S. history, totaling $1.415 billion was imposed on Lilly for illegal marketing of its best-selling product, the atypical antipsychotic medication, Zyprexa.[74]
In January 2011, Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly and Company announced their global agreement for the joint development and marketing of new APIs for diabetes therapy. Lilly could receive more than one billion dollars for their work on the project, while Boehringer Ingelheim could receive more than $800 million from development of the new drugs.[75] Oral anti-diabetic of Boehringer Ingelheim–Linagliptin and BI 10773–and two insulin analogs of Lilly–LY2605541 and LY2963016–were in phase II and III of clinical developmentat that time.[76]
In April 2014, Lilly announced plans to buy Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG's animal health business for $5.4 billion in cash to strengthen and diversify its Elanco unit. Lilly said it planned to fund the deal with about $3.4 billion of cash on hand and $2 billion of loans.[77] As a condition of the acquisition, the Sentinel heartworm treatment would be divested to Virbac in order to avoid a monopoly in a subsector of the heartworm treatment market.[78]
In March 2015, the company announced it would join Hanmi Pharmaceutical in developing and commercialising Hanmi's phase I Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor HM71224 in a deal which could yield $690 million.[79] A day later the company announced another deal with Innovent Biologics, Inc to co-develop and commercialise at least three of Innovents treatments over the next decade, in a deal which could generate up to $456 million. As part of the deal the company will contribute its c-Met monoclonal antibody whilst Innovent will contribute a monoclonal antibody which targets CD-20. The second compound from Innovent is a preclinical immuno-oncology molecule.[80] The following week the company announced it would restart its collaboration with Pfizer surrounding the Phase III trial of Tanezumab. Pfizer is expected to receive an upfront sum of $200 million from the company.[81] In April 2015, the company engaged CBRE Group to sell its biomanufacturing facility in Vacaville, California.[82] The facility resides on a 52 acres (0.21 km2) campus and is one of the largest biopharmaceutical manufacturing centers in the United States.[82]
In January 2017, the company announced it would acquire CoLucid Pharmaceuticals for $960 million, specifically gaining the late clinical-stage migraine therapy candidate, lasmiditan,[83] with the deal completing in March.[84] In march, the company also announced that it had completed the acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc's (a subsidiary of Boehringer Ingelheim) US feline, canine and rabies vaccines portfolio.[85]

Collaborative research[edit]
Further information: Lilly Research Laboratories
Eli Lilly and Company has a long history of collaboration with research scientists. In 1886 Ernest G. Eberhardt, a chemist, joined the company as its first full-time research scientist.[97] Lilly also hired two botanists, Walter H. Evans and John S. Wright, to join its early research efforts.[14][98] After World War I the company’s expanded production facilities and introduction of new management methods set the stage for Lilly's next crucial phase—its "aggressive entry into scientific research and development."[10] The first big step came in 1919 when Josiah Lilly hired biochemist George Henry Alexander Clowes as director of biochemical research.[99] Clowes had extensive medical research expertise and links to the scientific research community, which led to the company's collaborations with researchers in the U.S. and elsewhere.[100] Clowes's first major collaboration with researchers who developed insulin at the University of Toronto significantly impacted the company’s future.[100] Lilly’s success with insulin production secured the company's position as a leading research-based pharmaceutical manufacturer, allowing it to attract and hire more research scientists and to collaborate with other universities in additional medical research.[101] In 1934 the company built a new research laboratory in Indianapolis.[35] As part of its research and product development process Lilly also conducted clinical studies at Indianapolis City Hospital (Wishard Memorial Hospital). Lilly continues to conduct clinical studies to test medications before their introduction to the market.[102] In 1949 Eli Lilly actually went into partnership with the United States Army Reserve setting up a local Strategic Intelligence Research and Analysis (SIRA)Unit to allow employees to research company data for the Scientific Logistics and Eurasian fields of study (source: declassified Defense Intelligence Agency document MDR -0191-2008 dated 17 Sep 2012). In 1998 the company dedicated new laboratories for clinical research at the Indiana University Medical Center in Indianapolis.
Publicly funded research[edit]
In addition to internal research and development activities Lilly is also involved in publicly funded research projects with other industrial and academic partners. One example in the area of non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox, a collaboration with pharmaceutical companies, research organizations, and the European Commission to improve the safety of drugs.[103][104] In 2008 this consortium, which included Lilly S.A. (Switzerland), secured a €8 million budget for a 40-month project that was coordinated by the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), an organization who represents the research-based pharmaceutical industry and biotech companies operating in Europe.[104][105][106] In 2008 Lilly's activities included research projects within the framework of the Innovative Medicines Initiative, a public-private research initiative in Europe that is a joint effort of the EFPIA and the European Commission.[107][108][109]
Pharmaceutical brands[edit]
The company's most important products introduced prior to World War II included insulin, which Lilly marketed as Iletin (Insulin, Lilly), Amytal, Merthiolate, ephedrine, and liver extracts.[48] Introduced in 1923, Iletin (Insulin, Lilly) was Lilly's first commercial insulin product. In 2002 the company was the leading producer of products for those with diabetes.[citation needed]
During World War II Lilly produced penicillins and other antibiotics. In addition to penicillin, other wartime production included "antimalarials," blood plasma, encephalitis vaccine, typhus and influenza vaccine, gas gangrene antitoxin, Merthiolate, and Iletin (Insulin, Lilly).[110]
Among the company's more recent pharmaceutical developments are cephalosporin, erythromycin, and Prozac (fluoxetine), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for the treatment of clinical depression. Ceclor, introduced in the 1970s, was an oral cephalosporin antibiotic. Prozac, introduced in the 1980s, quickly became the company's best-selling product for treatment of depression, but Lilly lost its U.S. patent protection for this product in 2001. Among other distinctions, Lilly is the world's largest manufacturer and distributor of medications used in a broad range of psychiatric and mental health-related conditions, including clinical depression, generalized anxiety disorder, narcotic addiction, insomnia, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and others.
Cialis[edit]
Further information: Tadalafil
In 2003, Eli Lilly introduced Cialis (tadalafil), a competitor to Pfizer's blockbuster Viagra for erectile dysfunction. Cialis maintains an active period of 36 hours, causing it sometimes to be dubbed the "weekend pill". Cialis was developed in a partnership with biotechnology company Icos Corporation. On December 18, 2006, Lilly bought Icos in order to gain full control of the product.[111]
Cymbalta[edit]
Further information: Duloxetine
Another Lilly manufactured anti-depressant, Cymbalta, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor used predominantly in the treatment of major depressive disorders and generalized anxiety disorder, ranks with Prozac as one of the most financially successful pharmaceuticals in industry history. It is also used in the treatment of fibromyalgia, neuropathy, chronic pain and osteoarthritis.[citation needed]
Gemzar[edit]
Further information: Gemcitabine
In 1996 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Gemzar for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Gemzar is commonly used in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, usually in coordination with 5-FU chemotherapy and radiology. Gemzar also is routinely used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.
Methadone[edit]
Further information: Methadone
Eli Lilly was the first distributor of methadone, an analgesic used frequently in the treatment of heroin, opium and other opioid and narcotic drug addictions.[citation needed]
Prozac[edit]
Further information: Fluoxetine
Prozac was one of the first therapies in its class to treat clinical depression by blocking the uptake of serotonin within the human brain. It is prescribed to more than fifty-four million people worldwide.[citation needed] Prozac was approved by the U.S. FDA in 1987 for use in treating depression. In 2001 Lilly lost its U.S. patent protection for Prozac and in January 2002 the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Lilly's final appeal, a decision that allows other companies to make generic versions of the drug. Prozac has given rise to a number of comparably functioning therapies for the treatment of clinical depression and other central nervous system disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder, bulimia nervosa, and panic disorders.[citation needed]
Prozac in popular culture[edit]
Because of its wide appeal as a popular anti-depressant, references to Prozac have appeared in books, movies, and music. Prozac Nation (1994), an autobiographical book by Elizabeth Wurtzel, was turned into a film of the same name in 2001 and starred Christina Ricci. Listening to Prozac (1993), by Peter Kramer, was a generally analytical look at Prozac and its uses, not only to treat disorders but to diagnose them as well. Talking Back to Prozac (1994), by psychiatrist Peter Breggin, focuses on Prozac's side effects. Rapper Jay-Z referenced Prozac in the song, "Nigga What, Nigga Who" (1998). In HBO's fictional series, The Sopranos, Tony Soprano's use of Prozac is periodically referenced.[citation needed]
Secobarbital[edit]
Further information: Secobarbital
Eli Lilly has manufactured Secobarbital, a barbiturate derivative with anaesthetic, anticonvulsant, sedative and hypnotic properties. Lilly marketed Secobarbital under the brand name Seconal. Secobarbital is indicated for the treatment of epilepsy, temporary insomnia and as a pre-operative medication to produce anaesthesia and anxiolysis in short surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures which are minimally painful. With the onset of new therapies for the treatment of these conditions, Secobarbital has been less utilized, and Lilly ceased manufacturing it in 2001.[citation needed]
Secobarbital overdoses[edit]
Secobarbital gained considerable attention during the 1970s, when it gained wide popularity as a recreational drug. On September 18, 1970, rock guitarist legend Jimi Hendrix died from a secobarbital overdose. On June 22, 1969, secobarbital overdose was the cause of death of actress Judy Garland. The drug was a central part of the plot of the hugely popular novel Valley of the Dolls (1966) by Jacqueline Susann in which three highly successful Hollywood women each fall victim, in various ways, to the drug. The novel was later released as a film by the same name.[citation needed]
Thimerosal[edit]
Further information: Thiomersal
Eli Lilly has developed the vaccine preservative thiomersal (also called merthiolate and thimerosal). Thiomersal is effective by causing susceptible bacteria to autolyze. Launched in 1930, merthiolate was a mercury-based antiseptic and germicide that "had been formulated at the University of Maryland with support of a Lilly research fellowship."[48]
Zyprexa[edit]
Zyprexa (for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, as well as off-label uses) Released in 1996, and as of 2010, Lilly's best-selling drug of all time[112]
Additional Eli Lilly drugs[edit]

Personnel[edit]
After three generations of Lilly family leadership under company founder, Col. Eli Lilly, his son, Josiah K. Lilly Sr., and two grandsons, Eli Lilly Jr. and Josiah K. Lilly Jr., the company announced a reorganization in 1944 that prepared the way for future expansion and the eventual separation of company management from its ownership.[115] The large, complex corporation was divided into smaller groups headed by vice presidents and in 1953 Eugene N. Beesley was named the first non-family member to become the company’s president.[57]
Although Lilly family members continued to serve as chairman of the board until 1969, Beesley's appointment began the transition to non-family management.[57] In 1972 Richard D. Wood became Lilly's president and CEO after the retirement of Burton E. Beck.[116] In 1991 Vaughn Bryson became president and Wood became board chairman.[117] During Bryson's 20-month tenure as Lilly's president and CEO, the company reported its first quarterly loss as a publicly traded company.[64]
Randall L. Tobias, a vice chairman of AT&T Corporation, was named chairman, president, and CEO in June 1993. Tobias, a Lilly board member since 1986, was recruited from outside the company's executive ranks to replace Lilly's president, Vaughn Bryson, and board chairman, Richard Wood.[64] Tobias later became the U.S. director of Foreign Assistance and administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), with the rank of ambassador.[118]
Sidney Taurel, former chief operating officer of Lilly, was named CEO in July 1998 to replace Tobias, who retired. Taurel became chairman of the board in January 1999.[119] Taurel retired as CEO on March 31, 2008, but remained as chairman of the board until December 31, 2008. John Lechleiter was elected as Lilly’s CEO and president, effective April 1, 2008. Lechleiter had served as Lilly's president and chief operating officer since October 2005.[120] In July 2016 Dave Ricks, who also had a long career at Lily, was appointed CEO.[121]

Accolades[edit]
In 2006 Fortune magazine named Eli Lilly and Company one of the top 100 companies in the United States for which to work. Also in 2006, Barron's Magazine named the company among the top 500 best managed companies in the U.S.
In 2012 Working Mothers magazine named Lilly one of the "100 Best Companies for Working Mothers" for the eighteenth consecutive year. Working Mother reported that in 2012 forty-eight percent of Lilly’s U.S. employees and thirty-four percent of its U.S. managers and executives were women.[122][123]
Community service[edit]
The Lilly family as well as Eli Lilly and Company has a long history of community service. Around 1890 Col. Lilly turned over operation of the family business to his son, Josiah, who ran the company for the next several decades.[14] Col. Lilly remained active in civic affairs and assisted a number of local organizations, including the Commercial Club of Indianapolis, which later became the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce,[124] and the Charity Organization Society, a forerunner to the Family Services Association of Central Indiana, an organization supported by United Way.[14][125] Josiah’s sons, Eli and Joe, were also philanthropists who supported numerous cultural and educational organizations.[126]
It was Josiah Sr. who continued his father's civic mindedness and began the company tradition of sending aid to disaster victims.[6] Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the company sent much needed medicine to support recovery efforts and provided relief after the 1936 Johnstown Flood.[6]
In 1917 Lilly Field Hospital 32, named in Josiah’s honor, was equipped in Indianapolis and moved overseas to Contrexville, France, during World War I, where it remained in operation until 1919.[6] Throughout World War II, Lilly manufactured more than two hundred products for military use, including aviator survival kits and seasickness medications for the D-Day invasion.[41] In addition Lilly dried more than two million pints of blood plasma by the war’s end.[46]
Lilly Endowment[edit]
Main article: Lilly Endowment
In 1937 Josiah K. Lilly Sr. and his two sons, Eli and Joe, founded the Lilly Endowment, a private charitable foundation, with gifts of Lilly stock.[127]
Eli Lilly and Company Foundation[edit]
The Eli Lilly and Company Foundation, which is separate from the Lilly Endowment, operates as a tax-exempt private charitable foundation that the company established in 1968. The Foundation is funded through Lilly’s corporate profits.[128]
Controversy[edit]
See also: List of largest pharmaceutical settlements
Eli Lilly has been involved in several controversies, including political and medical ethics controversies. Eli Lilly is now the sole manufacturer of BGH having purchased the rights to manufacture the drug from Monsanto.
NAFTA Suit[edit]
In September 2013, Eli Lilly sued Canada for violating its obligations to foreign investors under the North American Free Trade Agreement by allowing its courts to invalidate patents for two of its drugs. The company sought damages in the amount of $500 million for lost potential profits.[129]
Criminal prosecution[edit]
See also: Olanzapine § Controversy, lawsuits and settlements; and James Gottstein § Eli Lilly memos
In 2009, four sales representatives for Eli Lilly filed separate qui tam lawsuits against the company for illegally marketing the drug Zyprexa for uses not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Eli Lilly pleaded guilty to actively promoting Zyprexa for off-label uses, particularly for the treatment of dementia in the elderly. The $1.415 billion penalty included an $800 million civil settlement and a $515 million criminal fine. The U.S. Justice Department said the criminal fine of $515 million was the largest ever in a health care case, and the largest criminal fine for an individual corporation ever imposed in a U.S. criminal prosecution of any kind.[130][131] "That was a blemish for us," John C. Lechleiter, CEO of Lilly, told The New York Times. "We don’t ever want that to happen again. We put measures in place to assure that not only do we have the right intentions in integrity and compliance, but we have systems in place to support that."[132] In an internal email, Lechleiter had stated "we must seize the opportunity to expand our work with Zyprexa in this same child-adolescent population" (for off-label use.)[133]

Testimonials















I have been working with Jones Metal for several months now and have only good to say. Delivery, and service has been very good, pricing has been competitive and negotiable when justified. We have had very few quality issues with Jones and in all fairness the majority of the issues have been because we provided poor or incorrect information. We are a short run O.E.M and continually order large volumes of item numbers with very low quantity each and flood our suppliers with work that is typically overdue when we order it, but Jones has risen to the occasion and accommodated our needs quite well.

- Ted ( Manufacturing Engineer )





We have just completed our global reviews with our partners throughout the world and I used your company as an example in my PowerPoint for an ideal candidate of a supplier.  So well done.

- Bill ( Commodity Manager, Global Supply Chain  )





Jones Metal Inc. has become a very instrumental, allied vendor to our manufacturing product lines and us. From production runs to sample orders, they are flexible in accommodating the ever changing production schedules and spur of the moment prototype samples. Their engineering support is knowledgeable and helps us decipher the correct manufacturing process for the job to make sure the part is made to the highest standards, consistently, and at the best price. It’s a partnership, and Jones Metal gets that.  They’ll work with you until your needs are met. Great company, great staff, great service.

- Jeremy ( Head Buyer )





As a customer of Jones Metal I have been rewarded with fast service on standard parts we order.  I also have been impressed with timely replies to quotes that I have asked for.  The quality of workmanship is very good.  I will continue to use Jones Metal for my go to vendor for metal products.

- Jim ( Purchasing Coordinator )





Thanks for all the hard work everyone at Jones has been doing to get these designed and now made for us. I know it has been a rollercoaster, but you have made it an easy process for me.

- Greg ( Product Design Engineer )
