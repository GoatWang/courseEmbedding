Farrow & Ball colors matched to Benjamin Moore




HollyPhillips Paint Colors 10 Comments









Paint colors can be one of the biggest challenges in interior design.  I am always having colors custom mixed or mixed by one store of another brands color,  etc.  Lots can be lost in translation.  I have a whole pinterest board dedicated to PAINT COLORS. 
Today I ran across the chart below.  I cannot seem to find the original source but,  it could be a handy thing to have…see the tiny notes below.

I so wanted this page to be my go-to for B. Moore substitutions but when I checked the colors in my  BM paint fan against the ones in my F&B booklet, they are not a match at ALL. Make sure you check your colors before relying on this list. You will be disappointed.









Which paint colour matches Ikea Grytnas? | Number8 April 14, 2015 at 5:16 pm Reply



[…] Ikea kitchen. However, I’ve never seen Benjamin Moore paint here in the UK but… I did find this post that matches in BM paint to Farrow & Ball, but alas,  no mention on here of Papier Mache. Realising that for once, maybe the internet was […]

I agree! I tried to match F&B Stony Ground with the above suggested Antique parchment. It was not even close. I will say that BM paint does match better than Sherwin Williams paint though. I have the match for Stony Ground in both BM and SW and BM is a truer match.

What is the match for Stony Ground?

We agree that often the closest matches we find for Farrow and Ball Colour Libraries are usually from either Benjamin Moore, Sherwin Williams or Dunne Edwards. The biggest issue really is that the complexity of colour stains is the key to the very muted shades loved by users of Farrow & Ball paints. Many very near matches are in RAL colours now very widely used by our customers who are painters and decorators as well as interior designers. Designers often find that NCS 2 colour references widely available through major paint centres. The CROMOCON METER measures colour and identifies nearest matches from 19 international paint libraries and over 22,000+ colours and checks accuracy of mixing machines.

No need to try and match Benjamin Moore colours anymore – Benjamin Moore was launched in the UK today by Shaw Paints Ltd. We ship US manufactured paint over to the UK and are able to make all 3500 authentic Benjamin Moore colours. Check out benjaminmoorepaint.co.uk .

Every paint company uses a proprietary combination if ingredients in the paint bases and different tinting systems. the beauty of this is that they all have unique  qualities to their colors. Benjamin Moore colors tend to be dirtied up a bit, or grayer. Sherwin Williams are more saturated/clearer, Farrow & Ball have a complexity that makes them very changeable in the light. They all also offer various bases that have different qualities and definitely affect the perception of the color. I’ve found that if Sherwin Williams custom matches a F&B color using the color chart/card, and mixes it into their Cashmere product, it’s the closest approximation to the real thing.

I’ve brought the F & B color cards into stores where the computer analyzes it and then replicates the color. The man helping me tried several times and couldn’t get close. He said he’d never not been able to get a close match.There’s something special about those Farrow & Ball colors.

Bios
Benjamin Ball grew up in Colorado and Iowa where his mother's involvement in theatre proved influential. While studying for his degree at the Southern California Institute of Architecture, Ball logged stints at Gehry Partners and Shirdel Zago Kipnis. Upon graduation, he sought work as a set and production designer for films (including the Matrix series) as well as music videos and commercials with such influential directors as Mark Romanek and Tony Scott. His experience ranges from work on the Disney Concert Hall and small residential commissions for boutique firms to complex medical structures and event design. In his current collaboration with Gaston Nogues, Ball is exploring the intersection of architecture, art and product design through physical modeling and the use of digital and more traditional forms of production.
Gaston Nogues was born and raised in Buenos Aires before moving to Los Angeles at age 12. Frequently accompanying his father to his job as an aerospace engineer, Nogues acquired a fascination with the hands-on process of building. An honors graduate in architecture from SCI-Arc, he moved directly from school into a position at Gehry Partners where he worked in product design and production and became a specialist in creative fabrication. He remained there until 2005 except for a one-year stint in 1996 as an assistant curator at a fine arts publishing house, Gemini GEL. In his current collaboration with Benjamin Ball, Nogues is focused on fabricating what they visualize; on process as it relates to the built object. In his spare time, Nogues flies paragliders.
