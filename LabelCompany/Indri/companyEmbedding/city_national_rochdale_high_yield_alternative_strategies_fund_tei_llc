Summary
  of Fair Value Exposure

�
  
�
  
�
  
�
  
�

The
  Fund has adopted authoritative fair valuation accounting standards which
  establish an authoritative definition of fair value and set out a
  hierarchy for measuring fair value.



These
  standards require additional disclosures about the various inputs and
  valuation techniques used to develop the measurements of fair value and a
  discussion in changes in valuation techniques
  and related inputs during the
period.




�





Level
  1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
  liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.
Level
  2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that
  are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
  indirectly.��These inputs may include quoted prices for the
  identical instrument on an inactive market, prices for similar
  instruments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, yield curves,
  default rates and similar data.
Level
  3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, to the extent relevant
  observable inputs are not available, representing the Company�s own
  assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in
  valuing the asset or liability, and would be based on the best information
  available.




�





The
  inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an
  indication of the risk associated with investing in those
  securities.

�
  
�
  
�

You could lose money by investing in the money market funds. Although the money market funds seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.



	
	City National Rochdale Funds do not generally accept investments by non-U.S. persons and may not be available in all states.
	

	To determine if these Funds are an appropriate investment for you, carefully consider each Fund's investment objectives, risk factors and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's full or summary prospectus which may be obtained by clicking here or by calling 1-888-889-0799. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
	

	Investment products are not bank deposits or obligations of or guaranteed by City National Bank or any subsidiary or affiliate and are not insured by the FDIC, and may lose value. Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Investment Manager for the City National Rochdale Funds is City National Rochdale, LLC, a subsidiary of City National Bank.
	
	Bond and bond funds will decrease in value as interest rates rise.  Funds that invest primarily in the securities of a single state may be more volatile and susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting those obligations.  High yield bonds involve greater risk of default or downgrade and are more volatile than investment-grade securities, due to the speculative nature of their investments.  Investments in smaller companies typically exhibit higher volatility.  Asset Allocation and diversification may not protect against market risk.  
    International investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from social, economic or political instability in other nations.  Emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and lower trading volume. There may be a significant change in legislation or policy affecting taxation on dividends, which may affect the performance of the Fund.
