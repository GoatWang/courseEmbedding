How We Invest




How We Invest
Hanseatic’s investment approach is highly disciplined and robust. At the core of our process is a proprietary, quantitative process 
            that generates a Q Score. Our investment approach is applicable and repeatable across market conditions, sectors, and geographies, allowing us to 
            efficiently and effectively construct and manage a mix of long-only equity products.

Roll over the key words below to explore more about our investment process.

Disciplined
An important differentiator of Hanseatic’s process, although unique and proprietary, is that it is not complex. Complex processes that have many 
        parts can become difficult to manage, often allowing for some of the rules to be ignored, especially in volatile environments.  Simple processes tend to 
        be more robust; complex processes tend to be more fragile.

SECOND QUARTER 2017
Hanseatic Market Commentary


U.S. equities finished both a strong second quarter and a first half of 2017.  Stocks were boosted by solid corporate earnings and investor optimism about the prospects for improving economic growth.  The NASDAQ paced the advance with a 14% gain in the first 6 months even as the index and technology stocks in general spent the entire month of June in correction mode.  The S&P 500 gained 8.24% and the Russell 2000 gained 4.29% in the first half.  The advances were broad from a sector standpoint.  Within the S&P 500, Healthcare gained 16% and Technology gained 14% while most other sectors performed in line with the index.  Energy was the sole loser down 18%.  The S&P 500 Index (including dividends) gained every month in the first half of the year, and is up 8 months in a row for the first time since 1991.  Historically, persistent consecutive monthly gains in the S&P 500 have been a reliable harbinger of further gains in the months ahead.  Since 1990, there has been 10 prior instances where the market advanced more than 6 consecutive months.  In each instance the market posted solid gains over the next year.  



We believe the recent correction in technology stocks is healthy and likely amended some overly optimistic sentiment.  This correction is ongoing and may persist a few more weeks.  But our model currently has high probabilities of further gains in the tech sector.  The breath-less reporting on the FAANG stocks (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google) seems to suggest that these stocks are akin to the “Nifty Fifty” stock phenomenon that preceded the 1973-74 bear market and/or are so overvalued that they are in bubble territory circa 2000.  Neither of these assertions are remotely accurate.


From our perspective, there are two important bullish factors taking place beneath the market surface.  The first is the positive breadth in technology stocks in the ongoing secular bull market.  By our model measurement, the equal weight index of technology stocks in the S&P 500 has outperformed the NDX 100 index which accords large weights to most all the FAANG stocks.  The three tech stocks within FAANG have performed very well; our point is that a surprising number of other tech stocks have also delivered excellent returns.


The second significant positive market influence is the recent improvement in the industrial, healthcare, and financial sectors.  After a strong rally post-election, the industrial sector has consolidated on an absolute basis, but lost ground relative to benchmarks.  There is emerging leadership in capital goods/heavy industrial stocks and railroads, along with continuing performance in aerospace/defense stocks.  Healthcare stocks peaked on a relative basis two years ago after four years of sustained leadership.  There is considerable uncertainty about the prospect of health-care reforms, but there has been notable relative improvement in many healthcare stocks, especially within biotech.  Financial stocks also topped shortly after a post-election rally, presumably on hopes of less regulatory red tape.  Most all stocks in the sector have improved of late, probably helped by the recent steepening in the yield curve.  Our bond models suggest the probability of higher interest rates ahead which is beneficial to this sector.  We believe positive leadership across multiple sectors and industry groups is essential for a healthy secular trend.


In the second quarter, global markets were up strong led by non-US markets.  The growth was broadly distributed among various countries and international indices were ahead of US indices helped by a weak US dollar.  The beginning of the quarter saw a switch from emerging markets leadership to being led by developed markets, especially the EU, though much of the gains were given up in June.  Japan and the emerging markets held gains for the quarter.  Global political developments including in France and the UK, lead to a decline in uncertainty in Europe and an increase in uncertainty in the UK.  In May, Brazilian markets corrected as bribery allegations of President Michel Temer emerged and curbed the markets enthusiasm for the pension and labor reforms.  Oddly though, the second strongest country ETF is South Korea which is obviously not immune to geopolitical risk.  The emerging markets equities look to be performing best helped by US dollar weakness and improving EM growth.  Chinese growth is expected to slow for the rest of the year due to rising rates and a slowdown of housing and construction.  This along with tighter global monetary policy is expected to lead to possible EM market volatility, though overall, looking forward to the second half of 2017, our outlook is sanguine.  Our long term market model continues to display the characteristics of a low volatility persistent uptrend, attributes that are inconsistent historically with market behavior in the late stages of a secular bull market.  This positive domestic outlook is supported by a synchronized bull market in global equities, the first by our estimation since 2007.

What are analysts saying about Freeport-McMoran stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Freeport-McMoran stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Estimates for Freeport for second-quarter 2017 have been going down of late. Freeport’s copper business is affected by supply-related issues and slowdown in China (a major market). Moreover, the company faces uncertainties surrounding the Grasberg mine in Indonesia. It is also exposed to a volatile copper pricing environment. Prices of the metal are expected to remain under pressure in second-half 2017 on concerns over an economic slowdown in China. Freeport has also underperformed the Zacks categorized Mining-Non Ferrous industry over the past six months." (7/11/2017)
2. FBR & Co analysts commented, "Over the weekend, another deadline has come and gone in Freeport's negotiations with the Government of Indonesia. The lack of any apparent material progress over the course of this year (and prior) leads us to believe that either a sale and/or arbitration are increasingly the most likely outcome in the prolonged dispute. We believe that either path holds additional risks for Freeport. The more favorable scenarios in which Freeport could continue to export concentrates while negotiations continue or a 'grand solution' appear less likely now. In our opinion, an argument that a sale might be the best outcome for Freeport is an acknowledgment that the company has few good options to choose from. We are concerned that if discussions move towards a sale process, investors will be paying close attention to the risk of value leakage, given the unique regulatory circumstances in Indonesia. Major questions would include how Freeport's assets are valued and how quickly Freeport divests, among others. Freeport can choose to go to arbitration around June/July of this year, which may be a catalyst for a mutually acceptable exit from Indonesia." (3/28/2017)
3. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "Despite extensive negotiations, Freeport and Indonesia have made little progress regarding conversion of Freeport's COW to an IUPK, local ownership of PT-FI, smelter development, and long-term mining rights. Grasberg is operating at a reduced rate, and the FCX investment case depends on a resolution to the dispute. In this report, we include a detailed analysis of Freeport's options and conclude that a sale of its stake in Grasberg may be best." (3/28/2017)
4. Barclays PLC analysts commented, "Hold FCX shares for now. We think that the market has bid up the stock to fair value in anticipation of a relatively quick resolution of the political overhang at Grasberg - and a view that any lingering production disruption will end up as a net positive, with FCX gaining more from a tighter copper market than it loses from a near-or-medium term reduction in output. Remember FCX is effectively a pure-play copper mining stock at this point, and at spot $2.65/lb as of this writing copper has outrun our 1Q17 /FY17 global forecasts of $2.40/lb and $2.48/lb, respectively." (1/30/2017)

MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations.

CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) was downgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “buy” rating to a “hold” rating in a report released on Monday. 
According to Zacks, “CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period.”
