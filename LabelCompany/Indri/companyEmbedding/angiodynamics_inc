About AngioDynamics
AngioDynamics® history is best characterized by innovation and growth. Originally founded in Queensbury, N.Y., U.S., in 1988, AngioDynamics® has grown into a NASDAQ-listed public company with a global reach. Queensbury was chosen due to its location in the heart of “Catheter Valley,” an area in New York’s Adirondack Region named for its long history of catheter and other medical device manufacturing. Today, the Company has made its presence apparent far beyond Upstate New York with 1,400 employees worldwide at facilities in the United States, Europe and Asia. AngioDynamics is currently selling in more than 50 markets through direct sales and distributors. Initially dedicated to the research and development of products used in interventional radiology, AngioDynamics began shipping product in the early 1990s. The Company soon became well established as a producer of diagnostic catheters for non-coronary angiography and thrombolytic delivery systems. In May 2004 the Company became publicly traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the symbol ANGO. Through acquisitions of companies such as RITA Medical Systems in January 2007, Oncobionic in May 2008, and the assets of Diomed in June 2008 and FlowMedica in January 2009, AngioDynamics now boasts a diverse product line that includes market-leading radiofrequency ablation and NanoKnife® systems, vascular access products, angiographic products and accessories, dialysis products, angioplasty products, drainage products, thrombolytic products, embolization products, venous products and targeted renal therapy products. Continuing its expansion, AngioDynamics opened a new headquarters in Albany, N.Y., in March 2010. Most recently, in May 2012, AngioDynamics acquired Navilyst Medical, bringing market-leading fluid management systems into its portfolio. The acquisition significantly expanded the Company’s scale, doubling its share of the vascular access market while building critical mass in the peripheral vascular market. A comprehensive look at the Company’s history can be found in the form of an interactive timeline of events at www.angiodynamics.com.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.

Value Score

Growth Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.
