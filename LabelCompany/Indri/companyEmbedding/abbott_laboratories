Abbott Laboratories is an American[2] worldwide health care company. It has 74,000 employees and operates in more than 150 countries.[3][4] The company headquarters are in Lake Bluff, Illinois. The company was founded by Chicago physician Wallace Calvin Abbott in 1888 to formulate known drugs; it eventually grew to also sell research-based drugs, medical devices, diagnostics, and nutritional products. It split off the research-based pharmaceuticals into Abbvie in 2013. In 2015, revenues were $20.4 billion.
Abbott has a broad range of branded generic pharmaceuticals, medical devices, diagnostics, and nutrition products. The company's in-vitro diagnostics business performs immunoassays and blood screening. Its medical tests and diagnostic instrument systems are used worldwide by hospitals, laboratories, blood banks, and physician offices to diagnose and monitor diseases such as HIV, hepatitis, cancer, heart failure and metabolic disorders, as well as assess other indicators of health. In 1985, the company developed the first HIV blood-screening test.
Abbott Point-of-Care manufactures diagnostic products for blood analysis to provide health care professionals diagnostics information at the point of patient care. Abbott also provides point-of-care cardiac assays to the emergency room.

History[edit]





Dr. Wallace C. Abbott


In 1888 at the age of 30, Wallace Abbott (1857–1921), an 1885 graduate of the University of Michigan, founded the Abbott Alkaloidal Company. At the time, he was a practicing physician and owned a drug store. His innovation was the use of the active part of a medicinal plant, generally an alkaloid (morphine, quinine, strychnine and codeine), which he formed into tiny "dosimetric granules". This approach was successful since it produced more consistent and effective dosages for patients.[5]
Abbott's first international affiliate was in London in 1907, and the company later added an affiliate in Montreal, Canada (Fact 21). Abbott started operations in Pakistan as a marketing affiliate in 1948; the company has steadily expanded to comprise a work force of over 1500 employees. Currently two manufacturing facilities located at Landhi and Korangi in Karachi continue to produce pharmaceutical products.[6] Expansion continued in 1962 when Abbott entered into a joint venture with Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., of Osaka, Japan, to manufacture radio-pharmaceuticals. In 1964, it acquired Ross Laboratories, making Ross a wholly owned subsidiary of Abbott. In 1965, Abbott's expansion in Europe continued with offices in Italy and France. Abbott Laboratories has been present in India for over 100 years through its subsidiary Abbott India Limited and it is currently India's largest healthcare products company.[7]
According to Harvard professor Lester Grinspoon and Peter Hedblom, "In 1966 Abbott Laboratories sold the equivalent of two million doses of methamphetamine in powder form to a Long Island criminal dealer".[8]
In 2001, the company acquired Knoll, the pharmaceutical division of BASF. In 2002, it divested the Selsun Blue brand to Chattem. Later in 2002, the company sold Clear Eyes and Murine to Prestige Brands.[citation needed] In 2004, it spun off its hospital products division into a new 14,000 employee company named Hospira, and acquired TheraSense, a diabetes-care company, which it merged with its MediSense division to become Abbott Diabetes Care. In 2006, Abbott assisted Boston Scientific in its purchase of Guidant Corporation. As part of the agreement, Abbott purchased the vascular device division of Guidant. In 2007, Ross was renamed Abbott Nutrition.
In 2007, Abbott acquired Kos Pharmaceuticals for $3.7 billion in cash.[citation needed] At the time of acquisition, Kos marketed Niaspan, which raises levels of “good,” or HDL, cholesterol and Advicor, a Niaspan combination drug for patients with multiple lipid disorders.
In January 2007, the company agreed to sell its in vitro diagnostics and Point-of-Care diagnostics divisions to General Electric for more than $8 billion. These units were slated to be integrated into the GE Healthcare business unit. The transaction was approved by the boards of directors of Abbott and GE and was targeted to close in the first half of 2007. However, on July 11, 2007, Abbott announced that it had terminated its agreement with GE because the parties could not agree on the terms of the deal.[9]
On September 8, 2007, the company completed the sale of the UK manufacturing plant at Queenborough to Aesica Pharmaceuticals, a private equity-owned UK manufacturer. No announcements have been made restricting the movement of staff to Abbott unlike other sell outs. On February 26, 2009, the company completed its acquisition of Advanced Medical Optics based in Santa Ana, California. In 2009, Abbott opened a satellite research and development facility at Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.[citation needed]
In February 2010, Abbott completed its $6.2 billion (EUR 4.5 billion) acquisition of the pharmaceuticals unit of Solvay S.A..[10] This provided Abbott with a large and complementary portfolio of pharmaceutical products and also expanding its presence in key emerging markets.[11]
On March 22, 2010, the company completed its acquisition of a Hollywood, Florida-based LIMS company STARLIMS. Under the terms of the deal, Abbott Laboratories acquired the company for $14 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $123 million.[12] On May 21, 2010, Abbott Laboratories said it would buy Piramal Healthcare Ltd.'s Healthcare Solutions unit for $2.2[13] billion to become the biggest drug company in India.[14]
In October 2011, the company announced that it planned to separate into two companies, one research-based pharmaceuticals and the other in medical devices, generic drugs sold internationally, and consumer products, with device company retaining the Abbott name.[15][16] The company announced that the other company would be named AbbVie in March 2012.[17] In preparation for the reorganization, Abbott made severe budget cuts and took a $478 million charge in Q3-2012 to pay for the restructuring.[18] The separation was effective as of January 1, 2013. AbbVie was officially listed in the New York Stock Exchange on January 2, 2013.[19]
On May 16, 2014, it was announced that Abbott would acquire the holding company Kalo Pharma Internacional S.L. for $2.9 billion in order to secure the 73% it held of Chilean pharmaceutical company, CFR Pharmaceuticals, which the company said would more than double its branded generic drug portfolio.[20][21][22]
In June 2014, the company entered into a definitive agreement to take over Russian pharmaceutical manufacturer Veropharm (Voronezh) in a deal worth $631 million.[20] Abbott, which already employs 1,400 people in Russia, said it planned to set up a manufacturing presence in the country when the deal closed.[23]
In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire Alere for $5.8 billion.[24][25] In late April, of the same year, Abbott announced it would acquire St. Jude Medical for $25 billion (each share receiving $46.75 in cash & 0.8708 shares of Abbott common stock, equating to an approximate value of $85).[20][26][27]

Organization[edit]




Abbott office


Abbott's core businesses focus on pharmaceuticals, medical devices and nutritional products, which have been supplemented through acquisitions. As of 2016[update], the firm's divisions are:

Diabetes Care:[20] Glucose monitoring devices
Diagnostics:[20] Hematology, immunodiagnostic, oncology and clinical chemistry (including the i-Stat)
Endovascular[20]
Established Pharmaceuticals (EPD):[20] Branded generic drugs sold exclusively in developing markets.
Medical Devices[20]
Medical Optics[20]
Nutrition:[20] baby nutrition (e.g., Similac, Isomil, and Gain), adult health products (e.g., Ensure and ZonePerfect) and special dietary needs (e.g., Glucerna and Juven)

Management structure[edit]
Miles D. White is Chairman and (CEO).[18] He joined Abbott in 1984, serving in management positions including senior vice president of diagnostic operations and executive vice president. He was elected to the Board of Directors in April 1998, to Chief Executive Officer in 1998, and to Chairman of the Board in April 1999.[citation needed]
Management practices[edit]
Along with being ranked 134th on the 2015 Fortune 500 list of largest U.S.-based corporation,[citation needed] Abbott was named one of the 2014 Top 20 Employers by the journal Science and listed as a Top 10 company for women by Working Mother magazine and the National Association for Female Executives.[citation needed] The company has also been named one of the World's Most Admired Companies by Fortune magazine every year since 1984 – ranking No. 1 in medical equipment in 2014 and 2015.[citation needed] Abbott has also been recognized for 11 consecutive years for sustainability leadership through its inclusion on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI).[citation needed] The Top Employers Institute designated Abbott as a great place to work in Europe and China in 2014.[citation needed] DiversityInc magazine has recognized Abbott repeatedly as a Top 50 company for diversity; and, additionally, the Dave Thomas Foundation ranked the company as a best company thanks to its generous adoption benefits.[citation needed]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Abbott Laboratories shares are mainly held by institutional investors (The Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street Corporation and others).[31]
Litigation[edit]
Humira[edit]
In March 2003, British company Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT) stated its wish to "initiate discussions regarding the applicability of the royalty offset provisions for Humira" (Adalimumab) with Abbott Laboratories in the High Court of London. In December 2004, the judgment ruled for CAT.[32]
Abbott was required to pay CAT US$255 million, some of which was to be passed to its partners in development. Of this sum, the Medical Research Council (United Kingdom) (MRC) received US$191M, and in addition, Abbott was asked to pay the MRC a further US$7.5M over five years from 2006, providing that Humira remains on the market.[citation needed]
Depakote[edit]
On October 2, 2012, the company was charged with a $500 million fine and $198.5 million forfeiture for illegal marketing, and in a plea agreement was assessed the second-largest criminal fine in U.S. history for a drug company. U.S. District Court Judge Samuel G Wilson of the Western District of Virginia imposed it given Abbott's guilty plea related to its unlawful promotion of Depakote for uses not approved by the FDA. Abbott had advertised Depakote to be used to control behavioral disturbances for patients with dementia and schizophrenia, without FDA approval. In addition, Abbott marketed Depakote for other psychiatric conditions in adults, including depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol and drug withdrawal and psychiatric conditions in children, including conduct disorders, attention deficit disorder and autism. The court also ordered Abbott to a five-year term of probation and court supervision.[33] Shareholders then brought derivative suits against the company directors for breach of fiduciary duty[34] The parties reached a negotiated settlement in which Abbott agreed to beef up its internal controls and paid the plaintiffs' attorney fees.[35]
Sponsorship[edit]
Since 2015 Abbott is the title sponsor of the World Marathon Majors.[36]

Abbott Laboratories is an American[2] worldwide health care company. It has 74,000 employees and operates in more than 150 countries.[3][4] The company headquarters are in Lake Bluff, Illinois. The company was founded by Chicago physician Wallace Calvin Abbott in 1888 to formulate known drugs; it eventually grew to also sell research-based drugs, medical devices, diagnostics, and nutritional products. It split off the research-based pharmaceuticals into Abbvie in 2013. In 2015, revenues were $20.4 billion.
Abbott has a broad range of branded generic pharmaceuticals, medical devices, diagnostics, and nutrition products. The company's in-vitro diagnostics business performs immunoassays and blood screening. Its medical tests and diagnostic instrument systems are used worldwide by hospitals, laboratories, blood banks, and physician offices to diagnose and monitor diseases such as HIV, hepatitis, cancer, heart failure and metabolic disorders, as well as assess other indicators of health. In 1985, the company developed the first HIV blood-screening test.
Abbott Point-of-Care manufactures diagnostic products for blood analysis to provide health care professionals diagnostics information at the point of patient care. Abbott also provides point-of-care cardiac assays to the emergency room.

History[edit]





Dr. Wallace C. Abbott


In 1888 at the age of 30, Wallace Abbott (1857–1921), an 1885 graduate of the University of Michigan, founded the Abbott Alkaloidal Company. At the time, he was a practicing physician and owned a drug store. His innovation was the use of the active part of a medicinal plant, generally an alkaloid (morphine, quinine, strychnine and codeine), which he formed into tiny "dosimetric granules". This approach was successful since it produced more consistent and effective dosages for patients.[5]
Abbott's first international affiliate was in London in 1907, and the company later added an affiliate in Montreal, Canada (Fact 21). Abbott started operations in Pakistan as a marketing affiliate in 1948; the company has steadily expanded to comprise a work force of over 1500 employees. Currently two manufacturing facilities located at Landhi and Korangi in Karachi continue to produce pharmaceutical products.[6] Expansion continued in 1962 when Abbott entered into a joint venture with Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., of Osaka, Japan, to manufacture radio-pharmaceuticals. In 1964, it acquired Ross Laboratories, making Ross a wholly owned subsidiary of Abbott. In 1965, Abbott's expansion in Europe continued with offices in Italy and France. Abbott Laboratories has been present in India for over 100 years through its subsidiary Abbott India Limited and it is currently India's largest healthcare products company.[7]
According to Harvard professor Lester Grinspoon and Peter Hedblom, "In 1966 Abbott Laboratories sold the equivalent of two million doses of methamphetamine in powder form to a Long Island criminal dealer".[8]
In 2001, the company acquired Knoll, the pharmaceutical division of BASF. In 2002, it divested the Selsun Blue brand to Chattem. Later in 2002, the company sold Clear Eyes and Murine to Prestige Brands.[citation needed] In 2004, it spun off its hospital products division into a new 14,000 employee company named Hospira, and acquired TheraSense, a diabetes-care company, which it merged with its MediSense division to become Abbott Diabetes Care. In 2006, Abbott assisted Boston Scientific in its purchase of Guidant Corporation. As part of the agreement, Abbott purchased the vascular device division of Guidant. In 2007, Ross was renamed Abbott Nutrition.
In 2007, Abbott acquired Kos Pharmaceuticals for $3.7 billion in cash.[citation needed] At the time of acquisition, Kos marketed Niaspan, which raises levels of “good,” or HDL, cholesterol and Advicor, a Niaspan combination drug for patients with multiple lipid disorders.
In January 2007, the company agreed to sell its in vitro diagnostics and Point-of-Care diagnostics divisions to General Electric for more than $8 billion. These units were slated to be integrated into the GE Healthcare business unit. The transaction was approved by the boards of directors of Abbott and GE and was targeted to close in the first half of 2007. However, on July 11, 2007, Abbott announced that it had terminated its agreement with GE because the parties could not agree on the terms of the deal.[9]
On September 8, 2007, the company completed the sale of the UK manufacturing plant at Queenborough to Aesica Pharmaceuticals, a private equity-owned UK manufacturer. No announcements have been made restricting the movement of staff to Abbott unlike other sell outs. On February 26, 2009, the company completed its acquisition of Advanced Medical Optics based in Santa Ana, California. In 2009, Abbott opened a satellite research and development facility at Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.[citation needed]
In February 2010, Abbott completed its $6.2 billion (EUR 4.5 billion) acquisition of the pharmaceuticals unit of Solvay S.A..[10] This provided Abbott with a large and complementary portfolio of pharmaceutical products and also expanding its presence in key emerging markets.[11]
On March 22, 2010, the company completed its acquisition of a Hollywood, Florida-based LIMS company STARLIMS. Under the terms of the deal, Abbott Laboratories acquired the company for $14 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $123 million.[12] On May 21, 2010, Abbott Laboratories said it would buy Piramal Healthcare Ltd.'s Healthcare Solutions unit for $2.2[13] billion to become the biggest drug company in India.[14]
In October 2011, the company announced that it planned to separate into two companies, one research-based pharmaceuticals and the other in medical devices, generic drugs sold internationally, and consumer products, with device company retaining the Abbott name.[15][16] The company announced that the other company would be named AbbVie in March 2012.[17] In preparation for the reorganization, Abbott made severe budget cuts and took a $478 million charge in Q3-2012 to pay for the restructuring.[18] The separation was effective as of January 1, 2013. AbbVie was officially listed in the New York Stock Exchange on January 2, 2013.[19]
On May 16, 2014, it was announced that Abbott would acquire the holding company Kalo Pharma Internacional S.L. for $2.9 billion in order to secure the 73% it held of Chilean pharmaceutical company, CFR Pharmaceuticals, which the company said would more than double its branded generic drug portfolio.[20][21][22]
In June 2014, the company entered into a definitive agreement to take over Russian pharmaceutical manufacturer Veropharm (Voronezh) in a deal worth $631 million.[20] Abbott, which already employs 1,400 people in Russia, said it planned to set up a manufacturing presence in the country when the deal closed.[23]
In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire Alere for $5.8 billion.[24][25] In late April, of the same year, Abbott announced it would acquire St. Jude Medical for $25 billion (each share receiving $46.75 in cash & 0.8708 shares of Abbott common stock, equating to an approximate value of $85).[20][26][27]

Organization[edit]




Abbott office


Abbott's core businesses focus on pharmaceuticals, medical devices and nutritional products, which have been supplemented through acquisitions. As of 2016[update], the firm's divisions are:

Diabetes Care:[20] Glucose monitoring devices
Diagnostics:[20] Hematology, immunodiagnostic, oncology and clinical chemistry (including the i-Stat)
Endovascular[20]
Established Pharmaceuticals (EPD):[20] Branded generic drugs sold exclusively in developing markets.
Medical Devices[20]
Medical Optics[20]
Nutrition:[20] baby nutrition (e.g., Similac, Isomil, and Gain), adult health products (e.g., Ensure and ZonePerfect) and special dietary needs (e.g., Glucerna and Juven)

Management structure[edit]
Miles D. White is Chairman and (CEO).[18] He joined Abbott in 1984, serving in management positions including senior vice president of diagnostic operations and executive vice president. He was elected to the Board of Directors in April 1998, to Chief Executive Officer in 1998, and to Chairman of the Board in April 1999.[citation needed]
Management practices[edit]
Along with being ranked 134th on the 2015 Fortune 500 list of largest U.S.-based corporation,[citation needed] Abbott was named one of the 2014 Top 20 Employers by the journal Science and listed as a Top 10 company for women by Working Mother magazine and the National Association for Female Executives.[citation needed] The company has also been named one of the World's Most Admired Companies by Fortune magazine every year since 1984 – ranking No. 1 in medical equipment in 2014 and 2015.[citation needed] Abbott has also been recognized for 11 consecutive years for sustainability leadership through its inclusion on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI).[citation needed] The Top Employers Institute designated Abbott as a great place to work in Europe and China in 2014.[citation needed] DiversityInc magazine has recognized Abbott repeatedly as a Top 50 company for diversity; and, additionally, the Dave Thomas Foundation ranked the company as a best company thanks to its generous adoption benefits.[citation needed]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Abbott Laboratories shares are mainly held by institutional investors (The Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street Corporation and others).[31]
Litigation[edit]
Humira[edit]
In March 2003, British company Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT) stated its wish to "initiate discussions regarding the applicability of the royalty offset provisions for Humira" (Adalimumab) with Abbott Laboratories in the High Court of London. In December 2004, the judgment ruled for CAT.[32]
Abbott was required to pay CAT US$255 million, some of which was to be passed to its partners in development. Of this sum, the Medical Research Council (United Kingdom) (MRC) received US$191M, and in addition, Abbott was asked to pay the MRC a further US$7.5M over five years from 2006, providing that Humira remains on the market.[citation needed]
Depakote[edit]
On October 2, 2012, the company was charged with a $500 million fine and $198.5 million forfeiture for illegal marketing, and in a plea agreement was assessed the second-largest criminal fine in U.S. history for a drug company. U.S. District Court Judge Samuel G Wilson of the Western District of Virginia imposed it given Abbott's guilty plea related to its unlawful promotion of Depakote for uses not approved by the FDA. Abbott had advertised Depakote to be used to control behavioral disturbances for patients with dementia and schizophrenia, without FDA approval. In addition, Abbott marketed Depakote for other psychiatric conditions in adults, including depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol and drug withdrawal and psychiatric conditions in children, including conduct disorders, attention deficit disorder and autism. The court also ordered Abbott to a five-year term of probation and court supervision.[33] Shareholders then brought derivative suits against the company directors for breach of fiduciary duty[34] The parties reached a negotiated settlement in which Abbott agreed to beef up its internal controls and paid the plaintiffs' attorney fees.[35]
Sponsorship[edit]
Since 2015 Abbott is the title sponsor of the World Marathon Majors.[36]

Abbott Laboratories is an American[2] worldwide health care company. It has 74,000 employees and operates in more than 150 countries.[3][4] The company headquarters are in Lake Bluff, Illinois. The company was founded by Chicago physician Wallace Calvin Abbott in 1888 to formulate known drugs; it eventually grew to also sell research-based drugs, medical devices, diagnostics, and nutritional products. It split off the research-based pharmaceuticals into Abbvie in 2013. In 2015, revenues were $20.4 billion.
Abbott has a broad range of branded generic pharmaceuticals, medical devices, diagnostics, and nutrition products. The company's in-vitro diagnostics business performs immunoassays and blood screening. Its medical tests and diagnostic instrument systems are used worldwide by hospitals, laboratories, blood banks, and physician offices to diagnose and monitor diseases such as HIV, hepatitis, cancer, heart failure and metabolic disorders, as well as assess other indicators of health. In 1985, the company developed the first HIV blood-screening test.
Abbott Point-of-Care manufactures diagnostic products for blood analysis to provide health care professionals diagnostics information at the point of patient care. Abbott also provides point-of-care cardiac assays to the emergency room.

History[edit]





Dr. Wallace C. Abbott


In 1888 at the age of 30, Wallace Abbott (1857–1921), an 1885 graduate of the University of Michigan, founded the Abbott Alkaloidal Company. At the time, he was a practicing physician and owned a drug store. His innovation was the use of the active part of a medicinal plant, generally an alkaloid (morphine, quinine, strychnine and codeine), which he formed into tiny "dosimetric granules". This approach was successful since it produced more consistent and effective dosages for patients.[5]
Abbott's first international affiliate was in London in 1907, and the company later added an affiliate in Montreal, Canada (Fact 21). Abbott started operations in Pakistan as a marketing affiliate in 1948; the company has steadily expanded to comprise a work force of over 1500 employees. Currently two manufacturing facilities located at Landhi and Korangi in Karachi continue to produce pharmaceutical products.[6] Expansion continued in 1962 when Abbott entered into a joint venture with Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., of Osaka, Japan, to manufacture radio-pharmaceuticals. In 1964, it acquired Ross Laboratories, making Ross a wholly owned subsidiary of Abbott. In 1965, Abbott's expansion in Europe continued with offices in Italy and France. Abbott Laboratories has been present in India for over 100 years through its subsidiary Abbott India Limited and it is currently India's largest healthcare products company.[7]
According to Harvard professor Lester Grinspoon and Peter Hedblom, "In 1966 Abbott Laboratories sold the equivalent of two million doses of methamphetamine in powder form to a Long Island criminal dealer".[8]
In 2001, the company acquired Knoll, the pharmaceutical division of BASF. In 2002, it divested the Selsun Blue brand to Chattem. Later in 2002, the company sold Clear Eyes and Murine to Prestige Brands.[citation needed] In 2004, it spun off its hospital products division into a new 14,000 employee company named Hospira, and acquired TheraSense, a diabetes-care company, which it merged with its MediSense division to become Abbott Diabetes Care. In 2006, Abbott assisted Boston Scientific in its purchase of Guidant Corporation. As part of the agreement, Abbott purchased the vascular device division of Guidant. In 2007, Ross was renamed Abbott Nutrition.
In 2007, Abbott acquired Kos Pharmaceuticals for $3.7 billion in cash.[citation needed] At the time of acquisition, Kos marketed Niaspan, which raises levels of “good,” or HDL, cholesterol and Advicor, a Niaspan combination drug for patients with multiple lipid disorders.
In January 2007, the company agreed to sell its in vitro diagnostics and Point-of-Care diagnostics divisions to General Electric for more than $8 billion. These units were slated to be integrated into the GE Healthcare business unit. The transaction was approved by the boards of directors of Abbott and GE and was targeted to close in the first half of 2007. However, on July 11, 2007, Abbott announced that it had terminated its agreement with GE because the parties could not agree on the terms of the deal.[9]
On September 8, 2007, the company completed the sale of the UK manufacturing plant at Queenborough to Aesica Pharmaceuticals, a private equity-owned UK manufacturer. No announcements have been made restricting the movement of staff to Abbott unlike other sell outs. On February 26, 2009, the company completed its acquisition of Advanced Medical Optics based in Santa Ana, California. In 2009, Abbott opened a satellite research and development facility at Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.[citation needed]
In February 2010, Abbott completed its $6.2 billion (EUR 4.5 billion) acquisition of the pharmaceuticals unit of Solvay S.A..[10] This provided Abbott with a large and complementary portfolio of pharmaceutical products and also expanding its presence in key emerging markets.[11]
On March 22, 2010, the company completed its acquisition of a Hollywood, Florida-based LIMS company STARLIMS. Under the terms of the deal, Abbott Laboratories acquired the company for $14 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $123 million.[12] On May 21, 2010, Abbott Laboratories said it would buy Piramal Healthcare Ltd.'s Healthcare Solutions unit for $2.2[13] billion to become the biggest drug company in India.[14]
In October 2011, the company announced that it planned to separate into two companies, one research-based pharmaceuticals and the other in medical devices, generic drugs sold internationally, and consumer products, with device company retaining the Abbott name.[15][16] The company announced that the other company would be named AbbVie in March 2012.[17] In preparation for the reorganization, Abbott made severe budget cuts and took a $478 million charge in Q3-2012 to pay for the restructuring.[18] The separation was effective as of January 1, 2013. AbbVie was officially listed in the New York Stock Exchange on January 2, 2013.[19]
On May 16, 2014, it was announced that Abbott would acquire the holding company Kalo Pharma Internacional S.L. for $2.9 billion in order to secure the 73% it held of Chilean pharmaceutical company, CFR Pharmaceuticals, which the company said would more than double its branded generic drug portfolio.[20][21][22]
In June 2014, the company entered into a definitive agreement to take over Russian pharmaceutical manufacturer Veropharm (Voronezh) in a deal worth $631 million.[20] Abbott, which already employs 1,400 people in Russia, said it planned to set up a manufacturing presence in the country when the deal closed.[23]
In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire Alere for $5.8 billion.[24][25] In late April, of the same year, Abbott announced it would acquire St. Jude Medical for $25 billion (each share receiving $46.75 in cash & 0.8708 shares of Abbott common stock, equating to an approximate value of $85).[20][26][27]

Miles D. White is Chairman and (CEO).[18] He joined Abbott in 1984, serving in management positions including senior vice president of diagnostic operations and executive vice president. He was elected to the Board of Directors in April 1998, to Chief Executive Officer in 1998, and to Chairman of the Board in April 1999.[citation needed]
Management practices[edit]
Along with being ranked 134th on the 2015 Fortune 500 list of largest U.S.-based corporation,[citation needed] Abbott was named one of the 2014 Top 20 Employers by the journal Science and listed as a Top 10 company for women by Working Mother magazine and the National Association for Female Executives.[citation needed] The company has also been named one of the World's Most Admired Companies by Fortune magazine every year since 1984 – ranking No. 1 in medical equipment in 2014 and 2015.[citation needed] Abbott has also been recognized for 11 consecutive years for sustainability leadership through its inclusion on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI).[citation needed] The Top Employers Institute designated Abbott as a great place to work in Europe and China in 2014.[citation needed] DiversityInc magazine has recognized Abbott repeatedly as a Top 50 company for diversity; and, additionally, the Dave Thomas Foundation ranked the company as a best company thanks to its generous adoption benefits.[citation needed]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Abbott Laboratories shares are mainly held by institutional investors (The Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street Corporation and others).[31]
Litigation[edit]
Humira[edit]
In March 2003, British company Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT) stated its wish to "initiate discussions regarding the applicability of the royalty offset provisions for Humira" (Adalimumab) with Abbott Laboratories in the High Court of London. In December 2004, the judgment ruled for CAT.[32]
Abbott was required to pay CAT US$255 million, some of which was to be passed to its partners in development. Of this sum, the Medical Research Council (United Kingdom) (MRC) received US$191M, and in addition, Abbott was asked to pay the MRC a further US$7.5M over five years from 2006, providing that Humira remains on the market.[citation needed]
Depakote[edit]
On October 2, 2012, the company was charged with a $500 million fine and $198.5 million forfeiture for illegal marketing, and in a plea agreement was assessed the second-largest criminal fine in U.S. history for a drug company. U.S. District Court Judge Samuel G Wilson of the Western District of Virginia imposed it given Abbott's guilty plea related to its unlawful promotion of Depakote for uses not approved by the FDA. Abbott had advertised Depakote to be used to control behavioral disturbances for patients with dementia and schizophrenia, without FDA approval. In addition, Abbott marketed Depakote for other psychiatric conditions in adults, including depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol and drug withdrawal and psychiatric conditions in children, including conduct disorders, attention deficit disorder and autism. The court also ordered Abbott to a five-year term of probation and court supervision.[33] Shareholders then brought derivative suits against the company directors for breach of fiduciary duty[34] The parties reached a negotiated settlement in which Abbott agreed to beef up its internal controls and paid the plaintiffs' attorney fees.[35]
Sponsorship[edit]
Since 2015 Abbott is the title sponsor of the World Marathon Majors.[36]

Abbott Laboratories is an American[2] worldwide health care company. It has 74,000 employees and operates in more than 150 countries.[3][4] The company headquarters are in Lake Bluff, Illinois. The company was founded by Chicago physician Wallace Calvin Abbott in 1888 to formulate known drugs; it eventually grew to also sell research-based drugs, medical devices, diagnostics, and nutritional products. It split off the research-based pharmaceuticals into Abbvie in 2013. In 2015, revenues were $20.4 billion.
Abbott has a broad range of branded generic pharmaceuticals, medical devices, diagnostics, and nutrition products. The company's in-vitro diagnostics business performs immunoassays and blood screening. Its medical tests and diagnostic instrument systems are used worldwide by hospitals, laboratories, blood banks, and physician offices to diagnose and monitor diseases such as HIV, hepatitis, cancer, heart failure and metabolic disorders, as well as assess other indicators of health. In 1985, the company developed the first HIV blood-screening test.
Abbott Point-of-Care manufactures diagnostic products for blood analysis to provide health care professionals diagnostics information at the point of patient care. Abbott also provides point-of-care cardiac assays to the emergency room.

History[edit]





Dr. Wallace C. Abbott


In 1888 at the age of 30, Wallace Abbott (1857–1921), an 1885 graduate of the University of Michigan, founded the Abbott Alkaloidal Company. At the time, he was a practicing physician and owned a drug store. His innovation was the use of the active part of a medicinal plant, generally an alkaloid (morphine, quinine, strychnine and codeine), which he formed into tiny "dosimetric granules". This approach was successful since it produced more consistent and effective dosages for patients.[5]
Abbott's first international affiliate was in London in 1907, and the company later added an affiliate in Montreal, Canada (Fact 21). Abbott started operations in Pakistan as a marketing affiliate in 1948; the company has steadily expanded to comprise a work force of over 1500 employees. Currently two manufacturing facilities located at Landhi and Korangi in Karachi continue to produce pharmaceutical products.[6] Expansion continued in 1962 when Abbott entered into a joint venture with Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., of Osaka, Japan, to manufacture radio-pharmaceuticals. In 1964, it acquired Ross Laboratories, making Ross a wholly owned subsidiary of Abbott. In 1965, Abbott's expansion in Europe continued with offices in Italy and France. Abbott Laboratories has been present in India for over 100 years through its subsidiary Abbott India Limited and it is currently India's largest healthcare products company.[7]
According to Harvard professor Lester Grinspoon and Peter Hedblom, "In 1966 Abbott Laboratories sold the equivalent of two million doses of methamphetamine in powder form to a Long Island criminal dealer".[8]
In 2001, the company acquired Knoll, the pharmaceutical division of BASF. In 2002, it divested the Selsun Blue brand to Chattem. Later in 2002, the company sold Clear Eyes and Murine to Prestige Brands.[citation needed] In 2004, it spun off its hospital products division into a new 14,000 employee company named Hospira, and acquired TheraSense, a diabetes-care company, which it merged with its MediSense division to become Abbott Diabetes Care. In 2006, Abbott assisted Boston Scientific in its purchase of Guidant Corporation. As part of the agreement, Abbott purchased the vascular device division of Guidant. In 2007, Ross was renamed Abbott Nutrition.
In 2007, Abbott acquired Kos Pharmaceuticals for $3.7 billion in cash.[citation needed] At the time of acquisition, Kos marketed Niaspan, which raises levels of “good,” or HDL, cholesterol and Advicor, a Niaspan combination drug for patients with multiple lipid disorders.
In January 2007, the company agreed to sell its in vitro diagnostics and Point-of-Care diagnostics divisions to General Electric for more than $8 billion. These units were slated to be integrated into the GE Healthcare business unit. The transaction was approved by the boards of directors of Abbott and GE and was targeted to close in the first half of 2007. However, on July 11, 2007, Abbott announced that it had terminated its agreement with GE because the parties could not agree on the terms of the deal.[9]
On September 8, 2007, the company completed the sale of the UK manufacturing plant at Queenborough to Aesica Pharmaceuticals, a private equity-owned UK manufacturer. No announcements have been made restricting the movement of staff to Abbott unlike other sell outs. On February 26, 2009, the company completed its acquisition of Advanced Medical Optics based in Santa Ana, California. In 2009, Abbott opened a satellite research and development facility at Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.[citation needed]
In February 2010, Abbott completed its $6.2 billion (EUR 4.5 billion) acquisition of the pharmaceuticals unit of Solvay S.A..[10] This provided Abbott with a large and complementary portfolio of pharmaceutical products and also expanding its presence in key emerging markets.[11]
On March 22, 2010, the company completed its acquisition of a Hollywood, Florida-based LIMS company STARLIMS. Under the terms of the deal, Abbott Laboratories acquired the company for $14 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $123 million.[12] On May 21, 2010, Abbott Laboratories said it would buy Piramal Healthcare Ltd.'s Healthcare Solutions unit for $2.2[13] billion to become the biggest drug company in India.[14]
In October 2011, the company announced that it planned to separate into two companies, one research-based pharmaceuticals and the other in medical devices, generic drugs sold internationally, and consumer products, with device company retaining the Abbott name.[15][16] The company announced that the other company would be named AbbVie in March 2012.[17] In preparation for the reorganization, Abbott made severe budget cuts and took a $478 million charge in Q3-2012 to pay for the restructuring.[18] The separation was effective as of January 1, 2013. AbbVie was officially listed in the New York Stock Exchange on January 2, 2013.[19]
On May 16, 2014, it was announced that Abbott would acquire the holding company Kalo Pharma Internacional S.L. for $2.9 billion in order to secure the 73% it held of Chilean pharmaceutical company, CFR Pharmaceuticals, which the company said would more than double its branded generic drug portfolio.[20][21][22]
In June 2014, the company entered into a definitive agreement to take over Russian pharmaceutical manufacturer Veropharm (Voronezh) in a deal worth $631 million.[20] Abbott, which already employs 1,400 people in Russia, said it planned to set up a manufacturing presence in the country when the deal closed.[23]
In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire Alere for $5.8 billion.[24][25] In late April, of the same year, Abbott announced it would acquire St. Jude Medical for $25 billion (each share receiving $46.75 in cash & 0.8708 shares of Abbott common stock, equating to an approximate value of $85).[20][26][27]

Organization[edit]




Abbott office


Abbott's core businesses focus on pharmaceuticals, medical devices and nutritional products, which have been supplemented through acquisitions. As of 2016[update], the firm's divisions are:

Diabetes Care:[20] Glucose monitoring devices
Diagnostics:[20] Hematology, immunodiagnostic, oncology and clinical chemistry (including the i-Stat)
Endovascular[20]
Established Pharmaceuticals (EPD):[20] Branded generic drugs sold exclusively in developing markets.
Medical Devices[20]
Medical Optics[20]
Nutrition:[20] baby nutrition (e.g., Similac, Isomil, and Gain), adult health products (e.g., Ensure and ZonePerfect) and special dietary needs (e.g., Glucerna and Juven)

Management structure[edit]
Miles D. White is Chairman and (CEO).[18] He joined Abbott in 1984, serving in management positions including senior vice president of diagnostic operations and executive vice president. He was elected to the Board of Directors in April 1998, to Chief Executive Officer in 1998, and to Chairman of the Board in April 1999.[citation needed]
Management practices[edit]
Along with being ranked 134th on the 2015 Fortune 500 list of largest U.S.-based corporation,[citation needed] Abbott was named one of the 2014 Top 20 Employers by the journal Science and listed as a Top 10 company for women by Working Mother magazine and the National Association for Female Executives.[citation needed] The company has also been named one of the World's Most Admired Companies by Fortune magazine every year since 1984 – ranking No. 1 in medical equipment in 2014 and 2015.[citation needed] Abbott has also been recognized for 11 consecutive years for sustainability leadership through its inclusion on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI).[citation needed] The Top Employers Institute designated Abbott as a great place to work in Europe and China in 2014.[citation needed] DiversityInc magazine has recognized Abbott repeatedly as a Top 50 company for diversity; and, additionally, the Dave Thomas Foundation ranked the company as a best company thanks to its generous adoption benefits.[citation needed]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Abbott Laboratories shares are mainly held by institutional investors (The Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street Corporation and others).[31]
Litigation[edit]
Humira[edit]
In March 2003, British company Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT) stated its wish to "initiate discussions regarding the applicability of the royalty offset provisions for Humira" (Adalimumab) with Abbott Laboratories in the High Court of London. In December 2004, the judgment ruled for CAT.[32]
Abbott was required to pay CAT US$255 million, some of which was to be passed to its partners in development. Of this sum, the Medical Research Council (United Kingdom) (MRC) received US$191M, and in addition, Abbott was asked to pay the MRC a further US$7.5M over five years from 2006, providing that Humira remains on the market.[citation needed]
Depakote[edit]
On October 2, 2012, the company was charged with a $500 million fine and $198.5 million forfeiture for illegal marketing, and in a plea agreement was assessed the second-largest criminal fine in U.S. history for a drug company. U.S. District Court Judge Samuel G Wilson of the Western District of Virginia imposed it given Abbott's guilty plea related to its unlawful promotion of Depakote for uses not approved by the FDA. Abbott had advertised Depakote to be used to control behavioral disturbances for patients with dementia and schizophrenia, without FDA approval. In addition, Abbott marketed Depakote for other psychiatric conditions in adults, including depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol and drug withdrawal and psychiatric conditions in children, including conduct disorders, attention deficit disorder and autism. The court also ordered Abbott to a five-year term of probation and court supervision.[33] Shareholders then brought derivative suits against the company directors for breach of fiduciary duty[34] The parties reached a negotiated settlement in which Abbott agreed to beef up its internal controls and paid the plaintiffs' attorney fees.[35]

Abbott Laboratories is an American[2] worldwide health care company. It has 74,000 employees and operates in more than 150 countries.[3][4] The company headquarters are in Lake Bluff, Illinois. The company was founded by Chicago physician Wallace Calvin Abbott in 1888 to formulate known drugs; it eventually grew to also sell research-based drugs, medical devices, diagnostics, and nutritional products. It split off the research-based pharmaceuticals into Abbvie in 2013. In 2015, revenues were $20.4 billion.
Abbott has a broad range of branded generic pharmaceuticals, medical devices, diagnostics, and nutrition products. The company's in-vitro diagnostics business performs immunoassays and blood screening. Its medical tests and diagnostic instrument systems are used worldwide by hospitals, laboratories, blood banks, and physician offices to diagnose and monitor diseases such as HIV, hepatitis, cancer, heart failure and metabolic disorders, as well as assess other indicators of health. In 1985, the company developed the first HIV blood-screening test.
Abbott Point-of-Care manufactures diagnostic products for blood analysis to provide health care professionals diagnostics information at the point of patient care. Abbott also provides point-of-care cardiac assays to the emergency room.

History[edit]





Dr. Wallace C. Abbott


In 1888 at the age of 30, Wallace Abbott (1857–1921), an 1885 graduate of the University of Michigan, founded the Abbott Alkaloidal Company. At the time, he was a practicing physician and owned a drug store. His innovation was the use of the active part of a medicinal plant, generally an alkaloid (morphine, quinine, strychnine and codeine), which he formed into tiny "dosimetric granules". This approach was successful since it produced more consistent and effective dosages for patients.[5]
Abbott's first international affiliate was in London in 1907, and the company later added an affiliate in Montreal, Canada (Fact 21). Abbott started operations in Pakistan as a marketing affiliate in 1948; the company has steadily expanded to comprise a work force of over 1500 employees. Currently two manufacturing facilities located at Landhi and Korangi in Karachi continue to produce pharmaceutical products.[6] Expansion continued in 1962 when Abbott entered into a joint venture with Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., of Osaka, Japan, to manufacture radio-pharmaceuticals. In 1964, it acquired Ross Laboratories, making Ross a wholly owned subsidiary of Abbott. In 1965, Abbott's expansion in Europe continued with offices in Italy and France. Abbott Laboratories has been present in India for over 100 years through its subsidiary Abbott India Limited and it is currently India's largest healthcare products company.[7]
According to Harvard professor Lester Grinspoon and Peter Hedblom, "In 1966 Abbott Laboratories sold the equivalent of two million doses of methamphetamine in powder form to a Long Island criminal dealer".[8]
In 2001, the company acquired Knoll, the pharmaceutical division of BASF. In 2002, it divested the Selsun Blue brand to Chattem. Later in 2002, the company sold Clear Eyes and Murine to Prestige Brands.[citation needed] In 2004, it spun off its hospital products division into a new 14,000 employee company named Hospira, and acquired TheraSense, a diabetes-care company, which it merged with its MediSense division to become Abbott Diabetes Care. In 2006, Abbott assisted Boston Scientific in its purchase of Guidant Corporation. As part of the agreement, Abbott purchased the vascular device division of Guidant. In 2007, Ross was renamed Abbott Nutrition.
In 2007, Abbott acquired Kos Pharmaceuticals for $3.7 billion in cash.[citation needed] At the time of acquisition, Kos marketed Niaspan, which raises levels of “good,” or HDL, cholesterol and Advicor, a Niaspan combination drug for patients with multiple lipid disorders.
In January 2007, the company agreed to sell its in vitro diagnostics and Point-of-Care diagnostics divisions to General Electric for more than $8 billion. These units were slated to be integrated into the GE Healthcare business unit. The transaction was approved by the boards of directors of Abbott and GE and was targeted to close in the first half of 2007. However, on July 11, 2007, Abbott announced that it had terminated its agreement with GE because the parties could not agree on the terms of the deal.[9]
On September 8, 2007, the company completed the sale of the UK manufacturing plant at Queenborough to Aesica Pharmaceuticals, a private equity-owned UK manufacturer. No announcements have been made restricting the movement of staff to Abbott unlike other sell outs. On February 26, 2009, the company completed its acquisition of Advanced Medical Optics based in Santa Ana, California. In 2009, Abbott opened a satellite research and development facility at Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.[citation needed]
In February 2010, Abbott completed its $6.2 billion (EUR 4.5 billion) acquisition of the pharmaceuticals unit of Solvay S.A..[10] This provided Abbott with a large and complementary portfolio of pharmaceutical products and also expanding its presence in key emerging markets.[11]
On March 22, 2010, the company completed its acquisition of a Hollywood, Florida-based LIMS company STARLIMS. Under the terms of the deal, Abbott Laboratories acquired the company for $14 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $123 million.[12] On May 21, 2010, Abbott Laboratories said it would buy Piramal Healthcare Ltd.'s Healthcare Solutions unit for $2.2[13] billion to become the biggest drug company in India.[14]
In October 2011, the company announced that it planned to separate into two companies, one research-based pharmaceuticals and the other in medical devices, generic drugs sold internationally, and consumer products, with device company retaining the Abbott name.[15][16] The company announced that the other company would be named AbbVie in March 2012.[17] In preparation for the reorganization, Abbott made severe budget cuts and took a $478 million charge in Q3-2012 to pay for the restructuring.[18] The separation was effective as of January 1, 2013. AbbVie was officially listed in the New York Stock Exchange on January 2, 2013.[19]
On May 16, 2014, it was announced that Abbott would acquire the holding company Kalo Pharma Internacional S.L. for $2.9 billion in order to secure the 73% it held of Chilean pharmaceutical company, CFR Pharmaceuticals, which the company said would more than double its branded generic drug portfolio.[20][21][22]
In June 2014, the company entered into a definitive agreement to take over Russian pharmaceutical manufacturer Veropharm (Voronezh) in a deal worth $631 million.[20] Abbott, which already employs 1,400 people in Russia, said it planned to set up a manufacturing presence in the country when the deal closed.[23]
In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire Alere for $5.8 billion.[24][25] In late April, of the same year, Abbott announced it would acquire St. Jude Medical for $25 billion (each share receiving $46.75 in cash & 0.8708 shares of Abbott common stock, equating to an approximate value of $85).[20][26][27]

Organization[edit]




Abbott office


Abbott's core businesses focus on pharmaceuticals, medical devices and nutritional products, which have been supplemented through acquisitions. As of 2016[update], the firm's divisions are:

Diabetes Care:[20] Glucose monitoring devices
Diagnostics:[20] Hematology, immunodiagnostic, oncology and clinical chemistry (including the i-Stat)
Endovascular[20]
Established Pharmaceuticals (EPD):[20] Branded generic drugs sold exclusively in developing markets.
Medical Devices[20]
Medical Optics[20]
Nutrition:[20] baby nutrition (e.g., Similac, Isomil, and Gain), adult health products (e.g., Ensure and ZonePerfect) and special dietary needs (e.g., Glucerna and Juven)

Management structure[edit]
Miles D. White is Chairman and (CEO).[18] He joined Abbott in 1984, serving in management positions including senior vice president of diagnostic operations and executive vice president. He was elected to the Board of Directors in April 1998, to Chief Executive Officer in 1998, and to Chairman of the Board in April 1999.[citation needed]
Management practices[edit]
Along with being ranked 134th on the 2015 Fortune 500 list of largest U.S.-based corporation,[citation needed] Abbott was named one of the 2014 Top 20 Employers by the journal Science and listed as a Top 10 company for women by Working Mother magazine and the National Association for Female Executives.[citation needed] The company has also been named one of the World's Most Admired Companies by Fortune magazine every year since 1984 – ranking No. 1 in medical equipment in 2014 and 2015.[citation needed] Abbott has also been recognized for 11 consecutive years for sustainability leadership through its inclusion on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI).[citation needed] The Top Employers Institute designated Abbott as a great place to work in Europe and China in 2014.[citation needed] DiversityInc magazine has recognized Abbott repeatedly as a Top 50 company for diversity; and, additionally, the Dave Thomas Foundation ranked the company as a best company thanks to its generous adoption benefits.[citation needed]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Abbott Laboratories shares are mainly held by institutional investors (The Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street Corporation and others).[31]
Litigation[edit]
Humira[edit]
In March 2003, British company Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT) stated its wish to "initiate discussions regarding the applicability of the royalty offset provisions for Humira" (Adalimumab) with Abbott Laboratories in the High Court of London. In December 2004, the judgment ruled for CAT.[32]
Abbott was required to pay CAT US$255 million, some of which was to be passed to its partners in development. Of this sum, the Medical Research Council (United Kingdom) (MRC) received US$191M, and in addition, Abbott was asked to pay the MRC a further US$7.5M over five years from 2006, providing that Humira remains on the market.[citation needed]
Depakote[edit]
On October 2, 2012, the company was charged with a $500 million fine and $198.5 million forfeiture for illegal marketing, and in a plea agreement was assessed the second-largest criminal fine in U.S. history for a drug company. U.S. District Court Judge Samuel G Wilson of the Western District of Virginia imposed it given Abbott's guilty plea related to its unlawful promotion of Depakote for uses not approved by the FDA. Abbott had advertised Depakote to be used to control behavioral disturbances for patients with dementia and schizophrenia, without FDA approval. In addition, Abbott marketed Depakote for other psychiatric conditions in adults, including depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol and drug withdrawal and psychiatric conditions in children, including conduct disorders, attention deficit disorder and autism. The court also ordered Abbott to a five-year term of probation and court supervision.[33] Shareholders then brought derivative suits against the company directors for breach of fiduciary duty[34] The parties reached a negotiated settlement in which Abbott agreed to beef up its internal controls and paid the plaintiffs' attorney fees.[35]
Sponsorship[edit]
Since 2015 Abbott is the title sponsor of the World Marathon Majors.[36]

Abbott Laboratories is an American[2] worldwide health care company. It has 74,000 employees and operates in more than 150 countries.[3][4] The company headquarters are in Lake Bluff, Illinois. The company was founded by Chicago physician Wallace Calvin Abbott in 1888 to formulate known drugs; it eventually grew to also sell research-based drugs, medical devices, diagnostics, and nutritional products. It split off the research-based pharmaceuticals into Abbvie in 2013. In 2015, revenues were $20.4 billion.
Abbott has a broad range of branded generic pharmaceuticals, medical devices, diagnostics, and nutrition products. The company's in-vitro diagnostics business performs immunoassays and blood screening. Its medical tests and diagnostic instrument systems are used worldwide by hospitals, laboratories, blood banks, and physician offices to diagnose and monitor diseases such as HIV, hepatitis, cancer, heart failure and metabolic disorders, as well as assess other indicators of health. In 1985, the company developed the first HIV blood-screening test.
Abbott Point-of-Care manufactures diagnostic products for blood analysis to provide health care professionals diagnostics information at the point of patient care. Abbott also provides point-of-care cardiac assays to the emergency room.

History[edit]





Dr. Wallace C. Abbott


In 1888 at the age of 30, Wallace Abbott (1857–1921), an 1885 graduate of the University of Michigan, founded the Abbott Alkaloidal Company. At the time, he was a practicing physician and owned a drug store. His innovation was the use of the active part of a medicinal plant, generally an alkaloid (morphine, quinine, strychnine and codeine), which he formed into tiny "dosimetric granules". This approach was successful since it produced more consistent and effective dosages for patients.[5]
Abbott's first international affiliate was in London in 1907, and the company later added an affiliate in Montreal, Canada (Fact 21). Abbott started operations in Pakistan as a marketing affiliate in 1948; the company has steadily expanded to comprise a work force of over 1500 employees. Currently two manufacturing facilities located at Landhi and Korangi in Karachi continue to produce pharmaceutical products.[6] Expansion continued in 1962 when Abbott entered into a joint venture with Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., of Osaka, Japan, to manufacture radio-pharmaceuticals. In 1964, it acquired Ross Laboratories, making Ross a wholly owned subsidiary of Abbott. In 1965, Abbott's expansion in Europe continued with offices in Italy and France. Abbott Laboratories has been present in India for over 100 years through its subsidiary Abbott India Limited and it is currently India's largest healthcare products company.[7]
According to Harvard professor Lester Grinspoon and Peter Hedblom, "In 1966 Abbott Laboratories sold the equivalent of two million doses of methamphetamine in powder form to a Long Island criminal dealer".[8]
In 2001, the company acquired Knoll, the pharmaceutical division of BASF. In 2002, it divested the Selsun Blue brand to Chattem. Later in 2002, the company sold Clear Eyes and Murine to Prestige Brands.[citation needed] In 2004, it spun off its hospital products division into a new 14,000 employee company named Hospira, and acquired TheraSense, a diabetes-care company, which it merged with its MediSense division to become Abbott Diabetes Care. In 2006, Abbott assisted Boston Scientific in its purchase of Guidant Corporation. As part of the agreement, Abbott purchased the vascular device division of Guidant. In 2007, Ross was renamed Abbott Nutrition.
In 2007, Abbott acquired Kos Pharmaceuticals for $3.7 billion in cash.[citation needed] At the time of acquisition, Kos marketed Niaspan, which raises levels of “good,” or HDL, cholesterol and Advicor, a Niaspan combination drug for patients with multiple lipid disorders.
In January 2007, the company agreed to sell its in vitro diagnostics and Point-of-Care diagnostics divisions to General Electric for more than $8 billion. These units were slated to be integrated into the GE Healthcare business unit. The transaction was approved by the boards of directors of Abbott and GE and was targeted to close in the first half of 2007. However, on July 11, 2007, Abbott announced that it had terminated its agreement with GE because the parties could not agree on the terms of the deal.[9]
On September 8, 2007, the company completed the sale of the UK manufacturing plant at Queenborough to Aesica Pharmaceuticals, a private equity-owned UK manufacturer. No announcements have been made restricting the movement of staff to Abbott unlike other sell outs. On February 26, 2009, the company completed its acquisition of Advanced Medical Optics based in Santa Ana, California. In 2009, Abbott opened a satellite research and development facility at Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.[citation needed]
In February 2010, Abbott completed its $6.2 billion (EUR 4.5 billion) acquisition of the pharmaceuticals unit of Solvay S.A..[10] This provided Abbott with a large and complementary portfolio of pharmaceutical products and also expanding its presence in key emerging markets.[11]
On March 22, 2010, the company completed its acquisition of a Hollywood, Florida-based LIMS company STARLIMS. Under the terms of the deal, Abbott Laboratories acquired the company for $14 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $123 million.[12] On May 21, 2010, Abbott Laboratories said it would buy Piramal Healthcare Ltd.'s Healthcare Solutions unit for $2.2[13] billion to become the biggest drug company in India.[14]
In October 2011, the company announced that it planned to separate into two companies, one research-based pharmaceuticals and the other in medical devices, generic drugs sold internationally, and consumer products, with device company retaining the Abbott name.[15][16] The company announced that the other company would be named AbbVie in March 2012.[17] In preparation for the reorganization, Abbott made severe budget cuts and took a $478 million charge in Q3-2012 to pay for the restructuring.[18] The separation was effective as of January 1, 2013. AbbVie was officially listed in the New York Stock Exchange on January 2, 2013.[19]
On May 16, 2014, it was announced that Abbott would acquire the holding company Kalo Pharma Internacional S.L. for $2.9 billion in order to secure the 73% it held of Chilean pharmaceutical company, CFR Pharmaceuticals, which the company said would more than double its branded generic drug portfolio.[20][21][22]
In June 2014, the company entered into a definitive agreement to take over Russian pharmaceutical manufacturer Veropharm (Voronezh) in a deal worth $631 million.[20] Abbott, which already employs 1,400 people in Russia, said it planned to set up a manufacturing presence in the country when the deal closed.[23]
In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire Alere for $5.8 billion.[24][25] In late April, of the same year, Abbott announced it would acquire St. Jude Medical for $25 billion (each share receiving $46.75 in cash & 0.8708 shares of Abbott common stock, equating to an approximate value of $85).[20][26][27]

Organization[edit]




Abbott office


Abbott's core businesses focus on pharmaceuticals, medical devices and nutritional products, which have been supplemented through acquisitions. As of 2016[update], the firm's divisions are:

Diabetes Care:[20] Glucose monitoring devices
Diagnostics:[20] Hematology, immunodiagnostic, oncology and clinical chemistry (including the i-Stat)
Endovascular[20]
Established Pharmaceuticals (EPD):[20] Branded generic drugs sold exclusively in developing markets.
Medical Devices[20]
Medical Optics[20]
Nutrition:[20] baby nutrition (e.g., Similac, Isomil, and Gain), adult health products (e.g., Ensure and ZonePerfect) and special dietary needs (e.g., Glucerna and Juven)

Management structure[edit]
Miles D. White is Chairman and (CEO).[18] He joined Abbott in 1984, serving in management positions including senior vice president of diagnostic operations and executive vice president. He was elected to the Board of Directors in April 1998, to Chief Executive Officer in 1998, and to Chairman of the Board in April 1999.[citation needed]
Management practices[edit]
Along with being ranked 134th on the 2015 Fortune 500 list of largest U.S.-based corporation,[citation needed] Abbott was named one of the 2014 Top 20 Employers by the journal Science and listed as a Top 10 company for women by Working Mother magazine and the National Association for Female Executives.[citation needed] The company has also been named one of the World's Most Admired Companies by Fortune magazine every year since 1984 – ranking No. 1 in medical equipment in 2014 and 2015.[citation needed] Abbott has also been recognized for 11 consecutive years for sustainability leadership through its inclusion on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI).[citation needed] The Top Employers Institute designated Abbott as a great place to work in Europe and China in 2014.[citation needed] DiversityInc magazine has recognized Abbott repeatedly as a Top 50 company for diversity; and, additionally, the Dave Thomas Foundation ranked the company as a best company thanks to its generous adoption benefits.[citation needed]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Abbott Laboratories shares are mainly held by institutional investors (The Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street Corporation and others).[31]
Litigation[edit]
Humira[edit]
In March 2003, British company Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT) stated its wish to "initiate discussions regarding the applicability of the royalty offset provisions for Humira" (Adalimumab) with Abbott Laboratories in the High Court of London. In December 2004, the judgment ruled for CAT.[32]
Abbott was required to pay CAT US$255 million, some of which was to be passed to its partners in development. Of this sum, the Medical Research Council (United Kingdom) (MRC) received US$191M, and in addition, Abbott was asked to pay the MRC a further US$7.5M over five years from 2006, providing that Humira remains on the market.[citation needed]
Depakote[edit]
On October 2, 2012, the company was charged with a $500 million fine and $198.5 million forfeiture for illegal marketing, and in a plea agreement was assessed the second-largest criminal fine in U.S. history for a drug company. U.S. District Court Judge Samuel G Wilson of the Western District of Virginia imposed it given Abbott's guilty plea related to its unlawful promotion of Depakote for uses not approved by the FDA. Abbott had advertised Depakote to be used to control behavioral disturbances for patients with dementia and schizophrenia, without FDA approval. In addition, Abbott marketed Depakote for other psychiatric conditions in adults, including depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol and drug withdrawal and psychiatric conditions in children, including conduct disorders, attention deficit disorder and autism. The court also ordered Abbott to a five-year term of probation and court supervision.[33] Shareholders then brought derivative suits against the company directors for breach of fiduciary duty[34] The parties reached a negotiated settlement in which Abbott agreed to beef up its internal controls and paid the plaintiffs' attorney fees.[35]
Sponsorship[edit]
Since 2015 Abbott is the title sponsor of the World Marathon Majors.[36]

Big Pharma & Medical Device ManufacturersAbbVie and AbbottAbbVieSpun off from Abbott Laboratories in January 2013, drug maker AbbVie now ranks 143 on Forbes’ list of the largest companies worldwide, pulling in at 71st in market value and 83 in sales, in spite of legal issues that have threatened some of its largest selling products.Jump To TopicBillion Dollar Making DrugsLawsuits & Challenges to Patent RightsLawsuits Over DrugsMedical MarijuanaCorporate HistoryJump To TopicSelect TopicBillion Dollar Making DrugsLawsuits & Challenges to Patent RightsLawsuits Over DrugsMedical MarijuanaCorporate HistoryEstablished: 2013 (History dates back to 1888)
Headquarters: Chicago, IL
Founder: Wallace C. Abbott
Size: 29,000 employees in 75 countries
Popular Products: Humira, Imbruvica, Viekira, Lupron, AndroGel, Marinol
2016 Revenue: $25.6 billion
AbbVie, the fledgling, research-based biopharmaceutical company, netted $18.8 billion in sales in its first year, growing to $25.6 billion in 2016, largely on the strength of Humira, its blockbuster arthritis drug. Now, the company, with 29,000 employees in 75 countries, markets more than 30 products and has more than 50 drugs in development.

The company focuses on four therapeutic areas where it says it has proven expertise. Those areas are:

Immunology
Oncology
Neuroscience
Virology


According to its website, AbbVie “takes on the toughest health challenges. But we do more than treat diseases — we aim to make a remarkable impact on people’s lives.”
Although the company has faced some legal issues, with lawsuits accusing it of fraudulent marketing of a testosterone-enhancing drug, for example, it has maintained a stellar reputation in the industry.
The Boston-based Reputation Institute announced in May 2017 that AbbVie had the best reputation among pharma companies. The ranking was based on more than 16,500 reputation rankings in eight markets, Brazil, France, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.
In seven measured areas of reputation, AbbVie led in three of them: workplace, governance and citizenship.
“Since the company’s inception less than five years ago, we have worked to raise a better understanding of AbbVie among our key stakeholders,” said Laura Schumacher, executive vice president of external affairs at AbbVie. “We are pleased that these efforts have resonated with our global audience and driven greater understanding of who we are and what we stand for as a company.”
According to the reputation institute, higher reputation ratings translate in increases in the likelihood that people will recommend a company. “In a world where word of mouth is becoming more and more critical, reputation is proving to be a key driver of business success, and that’s why the leading companies are actively measuring and managing it,” said Kaspar Ulf Nielsen, an official at the Reputation Institute.
AbbVie’s Drugs Make Billions

Fact
Abbvie’s arthritis drug Humira is the world’s top-selling drug, bringing in $16 billion in 2016.

By far, AbbVie’s biggest sales generator — also the world’s top-selling drug — is the arthritis drug Humira, which brought in a jaw-dropping $16 billion in 2016. Forbes has called Humira one of the biggest selling products of all time.
To put that in some perspective, that’s more than the national government budgets of more than 100 countries, including Panama ($12.4 billion), Jordan ($11.2 billion), and Iceland ($7.9 billion).
All that revenue comes at a steep cost to patients, insurance companies and taxpayers, who can pay $50,000 a year or more per patient for the drug. AbbVie spends heavily marketing its crown jewel. In 2015, the company spent $357 million marketing Humira.
Also used to treat psoriasis and Crohn’s disease, Humira accounts for more than 62 percent of AbbVie’s total annual sales. Perhaps, not surprisingly, other pharmaceutical companies are looking for a piece of that action.

Humira works by blocking proteins called tumor necrosis factor (TNF) which are naturally produced by the immune system
Part of the reason for the high-level of revenue is that AbbVie doubled the price of the drug over a three-year period. The price actually went up about 3 percent every three months, according to one analyst.
Humira works by blocking certain proteins called tumor necrosis factor (TNF) which is naturally produced by the immune symptom. An overproduction of the proteins has been linked to Crohn’s disease and other inflammation conditions.
AbbVie Lawsuits and Challenges to Patent Rights
Humira is the focus of patent fights, as rivals seek to make generic versions known as biosimilars, and AbbVie tries to stave them off by filing new patents to keep the generics off the market. AbbVie has filed more than 70 new patents on Humira covering such things as formulations, manufacturing methods and uses. In May 2017, AbbVie lost a round to the company Coherus on a case in which it challenged one of AbbVie’s patents. However, according to Fortune, other patents should protect Abbvie’s sales through 2022.
“Any company seeking to market a biosimilar version of Humira will have to contend with this extensive patent estate, which AbbVie intends to enforce vigorously,” said AbbVie Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard A. Gonzalez, according to The New York Times.





“Any company seeking to market a biosimilar version of Humira will have to contend with this extensive patent estate, which AbbVie intends to enforce vigorously.”- Richard A. Gonzalez, AbbVie Chairman and Chief Executive Officer





But AbbVie isn’t relying solely on Humira in the arthritis market. It’s positioning a new drug, Upadacitinib, which in June 2017 succeeded in a late-stage study on patients who hadn’t responded well to other treatments. If the new drug gets the go-ahead from the FDA, it could ease the company’s reliance on Humira.
Patients Allege Drug Injuries
Humira has also been the subject of some litigation by people who say they were injured after taking the drug.
Abbott was ordered by a jury in 2013 to pay a North Dakota family $2.24 million in the case of Delores Tietz, who took the drug for almost seven months in 2009 until suffering from a fungal infection caused by the drug. She spent 13 months in the hospital and had to undergo physical and speech therapy.

Close up of histoplasmosis, an invasive fungal infection
The FDA in 2008 required the makers of TNF blocking drugs like Humira to strengthen existing warnings on the risk of developing fungal infections after some patients with the infections died. Although the risk of serious infections had been included in the prescribing information since the drugs were approved, the FDA said health care professionals weren’t always recognizing cases of histoplasmosis and other invasive fungal infections, leading to some delays in treatment.
In 2009, the FDA required makers of TNF blockers, including Humira, to update the boxed warning to alert healthcare professionals of an increased risk of lymphoma and other malignancies in children and adolescents treated with the drugs.
Other Top Performers
Although their revenue isn’t anywhere near Humira’s, other AbbVie top performers include Imbruvica (cancer drug), with $1.8 billion in 2016 world sales; Viekira (hepatitis C) at $1.5 billion, and Lupron (synthetic hormone), coming in at $821 million. Then there’s, Synthroid (thyroid) at $763 million and Synagis (prevents severe respiratory disease in infants) and Creon (replaces pancreatic enzymes) each at $730 million. Troubled testosterone booster AndroGel generated $675 million in sales in 2016, a tumble from 2013 when sales were at $1.4 billion. Sales of the drug dropped precipitously in 2015 after the Food and Drug Administration required a warning that testosterone supplements could increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes.
AbbVie has sought FDA approval to market Imbruvica for additional conditions, including chronic graft-versus-host disease.
Lawsuits Over Some of AbbVie’s Drugs
The company faces thousands of lawsuits from men who say they suffered heart attacks and other injuries after taking AndroGel. The plaintiffs accuse the company and others of fabricating a condition called “Low T” in order to explode the market for a product that had been received FDA approval for a specific disease. The company is also accused of failing to disclose known risks associated with taking the drug.

AndroGel was marketed as a solution to the natural symptoms of aging
AbbVie and other companies are defendants in more than 4,000 lawsuits in federal court in multidistrict litigation Chicago, as well as hundreds of cases in various state courts. The lawsuits allege AbbVie aggressively marketed AndroGel as the solution to the natural symptoms of aging, such as fatigue and grumpiness. The plaintiffs say they were injured when they took the drug, which had risks that were known as far back as the 1970s but were never disclosed to patients.
AbbVie says the FDA approval process and regulations were followed, and that its marketing practices were covered by the First Amendment. It is also challenging whether AndroGel caused the specific injuries suffered. In a statement emailed to Bloomberg, AbbVie spokeswoman Toni Haubert said, “We believe our disease education and marketing of AndroGel have adhered strictly to FDA-approved uses and are in full compliance with applicable standards.”
AbbVie also sells the anti-seizure drug Depakote, but it is not one of the company’s top sellers. In 2012, Abbott agreed to pay $1.6 billion for illegal marketing of the drug, which is the focus of lawsuits over birth defects suffered by children of mothers who took it during pregnancy. In February 2017, a federal jury in Cleveland ruled in favor of Abbott and AbbVie in the case of a woman who had sued the companies claiming they were responsible for her son’s birth defects after she took Depakote while pregnant.
Medical Marijuana
Another of Abbvie’s drugs, Marinol, has caused some analysts to classify Abbvie as a medical marijuana maker. That’s because Marinol’s active ingredients is a synthetic cannabinoid — man-made delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol or THC.

Marinol was the first FDA-approved cannabis drug
Marinol received FDA approval in 1985 for chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting and in 1992 to treat anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS. It was the first FDA-approved cannabis drug.
Marinol was developed by Solvay Pharmaceuticals; In 2010 Abbott bought Solvay’s pharmaceutical division, including Marinol. Abbvie doesn’t release its sales numbers, but analysts think they may be suffering because of the availability of generic versions of the drug. According to one report, Solvay said in 2007 that the drug had generated more than $100 million, but those numbers sank to less than half of that when generics came on the market the following year.
AbbVie’s Corporate History
Although AbbVie is relatively new, it builds on the 125-year history of Abbott Laboratories, founded in 1888 by Dr. Wallace C. Abbott started making tiny “dosimetric granules,” tiny pills made from medicinal plants, which he sold in his drugstore in Chicago.
Abbott announced the planned split in 2011, maintaining the parts of the business that concentrated on medical devices such as heart stents, and allowing AbbVie to focus on research-based pharmaceuticals. The company says its name represents its connection to the past and future.
Analysts said the spinoff allowed investors to choose levels of risk and possible reward, with the pharmaceuticals having higher levels of both potential risk and possible payoff. AbbVie was led from the outset by Gonzalez, a veteran Abbott executive.
Since it split from Abbott, AbbVie has increased its annual research and development investment from $2.8 billion in 2013 to $4.15 billion in 2016. And it says its revenue and earnings have grown every year since it became a stand-alone entity.

Big Pharma & Medical Device ManufacturersBig Pharma and Medical Device ManufacturersBig Pharma is the nickname given to the world's vast and influential pharmaceutical industry and its trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America or PhRMA. Big Pharma and medical device companies make billions of dollars every year selling drugs and devices — including those that were recalled or involved in fraud or product liability lawsuits.Jump To TopicAbout Big PharmaBig Pharma’s InfluenceBig Pharma Sways OpinionsInfluencing Doctors & ResearchersFraud SettlementsManufacturer DirectoryJump To TopicSelect TopicAbout Big PharmaBig Pharma’s InfluenceBig Pharma Sways OpinionsInfluencing Doctors & ResearchersFraud SettlementsManufacturer DirectoryThe pharmaceutical industry — nicknamed Big Pharma — is one of the most powerful industries in the world. The global revenue for pharmaceuticals was over $1 trillion in 2014. But nowhere else in the world do the drug and medical device industries have as much power and make as much money as in the U.S.
In fact, Americans spent an all-time high of $457 billion on prescription drugs in 2015. By 2020, it will be $610 billion. Medical devices are also lucrative. The U.S. makes up about half of the world’s share of the market at about $148 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.

US based big pharma companies
Meanwhile, drug prices continue to rise. Consulting firm Segal Consulting expects drug prices for Americans under age 65 to rise 11.6 percent in 2017. In contrast, wages are only expected to rise 2.5 percent, leaving many American unable to afford their medications.
Big Pharma even contributes heavily to the annual budget of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through application fees (user fees) for its new products. Experts say the industry contributes about two thirds of the FDA’s budget.
Five of the top 10 pharma and medical device companies for 2016 are headquartered in the U.S.: Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Merck, Gilead and AbbVie.
The underside of the industry reveals a history of fraud, bribery, product liability lawsuits and scandals that led to billions in settlements — a known cost of doing business for these companies who are “too big to jail.” Despite criminal charges and fines, the companies continue to do business.
Who is Big Pharma?
The majority of drugs and medical devices have ties to a small group of parent companies. Prescription drugs and devices manufactured by these companies bring in billions in profits. The biggest drug makers may also have subsidiaries that manufacture medical devices.
Pharmaceutical companies are typically larger and make more money than companies that focus on medical devices.


The most powerful drug and device companies are members of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) — the industry’s U.S. lobbying organization.

With the help of staggering profits and an army of 1,378 paid lobbyists, the industry spreads its influence on Capitol Hill. From 1998 to 2016, Big Pharma spent nearly $3.5 billion on lobbying expenses — more than any other industry. In 2016 alone, it spent about $246 million — more than the defense industries and corporate business lobbyists combined.

Fact
Only 28 percent of Americans have a good opinion of Big Pharma.

Only 28 percent of Americans have a good opinion of Big Pharma. In fact, they are the second most hated industry in the U.S. They are also the biggest defrauder of the Federal Government under the False Claims Act, according to consumer watchdog group Public Citizen.
The Reputation Institute evaluated public perception of 17 pharmaceutical companies for products and services, innovation, workplace, governance, citizenship and financial performance. The Institute based its results on 16,800 ratings from the U.S., U.K., Canada and other countries.
Of all the countries, the U.S. had the lowest opinion of pharmaceutical companies. Older people had the most favorable view of the industry.

Medical Device Manufacturers
Medical devices can be anything from hospital diagnostic equipment to hip and knee implants. Several companies only produce medical devices, but some drug manufacturers, such as Johnson & Johnson, also manufacture devices.

Fact
Part of the total pharmaceutical industry lobbying price tag comes from the Medical Device Manufacturers Association (MDMA).

Like Big Pharma, medical device manufacturers also have a lobbying group to pursue their interests in Washington.Part of the total pharmaceutical industry lobbying price tag comes from the Medical Device Manufacturers Association (MDMA).
In 2016, it contributed $1.2 million in lobbying funds. Its efforts concentrate on medical device friendly bills in Congress mostly related to how companies pay taxes.
Five of the top medical devices companies have their headquarters in the U.S.: Johnson & Johnson, Baxter International, Abbott Laboratories, Stryker and Boston Scientific.

Big Pharma’s Influence
Critics contend that Big Pharma uses manipulative tactics and expensive advertising to sway lawmakers, the FDA and the public to increase sales.
The public is exposed to Pharma’s misleading promotions and advertising. For example, critics say AbbVie and other companies who make testosterone replacement drugs such as AndroGel marketed their drugs as the fountain of youth to older men. They created a marketing campaign around the condition “Low T” that featured a quiz for men to self-diagnose Low T symptoms.

Androgel, above, was marketed as the “fountain of youth” with few studies to back it up
The testosterone market soared into the billions as a result. But few studies back up drug-company claims that the drug significantly enhances mood, vitality and sexual performance. Studies also link these drugs to heart problems. The FDA added a warning on the label after millions of men were already exposed to the risk.
The American public is not the only sector of society influenced by Big Pharma’s techniques. Doctors, scientists and research organizations, medical journals, teaching hospitals and university medical schools all exhibit disturbing conflicts of interest between their publicly stated missions and their financial and ideological subjection to Big Pharma.
Doctors conduct research with funds from Big Pharma. Private charities and foundations account for a mere 5 percent of the estimated $100 billion spent on biomedical research in the U.S. each year. Pharmaceutical and medical device companies contribute approximately 60 percent.
Big Pharma has a track record of hiring former government workers with valuable connections to gain political clout.

 The trade group PhRMA has many current or former staff members who once served in the political arena, including:

36 who worked for a member of Congress
13 who worked for a federal agency
12 who worked for a congressional committee
Two who worked for the White House
One who worked in the court system


Using these connections to pursue industry goals, Big Pharma has a significant competitive advantage over the public interest.
Marketing, Research and Development (R&D) and Drug Cost
Americans pay more than any other country in the world for pharmaceuticals — in some cases, thousands of dollars more per prescription. Big Pharma says this occurs because of the astronomical costs of developing a new drug.

Cost Facts
While companies claim each new drug costs them $1.2 billion, the true cost is more like 60 million.

The truth is that U.S. law allows drug companies to set the prices for drugs and protects them from free-market competition. Other countries set a limit on what companies can charge based on the benefit of the drug. The true cost of developing a drug is shrouded in mystery, with many unverifiable figures reported by Big Pharma.
Donald Light, a professor and expert on the pharma business model, said that while companies claim each new drug costs them $1.2 billion, the true cost is more like 60 million.
The industry also avoids talking about how much it spends on marketing, which is almost double what it spends on research.
Big Pharma Sways Opinions
The large amount of cash Big Pharma bestows on government representatives and regulatory bodies is small when compared with the billions it spends each year on direct-to-consumer advertising. The U.S. is one of only two countries in the world whose governments allow prescription drugs to be advertised on TV (the other is New Zealand).


In 2015, Big Pharma spent $5.4 billion on direct-to-consumer ads and fired off about 80 ads an hour, according to Nielsen.

Big Pharma also employs doctors, researchers and institutions.
The industry persuades doctors to allow ghostwriting, paying physicians to attach their names to positive articles about a particular drug with the goal of seeing it published in a reputable medical journal.

Paid copywriters were used in advertising Paxil,
above
Often the commentary is little more than an advertisement penned by a company paid copywriter showcasing a new product. Big Pharma used ghostwriting to promote numerous drugs, including the antidepressant Paxil, the recalled weight loss drug Fen-Phen, the anti-epilepsy drug Neurontin, the antidepressant Zoloft and painkiller Vioxx, to name a few.
In addition, even when a medical reviewer writes a comprehensive assessment of a new drug for a medical journal, it is common practice for those supposedly unbiased professionals to be on Big Pharma’s payroll.
These slanted studies appear in medical journals that are widely hailed as collections of unbiased scientific evaluation and separated from the long financial arm of pharmaceutical industry influence. Yet Richard Smith, former editor of the British Medical Journal, says, “All journals are bought — or at least cleverly used — by the pharmaceutical industry.”

Big Pharma tends to weaken the objectivity of even the most honest health professionals while encouraging them to overprescribe medications. Consider the numbers:

Advertising instead of research: For every $1 spent on “basic research,” Big Pharma spends $19 on promotions and advertising.
Distribution of free drug samples: The U.S. has one pharmaceutical sales representative for every five office-based physicians.
Sponsorship of symposiums and medical conventions: Drug and medical device makers spend lavishly on doctors, including covering meals, travel, seminars and conventions that sometimes look more like vacations.


Many medical journals, including the esteemed Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), actively vie for the attention of Big Pharma advertising dollars, billing themselves as the best way for drug companies to reach their professional readership.
How Big Pharma Influences Doctors and Researchers
Part of Big Pharma’s formula for creating blockbuster drugs is promoting to physicians and providing kickbacks and incentives to prescribe their expensive, brand name drugs.

Fact
In 2012, Big Pharma spent $24 billion on physician advertising, according to Pew Charitable Trusts.

Drug companies also buy doctors meals and pay them for “speaking engagements” in exchange for brand loyalty. One 2016 study in JAMA Internal Medicine found that when drug reps bought doctors just one meal costing less than $20 they were more likely to prescribe a promoted brand name drug.
According to ProPublica’s Dollars for Docs investigation, 1,866 companies paid $6.25 billion to doctors and hospitals from August 2013 to December 2015.

Drug and Device Company Payments to Doctors from Select Companies, August 2013 to December 2015:



Company
PAYMENTS




DePuy (Johnson & Johnson)
$167 million


Stryker Corporation
$153 million


AstraZeneca
$145 million


Pfizer
$128 million


Janssen Pharmaceuticals
$106 million


GlaxoSmithKline
$86.3 million


Boston Scientific
$77 million




Big Pharma and Researchers
Then there are medical researchers, who are hardly immune to Big Pharma’s financial power. Because drug companies sponsor clinical trials that researchers are paid to administer, too often the academics and scientists are hired hands who supply human subjects and collect data according to the instructions of their corporate employers.
Sponsors keep the data, analyze it, write the papers and decide whether and when and where to submit them for publication. Drug companies also stage-manage trials to produce predetermined outcomes that will put their products in the best light.
Medical Schools and Big Pharma
Big Pharma has also infiltrated medical schools. Teachers, department chairs and deans often sit on drug companies’ boards of directors. This influences educational content. Money from Big Pharma supports programs within many medical schools and teaching hospitals, and company reps are given access to young doctors to promote their company’s drugs.


The result is that doctors not only receive biased information but also learn a drug-intensive style of medicine.

Sales reps may influence these doctors to believe that newer, more expensive drugs are always better than old ones.
In most states, doctors must also take accredited education courses, called continuing medical education (CME). The pharmaceutical industry provides a substantial proportion of the billions spent on CME annually and continues to use that support as a marketing tool.
In addition, academic centers are able to receive royalties from Big Pharma on any drug or technology they help to create and patent as a result of research — sometimes underwritten with government funds.
Columbia University, for example, received nearly $790 million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companies during the 17-year life of its medical school’s patent on a method for synthesizing certain biological products.
Columbia University received nearly $790 million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companiesBig Pharma Fraud Settlements
In a 24-year period, Big Pharma companies paid 373 settlements totaling $35.7 billion for marketing fraud, according to Public Citizen’s 2013 report Pharmaceutical Industry Settlements: 1991 through 2015.

Fact
In a 24-year period, Big Pharma companies paid 373 settlements totaling $35.7 billion for marketing fraud.

The most common charge involved drug-pricing scams against state Medicaid programs. This meant state taxpayers ended up footing the bill while Big Pharma made billions.
Unlawful promotion of drugs yielded the biggest settlements. But these investigations take many years to complete. By then, drug companies have made hundreds of millions or even several billion, while the U.S. Department of Justice fine is typically only a few million.
This makes it too profitable to stop breaking the law for many companies, according to Michael Bobelian of Forbes Magazine.

Abbott Laboratories is an American[2] worldwide health care company. It has 74,000 employees and operates in more than 150 countries.[3][4] The company headquarters are in Lake Bluff, Illinois. The company was founded by Chicago physician Wallace Calvin Abbott in 1888 to formulate known drugs; it eventually grew to also sell research-based drugs, medical devices, diagnostics, and nutritional products. It split off the research-based pharmaceuticals into Abbvie in 2013. In 2015, revenues were $20.4 billion.
Abbott has a broad range of branded generic pharmaceuticals, medical devices, diagnostics, and nutrition products. The company's in-vitro diagnostics business performs immunoassays and blood screening. Its medical tests and diagnostic instrument systems are used worldwide by hospitals, laboratories, blood banks, and physician offices to diagnose and monitor diseases such as HIV, hepatitis, cancer, heart failure and metabolic disorders, as well as assess other indicators of health. In 1985, the company developed the first HIV blood-screening test.
Abbott Point-of-Care manufactures diagnostic products for blood analysis to provide health care professionals diagnostics information at the point of patient care. Abbott also provides point-of-care cardiac assays to the emergency room.

History[edit]





Dr. Wallace C. Abbott


In 1888 at the age of 30, Wallace Abbott (1857–1921), an 1885 graduate of the University of Michigan, founded the Abbott Alkaloidal Company. At the time, he was a practicing physician and owned a drug store. His innovation was the use of the active part of a medicinal plant, generally an alkaloid (morphine, quinine, strychnine and codeine), which he formed into tiny "dosimetric granules". This approach was successful since it produced more consistent and effective dosages for patients.[5]
Abbott's first international affiliate was in London in 1907, and the company later added an affiliate in Montreal, Canada (Fact 21). Abbott started operations in Pakistan as a marketing affiliate in 1948; the company has steadily expanded to comprise a work force of over 1500 employees. Currently two manufacturing facilities located at Landhi and Korangi in Karachi continue to produce pharmaceutical products.[6] Expansion continued in 1962 when Abbott entered into a joint venture with Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., of Osaka, Japan, to manufacture radio-pharmaceuticals. In 1964, it acquired Ross Laboratories, making Ross a wholly owned subsidiary of Abbott. In 1965, Abbott's expansion in Europe continued with offices in Italy and France. Abbott Laboratories has been present in India for over 100 years through its subsidiary Abbott India Limited and it is currently India's largest healthcare products company.[7]
According to Harvard professor Lester Grinspoon and Peter Hedblom, "In 1966 Abbott Laboratories sold the equivalent of two million doses of methamphetamine in powder form to a Long Island criminal dealer".[8]
In 2001, the company acquired Knoll, the pharmaceutical division of BASF. In 2002, it divested the Selsun Blue brand to Chattem. Later in 2002, the company sold Clear Eyes and Murine to Prestige Brands.[citation needed] In 2004, it spun off its hospital products division into a new 14,000 employee company named Hospira, and acquired TheraSense, a diabetes-care company, which it merged with its MediSense division to become Abbott Diabetes Care. In 2006, Abbott assisted Boston Scientific in its purchase of Guidant Corporation. As part of the agreement, Abbott purchased the vascular device division of Guidant. In 2007, Ross was renamed Abbott Nutrition.
In 2007, Abbott acquired Kos Pharmaceuticals for $3.7 billion in cash.[citation needed] At the time of acquisition, Kos marketed Niaspan, which raises levels of “good,” or HDL, cholesterol and Advicor, a Niaspan combination drug for patients with multiple lipid disorders.
In January 2007, the company agreed to sell its in vitro diagnostics and Point-of-Care diagnostics divisions to General Electric for more than $8 billion. These units were slated to be integrated into the GE Healthcare business unit. The transaction was approved by the boards of directors of Abbott and GE and was targeted to close in the first half of 2007. However, on July 11, 2007, Abbott announced that it had terminated its agreement with GE because the parties could not agree on the terms of the deal.[9]
On September 8, 2007, the company completed the sale of the UK manufacturing plant at Queenborough to Aesica Pharmaceuticals, a private equity-owned UK manufacturer. No announcements have been made restricting the movement of staff to Abbott unlike other sell outs. On February 26, 2009, the company completed its acquisition of Advanced Medical Optics based in Santa Ana, California. In 2009, Abbott opened a satellite research and development facility at Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.[citation needed]
In February 2010, Abbott completed its $6.2 billion (EUR 4.5 billion) acquisition of the pharmaceuticals unit of Solvay S.A..[10] This provided Abbott with a large and complementary portfolio of pharmaceutical products and also expanding its presence in key emerging markets.[11]
On March 22, 2010, the company completed its acquisition of a Hollywood, Florida-based LIMS company STARLIMS. Under the terms of the deal, Abbott Laboratories acquired the company for $14 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $123 million.[12] On May 21, 2010, Abbott Laboratories said it would buy Piramal Healthcare Ltd.'s Healthcare Solutions unit for $2.2[13] billion to become the biggest drug company in India.[14]
In October 2011, the company announced that it planned to separate into two companies, one research-based pharmaceuticals and the other in medical devices, generic drugs sold internationally, and consumer products, with device company retaining the Abbott name.[15][16] The company announced that the other company would be named AbbVie in March 2012.[17] In preparation for the reorganization, Abbott made severe budget cuts and took a $478 million charge in Q3-2012 to pay for the restructuring.[18] The separation was effective as of January 1, 2013. AbbVie was officially listed in the New York Stock Exchange on January 2, 2013.[19]
On May 16, 2014, it was announced that Abbott would acquire the holding company Kalo Pharma Internacional S.L. for $2.9 billion in order to secure the 73% it held of Chilean pharmaceutical company, CFR Pharmaceuticals, which the company said would more than double its branded generic drug portfolio.[20][21][22]
In June 2014, the company entered into a definitive agreement to take over Russian pharmaceutical manufacturer Veropharm (Voronezh) in a deal worth $631 million.[20] Abbott, which already employs 1,400 people in Russia, said it planned to set up a manufacturing presence in the country when the deal closed.[23]
In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire Alere for $5.8 billion.[24][25] In late April, of the same year, Abbott announced it would acquire St. Jude Medical for $25 billion (each share receiving $46.75 in cash & 0.8708 shares of Abbott common stock, equating to an approximate value of $85).[20][26][27]

Organization[edit]




Abbott office


Abbott's core businesses focus on pharmaceuticals, medical devices and nutritional products, which have been supplemented through acquisitions. As of 2016[update], the firm's divisions are:

Diabetes Care:[20] Glucose monitoring devices
Diagnostics:[20] Hematology, immunodiagnostic, oncology and clinical chemistry (including the i-Stat)
Endovascular[20]
Established Pharmaceuticals (EPD):[20] Branded generic drugs sold exclusively in developing markets.
Medical Devices[20]
Medical Optics[20]
Nutrition:[20] baby nutrition (e.g., Similac, Isomil, and Gain), adult health products (e.g., Ensure and ZonePerfect) and special dietary needs (e.g., Glucerna and Juven)

Management structure[edit]
Miles D. White is Chairman and (CEO).[18] He joined Abbott in 1984, serving in management positions including senior vice president of diagnostic operations and executive vice president. He was elected to the Board of Directors in April 1998, to Chief Executive Officer in 1998, and to Chairman of the Board in April 1999.[citation needed]
Management practices[edit]
Along with being ranked 134th on the 2015 Fortune 500 list of largest U.S.-based corporation,[citation needed] Abbott was named one of the 2014 Top 20 Employers by the journal Science and listed as a Top 10 company for women by Working Mother magazine and the National Association for Female Executives.[citation needed] The company has also been named one of the World's Most Admired Companies by Fortune magazine every year since 1984 – ranking No. 1 in medical equipment in 2014 and 2015.[citation needed] Abbott has also been recognized for 11 consecutive years for sustainability leadership through its inclusion on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI).[citation needed] The Top Employers Institute designated Abbott as a great place to work in Europe and China in 2014.[citation needed] DiversityInc magazine has recognized Abbott repeatedly as a Top 50 company for diversity; and, additionally, the Dave Thomas Foundation ranked the company as a best company thanks to its generous adoption benefits.[citation needed]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Abbott Laboratories shares are mainly held by institutional investors (The Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street Corporation and others).[31]
Litigation[edit]
Humira[edit]
In March 2003, British company Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT) stated its wish to "initiate discussions regarding the applicability of the royalty offset provisions for Humira" (Adalimumab) with Abbott Laboratories in the High Court of London. In December 2004, the judgment ruled for CAT.[32]
Abbott was required to pay CAT US$255 million, some of which was to be passed to its partners in development. Of this sum, the Medical Research Council (United Kingdom) (MRC) received US$191M, and in addition, Abbott was asked to pay the MRC a further US$7.5M over five years from 2006, providing that Humira remains on the market.[citation needed]
Depakote[edit]
On October 2, 2012, the company was charged with a $500 million fine and $198.5 million forfeiture for illegal marketing, and in a plea agreement was assessed the second-largest criminal fine in U.S. history for a drug company. U.S. District Court Judge Samuel G Wilson of the Western District of Virginia imposed it given Abbott's guilty plea related to its unlawful promotion of Depakote for uses not approved by the FDA. Abbott had advertised Depakote to be used to control behavioral disturbances for patients with dementia and schizophrenia, without FDA approval. In addition, Abbott marketed Depakote for other psychiatric conditions in adults, including depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol and drug withdrawal and psychiatric conditions in children, including conduct disorders, attention deficit disorder and autism. The court also ordered Abbott to a five-year term of probation and court supervision.[33] Shareholders then brought derivative suits against the company directors for breach of fiduciary duty[34] The parties reached a negotiated settlement in which Abbott agreed to beef up its internal controls and paid the plaintiffs' attorney fees.[35]
Sponsorship[edit]
Since 2015 Abbott is the title sponsor of the World Marathon Majors.[36]

Abbott Laboratories is an American[2] worldwide health care company. It has 74,000 employees and operates in more than 150 countries.[3][4] The company headquarters are in Lake Bluff, Illinois. The company was founded by Chicago physician Wallace Calvin Abbott in 1888 to formulate known drugs; it eventually grew to also sell research-based drugs, medical devices, diagnostics, and nutritional products. It split off the research-based pharmaceuticals into Abbvie in 2013. In 2015, revenues were $20.4 billion.
Abbott has a broad range of branded generic pharmaceuticals, medical devices, diagnostics, and nutrition products. The company's in-vitro diagnostics business performs immunoassays and blood screening. Its medical tests and diagnostic instrument systems are used worldwide by hospitals, laboratories, blood banks, and physician offices to diagnose and monitor diseases such as HIV, hepatitis, cancer, heart failure and metabolic disorders, as well as assess other indicators of health. In 1985, the company developed the first HIV blood-screening test.
Abbott Point-of-Care manufactures diagnostic products for blood analysis to provide health care professionals diagnostics information at the point of patient care. Abbott also provides point-of-care cardiac assays to the emergency room.

History[edit]





Dr. Wallace C. Abbott


In 1888 at the age of 30, Wallace Abbott (1857–1921), an 1885 graduate of the University of Michigan, founded the Abbott Alkaloidal Company. At the time, he was a practicing physician and owned a drug store. His innovation was the use of the active part of a medicinal plant, generally an alkaloid (morphine, quinine, strychnine and codeine), which he formed into tiny "dosimetric granules". This approach was successful since it produced more consistent and effective dosages for patients.[5]
Abbott's first international affiliate was in London in 1907, and the company later added an affiliate in Montreal, Canada (Fact 21). Abbott started operations in Pakistan as a marketing affiliate in 1948; the company has steadily expanded to comprise a work force of over 1500 employees. Currently two manufacturing facilities located at Landhi and Korangi in Karachi continue to produce pharmaceutical products.[6] Expansion continued in 1962 when Abbott entered into a joint venture with Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., of Osaka, Japan, to manufacture radio-pharmaceuticals. In 1964, it acquired Ross Laboratories, making Ross a wholly owned subsidiary of Abbott. In 1965, Abbott's expansion in Europe continued with offices in Italy and France. Abbott Laboratories has been present in India for over 100 years through its subsidiary Abbott India Limited and it is currently India's largest healthcare products company.[7]
According to Harvard professor Lester Grinspoon and Peter Hedblom, "In 1966 Abbott Laboratories sold the equivalent of two million doses of methamphetamine in powder form to a Long Island criminal dealer".[8]
In 2001, the company acquired Knoll, the pharmaceutical division of BASF. In 2002, it divested the Selsun Blue brand to Chattem. Later in 2002, the company sold Clear Eyes and Murine to Prestige Brands.[citation needed] In 2004, it spun off its hospital products division into a new 14,000 employee company named Hospira, and acquired TheraSense, a diabetes-care company, which it merged with its MediSense division to become Abbott Diabetes Care. In 2006, Abbott assisted Boston Scientific in its purchase of Guidant Corporation. As part of the agreement, Abbott purchased the vascular device division of Guidant. In 2007, Ross was renamed Abbott Nutrition.
In 2007, Abbott acquired Kos Pharmaceuticals for $3.7 billion in cash.[citation needed] At the time of acquisition, Kos marketed Niaspan, which raises levels of “good,” or HDL, cholesterol and Advicor, a Niaspan combination drug for patients with multiple lipid disorders.
In January 2007, the company agreed to sell its in vitro diagnostics and Point-of-Care diagnostics divisions to General Electric for more than $8 billion. These units were slated to be integrated into the GE Healthcare business unit. The transaction was approved by the boards of directors of Abbott and GE and was targeted to close in the first half of 2007. However, on July 11, 2007, Abbott announced that it had terminated its agreement with GE because the parties could not agree on the terms of the deal.[9]
On September 8, 2007, the company completed the sale of the UK manufacturing plant at Queenborough to Aesica Pharmaceuticals, a private equity-owned UK manufacturer. No announcements have been made restricting the movement of staff to Abbott unlike other sell outs. On February 26, 2009, the company completed its acquisition of Advanced Medical Optics based in Santa Ana, California. In 2009, Abbott opened a satellite research and development facility at Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.[citation needed]
In February 2010, Abbott completed its $6.2 billion (EUR 4.5 billion) acquisition of the pharmaceuticals unit of Solvay S.A..[10] This provided Abbott with a large and complementary portfolio of pharmaceutical products and also expanding its presence in key emerging markets.[11]
On March 22, 2010, the company completed its acquisition of a Hollywood, Florida-based LIMS company STARLIMS. Under the terms of the deal, Abbott Laboratories acquired the company for $14 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $123 million.[12] On May 21, 2010, Abbott Laboratories said it would buy Piramal Healthcare Ltd.'s Healthcare Solutions unit for $2.2[13] billion to become the biggest drug company in India.[14]
In October 2011, the company announced that it planned to separate into two companies, one research-based pharmaceuticals and the other in medical devices, generic drugs sold internationally, and consumer products, with device company retaining the Abbott name.[15][16] The company announced that the other company would be named AbbVie in March 2012.[17] In preparation for the reorganization, Abbott made severe budget cuts and took a $478 million charge in Q3-2012 to pay for the restructuring.[18] The separation was effective as of January 1, 2013. AbbVie was officially listed in the New York Stock Exchange on January 2, 2013.[19]
On May 16, 2014, it was announced that Abbott would acquire the holding company Kalo Pharma Internacional S.L. for $2.9 billion in order to secure the 73% it held of Chilean pharmaceutical company, CFR Pharmaceuticals, which the company said would more than double its branded generic drug portfolio.[20][21][22]
In June 2014, the company entered into a definitive agreement to take over Russian pharmaceutical manufacturer Veropharm (Voronezh) in a deal worth $631 million.[20] Abbott, which already employs 1,400 people in Russia, said it planned to set up a manufacturing presence in the country when the deal closed.[23]
In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire Alere for $5.8 billion.[24][25] In late April, of the same year, Abbott announced it would acquire St. Jude Medical for $25 billion (each share receiving $46.75 in cash & 0.8708 shares of Abbott common stock, equating to an approximate value of $85).[20][26][27]

Organization[edit]




Abbott office


Abbott's core businesses focus on pharmaceuticals, medical devices and nutritional products, which have been supplemented through acquisitions. As of 2016[update], the firm's divisions are:

Diabetes Care:[20] Glucose monitoring devices
Diagnostics:[20] Hematology, immunodiagnostic, oncology and clinical chemistry (including the i-Stat)
Endovascular[20]
Established Pharmaceuticals (EPD):[20] Branded generic drugs sold exclusively in developing markets.
Medical Devices[20]
Medical Optics[20]
Nutrition:[20] baby nutrition (e.g., Similac, Isomil, and Gain), adult health products (e.g., Ensure and ZonePerfect) and special dietary needs (e.g., Glucerna and Juven)

Management structure[edit]
Miles D. White is Chairman and (CEO).[18] He joined Abbott in 1984, serving in management positions including senior vice president of diagnostic operations and executive vice president. He was elected to the Board of Directors in April 1998, to Chief Executive Officer in 1998, and to Chairman of the Board in April 1999.[citation needed]
Management practices[edit]
Along with being ranked 134th on the 2015 Fortune 500 list of largest U.S.-based corporation,[citation needed] Abbott was named one of the 2014 Top 20 Employers by the journal Science and listed as a Top 10 company for women by Working Mother magazine and the National Association for Female Executives.[citation needed] The company has also been named one of the World's Most Admired Companies by Fortune magazine every year since 1984 – ranking No. 1 in medical equipment in 2014 and 2015.[citation needed] Abbott has also been recognized for 11 consecutive years for sustainability leadership through its inclusion on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI).[citation needed] The Top Employers Institute designated Abbott as a great place to work in Europe and China in 2014.[citation needed] DiversityInc magazine has recognized Abbott repeatedly as a Top 50 company for diversity; and, additionally, the Dave Thomas Foundation ranked the company as a best company thanks to its generous adoption benefits.[citation needed]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Abbott Laboratories shares are mainly held by institutional investors (The Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street Corporation and others).[31]
Litigation[edit]
Humira[edit]
In March 2003, British company Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT) stated its wish to "initiate discussions regarding the applicability of the royalty offset provisions for Humira" (Adalimumab) with Abbott Laboratories in the High Court of London. In December 2004, the judgment ruled for CAT.[32]
Abbott was required to pay CAT US$255 million, some of which was to be passed to its partners in development. Of this sum, the Medical Research Council (United Kingdom) (MRC) received US$191M, and in addition, Abbott was asked to pay the MRC a further US$7.5M over five years from 2006, providing that Humira remains on the market.[citation needed]
Depakote[edit]
On October 2, 2012, the company was charged with a $500 million fine and $198.5 million forfeiture for illegal marketing, and in a plea agreement was assessed the second-largest criminal fine in U.S. history for a drug company. U.S. District Court Judge Samuel G Wilson of the Western District of Virginia imposed it given Abbott's guilty plea related to its unlawful promotion of Depakote for uses not approved by the FDA. Abbott had advertised Depakote to be used to control behavioral disturbances for patients with dementia and schizophrenia, without FDA approval. In addition, Abbott marketed Depakote for other psychiatric conditions in adults, including depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol and drug withdrawal and psychiatric conditions in children, including conduct disorders, attention deficit disorder and autism. The court also ordered Abbott to a five-year term of probation and court supervision.[33] Shareholders then brought derivative suits against the company directors for breach of fiduciary duty[34] The parties reached a negotiated settlement in which Abbott agreed to beef up its internal controls and paid the plaintiffs' attorney fees.[35]
Sponsorship[edit]
Since 2015 Abbott is the title sponsor of the World Marathon Majors.[36]

Abbott Laboratories is an American[2] worldwide health care company. It has 74,000 employees and operates in more than 150 countries.[3][4] The company headquarters are in Lake Bluff, Illinois. The company was founded by Chicago physician Wallace Calvin Abbott in 1888 to formulate known drugs; it eventually grew to also sell research-based drugs, medical devices, diagnostics, and nutritional products. It split off the research-based pharmaceuticals into Abbvie in 2013. In 2015, revenues were $20.4 billion.
Abbott has a broad range of branded generic pharmaceuticals, medical devices, diagnostics, and nutrition products. The company's in-vitro diagnostics business performs immunoassays and blood screening. Its medical tests and diagnostic instrument systems are used worldwide by hospitals, laboratories, blood banks, and physician offices to diagnose and monitor diseases such as HIV, hepatitis, cancer, heart failure and metabolic disorders, as well as assess other indicators of health. In 1985, the company developed the first HIV blood-screening test.
Abbott Point-of-Care manufactures diagnostic products for blood analysis to provide health care professionals diagnostics information at the point of patient care. Abbott also provides point-of-care cardiac assays to the emergency room.

History[edit]





Dr. Wallace C. Abbott


In 1888 at the age of 30, Wallace Abbott (1857–1921), an 1885 graduate of the University of Michigan, founded the Abbott Alkaloidal Company. At the time, he was a practicing physician and owned a drug store. His innovation was the use of the active part of a medicinal plant, generally an alkaloid (morphine, quinine, strychnine and codeine), which he formed into tiny "dosimetric granules". This approach was successful since it produced more consistent and effective dosages for patients.[5]
Abbott's first international affiliate was in London in 1907, and the company later added an affiliate in Montreal, Canada (Fact 21). Abbott started operations in Pakistan as a marketing affiliate in 1948; the company has steadily expanded to comprise a work force of over 1500 employees. Currently two manufacturing facilities located at Landhi and Korangi in Karachi continue to produce pharmaceutical products.[6] Expansion continued in 1962 when Abbott entered into a joint venture with Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., of Osaka, Japan, to manufacture radio-pharmaceuticals. In 1964, it acquired Ross Laboratories, making Ross a wholly owned subsidiary of Abbott. In 1965, Abbott's expansion in Europe continued with offices in Italy and France. Abbott Laboratories has been present in India for over 100 years through its subsidiary Abbott India Limited and it is currently India's largest healthcare products company.[7]
According to Harvard professor Lester Grinspoon and Peter Hedblom, "In 1966 Abbott Laboratories sold the equivalent of two million doses of methamphetamine in powder form to a Long Island criminal dealer".[8]
In 2001, the company acquired Knoll, the pharmaceutical division of BASF. In 2002, it divested the Selsun Blue brand to Chattem. Later in 2002, the company sold Clear Eyes and Murine to Prestige Brands.[citation needed] In 2004, it spun off its hospital products division into a new 14,000 employee company named Hospira, and acquired TheraSense, a diabetes-care company, which it merged with its MediSense division to become Abbott Diabetes Care. In 2006, Abbott assisted Boston Scientific in its purchase of Guidant Corporation. As part of the agreement, Abbott purchased the vascular device division of Guidant. In 2007, Ross was renamed Abbott Nutrition.
In 2007, Abbott acquired Kos Pharmaceuticals for $3.7 billion in cash.[citation needed] At the time of acquisition, Kos marketed Niaspan, which raises levels of “good,” or HDL, cholesterol and Advicor, a Niaspan combination drug for patients with multiple lipid disorders.
In January 2007, the company agreed to sell its in vitro diagnostics and Point-of-Care diagnostics divisions to General Electric for more than $8 billion. These units were slated to be integrated into the GE Healthcare business unit. The transaction was approved by the boards of directors of Abbott and GE and was targeted to close in the first half of 2007. However, on July 11, 2007, Abbott announced that it had terminated its agreement with GE because the parties could not agree on the terms of the deal.[9]
On September 8, 2007, the company completed the sale of the UK manufacturing plant at Queenborough to Aesica Pharmaceuticals, a private equity-owned UK manufacturer. No announcements have been made restricting the movement of staff to Abbott unlike other sell outs. On February 26, 2009, the company completed its acquisition of Advanced Medical Optics based in Santa Ana, California. In 2009, Abbott opened a satellite research and development facility at Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.[citation needed]
In February 2010, Abbott completed its $6.2 billion (EUR 4.5 billion) acquisition of the pharmaceuticals unit of Solvay S.A..[10] This provided Abbott with a large and complementary portfolio of pharmaceutical products and also expanding its presence in key emerging markets.[11]
On March 22, 2010, the company completed its acquisition of a Hollywood, Florida-based LIMS company STARLIMS. Under the terms of the deal, Abbott Laboratories acquired the company for $14 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $123 million.[12] On May 21, 2010, Abbott Laboratories said it would buy Piramal Healthcare Ltd.'s Healthcare Solutions unit for $2.2[13] billion to become the biggest drug company in India.[14]
In October 2011, the company announced that it planned to separate into two companies, one research-based pharmaceuticals and the other in medical devices, generic drugs sold internationally, and consumer products, with device company retaining the Abbott name.[15][16] The company announced that the other company would be named AbbVie in March 2012.[17] In preparation for the reorganization, Abbott made severe budget cuts and took a $478 million charge in Q3-2012 to pay for the restructuring.[18] The separation was effective as of January 1, 2013. AbbVie was officially listed in the New York Stock Exchange on January 2, 2013.[19]
On May 16, 2014, it was announced that Abbott would acquire the holding company Kalo Pharma Internacional S.L. for $2.9 billion in order to secure the 73% it held of Chilean pharmaceutical company, CFR Pharmaceuticals, which the company said would more than double its branded generic drug portfolio.[20][21][22]
In June 2014, the company entered into a definitive agreement to take over Russian pharmaceutical manufacturer Veropharm (Voronezh) in a deal worth $631 million.[20] Abbott, which already employs 1,400 people in Russia, said it planned to set up a manufacturing presence in the country when the deal closed.[23]
In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire Alere for $5.8 billion.[24][25] In late April, of the same year, Abbott announced it would acquire St. Jude Medical for $25 billion (each share receiving $46.75 in cash & 0.8708 shares of Abbott common stock, equating to an approximate value of $85).[20][26][27]

Organization[edit]




Abbott office


Abbott's core businesses focus on pharmaceuticals, medical devices and nutritional products, which have been supplemented through acquisitions. As of 2016[update], the firm's divisions are:

Diabetes Care:[20] Glucose monitoring devices
Diagnostics:[20] Hematology, immunodiagnostic, oncology and clinical chemistry (including the i-Stat)
Endovascular[20]
Established Pharmaceuticals (EPD):[20] Branded generic drugs sold exclusively in developing markets.
Medical Devices[20]
Medical Optics[20]
Nutrition:[20] baby nutrition (e.g., Similac, Isomil, and Gain), adult health products (e.g., Ensure and ZonePerfect) and special dietary needs (e.g., Glucerna and Juven)

Management structure[edit]
Miles D. White is Chairman and (CEO).[18] He joined Abbott in 1984, serving in management positions including senior vice president of diagnostic operations and executive vice president. He was elected to the Board of Directors in April 1998, to Chief Executive Officer in 1998, and to Chairman of the Board in April 1999.[citation needed]
Management practices[edit]
Along with being ranked 134th on the 2015 Fortune 500 list of largest U.S.-based corporation,[citation needed] Abbott was named one of the 2014 Top 20 Employers by the journal Science and listed as a Top 10 company for women by Working Mother magazine and the National Association for Female Executives.[citation needed] The company has also been named one of the World's Most Admired Companies by Fortune magazine every year since 1984 – ranking No. 1 in medical equipment in 2014 and 2015.[citation needed] Abbott has also been recognized for 11 consecutive years for sustainability leadership through its inclusion on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI).[citation needed] The Top Employers Institute designated Abbott as a great place to work in Europe and China in 2014.[citation needed] DiversityInc magazine has recognized Abbott repeatedly as a Top 50 company for diversity; and, additionally, the Dave Thomas Foundation ranked the company as a best company thanks to its generous adoption benefits.[citation needed]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Abbott Laboratories shares are mainly held by institutional investors (The Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street Corporation and others).[31]
Litigation[edit]
Humira[edit]
In March 2003, British company Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT) stated its wish to "initiate discussions regarding the applicability of the royalty offset provisions for Humira" (Adalimumab) with Abbott Laboratories in the High Court of London. In December 2004, the judgment ruled for CAT.[32]
Abbott was required to pay CAT US$255 million, some of which was to be passed to its partners in development. Of this sum, the Medical Research Council (United Kingdom) (MRC) received US$191M, and in addition, Abbott was asked to pay the MRC a further US$7.5M over five years from 2006, providing that Humira remains on the market.[citation needed]
Depakote[edit]
On October 2, 2012, the company was charged with a $500 million fine and $198.5 million forfeiture for illegal marketing, and in a plea agreement was assessed the second-largest criminal fine in U.S. history for a drug company. U.S. District Court Judge Samuel G Wilson of the Western District of Virginia imposed it given Abbott's guilty plea related to its unlawful promotion of Depakote for uses not approved by the FDA. Abbott had advertised Depakote to be used to control behavioral disturbances for patients with dementia and schizophrenia, without FDA approval. In addition, Abbott marketed Depakote for other psychiatric conditions in adults, including depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol and drug withdrawal and psychiatric conditions in children, including conduct disorders, attention deficit disorder and autism. The court also ordered Abbott to a five-year term of probation and court supervision.[33] Shareholders then brought derivative suits against the company directors for breach of fiduciary duty[34] The parties reached a negotiated settlement in which Abbott agreed to beef up its internal controls and paid the plaintiffs' attorney fees.[35]
Sponsorship[edit]
Since 2015 Abbott is the title sponsor of the World Marathon Majors.[36]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
