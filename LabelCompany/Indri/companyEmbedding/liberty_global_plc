History[edit]
Liberty Global Inc. was founded in 2005 when Liberty Media International, Inc. (LMI) and UnitedGlobalCom, Inc. (UGC) merged. LMI and UGC became subsidiaries of Liberty Global. The new entity had operations in 18 countries and networks over approximately 23 million homes, making it one of the largest broadband services companies in the world.[8][9]
Liberty acquired German company Unitymedia in November 2009 for $5.2 billion. Unitymedia was Liberty's first German acquisition and the largest private-equity exit in Europe in 2009.[10] In 2010, Liberty sold its stake in Jupiter Telecommunications, a Japanese telecommunications-services provider as Liberty shifted its resources back toward Europe.[11]
In January 2013, Liberty Global raised its stake in Belgium-based Telenet from 50.2% to 58%.[12] In June 2013, Liberty Global acquired British cable group Virgin Media for $24 billion in cash and stock.[13][14] The agreement expanded Liberty into Europe's largest cable market. The acquisition was ranked as one of the 10 largest cable deals of all time.[15] Liberty agreed on October 28 to sell Chellomedia for $1.035 billion except for its Benelux unit to AMC Networks.[12] It was reported that this acquisition would make Liberty Global the largest broadband company in the world.[4]
Liberty Global announced it would be acquiring Dutch cable company Ziggo for €10 billion in January 2014. The acquisition was completed in November 2014, when the services of UPC Nederland began to be merged into the new business.[16] Liberty Global and Discovery Communications became joint owners of All3Media in May 2014 in a £500 million joint deal.[17][18][19] In July 2014, Liberty Global acquired a 6.4% stake in ITV plc, valued at £481 million.[20] Liberty's stake in the company increased to 9.9% in July 2015.[21][22]
In November 2015, Liberty Global announced its acquisition of Cable & Wireless Communications. The $5.3 billion deal expanded Liberty Global's presence into the Caribbean & greater Latin America.[23][24][25] The acquisition was completed in May 2016.[1] In 2015, Liberty established the stock Liberty Latin American & Caribbean (LiLAC) focusing on Panama and the Caribbean with assets in Chile and Puerto Rico. Liberty Global is also owner of Cable & Wireless Communications' Seychelles business (named Cable and Wireless Seychelles), a vestige of CWC's once expansive portfolio which once included businesses in Macau, Monaco (Monaco Telecom), Jersey, Isle of Man, Guernsey, St. Helena, Ascension Island, Falkland Islands and Diego Garcia (under the brand Sure, sold to Batelco). The company also currently owns a 49% stake in majority state-owned Trinidadian telco, TSTT (which it has been obliged to dispose of) which competes with their wholly owned subsidiary, FLOW Trinidad.[26][27] Liberty Global paid approximately $195 million for a 3.4% stake in Lions Gate Entertainment Group in November 2015. Liberty CEO Mike Fries joined the Lion's Gate board of directors as part of the acquisition.[28][29][30] Liberty invested £7.5million in global broadband cable network Technetix in July 2016.[31][32] In November 2016, Liberty Global's Virgin Media subsidiary released its Netflix and other app-enabled set-top V6 box.[33]
Merger with Vodafone in the Netherlands[edit]
In June 2015, Vodafone confirmed talks with Liberty Global focused on potential partnerships, but denied that a full merger was in the works.[34][35][36] Liberty Global invested in Guavus, a data analytics company, in September 2015.[37] In February 2016, it was announced that Vodafone and Liberty Global would merge Dutch operations. Liberty's Dutch subsidiary, Ziggo, would work with Vodafone's mobile network.[38][39] Vodafone paid Liberty €1 billion as part of the joint venture valued at €3.5 billion.[40][41] The deal was approved by the European Commission in August 2016.[42] On December 31, 2016, the proposed merger of Liberty Global's and Vodafone Group's Dutch operations was completed, resulting in a joint venture called VodafoneZiggo Group Holding B.V.[43]
Horizon TV[edit]
Horizon TV is Liberty Global's flagship platform with more than 10 million first-generation Horizon TV devices sold.
Liberty Global launched Horizon TV, a box to stream to TVs, in 2012.[44] H2, an upgraded version of the Horizon box, was launched in 2013. The new system included an upgraded remote control with a QWERTY keyboard. A secondary box connects wirelessly to the main device allowing TV, DVR and VoD streaming to multiple rooms in a subscriber's house.[45] Liberty partnered with ActiveVideo in 2013 to include ActiveVideo's CloudTV on the Horizon boxes.[46] Twitter was integrated into Horizon's mobile app library in 2016. The addition allowed live tweets to be overlaid onto the screen of a program being broadcast.[47][48] Also in 2016, Horizon TV was launched in Austria, making it available in all three German-speaking countries that Liberty Global operates in.[49]

History[edit]
Liberty Global Inc. was founded in 2005 when Liberty Media International, Inc. (LMI) and UnitedGlobalCom, Inc. (UGC) merged. LMI and UGC became subsidiaries of Liberty Global. The new entity had operations in 18 countries and networks over approximately 23 million homes, making it one of the largest broadband services companies in the world.[8][9]
Liberty acquired German company Unitymedia in November 2009 for $5.2 billion. Unitymedia was Liberty's first German acquisition and the largest private-equity exit in Europe in 2009.[10] In 2010, Liberty sold its stake in Jupiter Telecommunications, a Japanese telecommunications-services provider as Liberty shifted its resources back toward Europe.[11]
In January 2013, Liberty Global raised its stake in Belgium-based Telenet from 50.2% to 58%.[12] In June 2013, Liberty Global acquired British cable group Virgin Media for $24 billion in cash and stock.[13][14] The agreement expanded Liberty into Europe's largest cable market. The acquisition was ranked as one of the 10 largest cable deals of all time.[15] Liberty agreed on October 28 to sell Chellomedia for $1.035 billion except for its Benelux unit to AMC Networks.[12] It was reported that this acquisition would make Liberty Global the largest broadband company in the world.[4]
Liberty Global announced it would be acquiring Dutch cable company Ziggo for €10 billion in January 2014. The acquisition was completed in November 2014, when the services of UPC Nederland began to be merged into the new business.[16] Liberty Global and Discovery Communications became joint owners of All3Media in May 2014 in a £500 million joint deal.[17][18][19] In July 2014, Liberty Global acquired a 6.4% stake in ITV plc, valued at £481 million.[20] Liberty's stake in the company increased to 9.9% in July 2015.[21][22]
In November 2015, Liberty Global announced its acquisition of Cable & Wireless Communications. The $5.3 billion deal expanded Liberty Global's presence into the Caribbean & greater Latin America.[23][24][25] The acquisition was completed in May 2016.[1] In 2015, Liberty established the stock Liberty Latin American & Caribbean (LiLAC) focusing on Panama and the Caribbean with assets in Chile and Puerto Rico. Liberty Global is also owner of Cable & Wireless Communications' Seychelles business (named Cable and Wireless Seychelles), a vestige of CWC's once expansive portfolio which once included businesses in Macau, Monaco (Monaco Telecom), Jersey, Isle of Man, Guernsey, St. Helena, Ascension Island, Falkland Islands and Diego Garcia (under the brand Sure, sold to Batelco). The company also currently owns a 49% stake in majority state-owned Trinidadian telco, TSTT (which it has been obliged to dispose of) which competes with their wholly owned subsidiary, FLOW Trinidad.[26][27] Liberty Global paid approximately $195 million for a 3.4% stake in Lions Gate Entertainment Group in November 2015. Liberty CEO Mike Fries joined the Lion's Gate board of directors as part of the acquisition.[28][29][30] Liberty invested £7.5million in global broadband cable network Technetix in July 2016.[31][32] In November 2016, Liberty Global's Virgin Media subsidiary released its Netflix and other app-enabled set-top V6 box.[33]
Merger with Vodafone in the Netherlands[edit]
In June 2015, Vodafone confirmed talks with Liberty Global focused on potential partnerships, but denied that a full merger was in the works.[34][35][36] Liberty Global invested in Guavus, a data analytics company, in September 2015.[37] In February 2016, it was announced that Vodafone and Liberty Global would merge Dutch operations. Liberty's Dutch subsidiary, Ziggo, would work with Vodafone's mobile network.[38][39] Vodafone paid Liberty €1 billion as part of the joint venture valued at €3.5 billion.[40][41] The deal was approved by the European Commission in August 2016.[42] On December 31, 2016, the proposed merger of Liberty Global's and Vodafone Group's Dutch operations was completed, resulting in a joint venture called VodafoneZiggo Group Holding B.V.[43]
Horizon TV[edit]
Horizon TV is Liberty Global's flagship platform with more than 10 million first-generation Horizon TV devices sold.
Liberty Global launched Horizon TV, a box to stream to TVs, in 2012.[44] H2, an upgraded version of the Horizon box, was launched in 2013. The new system included an upgraded remote control with a QWERTY keyboard. A secondary box connects wirelessly to the main device allowing TV, DVR and VoD streaming to multiple rooms in a subscriber's house.[45] Liberty partnered with ActiveVideo in 2013 to include ActiveVideo's CloudTV on the Horizon boxes.[46] Twitter was integrated into Horizon's mobile app library in 2016. The addition allowed live tweets to be overlaid onto the screen of a program being broadcast.[47][48] Also in 2016, Horizon TV was launched in Austria, making it available in all three German-speaking countries that Liberty Global operates in.[49]

Liberty Global Inc. was founded in 2005 when Liberty Media International, Inc. (LMI) and UnitedGlobalCom, Inc. (UGC) merged. LMI and UGC became subsidiaries of Liberty Global. The new entity had operations in 18 countries and networks over approximately 23 million homes, making it one of the largest broadband services companies in the world.[8][9]
Liberty acquired German company Unitymedia in November 2009 for $5.2 billion. Unitymedia was Liberty's first German acquisition and the largest private-equity exit in Europe in 2009.[10] In 2010, Liberty sold its stake in Jupiter Telecommunications, a Japanese telecommunications-services provider as Liberty shifted its resources back toward Europe.[11]
In January 2013, Liberty Global raised its stake in Belgium-based Telenet from 50.2% to 58%.[12] In June 2013, Liberty Global acquired British cable group Virgin Media for $24 billion in cash and stock.[13][14] The agreement expanded Liberty into Europe's largest cable market. The acquisition was ranked as one of the 10 largest cable deals of all time.[15] Liberty agreed on October 28 to sell Chellomedia for $1.035 billion except for its Benelux unit to AMC Networks.[12] It was reported that this acquisition would make Liberty Global the largest broadband company in the world.[4]
Liberty Global announced it would be acquiring Dutch cable company Ziggo for €10 billion in January 2014.

History[edit]
Liberty Global Inc. was founded in 2005 when Liberty Media International, Inc. (LMI) and UnitedGlobalCom, Inc. (UGC) merged. LMI and UGC became subsidiaries of Liberty Global. The new entity had operations in 18 countries and networks over approximately 23 million homes, making it one of the largest broadband services companies in the world.[8][9]
Liberty acquired German company Unitymedia in November 2009 for $5.2 billion. Unitymedia was Liberty's first German acquisition and the largest private-equity exit in Europe in 2009.[10] In 2010, Liberty sold its stake in Jupiter Telecommunications, a Japanese telecommunications-services provider as Liberty shifted its resources back toward Europe.[11]
In January 2013, Liberty Global raised its stake in Belgium-based Telenet from 50.2% to 58%.[12] In June 2013, Liberty Global acquired British cable group Virgin Media for $24 billion in cash and stock.[13][14] The agreement expanded Liberty into Europe's largest cable market. The acquisition was ranked as one of the 10 largest cable deals of all time.[15] Liberty agreed on October 28 to sell Chellomedia for $1.035 billion except for its Benelux unit to AMC Networks.[12] It was reported that this acquisition would make Liberty Global the largest broadband company in the world.[4]
Liberty Global announced it would be acquiring Dutch cable company Ziggo for €10 billion in January 2014. The acquisition was completed in November 2014, when the services of UPC Nederland began to be merged into the new business.[16] Liberty Global and Discovery Communications became joint owners of All3Media in May 2014 in a £500 million joint deal.[17][18][19] In July 2014, Liberty Global acquired a 6.4% stake in ITV plc, valued at £481 million.[20] Liberty's stake in the company increased to 9.9% in July 2015.[21][22]
In November 2015, Liberty Global announced its acquisition of Cable & Wireless Communications. The $5.3 billion deal expanded Liberty Global's presence into the Caribbean & greater Latin America.[23][24][25] The acquisition was completed in May 2016.[1] In 2015, Liberty established the stock Liberty Latin American & Caribbean (LiLAC) focusing on Panama and the Caribbean with assets in Chile and Puerto Rico. Liberty Global is also owner of Cable & Wireless Communications' Seychelles business (named Cable and Wireless Seychelles), a vestige of CWC's once expansive portfolio which once included businesses in Macau, Monaco (Monaco Telecom), Jersey, Isle of Man, Guernsey, St. Helena, Ascension Island, Falkland Islands and Diego Garcia (under the brand Sure, sold to Batelco). The company also currently owns a 49% stake in majority state-owned Trinidadian telco, TSTT (which it has been obliged to dispose of) which competes with their wholly owned subsidiary, FLOW Trinidad.[26][27] Liberty Global paid approximately $195 million for a 3.4% stake in Lions Gate Entertainment Group in November 2015. Liberty CEO Mike Fries joined the Lion's Gate board of directors as part of the acquisition.[28][29][30] Liberty invested £7.5million in global broadband cable network Technetix in July 2016.[31][32] In November 2016, Liberty Global's Virgin Media subsidiary released its Netflix and other app-enabled set-top V6 box.[33]
Merger with Vodafone in the Netherlands[edit]
In June 2015, Vodafone confirmed talks with Liberty Global focused on potential partnerships, but denied that a full merger was in the works.[34][35][36] Liberty Global invested in Guavus, a data analytics company, in September 2015.[37] In February 2016, it was announced that Vodafone and Liberty Global would merge Dutch operations. Liberty's Dutch subsidiary, Ziggo, would work with Vodafone's mobile network.[38][39] Vodafone paid Liberty €1 billion as part of the joint venture valued at €3.5 billion.[40][41] The deal was approved by the European Commission in August 2016.[42] On December 31, 2016, the proposed merger of Liberty Global's and Vodafone Group's Dutch operations was completed, resulting in a joint venture called VodafoneZiggo Group Holding B.V.[43]
Horizon TV[edit]
Horizon TV is Liberty Global's flagship platform with more than 10 million first-generation Horizon TV devices sold.
Liberty Global launched Horizon TV, a box to stream to TVs, in 2012.[44] H2, an upgraded version of the Horizon box, was launched in 2013. The new system included an upgraded remote control with a QWERTY keyboard. A secondary box connects wirelessly to the main device allowing TV, DVR and VoD streaming to multiple rooms in a subscriber's house.[45] Liberty partnered with ActiveVideo in 2013 to include ActiveVideo's CloudTV on the Horizon boxes.[46] Twitter was integrated into Horizon's mobile app library in 2016. The addition allowed live tweets to be overlaid onto the screen of a program being broadcast.[47][48] Also in 2016, Horizon TV was launched in Austria, making it available in all three German-speaking countries that Liberty Global operates in.[49]

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

Liberty Global Hampered By Slow Start to 2017 in U.K.
New products Liberty Global is bringing to the market haven't taken hold yet, but the second half of the year should see a boost in growth.











                Travis Hoium
            

                (TMFFlushDraw)



            
            May 8, 2017 at 5:24PM
            
            





Liberty Global plc (NASDAQ:LBTYK) was expecting 2017 to be a big growth year as it consolidated its power in European telecommunications and brought new products to market. And that vision may still take place, it's just taking a little longer than planned.
First-quarter results released this week showed there are some signs of improvement, and 2017 should still be a growth year. But not every market was growing as quickly as planned, highlighted by the U.K.'s tepid growth in the quarter.

N/A



Data source: Liberty Global earnings release. Includes only European operations.
What happened with Liberty Global plc this quarter?
The results above look bad on the surface, but they're due more to accounting changes than to a deterioration in the business. Here's a look at some of the highlights to keep in mind from the quarter:

Most of the decline in revenue was driven by the deconsolidation of Liberty Global's joint venture in the Netherlands, VodafoneZiggo. Without this financial change, revenue was up 2% on a rebased basis.
Organic customer additions in Europe were 244,300, which included a loss of just 15,000 revenue-generating units on the video side. Mobile and broadband have seen consistent growth the last few years, but video has been where the entire industry has struggled.
Rebased revenue growth in the U.K. and Ireland, which accounted for 43% of total group revenue, grew 2% on a rebased basis. And rebased operating cash flow growth was just 1%.
Germany had rebased revenue growth of 6%, and a 5% increase in operating cash flow growth.
Management is targeting $2 billion in share buybacks by the end of 2017.






What management had to say
Management said conditions in the U.K. and Belgium were weaker than expected, causing the reduction in operating cash flow guidance from 6% to 7% to a new expectation of 5% for 2017. While this is a surprise reduction, management did say they expect second-half performance to improve as new products -- like a 4K set-top box and 4G quad-play offering -- hit the market.
Looking forward
A steady increase in the customer base is helping drive Liberty Global's results, and with 4K TV and more bundled offerings coming, there will be more opportunities for growth. Short-term, the reduction in operating cash flow guidance is a bit worrisome, but it sounds like it's more of a delay in expected growth than a fundamental flaw in the business model.
Liberty Global has the right set of products for the modern economy; with its customer base expanding, 2017 should be another solid year for shareholders, despite the small reduction in expected growth.

Liberty Global Plc Wraps the Year With a Strong Quarter
Fourth-quarter results were hurt by a strong dollar again, but there were some positive signs for Liberty Global Plc as well. 











                Travis Hoium
            

                (TMFFlushDraw)



            
            Feb 16, 2016 at 4:39PM
            
            





Liberty Global plc (NASDAQ:LBTYK) reported fourth-quarter earnings Monday and also announced a merger with Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD). The two companies will combine forces in the Netherlands to deliver a more well-rounded suite of products to customers there.
But before we get to that deal, let's go through the company's raw numbers.  
Liberty Global plc results: The raw numbers


 
Q4 2015 Actuals

Q4 2014 Actuals

Growth (YOY)





Sales


$4.60 billion


$4.62 billion


(0.3%)




Operating Income


$621.3 million

127.3%




Free Cash Flow

$809.8 million


2.1%




Data source: Company earnings release.
What happened with Liberty Global plc?






A total of 344,000 revenue generating units, or RGUs, were added in the fourth quarter. It was the best quarter in a year that saw 870,000 organic RGU additions.
If you adjust for currency, management said revenue was up 3% in 2015, operating cash flow grew 3.5%, and free cash flow was up 16%.  
Cash is being used at a rapid rate to buy back shares. In 2015, buybacks were $2.3 billion and management expects another $4.0 billion in buybacks by the end of 2017.
In the LiLAC Group, which includes operations in Chile and Puerto Rico, revenue grew 7% on a rebased basis to $1.22 billion and free cash flow jumped 25% to $87 million.
Interest on its debt reached a record low of 4.9%. This helps put strong leverage on the balance sheet and allows for acquisitions or share buybacks.
45% of customers subscribed to a triple-play product, 17% subscribed to a double-play product, and 38% subscribed to a single-play product. The company noted the opportunity to "up-sell" subscribers.

What management had to say Cable customers continue to slowly fade away, but broadband and mobile continue to improve for Liberty Global. Operations in Europe are also improving as the economy slowly picks up there and customers begin demanding faster broadband connections.
The 50/50 merger of Vodafone's mobile operations in the Netherlands with Ziggo's broadband network will also help drive the company's broader adoption in the country. This will make the "triple play" more compelling for consumers and repeats a strategy Liberty Global has been using across Europe and Latin America.  
The Dutch transaction likely won't close until the end of 2016, but look for it to be a potentially lucrative growth market for Liberty Global with 280 million euros of cost synergies already identified by the two companies.
Looking forward In many ways, the fourth quarter was the strongest of the year for Liberty Global, despite currency headwinds from a strong dollar. The strategy of investing in faster broadband and more "triple play" options for customers is paying off and that should continue in 2016.





The continued momentum in share repurchases should also help shareholders over the next couple of years. Liberty Global isn't a company that chooses to pay dividends, so that's the best way the company can pay back shareholders and boost earnings per share in the future.

History[edit]
Liberty Global Inc. was founded in 2005 when Liberty Media International, Inc. (LMI) and UnitedGlobalCom, Inc. (UGC) merged. LMI and UGC became subsidiaries of Liberty Global. The new entity had operations in 18 countries and networks over approximately 23 million homes, making it one of the largest broadband services companies in the world.[8][9]
Liberty acquired German company Unitymedia in November 2009 for $5.2 billion. Unitymedia was Liberty's first German acquisition and the largest private-equity exit in Europe in 2009.[10] In 2010, Liberty sold its stake in Jupiter Telecommunications, a Japanese telecommunications-services provider as Liberty shifted its resources back toward Europe.[11]
In January 2013, Liberty Global raised its stake in Belgium-based Telenet from 50.2% to 58%.[12] In June 2013, Liberty Global acquired British cable group Virgin Media for $24 billion in cash and stock.[13][14] The agreement expanded Liberty into Europe's largest cable market. The acquisition was ranked as one of the 10 largest cable deals of all time.[15] Liberty agreed on October 28 to sell Chellomedia for $1.035 billion except for its Benelux unit to AMC Networks.[12] It was reported that this acquisition would make Liberty Global the largest broadband company in the world.[4]
Liberty Global announced it would be acquiring Dutch cable company Ziggo for €10 billion in January 2014. The acquisition was completed in November 2014, when the services of UPC Nederland began to be merged into the new business.[16] Liberty Global and Discovery Communications became joint owners of All3Media in May 2014 in a £500 million joint deal.[17][18][19] In July 2014, Liberty Global acquired a 6.4% stake in ITV plc, valued at £481 million.[20] Liberty's stake in the company increased to 9.9% in July 2015.[21][22]
In November 2015, Liberty Global announced its acquisition of Cable & Wireless Communications. The $5.3 billion deal expanded Liberty Global's presence into the Caribbean & greater Latin America.[23][24][25] The acquisition was completed in May 2016.[1] In 2015, Liberty established the stock Liberty Latin American & Caribbean (LiLAC) focusing on Panama and the Caribbean with assets in Chile and Puerto Rico. Liberty Global is also owner of Cable & Wireless Communications' Seychelles business (named Cable and Wireless Seychelles), a vestige of CWC's once expansive portfolio which once included businesses in Macau, Monaco (Monaco Telecom), Jersey, Isle of Man, Guernsey, St. Helena, Ascension Island, Falkland Islands and Diego Garcia (under the brand Sure, sold to Batelco). The company also currently owns a 49% stake in majority state-owned Trinidadian telco, TSTT (which it has been obliged to dispose of) which competes with their wholly owned subsidiary, FLOW Trinidad.[26][27] Liberty Global paid approximately $195 million for a 3.4% stake in Lions Gate Entertainment Group in November 2015. Liberty CEO Mike Fries joined the Lion's Gate board of directors as part of the acquisition.[28][29][30] Liberty invested £7.5million in global broadband cable network Technetix in July 2016.[31][32] In November 2016, Liberty Global's Virgin Media subsidiary released its Netflix and other app-enabled set-top V6 box.[33]
Merger with Vodafone in the Netherlands[edit]
In June 2015, Vodafone confirmed talks with Liberty Global focused on potential partnerships, but denied that a full merger was in the works.[34][35][36] Liberty Global invested in Guavus, a data analytics company, in September 2015.[37] In February 2016, it was announced that Vodafone and Liberty Global would merge Dutch operations. Liberty's Dutch subsidiary, Ziggo, would work with Vodafone's mobile network.[38][39] Vodafone paid Liberty €1 billion as part of the joint venture valued at €3.5 billion.[40][41] The deal was approved by the European Commission in August 2016.[42] On December 31, 2016, the proposed merger of Liberty Global's and Vodafone Group's Dutch operations was completed, resulting in a joint venture called VodafoneZiggo Group Holding B.V.[43]
Horizon TV[edit]
Horizon TV is Liberty Global's flagship platform with more than 10 million first-generation Horizon TV devices sold.
Liberty Global launched Horizon TV, a box to stream to TVs, in 2012.[44] H2, an upgraded version of the Horizon box, was launched in 2013. The new system included an upgraded remote control with a QWERTY keyboard. A secondary box connects wirelessly to the main device allowing TV, DVR and VoD streaming to multiple rooms in a subscriber's house.[45] Liberty partnered with ActiveVideo in 2013 to include ActiveVideo's CloudTV on the Horizon boxes.[46] Twitter was integrated into Horizon's mobile app library in 2016. The addition allowed live tweets to be overlaid onto the screen of a program being broadcast.[47][48] Also in 2016, Horizon TV was launched in Austria, making it available in all three German-speaking countries that Liberty Global operates in.[49]

History[edit]
Liberty Global Inc. was founded in 2005 when Liberty Media International, Inc. (LMI) and UnitedGlobalCom, Inc. (UGC) merged. LMI and UGC became subsidiaries of Liberty Global. The new entity had operations in 18 countries and networks over approximately 23 million homes, making it one of the largest broadband services companies in the world.[8][9]
Liberty acquired German company Unitymedia in November 2009 for $5.2 billion. Unitymedia was Liberty's first German acquisition and the largest private-equity exit in Europe in 2009.[10] In 2010, Liberty sold its stake in Jupiter Telecommunications, a Japanese telecommunications-services provider as Liberty shifted its resources back toward Europe.[11]
In January 2013, Liberty Global raised its stake in Belgium-based Telenet from 50.2% to 58%.[12] In June 2013, Liberty Global acquired British cable group Virgin Media for $24 billion in cash and stock.[13][14] The agreement expanded Liberty into Europe's largest cable market. The acquisition was ranked as one of the 10 largest cable deals of all time.[15] Liberty agreed on October 28 to sell Chellomedia for $1.035 billion except for its Benelux unit to AMC Networks.[12] It was reported that this acquisition would make Liberty Global the largest broadband company in the world.[4]
Liberty Global announced it would be acquiring Dutch cable company Ziggo for €10 billion in January 2014. The acquisition was completed in November 2014, when the services of UPC Nederland began to be merged into the new business.[16] Liberty Global and Discovery Communications became joint owners of All3Media in May 2014 in a £500 million joint deal.[17][18][19] In July 2014, Liberty Global acquired a 6.4% stake in ITV plc, valued at £481 million.[20] Liberty's stake in the company increased to 9.9% in July 2015.[21][22]
In November 2015, Liberty Global announced its acquisition of Cable & Wireless Communications. The $5.3 billion deal expanded Liberty Global's presence into the Caribbean & greater Latin America.[23][24][25] The acquisition was completed in May 2016.[1] In 2015, Liberty established the stock Liberty Latin American & Caribbean (LiLAC) focusing on Panama and the Caribbean with assets in Chile and Puerto Rico. Liberty Global is also owner of Cable & Wireless Communications' Seychelles business (named Cable and Wireless Seychelles), a vestige of CWC's once expansive portfolio which once included businesses in Macau, Monaco (Monaco Telecom), Jersey, Isle of Man, Guernsey, St. Helena, Ascension Island, Falkland Islands and Diego Garcia (under the brand Sure, sold to Batelco). The company also currently owns a 49% stake in majority state-owned Trinidadian telco, TSTT (which it has been obliged to dispose of) which competes with their wholly owned subsidiary, FLOW Trinidad.[26][27] Liberty Global paid approximately $195 million for a 3.4% stake in Lions Gate Entertainment Group in November 2015. Liberty CEO Mike Fries joined the Lion's Gate board of directors as part of the acquisition.[28][29][30] Liberty invested £7.5million in global broadband cable network Technetix in July 2016.[31][32] In November 2016, Liberty Global's Virgin Media subsidiary released its Netflix and other app-enabled set-top V6 box.[33]
Merger with Vodafone in the Netherlands[edit]
In June 2015, Vodafone confirmed talks with Liberty Global focused on potential partnerships, but denied that a full merger was in the works.[34][35][36] Liberty Global invested in Guavus, a data analytics company, in September 2015.[37] In February 2016, it was announced that Vodafone and Liberty Global would merge Dutch operations. Liberty's Dutch subsidiary, Ziggo, would work with Vodafone's mobile network.[38][39] Vodafone paid Liberty €1 billion as part of the joint venture valued at €3.5 billion.[40][41] The deal was approved by the European Commission in August 2016.[42] On December 31, 2016, the proposed merger of Liberty Global's and Vodafone Group's Dutch operations was completed, resulting in a joint venture called VodafoneZiggo Group Holding B.V.[43]
Horizon TV[edit]
Horizon TV is Liberty Global's flagship platform with more than 10 million first-generation Horizon TV devices sold.
Liberty Global launched Horizon TV, a box to stream to TVs, in 2012.[44] H2, an upgraded version of the Horizon box, was launched in 2013. The new system included an upgraded remote control with a QWERTY keyboard. A secondary box connects wirelessly to the main device allowing TV, DVR and VoD streaming to multiple rooms in a subscriber's house.[45] Liberty partnered with ActiveVideo in 2013 to include ActiveVideo's CloudTV on the Horizon boxes.[46] Twitter was integrated into Horizon's mobile app library in 2016. The addition allowed live tweets to be overlaid onto the screen of a program being broadcast.[47][48] Also in 2016, Horizon TV was launched in Austria, making it available in all three German-speaking countries that Liberty Global operates in.[49]

History[edit]
Liberty Global Inc. was founded in 2005 when Liberty Media International, Inc. (LMI) and UnitedGlobalCom, Inc. (UGC) merged. LMI and UGC became subsidiaries of Liberty Global. The new entity had operations in 18 countries and networks over approximately 23 million homes, making it one of the largest broadband services companies in the world.[8][9]
Liberty acquired German company Unitymedia in November 2009 for $5.2 billion. Unitymedia was Liberty's first German acquisition and the largest private-equity exit in Europe in 2009.[10] In 2010, Liberty sold its stake in Jupiter Telecommunications, a Japanese telecommunications-services provider as Liberty shifted its resources back toward Europe.[11]
In January 2013, Liberty Global raised its stake in Belgium-based Telenet from 50.2% to 58%.[12] In June 2013, Liberty Global acquired British cable group Virgin Media for $24 billion in cash and stock.[13][14] The agreement expanded Liberty into Europe's largest cable market. The acquisition was ranked as one of the 10 largest cable deals of all time.[15] Liberty agreed on October 28 to sell Chellomedia for $1.035 billion except for its Benelux unit to AMC Networks.[12] It was reported that this acquisition would make Liberty Global the largest broadband company in the world.[4]
Liberty Global announced it would be acquiring Dutch cable company Ziggo for €10 billion in January 2014. The acquisition was completed in November 2014, when the services of UPC Nederland began to be merged into the new business.[16] Liberty Global and Discovery Communications became joint owners of All3Media in May 2014 in a £500 million joint deal.[17][18][19] In July 2014, Liberty Global acquired a 6.4% stake in ITV plc, valued at £481 million.[20] Liberty's stake in the company increased to 9.9% in July 2015.[21][22]
In November 2015, Liberty Global announced its acquisition of Cable & Wireless Communications. The $5.3 billion deal expanded Liberty Global's presence into the Caribbean & greater Latin America.[23][24][25] The acquisition was completed in May 2016.[1] In 2015, Liberty established the stock Liberty Latin American & Caribbean (LiLAC) focusing on Panama and the Caribbean with assets in Chile and Puerto Rico. Liberty Global is also owner of Cable & Wireless Communications' Seychelles business (named Cable and Wireless Seychelles), a vestige of CWC's once expansive portfolio which once included businesses in Macau, Monaco (Monaco Telecom), Jersey, Isle of Man, Guernsey, St. Helena, Ascension Island, Falkland Islands and Diego Garcia (under the brand Sure, sold to Batelco). The company also currently owns a 49% stake in majority state-owned Trinidadian telco, TSTT (which it has been obliged to dispose of) which competes with their wholly owned subsidiary, FLOW Trinidad.[26][27] Liberty Global paid approximately $195 million for a 3.4% stake in Lions Gate Entertainment Group in November 2015. Liberty CEO Mike Fries joined the Lion's Gate board of directors as part of the acquisition.[28][29][30] Liberty invested £7.5million in global broadband cable network Technetix in July 2016.[31][32] In November 2016, Liberty Global's Virgin Media subsidiary released its Netflix and other app-enabled set-top V6 box.[33]
Merger with Vodafone in the Netherlands[edit]
In June 2015, Vodafone confirmed talks with Liberty Global focused on potential partnerships, but denied that a full merger was in the works.[34][35][36] Liberty Global invested in Guavus, a data analytics company, in September 2015.[37] In February 2016, it was announced that Vodafone and Liberty Global would merge Dutch operations. Liberty's Dutch subsidiary, Ziggo, would work with Vodafone's mobile network.[38][39] Vodafone paid Liberty €1 billion as part of the joint venture valued at €3.5 billion.[40][41] The deal was approved by the European Commission in August 2016.[42] On December 31, 2016, the proposed merger of Liberty Global's and Vodafone Group's Dutch operations was completed, resulting in a joint venture called VodafoneZiggo Group Holding B.V.[43]
Horizon TV[edit]
Horizon TV is Liberty Global's flagship platform with more than 10 million first-generation Horizon TV devices sold.
Liberty Global launched Horizon TV, a box to stream to TVs, in 2012.[44] H2, an upgraded version of the Horizon box, was launched in 2013. The new system included an upgraded remote control with a QWERTY keyboard. A secondary box connects wirelessly to the main device allowing TV, DVR and VoD streaming to multiple rooms in a subscriber's house.[45] Liberty partnered with ActiveVideo in 2013 to include ActiveVideo's CloudTV on the Horizon boxes.[46] Twitter was integrated into Horizon's mobile app library in 2016. The addition allowed live tweets to be overlaid onto the screen of a program being broadcast.[47][48] Also in 2016, Horizon TV was launched in Austria, making it available in all three German-speaking countries that Liberty Global operates in.[49]
