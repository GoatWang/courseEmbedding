GF Xinde and Bay City Capital Co-Host Investment Conference and Announce Collaboration on Unique Fund          





 












Jul 14, 2017



            Category: InvestmentPR News






















GF Securities, GF Xinde Investment Management Co., Ltd. ("GF Xinde") and Bay City Capital, LLC ("Bay City Capital"), in collaboration with the China Society of Biotechnology and the China Pharmaceutical Enterprises Development Promote Association, organized and hosted the 10th China Biotechnology Industry Conference - the Biomedical and Health Industry Investment and Financing Summit Forum. The conference was held on July 3 and 4 in the Guangzhou Baiyun International Convention Center in Guangzhou City, China.
The theme of the conference focused on the "Globalization of China's innovation and the Internationalization of regulation" in the biotechnology and biomedical industries. In addition, the conference covered the latest trends on cross-border biomedical investments and financings and bridging the technology gap between western technologies and domestic Chinese innovation.
Dr. Zeng Hao, Chairman of GF Xinde, Zhu Xun, Director of the Tongxieyi Innovative Drug Club, and David Beier JD, the Managing Director of Bay City Capital, were in attendance at the conference.
During the two-day conference, participants presented and exchanged opinions on Chinese drug regulation in the new era, strategies of major pharmaceutical companies in China, and a review of biomedical investments and financings in the United States and Europe.

Also at the conference, Bay City Capital and GF Xinde announced a new life sciences fund -- Bay City Capital GF Xinde International Life Sciences USD Fund, L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership. This fund will invest in companies across all stages of development with a focus on novel and transformative biopharmaceutical investments including the United States, Canada, Western Europe and China. This unique collaboration between Bay City Capital and GF Xinde aims to capitalize on the strengths of Bay City Capital in deal sourcing and execution in the Western markets and GF Xinde's strategic network in China for value-add partnerships and financing opportunities for the fund. "China is the fastest growing life science market and is the world's second largest pharmaceutical market," said David Beier, Managing Director of Bay City Capital. "Our collaboration with GF Xinde can provide valuable insights for this important healthcare segment."
GF Xinde is a private equity investment subsidiary wholly owned by GF Securities, a large leading A+H share listed securities company whose clients comprise 80 percent of the listed pharmaceutical companies in China and which has deep connections to Chinese biotech and pharma industries. "The establishment of Bay City Capital GF Xinde International Life Sciences USD Fund is another important step in GF Xinde's China life science strategy. "Access to innovation is a high priority for Chinese companies and this fund will provide a window into cutting-edge technologies and assets in the United States and beyond and serve as a cross-border healthcare investment and technology-licensing portal for both foreign and Chinese healthcare companies," said Dr. Zeng Hao, Chairman of GF Xinde.

GF Securities' Dynamic Globalization Strategy, GF Xinde Establishes Life Sciences Fund in the U.S. 





EQS-News / 14/05/2016 / 10:59 UTC+8


New York, U.S.                                                    May 13, 2016

GF Securities' Dynamic Globalization Strategy
GF Xinde Establishes Life Sciences Fund in the U.S.
 Recently, at New York Times Square the GF Securities' 25th anniversary promo video is airing on the China billboard downtown, 192 times a day. GF Securities is the largest, non-government, investment bank in China, listed on the Shenzhen and HK stock exchanges, in February 2010, and April 2015, respectively. The promotional display at Times Square in New York City is not only to create momentum for GF Xinde Investment Management CO., LTD. (a wholly owned subsidiary of GF Securities, hereinafter referred to as "GF Xinde", and to celebrate the creation of a Life Sciences Fund in the US; furthermore, it represents GF Securities overall strategic layout to acquire diversified assets including cutting-edge technology, laying a solid foundation for the company's overall strategy of increased globalization. 
 On May 13 (EDT), GF Xinde signed a strategic cooperation agreement in New York with Bay City Capital, America's leading life sciences investment institution for initiating the establishment of a multinational life sciences fund. Mr. Sun Shuming, Chairman of GF Securities attended the ceremony and declared that, "this life sciences fund is the first investment fund that combines 'international technology and Chinese backing!' This investment platform aims to break through innovative medical deficiencies in China, with advancements in life sciences technology representing a new era of creation and innovation. With more than 25 years of strategic planning and development, the pace of GF Securities international investments are gaining greater and greater traction. This is an unprecedented breakthrough in healthcare for GF Securities, to establish an international life sciences fund with the leading life sciences investment institution in the United States. It will provide momentum and innovative development resources for the Chinese life sciences industry! In terms of cross-industry and cross-border cooperation, this fund is an innovative first amongst Chinese investment banks."
 Mr. Fred Craves, founder and managing partner of Bay City Capital was in attendance during the ceremonial signing, and remarked, "Bay City Capital has invested in life sciences technology for nearly 20 years. And we feel honored to partner with GF Securities and GF Xinde. We have been interested with great intensity in the Chinese markets, closely following the initiatives put forth by the Chinese government for improving the quality and accessibility of universal health care. The current speed of development in China's pharmaceutical industry is much higher than that of Europe and America, thus the country is expected to become the world's largest pharmaceutical market soon. This will provide many opportunities for international medical investment institutions to enter China. GF Securities, as one of China's leading investment banks, has a wealth of resources and experience in capital market operations, with a vast network of institutional clients. We are confident that the cooperation between GF Xinde and Bay City Capital in an international life sciences fund will create outstanding financial and industrial benefits for Chinese enterprises."
 The fund, jointly managed by GF Xinde and Bay City Capital, focuses on investing in innovative life science companies with high growth potential in the United States, Europe and China. The fund will be fully backed by the resources of both Bay City Capital and GF Xinde to achieve cross-border mergers and acquisitions, which will serve to introduce the world's leading technology to Chinese enterprises. Chinese companies will gain access to competitive global products and technology. The fund will diversify sources of returns through a variety of exits channels, through cross-border mergers and acquisitions and the licensing of technology. 
 GF Securities and Bay City Capital, have already attracted large publicly listed pharmaceutical enterprises to be limited partners, including By Health, Jinling Aodong, Nanjing Pharma and Nanjing New Industry Investment Group which is major shareholder of Jinling Pharma, as well as publicly listed companies and institutions such as Solareast and Hengqin Financial Investment. There is a lack of leading-edge technology and innovative diversity in the pharmaceutical industry of China. In order to meet the demand for overseas mergers and acquisitions, now is a crucial time for Chinese pharmaceutical enterprises to carry out a large-scale reform of the pharmaceutical industry in China. Strong reform and supply side development in this industry, will have profound social effects for the entire Chinese society. 
 GF Xinde is China's leading PE and VC investment institution in China. Since its establishment, over the past eight years, the Company has ranked top three for direct investment five years in a row. Assets under management are more than RMB 15 billion, specializing in VC investment in life sciences, listed pharmaceutical companies, cross-border investment banking, IPO and M & As. In the field of life sciences, GF Xinde and GF Securities has a team of over 50 investment advisors, investment bankers and equity analysts. In addition, GF Xinde has a large presence in the health and medical industries, not only through direct investment holdings but facilitating merger and acquisitions of hospitals in China, and investing a considerable amount in various life sciences companies. GF Xinde has over 300 projects underway in the field of life science and the GF Xinde Medical Treatment Industry M&A Fund focuses on mergers and acquisitions of hospitals, with over 50 potential acquisition targets each year.
 Bay City Capital has been deeply involved in life sciences investment for over 20 years in the United States of America. It is the world's leading life sciences VC investment institution with a wealth of experience and resources in the R&D of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, IPOs and M&As, scientists and entrepreneurs. The Company has invested in more than 100 life sciences companies worldwide, with a successful exit rate of more than 50%.
