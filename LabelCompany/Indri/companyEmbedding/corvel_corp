Claims Management
Workers' Compensation Administration



When it comes to workers’ compensation claims administration, our solutions offer a simplified approach to a complex process. It starts with efficient incident reporting and early intervention by an integrated service model that advocates focused claims management from the very onset of injury. Because all of our claims management services are connected in a single database, interested parties can access healthcare intervention, reporting, analytics and claims data in real time, reducing costly delays. 
Early InterventionConnecting patients with appropriate, quality care is the cornerstone of CorVel’s risk management solution. Our early intake process begins with access to a 24/7 nurse call center where injured workers can speak with a registered nurse for first aid advice or referral to preferred providers.
Personalized CareOur value continues with automated solutions that personalize medical treatment programs using precise protocols. All to improve the timeliness and quality of care for injured workers. Our approach includes three point contact, nurse triage and proactive assignment to case management. 
Complete VisibilityOur integrated claims management and managed care solution runs on a single technology platform and keeps everyone connected. User friendly workflows, informed by human intelligence, make it easy to manage claims and provide all parties with complete visibility and real time communication.
Risk Management SystemClaims information entered into our proprietary database is always available for collaboration by all parties involved, including adjusters, employers, providers and CorVel nurse case managers. A customizable dashboard makes it easy to review pertinent data, including number of visits, duration of care, improvement in function, comorbidities, risk scores and other metrics. These tools allow us to respond to a claim within moments rather than days, coordinate care for injured workers quickly and keep activity transparent for employers.
Improved OutcomesOnce an incident is reported, our integrated solution focuses on compressing traditional delays, allowing immediate care for injured workers, regardless of the compensability for first time treatment authorization. This accelerates appropriate care and early return to work outcomes, while reducing the total cost of loss and keeping more claims in medical only status.

History[edit]
In 1987, Gordon Clemons joined with Jim Michael and Jeff Michael, investors from Minnesota and founded CorVel Corporation (originally named FORTIS). Three small vocational rehabilitation firms were consolidated to form the initial foundation of the new Company, valued at approximately $2 million with over 200 associates.[4]
Within two years the Company expanded to 51 American locations and they entered the medical bill review and medical case management business.
In 1991 the Company first issued stock to the public and began trading on the NYSE at a market capitalization value of $46 million.[5] The offering raised $3.5 million, net of the repayment of venture funding.[5] The following year the Fortis name was sold,[5] raising $4 million[5] and the Company changed its name to CorVel Corporation. With the funding from the name sale, CorVel began building a national preferred provider organization (PPO).
During the mid '90s CorVel doubled its office network again, and expanded its software offerings.[5] PPO services became an important part of most healthcare management sales. Out of network medical review was added to the portfolio of provider programs.[3]
By 2005, CorVel grew to over 2,000 clients and 15% compounded annual stock growth.
In March 2009, the Company continued to expand its workers' compensation claims management solutions. During the March quarter, CorVel completed the acquisition of a third party administrator (TPA) in New York, the Company's third acquisition in its TPA expansion effort. Software development efforts have been focused on the incorporation of artificial intelligence capabilities and workflow management tools in to the claims management systems in order to enable CorVel's unique process.
In August 2010, CorVel introduced a provider look up app that can be accessed in the Apple Store and Google Play. This mobile app provides access to locate network doctors, specialists, hospitals and other facilities near the user.
In August 2011, the company celebrated twenty years as a publicly traded company by ringing the opening ball at NASDAQ.
In August 2011, the company also introduced a claim intake app available from Apple that provides mobile access to report workplace incidents and injuries.
In March 2012, the company announced revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 that were a 4% increase over the previous quarter in 2011.
In September 2014, CorVel released a new app (My Care) that provides online access to view indemnity payments, access pharmacy cards, review treatment guidelines and review details of the workplace injury claim. The newest feature of the app provides Touch ID for iPhones that provides secure fingerprint access on iOS devices.
In August 2015, the company announced Telehealth Services as part of their existing Enterprise Comp claims management model to offer immediate access to medical providers for injured workers.[6]
On June 29, 2016, CorVel celebrated 25 years on NASDAQ by ringing the opening bell.
Operations[edit]
CorVel had revenues of $519 million for fiscal year ending March 31, 2017.[7]
CorVel is licensed to do business in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.

History[edit]
In 1987, Gordon Clemons joined with Jim Michael and Jeff Michael, investors from Minnesota and founded CorVel Corporation (originally named FORTIS). Three small vocational rehabilitation firms were consolidated to form the initial foundation of the new Company, valued at approximately $2 million with over 200 associates.[4]
Within two years the Company expanded to 51 American locations and they entered the medical bill review and medical case management business.
In 1991 the Company first issued stock to the public and began trading on the NYSE at a market capitalization value of $46 million.[5] The offering raised $3.5 million, net of the repayment of venture funding.[5] The following year the Fortis name was sold,[5] raising $4 million[5] and the Company changed its name to CorVel Corporation. With the funding from the name sale, CorVel began building a national preferred provider organization (PPO).
During the mid '90s CorVel doubled its office network again, and expanded its software offerings.[5] PPO services became an important part of most healthcare management sales. Out of network medical review was added to the portfolio of provider programs.[3]
By 2005, CorVel grew to over 2,000 clients and 15% compounded annual stock growth.
In March 2009, the Company continued to expand its workers' compensation claims management solutions. During the March quarter, CorVel completed the acquisition of a third party administrator (TPA) in New York, the Company's third acquisition in its TPA expansion effort. Software development efforts have been focused on the incorporation of artificial intelligence capabilities and workflow management tools in to the claims management systems in order to enable CorVel's unique process.
In August 2010, CorVel introduced a provider look up app that can be accessed in the Apple Store and Google Play. This mobile app provides access to locate network doctors, specialists, hospitals and other facilities near the user.
In August 2011, the company celebrated twenty years as a publicly traded company by ringing the opening ball at NASDAQ.
In August 2011, the company also introduced a claim intake app available from Apple that provides mobile access to report workplace incidents and injuries.
In March 2012, the company announced revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 that were a 4% increase over the previous quarter in 2011.
In September 2014, CorVel released a new app (My Care) that provides online access to view indemnity payments, access pharmacy cards, review treatment guidelines and review details of the workplace injury claim. The newest feature of the app provides Touch ID for iPhones that provides secure fingerprint access on iOS devices.
In August 2015, the company announced Telehealth Services as part of their existing Enterprise Comp claims management model to offer immediate access to medical providers for injured workers.[6]
On June 29, 2016, CorVel celebrated 25 years on NASDAQ by ringing the opening bell.

CorVel had revenues of $519 million for fiscal year ending March 31, 2017.[7]
CorVel is licensed to do business in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.
