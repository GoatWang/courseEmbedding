Why do you need professional liability insurance?Professional liability insurance, also called errors and omissions insurance (E & O insurance) or indemnity insurance, protects your business if you are sued for negligently performing your services, even if you haven’t made a mistake. Some examples of what could be covered are below:Dissatisfied Client: A consultant is hired to increase a company’s efficiency. The consultant advises the company to implement several internal processes, however the recommendations are not implemented as specified and productivity decreases rather than improving, causing the client to sue the consultant. A professional liability insurance policy could protect the consultant, even if no mistake was made.Negligent Acts: A photographer is contracted to photograph an engagement party, but forgets to take pictures of the graduate with key family members. The client makes a claim against the photographer for failure to deliver the services agreed upon. A professional liability insurance policy could protect the photographer if such a claim is made.  You should seriously consider professional liability insurance coverage if your business:provides a professional service.regularly gives advice to clients.is requested by a client to have professional liability insurance to complete a contract. Get Liability Insurance that best meets your needs.Professional liability insurance will not protect you from everything.

ReviewsRated 4.8/5 for customer satisfaction on feefo – 8,531 reviews Richard, Cincinatti, OH“Excellent customer service! The ability to obtain the insurance quickly and efficiently was excellent. My only issue was that I had saved a policy without purchasing, came back to purchase, made an edit to the company name, and that edit did not carry over to the final purchase. I then had to call customer service to have it addressed. This is when I was really impressed with their service, because the person on the other end quickly understood the problem, and addressed it.”  Bruce, Minneapolis, MN"Architect/Construction Manager very satisfied w/ the Hiscox Experience. Hiscox made what I was anticipating would be a stressful experience very easy."  Kathleen, Chicago, IL"Super easy and Necessary. Very easy and straightforward.”Douglas, Michigan“EXCELLENT VALUE Insurance is just what I need for my small business. Price was fair and affordable. I have read the coverage and the insurance is an excellent value.”  Isaac Fram, Boston, MA"Excellent insurance offering and service. Very professional, prompt and courteous service. Not to mention the very attractive terms of the policy. I would definitely recommend Hiscox to other small businesses.”  Ms. Pam, New York, NY"My experience this far is good. The rate was excellent in comparison to my previous INS CO. The REP was very knowledgeable and helpful.  It was good being able to speak to a live person opposed to speaking to a computer. "  Evelyn, Petersburg, VAAll persons spoke with were very pleasant, knowledgeable and helpful. Pricing was very competitive. Overall nice experience.  See More

What Is General Liability Insurance?






What Does General Liability Insurance Cover?






How Much Does General Liability Insurance Cost?






 
 



General Liability Insurance
What Is It?

General Liability Insurance provides coverage for customer injuries, customer property damage, and lawsuits relating to both of these. It can help pay for immediate medical expenses as well as legal costs if an incident leads to a lawsuit.
Put another way, if business insurance were Thanksgiving dinner, Commercial General Liability would be the turkey. It's the starting point and centerpiece of any business's commercial insurance plan. In fact, it's usually the first policy small-business owners purchase because they often need it to sign commercial leases and client contracts.
A General Liability policy can help pay for lawsuits over:

Third-party injuries.
Third-party property damage.
Product liability.
Advertising injuries.

It's tempting to think you'll never get sued, but lawsuits are part of the business landscape. And when a small business is sued, the costs can be devastating. A 2005 study [PDF] by the Small Business Administration found that a lawsuit costs between $3,000 and $150,000 for a small business. In today's dollars, that's closer to $4,000 to $190,000.
Commercial General Liability Insurance is an essential safety net when you don't have deep pockets because it can provide funding when things go wrong. Let's look at a few examples of the lawsuits this policy can cover.



 
 




 


Small business lawsuits cost between $3,000 and $150,000.




 
 




4 Ways General Liability Insurance Protects Your Business



­


Third-Party Bodily Injury
(e.g., slip-and-falls)
If a customer is hurt on your property, General Liability Insurance can help pay for their immediate medical expenses or your legal expenses when they sue.




­


Third-Party Property Damage
(e.g., ruined customer smartphones)
If you damage customer property, General Liability Insurance can help pay to repair or replace it.




­


Product Liability
(e.g., hot coffee burns)
If your product hurts someone or damages their property, General Liability Insurance can help pay for your legal expenses.




­


Advertising Injury
(e.g., slander & copyright infringement)
If someone sues you over slander or copyright infringement, General Liability Insurance can help pay for lawsuit expenses.





 
 



Coverage for Third-Party Injuries
(e.g., slip-and-falls)








third-party injuries (n.): physical bodily harm that happens to people not employed by your business










 
 



Customer slip-and-fall accidents cost about $20,000 on average, according to a report by The Hartford. What's worse: these accidents can happen to any visitor at any business.
Third-Party Injury Example: A customer slips on a banana peel and breaks his leg. The doctor's bills and time off work add up fast, so the customer sues to recoup his losses.
Look around your business. See any tracked-in rainwater? Boxes or books near walkways? Computer cords? Under the right (or wrong) circumstances, these things can be the hazards that trigger an expensive lawsuit.



 
 




 


Third-Party Injury Protection May Cover...

Non-employee injuries that happen on your property.
Immediate medical expenses for the injured person.
Legal costs when you're sued over the incident.





 
 



Commercial General Liability Insurance in Action: Your policy can cover the cost of your customer's immediate medical expenses, such as the ambulance ride and emergency room visit. Insurance companies offer immediate medical expense coverage because it's often cheaper to pay a little money up front rather than a lot of money in a lawsuit down the road.
But if the customer refuses your assistance and opts to sue instead, you have a second line of defense. Your policy can help cover the cost of hiring a lawyer to negotiate and settle the case (or take it to trial).
To summarize: for third-party injuries, General Liability Insurance can cover…

Immediate medical expenses.
Lawyers' fees.
Court expenses.
Settlements.
Judgments, if the case goes to trial and you're found liable for wrongdoing.




 
 




 


Slip-and-fall accidents typically cost small businesses ~$20k.




 
 



Coverage for Third-Party Property Damage
(e.g., ruined customer smartphones)








third-party property damage (n): a catchall phrase for client, customer, or vendor property lost or damaged on your premises










 
 



If you damage someone's property, you may have to pay to repair or replace it. In some cases, you don't even have to touch something to be responsible for its damage.
Third-Party Property Damage Example: A customer slips in your store and sends his smartphone flying. His phone wouldn't be broken if he hadn't slipped, and he wouldn't have slipped if you had mopped up that puddle. So he wants you to pay for the broken phone.
Some other examples? You might accidentally spill your coffee on a client's laptop. That's a cool $3,000 down the drain.
Or maybe your office building's fire spreads to a neighboring business. Imagine paying to repair an entire building when your business is already reeling from the disaster. That's where small business liability insurance becomes crucial.
Commercial General Liability Insurance in Action: Business liability insurance can't keep accidents from happening. However, it can help cushion the blow by paying to repair or replace someone's property you lost or damaged.



 
 




 


Third-Party Property Damage Protection May Cover…

Repair costs for damaged property.
Replacements for lost or destroyed property.





 
 



Coverage for Product Liability
(e.g., hot coffee burns)








product liability (n): the legal responsibility to pay for damage caused by a faulty product










 
 



Not all property damage or customer injuries happen in your store. If you manufacture, distribute, or sell products, you can be sued over the harm those products cause.
You read that right. Most states allow injured parties to sue any business that helped put a defective or dangerous product into consumer hands.
Product Liability Example: A customer buys and eats the store’s signature salsa. Shortly after, he falls seriously ill. He thinks the salsa is to blame, so he sues your business to help pay for medical expenses.
But say you sell piping hot coffee that burns a customer or hoverboards that send riders crashing to the sidewalk. You didn’t grow the beans or manufacture the boards, but because you benefitted from the sale, you could be on the hook for damages.



 
 




 


Product Liability Protection May Cover…

Damage caused by the products you make, distribute, or sell.
Legal costs when you're sued over the incident.





 
 



Commercial General Liability Insurance in Action: Your policy can typically cover the legal expenses associated with product liability lawsuits. That's good news for any manufacturer, distributor, supplier, or retailer. Most states have strict liability laws, and that means you can take every reasonable precaution to make the product safe and still be held liable for the harm it causes.
Your General Liability policy can help pay for legal expenses when you're sued over a product's…

Design defects: inherently dangerous products like scalding coffee, lawn darts, or hoverboards.
Manufacturing defects: products made with contaminated ingredients, defective parts, or misassembled parts.
Marketing defects: products without proper warnings, instructions, or labels.




 
 




 


You could be liable for damage a product causes, even if it wasn't your fault.




 
 



Coverage for Advertising Injuries
(e.g., slander and copyright infringement)








advertising injury (n): libel, slander, copyright infringement, and other harm your marketing or advertising causes to someone's reputation, brand, or market share










 
 



Libel and slander lawsuits cost $50,000 on average, according to The Hartford. And it's easier than ever to be accused of slander, libel, or copyright infringement if you advertise online or use social media.
A single tweet or photo on your website could trigger a lawsuit.
Advertising Injury Example: A celebrity once ate your business’s salsa, so you use the celebrity's image on the label. The problem? You didn’t have permission. The celebrity sues to take a cut of what your business earned by linking itself with his image.
Here’s another example: you tweet about a client who’s late on payments. That client hasn't noticed her pile of unpaid invoices, but the tweet gets her attention. She claims it hurt her reputation and sues you for libel.
Have a website? Be careful with the photos you post and logos you use. Either could be a copyright or trademark infringement lawsuit in the making, so make sure you own the rights.
Commercial General Liability Insurance in Action: The advertising injury coverage in your business liability insurance can help pay for legal defense as well as settlement or judgment costs when you're sued over advertising mistakes. That way a misstep doesn't force you to close shop.



 
 




 


Advertising Injury Protection May Cover...

Invasion of privacy, such as using someone's image or words without their consent.
Libel or slander.
Copyright or trademark infringement.
Legal costs when you're sued over these incidents.

How Much Does General Liability Insurance Cost?



 
 








$428
Median yearly cost



$741
Average yearly cost



$425
Typical yearly cost for low-risk business





 
 



Liability insurance for small businesses is typically very affordable, and General Liability is no exception. If you run a low-risk business, you may pay less than $450 a year. On average, policies cost $741 per year, but the median cost is $428, meaning that most businesses' policies fall on the cheaper end of the spectrum.
To put that in perspective, your policy may cost between $36 and $62 per month. That's about what you'd spend on a family outing to the movies, and less than most other liability insurance policies.
These price estimates are for policies with a $1 million / $2 million limit. That means you get up to $1 million in coverage for any single claim and up to $2 million in coverage for all claims in a year.

What Is Workers' Compensation Insurance?






Who Needs It?






How Much Does it Cost?






 
 



Workers' Compensation Insurance
What Is It?
Workers' Compensation Insurance can pay for three things when an employee is injured at work: medical bills, recovery costs, and partial missed wages. If an employee dies, Workers' Comp can cover funeral costs and benefits to the worker's family. Depending on state laws and contract requirements, you may need this policy to cover employees, contractors, freelancers, or even yourself.
Workers' Comp (formerly "workman's comp") emerged from a "grand bargain" between business owners and workers. Business owners were tired of being sued by injured workers. Workers were tired of being injured.
So Workers' Comp Insurance was designed to help pay for work injuries and illnesses without the rigmarole of a lawsuit. This liability insurance policy can help your business do three things:

Pay for medical expenses and replacement wages when employees are injured at work.
Comply with state Workers' Comp laws.
Pay for legal expenses if an employee sues over a work injury the policy doesn't cover.

Most states require employers to buy Workers' Compensation Insurance as soon as they hire their first employee. Even when that's not the case, it's smart to have this policy, because the cost of workplace injuries is substantial:

The average workplace injury claim costs $36,551, according to the National Safety Council [PDF].
Recovering from a workplace injury took a median of nine days in 2014, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics [PDF].
Productivity losses come to about $3,600 per hourly worker and $2,650 per salaried employee, according to a report [PDF] from workforce solution company Circadian.

The takeaway: workman's comp injuries cost small businesses in lost productivity. Without insurance, those costs would be compounded by employee medical expenses and missed wages.



 
 




 


Work injury claims cost $36,551 on average.




 
 




3 Ways Workers' Comp Insurance Protects Your Business






Employee Work Illness & Injury Expenses

Workers' Comp can help pay for medical expenses and missed wages for employees who are hurt on the job. If an employee dies, the policy can cover funeral expenses. 




­


State Law Compliance

Most states require employers to carry Workman's Compensation Insurance as soon as they hire their first employee.




­


Employee Injury Lawsuits

If your employee suffers an occupational injury your state doesn't require Workers' Comp Insurance to cover, the employee may sue you to recoup medical expenses.

Workers' Comp Insurance: Coverage for Employee Work Injuries & Illnesses









 
 



The most common Workman's Comp Insurance claim is for an injury that can happen anywhere: falls on the same level. Fully 17 percent of workplace accidents are caused by same-level falls, according to a 2014 Bureau of Labor Statistics report [PDF]. One trip over a computer cord, and you could be facing a pile of employee medical bills. (True story: OSHA lists "trip over self" as a category of workplace injury.) But it's not just accidents. Sometimes an employee's job can hurt them even if they don't work in a high-risk industry.
Example: Your copywriter churns out articles all day, but constant typing gives her carpal tunnel syndrome. Because the injury is work-related, she can recoup her medical expenses from your business.
If you have a Workers' Comp policy, that's no big deal. The copywriter can make a claim to cover corticosteroid injections or corrective surgery and partial wages for the time she needs to recover.

Workers' Comp Quick Facts
You can turn your Workers' Comp policy to help pay for employees' work-related injury or illness expenses, including...

Medical bills.
Ongoing care (including medication and rehabilitation).
Missed wages (often partial) during recovery.
Funeral expenses for fatal incidents.
Death benefits to support the deceased's family.

But it can't pay for:

Injuries caused by intoxication or drugs.
Self-inflicted injuries.
Injuries from a fight the employee starts.
Injuries caused by horseplay or company policy violations.
Off-the-job injuries.
Injuries claimed after an employee is fired or laid off.
Independent contractor injuries.
Wages for a replacement worker.
OSHA fines.




 
 




 


Falls on the same level cause 17% of Workers' Comp claims.




 
 


Workers' Compensation Laws by State




Every state has different Workers' Compensation laws. Find out what your state requires of businesses like yours in our page dedicated to Workers' Compensation Insurance laws by state. We maintain an overview of each state's requirements, which vary most often by industry and number of employees.



 
 



Workman's Compensation Insurance: Coverage that Helps You Comply with State Laws









 
 



Forty-nine states currently require employers to carry some form of Workers' Comp Insurance. Here's the catch: every state has its own spin on those laws.
Some states require employers to carry coverage as soon as they hire their first employee (California and Illinois are examples). In other states, the mandate kicks in once you have a certain number of employees (for example, four in Florida and five in Tennessee).
Only Texas allows employers to opt out of carrying insurance altogether. However, Texas employers can still be sued over uncompensated work injuries.
To complicate matters more, four states only allow you to purchase coverage from state-run funds. These states are...

North Dakota.
Ohio.
Washington.
Wyoming.

So what happens if you skip out on Worker Compensation Insurance when your state requires it? It depends on where you live, but generally, you face fines and even jail time for serious offenses.



 
 



Sample of State Penalties for Workers' Comp Noncompliance




State
Penalty




California
Up to $10,000 in fines and / or up to a year in jail (the state can also issue penalties of up to $100,000 against illegally uninsured employers).


Florida
2x the amount the employer would have paid in premium within the last two years.


Illinois
Up to $500 for every day of noncompliance with a minimum fine of $10,000


New York
Up to $50,000 in fines for employers with more than 5 employees.


Virginia
$250 per day for each day of noncompliance, with a maximum penalty of $50,000.







 
 




 


IL employers face fines up to $500 per day for not carrying Workers' Comp.




 
 



Worker Compensation Insurance: Coverage for Employee Injury Lawsuits









 
 



According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 3 million non-fatal work injuries in 2014. What happens when Workers' Comp benefits don't cover one of those accidents?
Answer: businesses turn to Employer's Liability Insurance, the second part of a Workman's Comp policy. This coverage can help cover lawsuits over employee work injuries.
We know what you're thinking: Workers' Comp is supposed to help me not get sued. What gives?
Workers' Comp benefits only cover what the state requires them to cover. In some states, certain types of workplace injuries and illnesses may not be eligible for Workers' Comp benefits.
Furthermore, an employee could allege you were negligent – for example, say you asked him to change a lightbulb by climbing a ladder that bore a striking resemblance to the leaning tower of Pisa. In negligence cases, you can still be sued. Employer's Liability Insurance helps you out when employees sue to cover their medical bills for ineligible work injuries. It can help pay for your...

Legal defense fees.
Settlement or judgments.
Court costs.

Workers' Compensation Insurance rates vary from state to state. For example, per $100 in employee wages, rates range from $0.75 in Texas to $2.74 in Alaska. Behind those rates are a lot of variables. The cost of Workers' Compensation depends on:

Your state.
Your industry.
How many employees you have.
The type of work your employees do.
Your payroll.
Your claims history.

The National Safety Council notes [PDF] that the cost of medical expenses for occupational injuries was $198 billion in 2011. As we mentioned earlier, that same study found that the average work injury claim costs about $36,551.
Chances are, your Workers' Comp premium is a much better deal. For more cost details, see the Workers' Comp Insurance Quote Analysis in our business insurance cost analysis section.

Commercial Property Insurance
Commercial Property Insurance protects the stuff your business needs to run. It can pay to repair or replace your business property if it's stolen, damaged, or destroyed in a fire or natural disaster. Most policies can cover…

Office space owned by your business.
Fixtures.
Furniture.
Inventory.
Supplies.
Equipment.

Without Commercial Property Insurance, most small businesses and startups can't replace their equipment after a covered event. Just look at the study from insurance company The Hartford. It lists the average cost of common small business property claims:

Fire: $35,000.
Wind and hail damage: $26,000.
Water and freezing pipe damage: $17,000.
Burglary and theft: $8,000.

Getting business property insurance doesn't mean your equipment will always be safe and sound. But it can help your business stay open when that property is damaged.
What Is Commercial Property Insurance?
When certain events happen, Commercial Property Insurance can pay for business property that is stolen, damaged, or destroyed. That property typically includes…

Your building. This usually means the structure, but it can include permanently installed fixtures, machinery, and equipment.
Contents of your building. This includes items that can be easily taken out, like inventory, office equipment, and other supplies.
Other people's property. This category includes items that are left in your care, custody, or control. For example, a customer might use an outlet on your premises to charge her laptop. Once it's in your care, you could be responsible if it's damaged.

Like most policies, business Property Insurance has inclusions and exclusions. For example, most Property Insurance pays when your stuff is damaged by common problems like fire, theft, or windstorms. But some things that cause property damage are often excluded. Two big ones are floods and earthquakes.
Read your policy carefully. Ask your agent if you're concerned that a specific kind of risk may not be covered. They can often help you find ways to increase your coverage.



 
 




 


Property Insurance usually doesn't cover flood or earthquake damage.




 
 



Who Needs Business Property Insurance?
You might want to consider this coverage if you…

Own a commercial office or building.
Rent a commercial office or storage space.
Have valuable property, such as computers, culinary equipment, or specialized tools.
Have property you rely on to run your business.

Worth noting: many commercial landlords require their tenants to have some Commercial Property coverage. Usually, they want you to purchase a policy that covers only your contents in the leased space. Read your lease carefully to check for potential insurance requirements.
How to Choose Business Property Insurance that Fits Your Budget
Want to protect your property and also keep your Commercial Property Insurance costs down? Here are a couple tips:

Consider "actual cash value" coverage. This will cost you less than a "replacement value" policy – but it also offers less coverage. Actual cash value insurance tends to work well if you can easily replace all your equipment with used equipment. Before making this choice, be sure to consult your insurance agent, who will know if the savings is worth the lower payout.
Consider "named perils" coverage. "Named perils" coverage usually costs less than an "open perils" policy because it covers less. So again: if your risk exposure is limited, this might make sense. But it could also end up costing you in the long run. Your agent is a great resource for more information, and so is this blog post: What We Talk about When We Talk About All Perils Coverage.

Get More Out of Your Commercial Property Insurance
You can beef up your business property insurance by bundling it with General Liability Insurance. This option is called a Business Owner's Policy (or BOP Insurance). Most of our small-business customers get their Property Insurance through a BOP because…

It's affordable.
It offers more protection.

You can also add Business Interruption Insurance to your Property Insurance policy. When certain events force your business to temporarily close, Business Interruption Insurance helps reimburse you for lost income.
Finally, some businesses might want to add Inland Marine Insurance to their Property Insurance. It can cover property when it's in transit or temporarily stored somewhere other than your shop. Read "What Is Inland Marine Insurance?" for more details.

We will cover the subsequent claim and related medical expenses up to your General Liability policy's limits of liability.Property damage and data loss : You spill coffee on a client’s server causing damage and loss of data. We will cover the subsequent claim up to your General Liability policy's limits of liability.Personal injury : One of your employees is at lunch. He talks to the owner of the shop about one of your clients in a false and unflattering way. The client learns of this discussion and sues for slander.

Some examples of what could be covered are below:Dissatisfied Client: A consultant is hired to increase a company’s efficiency. The consultant advises the company to implement several internal processes, however the recommendations are not implemented as specified and productivity decreases rather than improving, causing the client to sue the consultant. A professional liability insurance policy could protect the consultant, even if no mistake was made.Negligent Acts: A photographer is contracted to photograph an engagement party, but forgets to take pictures of the graduate with key family members. The client makes a claim against the photographer for failure to deliver the services agreed upon.

ReviewsRated 4.8/5 for customer satisfaction on feefo – 8,531 reviews Richard, Cincinatti, OH“Excellent customer service! The ability to obtain the insurance quickly and efficiently was excellent. My only issue was that I had saved a policy without purchasing, came back to purchase, made an edit to the company name, and that edit did not carry over to the final purchase. I then had to call customer service to have it addressed. This is when I was really impressed with their service, because the person on the other end quickly understood the problem, and addressed it.”  Bruce, Minneapolis, MN"Architect/Construction Manager very satisfied w/ the Hiscox Experience. Hiscox made what I was anticipating would be a stressful experience very easy."  Kathleen, Chicago, IL"Super easy and Necessary. Very easy and straightforward.”Douglas, Michigan“EXCELLENT VALUE Insurance is just what I need for my small business. Price was fair and affordable. I have read the coverage and the insurance is an excellent value.”  Isaac Fram, Boston, MA"Excellent insurance offering and service. Very professional, prompt and courteous service. Not to mention the very attractive terms of the policy. I would definitely recommend Hiscox to other small businesses.”  Ms. Pam, New York, NY"My experience this far is good. The rate was excellent in comparison to my previous INS CO. The REP was very knowledgeable and helpful.  It was good being able to speak to a live person opposed to speaking to a computer. "  Evelyn, Petersburg, VAAll persons spoke with were very pleasant, knowledgeable and helpful. Pricing was very competitive. Overall nice experience.  See More

What Is General Liability Insurance?






What Does General Liability Insurance Cover?






How Much Does General Liability Insurance Cost?






 
 



General Liability Insurance
What Is It?

General Liability Insurance provides coverage for customer injuries, customer property damage, and lawsuits relating to both of these. It can help pay for immediate medical expenses as well as legal costs if an incident leads to a lawsuit.
Put another way, if business insurance were Thanksgiving dinner, Commercial General Liability would be the turkey. It's the starting point and centerpiece of any business's commercial insurance plan. In fact, it's usually the first policy small-business owners purchase because they often need it to sign commercial leases and client contracts.
A General Liability policy can help pay for lawsuits over:

Third-party injuries.
Third-party property damage.
Product liability.
Advertising injuries.

It's tempting to think you'll never get sued, but lawsuits are part of the business landscape. And when a small business is sued, the costs can be devastating. A 2005 study [PDF] by the Small Business Administration found that a lawsuit costs between $3,000 and $150,000 for a small business. In today's dollars, that's closer to $4,000 to $190,000.
Commercial General Liability Insurance is an essential safety net when you don't have deep pockets because it can provide funding when things go wrong. Let's look at a few examples of the lawsuits this policy can cover.



 
 




 


Small business lawsuits cost between $3,000 and $150,000.




 
 




4 Ways General Liability Insurance Protects Your Business



­


Third-Party Bodily Injury
(e.g., slip-and-falls)
If a customer is hurt on your property, General Liability Insurance can help pay for their immediate medical expenses or your legal expenses when they sue.




­


Third-Party Property Damage
(e.g., ruined customer smartphones)
If you damage customer property, General Liability Insurance can help pay to repair or replace it.




­


Product Liability
(e.g., hot coffee burns)
If your product hurts someone or damages their property, General Liability Insurance can help pay for your legal expenses.




­


Advertising Injury
(e.g., slander & copyright infringement)
If someone sues you over slander or copyright infringement, General Liability Insurance can help pay for lawsuit expenses.





 
 



Coverage for Third-Party Injuries
(e.g., slip-and-falls)








third-party injuries (n.): physical bodily harm that happens to people not employed by your business










 
 



Customer slip-and-fall accidents cost about $20,000 on average, according to a report by The Hartford. What's worse: these accidents can happen to any visitor at any business.
Third-Party Injury Example: A customer slips on a banana peel and breaks his leg. The doctor's bills and time off work add up fast, so the customer sues to recoup his losses.
Look around your business. See any tracked-in rainwater? Boxes or books near walkways? Computer cords? Under the right (or wrong) circumstances, these things can be the hazards that trigger an expensive lawsuit.



 
 




 


Third-Party Injury Protection May Cover...

Non-employee injuries that happen on your property.
Immediate medical expenses for the injured person.
Legal costs when you're sued over the incident.





 
 



Commercial General Liability Insurance in Action: Your policy can cover the cost of your customer's immediate medical expenses, such as the ambulance ride and emergency room visit. Insurance companies offer immediate medical expense coverage because it's often cheaper to pay a little money up front rather than a lot of money in a lawsuit down the road.
But if the customer refuses your assistance and opts to sue instead, you have a second line of defense. Your policy can help cover the cost of hiring a lawyer to negotiate and settle the case (or take it to trial).
To summarize: for third-party injuries, General Liability Insurance can cover…

Immediate medical expenses.
Lawyers' fees.
Court expenses.
Settlements.
Judgments, if the case goes to trial and you're found liable for wrongdoing.




 
 




 


Slip-and-fall accidents typically cost small businesses ~$20k.




 
 



Coverage for Third-Party Property Damage
(e.g., ruined customer smartphones)








third-party property damage (n): a catchall phrase for client, customer, or vendor property lost or damaged on your premises










 
 



If you damage someone's property, you may have to pay to repair or replace it. In some cases, you don't even have to touch something to be responsible for its damage.
Third-Party Property Damage Example: A customer slips in your store and sends his smartphone flying. His phone wouldn't be broken if he hadn't slipped, and he wouldn't have slipped if you had mopped up that puddle. So he wants you to pay for the broken phone.
Some other examples? You might accidentally spill your coffee on a client's laptop. That's a cool $3,000 down the drain.
Or maybe your office building's fire spreads to a neighboring business. Imagine paying to repair an entire building when your business is already reeling from the disaster. That's where small business liability insurance becomes crucial.
Commercial General Liability Insurance in Action: Business liability insurance can't keep accidents from happening. However, it can help cushion the blow by paying to repair or replace someone's property you lost or damaged.



 
 




 


Third-Party Property Damage Protection May Cover…

Repair costs for damaged property.
Replacements for lost or destroyed property.





 
 



Coverage for Product Liability
(e.g., hot coffee burns)








product liability (n): the legal responsibility to pay for damage caused by a faulty product










 
 



Not all property damage or customer injuries happen in your store. If you manufacture, distribute, or sell products, you can be sued over the harm those products cause.
You read that right. Most states allow injured parties to sue any business that helped put a defective or dangerous product into consumer hands.
Product Liability Example: A customer buys and eats the store’s signature salsa. Shortly after, he falls seriously ill. He thinks the salsa is to blame, so he sues your business to help pay for medical expenses.
But say you sell piping hot coffee that burns a customer or hoverboards that send riders crashing to the sidewalk. You didn’t grow the beans or manufacture the boards, but because you benefitted from the sale, you could be on the hook for damages.



 
 




 


Product Liability Protection May Cover…

Damage caused by the products you make, distribute, or sell.
Legal costs when you're sued over the incident.





 
 



Commercial General Liability Insurance in Action: Your policy can typically cover the legal expenses associated with product liability lawsuits. That's good news for any manufacturer, distributor, supplier, or retailer. Most states have strict liability laws, and that means you can take every reasonable precaution to make the product safe and still be held liable for the harm it causes.
Your General Liability policy can help pay for legal expenses when you're sued over a product's…

Design defects: inherently dangerous products like scalding coffee, lawn darts, or hoverboards.
Manufacturing defects: products made with contaminated ingredients, defective parts, or misassembled parts.
Marketing defects: products without proper warnings, instructions, or labels.




 
 




 


You could be liable for damage a product causes, even if it wasn't your fault.




 
 



Coverage for Advertising Injuries
(e.g., slander and copyright infringement)








advertising injury (n): libel, slander, copyright infringement, and other harm your marketing or advertising causes to someone's reputation, brand, or market share










 
 



Libel and slander lawsuits cost $50,000 on average, according to The Hartford. And it's easier than ever to be accused of slander, libel, or copyright infringement if you advertise online or use social media.
A single tweet or photo on your website could trigger a lawsuit.
Advertising Injury Example: A celebrity once ate your business’s salsa, so you use the celebrity's image on the label. The problem? You didn’t have permission. The celebrity sues to take a cut of what your business earned by linking itself with his image.
Here’s another example: you tweet about a client who’s late on payments. That client hasn't noticed her pile of unpaid invoices, but the tweet gets her attention. She claims it hurt her reputation and sues you for libel.
Have a website? Be careful with the photos you post and logos you use. Either could be a copyright or trademark infringement lawsuit in the making, so make sure you own the rights.
Commercial General Liability Insurance in Action: The advertising injury coverage in your business liability insurance can help pay for legal defense as well as settlement or judgment costs when you're sued over advertising mistakes. That way a misstep doesn't force you to close shop.



 
 




 


Advertising Injury Protection May Cover...

Invasion of privacy, such as using someone's image or words without their consent.
Libel or slander.
Copyright or trademark infringement.
Legal costs when you're sued over these incidents.

How Much Does General Liability Insurance Cost?



 
 








$428
Median yearly cost



$741
Average yearly cost



$425
Typical yearly cost for low-risk business





 
 



Liability insurance for small businesses is typically very affordable, and General Liability is no exception. If you run a low-risk business, you may pay less than $450 a year. On average, policies cost $741 per year, but the median cost is $428, meaning that most businesses' policies fall on the cheaper end of the spectrum.
To put that in perspective, your policy may cost between $36 and $62 per month. That's about what you'd spend on a family outing to the movies, and less than most other liability insurance policies.
These price estimates are for policies with a $1 million / $2 million limit. That means you get up to $1 million in coverage for any single claim and up to $2 million in coverage for all claims in a year.

What Is Workers' Compensation Insurance?






Who Needs It?






How Much Does it Cost?






 
 



Workers' Compensation Insurance
What Is It?
Workers' Compensation Insurance can pay for three things when an employee is injured at work: medical bills, recovery costs, and partial missed wages. If an employee dies, Workers' Comp can cover funeral costs and benefits to the worker's family. Depending on state laws and contract requirements, you may need this policy to cover employees, contractors, freelancers, or even yourself.
Workers' Comp (formerly "workman's comp") emerged from a "grand bargain" between business owners and workers. Business owners were tired of being sued by injured workers. Workers were tired of being injured.
So Workers' Comp Insurance was designed to help pay for work injuries and illnesses without the rigmarole of a lawsuit. This liability insurance policy can help your business do three things:

Pay for medical expenses and replacement wages when employees are injured at work.
Comply with state Workers' Comp laws.
Pay for legal expenses if an employee sues over a work injury the policy doesn't cover.

Most states require employers to buy Workers' Compensation Insurance as soon as they hire their first employee. Even when that's not the case, it's smart to have this policy, because the cost of workplace injuries is substantial:

The average workplace injury claim costs $36,551, according to the National Safety Council [PDF].
Recovering from a workplace injury took a median of nine days in 2014, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics [PDF].
Productivity losses come to about $3,600 per hourly worker and $2,650 per salaried employee, according to a report [PDF] from workforce solution company Circadian.

The takeaway: workman's comp injuries cost small businesses in lost productivity. Without insurance, those costs would be compounded by employee medical expenses and missed wages.



 
 




 


Work injury claims cost $36,551 on average.




 
 




3 Ways Workers' Comp Insurance Protects Your Business






Employee Work Illness & Injury Expenses

Workers' Comp can help pay for medical expenses and missed wages for employees who are hurt on the job. If an employee dies, the policy can cover funeral expenses. 




­


State Law Compliance

Most states require employers to carry Workman's Compensation Insurance as soon as they hire their first employee.




­


Employee Injury Lawsuits

If your employee suffers an occupational injury your state doesn't require Workers' Comp Insurance to cover, the employee may sue you to recoup medical expenses.

Workers' Comp Insurance: Coverage for Employee Work Injuries & Illnesses









 
 



The most common Workman's Comp Insurance claim is for an injury that can happen anywhere: falls on the same level. Fully 17 percent of workplace accidents are caused by same-level falls, according to a 2014 Bureau of Labor Statistics report [PDF]. One trip over a computer cord, and you could be facing a pile of employee medical bills. (True story: OSHA lists "trip over self" as a category of workplace injury.) But it's not just accidents. Sometimes an employee's job can hurt them even if they don't work in a high-risk industry.
Example: Your copywriter churns out articles all day, but constant typing gives her carpal tunnel syndrome. Because the injury is work-related, she can recoup her medical expenses from your business.
If you have a Workers' Comp policy, that's no big deal. The copywriter can make a claim to cover corticosteroid injections or corrective surgery and partial wages for the time she needs to recover.

Workers' Comp Quick Facts
You can turn your Workers' Comp policy to help pay for employees' work-related injury or illness expenses, including...

Medical bills.
Ongoing care (including medication and rehabilitation).
Missed wages (often partial) during recovery.
Funeral expenses for fatal incidents.
Death benefits to support the deceased's family.

But it can't pay for:

Injuries caused by intoxication or drugs.
Self-inflicted injuries.
Injuries from a fight the employee starts.
Injuries caused by horseplay or company policy violations.
Off-the-job injuries.
Injuries claimed after an employee is fired or laid off.
Independent contractor injuries.
Wages for a replacement worker.
OSHA fines.




 
 




 


Falls on the same level cause 17% of Workers' Comp claims.




 
 


Workers' Compensation Laws by State




Every state has different Workers' Compensation laws. Find out what your state requires of businesses like yours in our page dedicated to Workers' Compensation Insurance laws by state. We maintain an overview of each state's requirements, which vary most often by industry and number of employees.



 
 



Workman's Compensation Insurance: Coverage that Helps You Comply with State Laws









 
 



Forty-nine states currently require employers to carry some form of Workers' Comp Insurance. Here's the catch: every state has its own spin on those laws.
Some states require employers to carry coverage as soon as they hire their first employee (California and Illinois are examples). In other states, the mandate kicks in once you have a certain number of employees (for example, four in Florida and five in Tennessee).
Only Texas allows employers to opt out of carrying insurance altogether. However, Texas employers can still be sued over uncompensated work injuries.
To complicate matters more, four states only allow you to purchase coverage from state-run funds. These states are...

North Dakota.
Ohio.
Washington.
Wyoming.

So what happens if you skip out on Worker Compensation Insurance when your state requires it? It depends on where you live, but generally, you face fines and even jail time for serious offenses.



 
 



Sample of State Penalties for Workers' Comp Noncompliance




State
Penalty




California
Up to $10,000 in fines and / or up to a year in jail (the state can also issue penalties of up to $100,000 against illegally uninsured employers).


Florida
2x the amount the employer would have paid in premium within the last two years.


Illinois
Up to $500 for every day of noncompliance with a minimum fine of $10,000


New York
Up to $50,000 in fines for employers with more than 5 employees.


Virginia
$250 per day for each day of noncompliance, with a maximum penalty of $50,000.







 
 




 


IL employers face fines up to $500 per day for not carrying Workers' Comp.




 
 



Worker Compensation Insurance: Coverage for Employee Injury Lawsuits









 
 



According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 3 million non-fatal work injuries in 2014. What happens when Workers' Comp benefits don't cover one of those accidents?
Answer: businesses turn to Employer's Liability Insurance, the second part of a Workman's Comp policy. This coverage can help cover lawsuits over employee work injuries.
We know what you're thinking: Workers' Comp is supposed to help me not get sued. What gives?
Workers' Comp benefits only cover what the state requires them to cover. In some states, certain types of workplace injuries and illnesses may not be eligible for Workers' Comp benefits.
Furthermore, an employee could allege you were negligent – for example, say you asked him to change a lightbulb by climbing a ladder that bore a striking resemblance to the leaning tower of Pisa. In negligence cases, you can still be sued. Employer's Liability Insurance helps you out when employees sue to cover their medical bills for ineligible work injuries. It can help pay for your...

Legal defense fees.
Settlement or judgments.
Court costs.

Workers' Compensation Insurance rates vary from state to state. For example, per $100 in employee wages, rates range from $0.75 in Texas to $2.74 in Alaska. Behind those rates are a lot of variables. The cost of Workers' Compensation depends on:

Your state.
Your industry.
How many employees you have.
The type of work your employees do.
Your payroll.
Your claims history.

The National Safety Council notes [PDF] that the cost of medical expenses for occupational injuries was $198 billion in 2011. As we mentioned earlier, that same study found that the average work injury claim costs about $36,551.
Chances are, your Workers' Comp premium is a much better deal. For more cost details, see the Workers' Comp Insurance Quote Analysis in our business insurance cost analysis section.

Commercial Property Insurance
Commercial Property Insurance protects the stuff your business needs to run. It can pay to repair or replace your business property if it's stolen, damaged, or destroyed in a fire or natural disaster. Most policies can cover…

Office space owned by your business.
Fixtures.
Furniture.
Inventory.
Supplies.
Equipment.

Without Commercial Property Insurance, most small businesses and startups can't replace their equipment after a covered event. Just look at the study from insurance company The Hartford. It lists the average cost of common small business property claims:

Fire: $35,000.
Wind and hail damage: $26,000.
Water and freezing pipe damage: $17,000.
Burglary and theft: $8,000.

Getting business property insurance doesn't mean your equipment will always be safe and sound. But it can help your business stay open when that property is damaged.
What Is Commercial Property Insurance?
When certain events happen, Commercial Property Insurance can pay for business property that is stolen, damaged, or destroyed. That property typically includes…

Your building. This usually means the structure, but it can include permanently installed fixtures, machinery, and equipment.
Contents of your building. This includes items that can be easily taken out, like inventory, office equipment, and other supplies.
Other people's property. This category includes items that are left in your care, custody, or control. For example, a customer might use an outlet on your premises to charge her laptop. Once it's in your care, you could be responsible if it's damaged.

Like most policies, business Property Insurance has inclusions and exclusions. For example, most Property Insurance pays when your stuff is damaged by common problems like fire, theft, or windstorms. But some things that cause property damage are often excluded. Two big ones are floods and earthquakes.
Read your policy carefully. Ask your agent if you're concerned that a specific kind of risk may not be covered. They can often help you find ways to increase your coverage.



 
 




 


Property Insurance usually doesn't cover flood or earthquake damage.




 
 



Who Needs Business Property Insurance?
You might want to consider this coverage if you…

Own a commercial office or building.
Rent a commercial office or storage space.
Have valuable property, such as computers, culinary equipment, or specialized tools.
Have property you rely on to run your business.

Worth noting: many commercial landlords require their tenants to have some Commercial Property coverage. Usually, they want you to purchase a policy that covers only your contents in the leased space. Read your lease carefully to check for potential insurance requirements.
How to Choose Business Property Insurance that Fits Your Budget
Want to protect your property and also keep your Commercial Property Insurance costs down? Here are a couple tips:

Consider "actual cash value" coverage. This will cost you less than a "replacement value" policy – but it also offers less coverage. Actual cash value insurance tends to work well if you can easily replace all your equipment with used equipment. Before making this choice, be sure to consult your insurance agent, who will know if the savings is worth the lower payout.
Consider "named perils" coverage. "Named perils" coverage usually costs less than an "open perils" policy because it covers less. So again: if your risk exposure is limited, this might make sense. But it could also end up costing you in the long run. Your agent is a great resource for more information, and so is this blog post: What We Talk about When We Talk About All Perils Coverage.

Get More Out of Your Commercial Property Insurance
You can beef up your business property insurance by bundling it with General Liability Insurance. This option is called a Business Owner's Policy (or BOP Insurance). Most of our small-business customers get their Property Insurance through a BOP because…

It's affordable.
It offers more protection.

You can also add Business Interruption Insurance to your Property Insurance policy. When certain events force your business to temporarily close, Business Interruption Insurance helps reimburse you for lost income.
Finally, some businesses might want to add Inland Marine Insurance to their Property Insurance. It can cover property when it's in transit or temporarily stored somewhere other than your shop. Read "What Is Inland Marine Insurance?" for more details.

Can't find your industry?







 




 


General Liability Insurance
The minute you start selling your IT services, you become a business. As such, you open yourself to certain liability exposures you wouldn't have as an individual. General Liability Insurance can help ensure that these exposures don't lead to serious financial losses for you or your business.


 




 



What Is General Liability Insurance?
Let’s start with the basics: Commercial General Liability Insurance is the first policy most IT businesses buy. (FYI, your second policy will probably be Professional Liability Insurance.)
It usually costs between $500 and $900 per year and can cover legal expenses when you’re sued over customer injuries, client property damage, or slander. If you know you need business insurance but you’re not sure which policy, there’s a good chance it’s General Liability Insurance.
Of course, there’s a lot more to the General Liability Insurance story. Now that we’ve covered the basics, let’s get into the nitty gritty.



 




 




What Does General Liability Insurance Cover?
It’s easiest to understand what General Liability Insurance covers by comparing it to Professional Liability Insurance. As its name suggests, General Liability offers protection for the “general” things that can go wrong at your business – that is, the things that can go wrong at any business. If someone slips and falls on your floor, that’s a general liability exposure that could be covered under your policy.
On the other hand, Professional Liability Insurance covers lawsuits over your professional work: glitches, code errors, and delays in your projects. If your client is mad because you missed a deadline, Professional Liability Insurance can likely help.
General Liability Insurance doesn’t cover work-related issues, but it does cover many common accident, injury, and property damage lawsuits.




 




 



3 Examples of General Liability Insurance Coverage in Action
General Liability Insurance offers protection when people other than your employees get hurt or have their property damaged on your premises. For example:



 




 








A visiting client trips over a power cord and breaks her wrist (covered).







You tweet about how annoying it was to work with a client. The client sees the tweet, knows it’s about him, and sues you for defamation (covered).







While using dry-erase markers as props to show a client how cloud backup works, you knock over the CFO’s coffee – which ruins her laptop. She sues for the cost of replacing it (covered).





 




 



Sure, imagining all these scenarios is dark. But that’s how insurance companies think. They imagine the worst and help you plan for it.
Let’s say the first scenario happens. A client trips over your laptop cord and shatters her wrist. It's an accident, but she sues you. If that happens, General Liability Insurance can cover your legal expenses, paying for…

Lawyers’ fees.
The damages you owe the client.
The client’s medical bills.
Other lawsuit costs.

That’s how GL works. It picks up the tab for a covered claim over injury, property damage, or slander and makes sure your business isn’t scuttled by a lawsuit or random accident.



 




 



Do You Really Need General Liability Insurance?
We’re a business insurance company, so naturally we think every business should have General Liability Insurance. But it’s not just us.
The Small Business Administration strongly recommends it, and your contractors, clients, and landlords will probably require you to have General Liability Insurance at some point.
Translation: you’re in danger of missing out on a contract if you can't get covered in time to sign on the dotted line. And that's especially true for contracts with big clients.
As your company grows, it becomes more and more likely that bigger clients will require you to have business insurance. To prepare you for that possibility, let’s take a closer look at when and how these insurance requirements come up.



 




 



Why Do IT Businesses Buy General Liability Insurance?
Why do clients, landlords, and third parties want you to have General Liability Insurance coverage?
First, there’s the big-picture reason. As part of their risk management strategy, clients want to work with tech vendors who are financially stable and take measures to protect their company. It’s the same reason you’d want a delivery driver to have car insurance. You want to know he’s legit.
In addition, there are a few tech-specific scenarios that General Liability Insurance can help with…

You’re moving your startup from your garage to an actual office. You’re keeping the ping pong table, but your new landlord won’t sign the lease until you have liability insurance.
You work from a home office, but your Homeowner's policy doesn't cover lawsuits against your business. You need liability coverage in case the delivery man slips and falls while bringing your latest supply of Soylent (who has time for grocery shopping?).
You’re hired as a consultant and need to spend a week coding at a client’s office to make sure the Salesforce app you’re building fits with their systems. You want insurance in case you damage the client’s computers, servers, or office space.
Because you’re working as a freelance developer for a company (and not a regular employee), you’re not covered under its General Liability Insurance and need to carry your own.




 




 



How Much Does General Liability Insurance Cost?
We’ve helped hundreds of thousands of tech businesses find General Liability Insurance, so we’ve got lots of data on policy costs. If you want the long read on GL premiums, you can visit our page on General Liability Insurance costs for information on how size (freelancer vs. small company) and specialty (web designer vs. consulting) affect your premium.
Or you can get the CliffsNotes version:



 




 



 




 







Annual premium for freelancers (approximate):

$425 - $900




Annual (approximate) cost for small tech companies:

$500 - $900




Annual (approximate) cost of coverage for tech businesses with 15 to 60 employees:

$3,600







 




 



These cost estimates are for policies that provide $1 million in coverage for each lawsuit and up to $2 million in total coverage for the policy’s term (usually one year).
The bottom line: for about $50 to $75 per month, small tech businesses can get million-dollar legal protection.
The Business Owner's Policy
Realistically, if you have business liability exposure, you probably also have some business property you want to protect. Whether that’s a laptop and an external hard drive or an office full of gear, it’s essential to your ability to do business and earn money.
If you’re into keeping your gadgets safe but not into spending your whole day pricing insurance policies, consider buying a Business Owner’s Policy (BOP), which includes both General Liability and Commercial Property Insurance: one policy, two types of coverage. Choosing the bundle may even be cheaper than buying the two policies separately.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
