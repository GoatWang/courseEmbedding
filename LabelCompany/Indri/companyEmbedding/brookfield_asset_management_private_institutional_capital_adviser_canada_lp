Large Scale Capital
Our strong balance sheet and ready access to large scale capital enables us to do transactions of a size that sets us apart.

We started as owners and operators of real assets, and continue to use our operational expertise to enhance cash flows, increase the value of underlying assets and produce solid long-term returns.


Contrarian Investors
Our experience shows us that the best opportunities are often found in out-of-favor regions or sectors.

Protecting the capital entrusted to us is at the forefront of how we think about risk, which means that we pursue a prudent and disciplined approach to investing and financing.


Alignment of Interests
Ensuring alignment of interests with our private fund investors is a priority for us: we are often one of the largest investors in our funds.
