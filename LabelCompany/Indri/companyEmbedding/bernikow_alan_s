               Company Size: $250 mil to less than $500 mil - Employee Range: 1,000 to less than 5,000. Destination XL Group, Inc. is the largest omni-channel specialty retailer of big & tall men's apparel with operations throughout the United States and in London, England. The retailer operates under five brands: Destination XL® (DXL®), Casual Male XL, Rochester Clothing, ShoesXL, and LivingXL, with e-commerce sites, including www.destinationxl.com and www.bigandtall.com. With more than 2,000 private label and name-brand styles to choose from, big and tall customers are provided with a unique blend of wardrobe solutions not available at traditional retailers. For the first time, big and tall men can choose from Polo Ralph Lauren®, Brooks Brothers®, Lacoste®, Nautica®, True Religion®, Lucky Brand®, Levi's®, Robert Graham®, Calvin Klein®, Reebok®, Adidas Golf®, and many more. The first 4 DXL® stores opened in 2010 and, at the end of fiscal 2014, the Company had 140 DXL stores open. The company is continuing its rollout strategy and expects to have approximately 230 DXL® stores open by the end of 2017. DXLG's Spring Media Campaign officially kicked off on April 30, 2015 with its second chapter in the 'You're Looking Good' ad campaign. This new series, entitled 'Look and Feel', illustrates the before-and-after 'look and feel' of three DXL customers in humorous, entertaining, and memorable vignettes. Each scenario opens with a man exiting a DXL dressing room, looking stylish and confident, to the announcer's voice stating, "This is how you'll look when you shop at DXL. In the scenes that follow, two of the men crash through the dressing room door - one in "rock star" mode, the other in "football player" mode - while the third man crashes through the store ceiling in "superhero" mode. As these men boast their new personas, the announcer states, "But this is how you'll feel." The spots will be televised on major networks such as: ESPN, CBS, FX and A&E, Comedy Central, Spike, and AMC, among others - and will be strategically placed on highly rated programs including: The Late Show with David Letterman, ESPN Monday Night Baseball, Mike & Mike, 48 Hours, NCIS New Orleans, Hawaii Five-0, and the NBA Playoffs. The campaign will also have a presence on radio, as well as online. This latest effort continues DXLG's long-term strategy of utilizing breakthrough advertising in order to build brand awareness and customer loyalty.
