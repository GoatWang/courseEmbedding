Research Interests
Professor Canizares’s main research interests are high-resolution  spectroscopy and plasma diagnostics of cosmic X-ray sources.  He led the development of the High Resolution  Transmission Grating Spectrometer on NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory and of  the crystal spectrometer on the earlier Einstein Observatory.  He studies the properties of a wide range of  Galactic and extra-Galactic X-ray sources, including active stars, black-hole  or neutron star binaries, supernova remnants, quasars and clusters of  galaxies.  He also uses X-ray sources as  probes of inter-stellar and inter-galactic matter.
Biographical Sketch
He earned his BA, MA and Ph.D. in physics from Harvard University after  which he came to MIT as a postdoctoral fellow and then joined the faculty. He  has served as Director of the Center for Space Research, now the MIT-Kavli  Institute (1990-2001), Associate Provost (2001-2006), Vice President for  Research & Associate Provost (2006-2013), and Vice President (2013-2015).  He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences  and the International Academy of Astronautics and is a fellow of the American  Academy of Arts & Sciences, the American Physical Society, and the American  Association for the Advancement of ScienceHe has served on numerous advisory  committees including the NASA Advisory Council, the National Advisory Council  on Innovation and Entrpreneurship of the Department of Commerce, and the Air  Force Scientific Advisory Board, and chaired the National Academies’ Space  Studies Board. .  He has also received  several awards including decoration for Meritorious Civilian Service to the  United States Air Force, and two NASA Public Service Medals.

Claude R. Canizares


Claude R. Canizares stepped down June 30, 2015 from his post as Vice President of MIT. He remains the Bruno Rossi Professor of Physics at MIT and associate director for MIT of the Chandra X-Ray Observatory Center. He is on sabbatical for the 2015-2016 school year.
Academic career[edit]
Prof. Canizares earned his B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in Physics from Harvard University. He came to MIT as a postdoctoral fellow in 1971 and joined the physics faculty in 1974. In 1984, he was made a full professor.
From 1990 to 2002, Prof. Canizares was the director of MIT's Center for Space Research (now known as the MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research). In 2002, he was appointed Associate Provost and Vice President for Research. He left the Associate Provostship and VPR positions to become VP in 2013.
Canizares is also the principal investigator for the Chandra X-ray Observatory's High Resolution Transmission Grating Spectrometer instrument.
Selected publications[edit]
Prof. Canizares is the author or co-author of more than 170 scientific papers.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
