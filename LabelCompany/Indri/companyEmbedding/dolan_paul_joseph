About Paul Dolan


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dolan_(baseball%29
Paul Joseph Dolan (born 1959 in Chardon, Ohio), is an attorney and Major League Baseball (MLB) team executive who is currently part-owner, chairman, and chief executive officer (CEO) of the Cleveland Indians. Dolan is also the "control person" for the team, as designated by MLB through a vote of team owners.
Career
After graduating from law school, Dolan was hired as an attorney for his father's law firm (Thrasher, Dinsmore, and Dolan), eventually becoming a partner in 1992.
In 2000, Larry Dolan purchased the Cleveland Indians baseball team. Upon his father taking control of the team, Dolan was hired as a vice president and general counsel. In 2004, Dolan was promoted to team president, and in 2011 promoted again to chairman/CEO.
In 2013, Dolan was approved by the team owners of MLB as the "control person" of the Indians; the Associated Press describes this new role as "controlling owner". This new designation means that Dolan oversees the day to day team operations, and is responsible for compliance with MLB rules and regulations.
Though officially listed as Chairman/CEO by the team, Dolan is sometimes referred to as an owner of the Indians, as the team is considered to be a family asset due to being purchased through various Dolan Family trusts.
Family
Dolan's son Peter was selected by the Indians in the 33rd round of the 2014 MLB Draft as a third baseman out of Gilmour Academy. His cousin James is owner of the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association (NBA), and the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL).
