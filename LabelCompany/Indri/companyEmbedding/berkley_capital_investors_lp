                    Our Approach



                    Partners with Management

                    While our portfolio companies benefit from the financial strength of W. R. Berkley Corporation, companies in which we invest
                    operate independently of our parent company. Following an investment, we will work
                    with management at the Board level as partners to define strategic direction and
                    ensure the Company has the required resources to realize opportunities. As our portfolio companies 
                    evaluate new markets, launch new products or seek executive talent, Berkley Capital leverages its 
                    relationships and resources to support the management team in the execution of its strategy. We believe
                    this structure provides our portfolio companies with the access to capital of a
                    large financial institution, and the independence necessary for the businesses to achieve
                    their long-term objectives.
                

                    Patient, Flexible Investment Approach

                    As a result of our permanent source of capital, we are able to support our portfolio
                    companies in ways traditional private equity funds often cannot. In terms of investment
                    horizon, we seek to realize value for all stakeholders at a time that is appropriate
                    for the investment, rather than at a time driven by fund constraints. We also have
                    the ability to provide additional capital resources (either debt or equity) in an
                    expedited manner. This flexibility can be especially valuable as businesses seek
                    to capitalize upon time sensitive opportunities.
                

                    Growth Orientation

                    While we have invested across a range of industries, all of our investments share
                    one characteristic: a distinct orientation towards growth. From early stage growth
                    equity investments to partnerships with more mature businesses, we have worked closely
                    with management teams to identify and execute on expansion opportunities within existing markets,
                    add-on acquisitions, new product introductions and strategic partnerships. We believe
                    that “financial engineering” is insufficient to achieve outstanding risk adjusted
                    returns and focus on identifying industries, companies and management teams actively
                    demonstrating the characteristics needed to achieve sustained growth.

What our customers say ...








                                    I had a great idea with the passion and determination to make it happen, but no matter how hard I tried to raise capital nobody would back me. Then I heard about the Australian Investment Network, so I invested the asking fee and joined up. Within 24hrs I was receiving genuine enquiries and after 3 days I was having difficulty answering everybody. In 4 weeks I pitched over 100 investors, all with varying net worths and investment needs. It only t...                                







Jon Glover @ Quikser
 www.quikser.com                                        








                                    Angel Investment Network provided a good opportunity to talk face to face with a range of potential investors who were interested in hearing more about my business.  We have generated a couple of follow on meetings as a result.                                







Chris Brown @ Frudoo
 www.frudoo.com                                        








                                    We engaged with Angel Investment Network to help secure funding for our first round and were delighted with the results. Not only were we over-subscribed, but the calibre of his investors was incredible. As a result, we are stronger, better funded and with greater traction than we could have hoped to be at this stage.

"Funded.com has been great and my project is in the final stages of being funded by an investor I found on here. I was surprized at the quick process and how fast investors funded my project. Website was a big help!" 

Rick R 
Entreprenuer





Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again. 

Faith D

I am grateful I had the opportunity to access your network of investors. I am reasonably confident that the current negotiations with one of your investors will go through for our film production. I will be back for my next production.

Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning

The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.

Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.
