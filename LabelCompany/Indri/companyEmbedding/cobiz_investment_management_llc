Make your money work for you by earning interest on excess checking account balances. Colorado Business Bank's fully automated overnight sweeps allow you to earn money without needing to forecast cash or manage daily trades. Our sweep accounts are completely liquid, permitting unrestricted use of your checking account without the risk of overdrafts or the inconvenience of manual transfers. You can select from several investment options so your accounts continue to grow outside of your traditional business hours.

Insured Cash Sweep (ICS*®) The Insured Cash Sweep® service is a deposit product with multi-million-dollar FDIC insurance to businesses, not-for-profits and other depositors needing FDIC coverage. You can combine ICS with a Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (CDARS), an interest-bearing CD product, to obtain higher insured limits and protect your deposits. ICS provides access to millions of dollars of FDIC insurance. Within the ICS product there are two options:  a non-interest-bearing account where the balances can be used to offset services fees on analysis and an interest-bearing account that will allow you to earn interest. 

Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (CDARS*®) The Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service®  is the easiest, most convenient way to enjoy full FDIC insurance on deposit amounts larger than $250,000. Your large deposit is broken into smaller amounts and placed with member banks. Those banks issue CDs in amounts under $250,000, so your entire investment is eligible for protection. By providing access to millions of dollars in FDIC insurance, CDARS can be an invaluable investment tool. 

Analysis Interest Checking Our Analysis Interest Checking Account (AIC) provides your not-for-profit organization with a unique combination of benefits rolled into a single checking account or group of checking accounts. Monthly account charges may be offset entirely or in part by a competitive earnings credit calculated on your collected balances, and there are no minimum balance requirements to worry about. With the account, you can use any treasury management and depository service and have your collected balances applied to the cost of the service. Also, you can combine all of your checking accounts under the AIC umbrella so every dollar in your banking relationship can be working to your benefit. 

*Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (CDARS) and Insured Cash Sweep (ICS) are registered service marks of Promontory Interfinancial Network, LLC.
