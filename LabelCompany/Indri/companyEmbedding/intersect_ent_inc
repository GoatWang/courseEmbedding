Localized Steroid-Releasing TechnologyIntersect ENT’s core technology is its bioabsorbable, sustained drug release platform. This advancement in ENT surgery improves patient care and is a cost effective option for preventing the need for postoperative interventions.1  Opens. Delivers. Maintains.PROPEL sinus implants are the first of a new category of products offering localized, controlled drug delivery directly to the sinus tissue.
Inserted to maintain the surgical opening, the springlike implant is placed following surgery and expands to prop open the sinus and gradually deliver an advanced corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory properties directly to the sinus lining as the implant dissolves.
Steroid-Releasing Implants to Improve Sinus Surgery Outcomes
The PROPEL family of steroid-releasing implants may be used for patients post ethmoid, frontal or maxillary surgeries, which represents the majority of chronic sinusitis procedures.

Teresa L. Kline Joins Intersect ENT’s Board of Directors | Business Wire
























































Teresa L. Kline Joins Intersect ENT’s Board of Directors




Health Care Veteran Brings Valuable Provider, Payer Expertise






July 20, 2017 04:05 PM Eastern Daylight Time



MENLO PARK, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Intersect ENT, Inc. (Nasdaq: XENT), a company dedicated to improving the 
      quality of life for patients with ear, nose and throat conditions, today 
      announced the appointment of Teresa (Terri) L. Kline to the company’s 
      board of directors effective August 1, 2017. Current director Casey 
      Tansey, general partner of U.S. Venture Partners (USVP), will step down 
      from the board following more than a decade of service.
    


      Kline is a leader in health care insurance, managed care, physician 
      practice management, and outpatient facility management. As president 
      and CEO of Health Alliance Plan (HAP), a Michigan-based nonprofit health 
      plan providing coverage to nearly 700,000 members, Kline provides 
      strategic, financial, and operational leadership for the organization 
      and its five subsidiaries. She is also an executive vice president of 
      Henry Ford Health System, which is comprised of hospitals, medical 
      centers and one of the nation’s largest group practices, the Henry Ford 
      Medical Group.
    

      “We are thrilled to welcome an advisor of Terri’s caliber to our board. 
      With a career in health care leadership spanning 30 years, her deep 
      provider and payer expertise will be invaluable as we deliver on our 
      commitment to ensuring patients and physicians have access to our 
      technologies,” said Lisa Earnhardt, president and CEO of Intersect ENT.
    

      “I have admired Intersect ENT for its innovative products, great 
      leadership team, and dedication to advancing care for patients, and I’m 
      honored to be joining the company’s board,” said Kline. “I look forward 
      to working with Lisa and with my fellow board members to help realize 
      all of Intersect ENT’s potential.”
    

      Kline’s deep knowledge of health care market dynamics and regulations 
      has enabled her to balance patient, physician, employer, and payer needs 
      throughout her career. Prior to her current role, she served as senior 
      vice president and chief health care management officer for Health Care 
      Service Corporation (HCSC), senior vice president of HealthSouth, CEO of 
      United Healthcare of Georgia, and regional vice president of Aetna 
      Health Plans. Kline also serves on the board of directors of 
      Presbyterian Health Plan in New Mexico. She holds a bachelor’s degree in 
      biology from Kalamazoo College and a master of public health degree from 
      the University of Michigan.
    

      Casey Tansey’s relationship with Intersect ENT dates back to 2006, when 
      he joined the board as the representative of USVP in connection with the 
      firm’s participation in Intersect ENT’s Series A funding.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

MENLO PARK, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Intersect ENT, Inc. (Nasdaq:XENT), a company dedicated to transforming 
      care for patients with ear, nose and throat conditions, today announced 
      that the company has received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA) for its PROPEL® Contour steroid 
      releasing sinus implant. PROPEL Contour features an innovative hourglass 
      design that facilitates treatment of patients with chronic sinusitis in 
      the frontal (behind the forehead) and maxillary (behind the cheeks) 
      sinuses.
    


      With this approval, Intersect ENT’s PROPEL family of steroid releasing 
      implants allows for treatment of patients undergoing ethmoid, frontal or 
      maxillary surgeries, which represent the majority of procedures for the 
      treatment of chronic sinusitis.
    

      PROPEL Contour, the latest in the PROPEL family of steroid releasing 
      sinus implants, is specifically designed to conform to the sinus ostia 
      (openings), focusing drug delivery and mechanical support where it is 
      needed in order to maximize sinus surgery outcomes. The implant features 
      a low-profile flexible delivery system to make it easier to access tight 
      areas of the sinus anatomy.
    

      “The approval of PROPEL Contour adds a third product under the PROPEL 
      umbrella, expanding our offering of steroid releasing implants to 
      improve surgical outcomes,” said Lisa Earnhardt, president and CEO of 
      Intersect ENT. “With its strong clinical evidence, we expect that PROPEL 
      Contour will extend adoption of our sinus implants both in the operating 
      room as well as in the office, and that offering physicians a wide range 
      of products to customize treatment based on their patients’ disease and 
      anatomy will ultimately lead to broader overall usage.”
    

      Positive data from the PROPEL Contour cohort of the PROGRESS study, a 
      prospective, randomized, blinded, multi-center trial of 80 patients 
      designed to assess the safety and efficacy of the implant when placed in 
      the frontal sinuses following surgery, supported the approval. The study 
      met its primary efficacy endpoint, demonstrating a statistically 
      significant 65 percent relative reduction in the need for post-operative 
      interventions, such as the need for additional surgical procedures or 
      the need for oral steroid prescription, compared to surgery alone.
    

      “The introduction of PROPEL steroid releasing implants has led to 
      meaningful benefits in how we as surgeons manage our patients, 
      especially by reducing our reliance on oral steroids to prevent 
      post-operative complications,” said Robert Weiss, M.D., director and 
      founder of CT ENT Sinus and Allergy Hearing and Balance in Norwalk, 
      Conn., and one of the PROGRESS study investigators. “With PROPEL 
      Contour, we are able to offer those benefits to a significant range of 
      our chronic sinusitis patients, regardless of their unique anatomy, and 
      to do so with the comfort of the same rigorous clinical evidence for 
      which the PROPEL family of products is known. With this base of solid 
      evidence pointing to a clear benefit, there are strong reasons to 
      include PROPEL as part of standard clinical practice.”
    

2017 Outlook


      The company expects to launch PROPEL Contour broadly in the second 
      quarter of 2017 and maintains its previously stated 2017 revenue 
      guidance of $87-$89 million.
    

      Management will discuss this outlook, along with recent financial 
      results and business updates, on a conference call scheduled for 
      February 28, 2017 at 4:30 p.m. ET. To access the conference call via the

About PROPEL® Steroid Releasing Sinus 
      Implants


      Intersect ENT’s PROPEL products are the first and only dissolvable 
      steroid releasing sinus implants approved by the FDA. Clinically proven 
      to improve outcomes for chronic sinusitis patients following sinus 
      surgery, PROPEL sinus implants mechanically prop open the sinuses and 
      release mometasone furoate, an advanced corticosteroid with 
      anti-inflammatory properties, directly into the sinus lining then 
      dissolve. PROPEL’s safety and effectiveness is supported by Level 1-A 
      clinical evidence from multiple clinical trials, which demonstrates that 
      PROPEL implants reduce inflammation and scarring after surgery, thereby 
      lessening the need for post-operative oral steroids and repeat surgical 
      interventions. More than 150,000 patients have been treated with PROPEL 
      products to date. PROPEL is indicated for the ethmoid sinus; PROPEL Mini 
      is indicted for the ethmoid and frontal sinuses; PROPEL Contour is 
      indicated for the frontal and maxillary sinuses.
    

About PROPEL® Contour Steroid Releasing 
      Sinus Implant


      PROPEL Contour represents the newest addition to the PROPEL family of 
      dissolvable steroid releasing implants, clinically proven to improve 
      results of sinus surgery. With its unique hourglass shape, PROPEL 
      Contour conforms to sinus ostia, propping sinuses open while delivering 
      anti-inflammatory medication when placed in the operating room or sinus 
      dilation in the physician’s office. PROPEL Contour’s low-profile design 
      allows for placement in smaller sinus openings, like those of the 
      frontal and maxillary sinuses, expanding the applicable patient 
      population for steroid releasing implants.

					Full Description



Intersect ENT, Inc., incorporated on October 6, 2003, is a commercial-stage drug-device company. The Company develops drugs for patients with ear, nose and throat (ENT) conditions. The Company has developed a drug releasing bioabsorbable implant technology that enables targeted and sustained release of therapeutic agents. This targeted drug delivery technology is designed to allow ENT physicians to manage patient care. The Company's commercial products are the PROPEL and PROPEL mini drug-releasing implants for patients undergoing sinus surgery to treat chronic sinusitis. The Company is building a portfolio of products based on its drug releasing bio-absorbable implant technology that are designed to provide localized drug delivery to treat patients across the continuum of care in chronic sinusitis.The Company markets PROPEL, which is indicated for use following ethmoid sinus surgery, and PROPEL Mini, which is indicated for use following ethmoid and/or frontal sinus surgery. It has also received approval of PROPEL Contour. PROPEL Contour is approved for use in the frontal and maxillary sinus ostia, or openings. In addition, the Company has also completed clinical evaluations of RESOLVE, its pipeline products. PROPEL implants are designed to manage the outcomes of sinus surgery by holding open the sinus passageways, thereby reducing postoperative inflammation and scarring. These implants are inserted by a physician under endoscopic visualization following sinus surgery.The Company has designed the RESOLVE steroid releasing implant to be placed in the physician office setting during a routine visit as an alternative treatment option for patients who are candidates for revision surgery. The implant is based on the same drug releasing bioabsorbable implant technology as PROPEL, but is designed to have more radial strength in order to dilate an obstructed, polyp-filled sinus cavity, and deliver drug for an extended period of time.The Company competes with Medtronic, Olympus, Johnson & Johnson, Stryker, Smith & Nephew and Entellus.
