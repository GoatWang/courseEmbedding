NASCAR and ISC[edit]
The son of NASCAR co-founder William Henry Getty France, Jim France began working for his father at ISC in 1959, aged 14 years, and ultimately acceded to the ISC presidency in 1987.[2] With his brother Bill France, Jr., he inherited control of NASCAR and ISC upon his father's death in 1992, and, a member, and for a time secretary, of the board of directors of NASCAR, he served influentially[2][3][4] as an advisor to his brother through the latter's retirement as NASCAR president in 2000 and as NASCAR CEO and chairman of the board in 2004; France, Jr., explained in 2000 that his singular prominence notwithstanding, the two jointly guided NASCAR and ISC, joking that, "In the past, we'd have a board meeting in the hall. My brother and I would meet and shoot the breeze for a few minutes".[5] Upon the accession of Brian France to the chairmanship of NASCAR in 2003, Jim France served his nephew in a similar advisory role, most significantly after the 2007 death of France, Jr.[2]
Grand American Road Racing Association[edit]
In 1999, France founded the Grand American Road Racing Association, a sanctioning body for various forms of road racing in North America, finally the governing entity for five series, including the Rolex Sports Car Series, the successor to the United States Road Racing Championship and the sponsor of the 24 Hours of Daytona; the Koni Challenge Series, a two-class touring car league; and the SunTrust Moto-ST Series, an endurance racing motorcycle series; the Association also operates the North American arm of the international Ferrari Challenge.
Worth[edit]
With a 2007 estimated net worth of US$1.5 billion, France was ranked, as his brother, by Forbes as the 664th-richest person in the world[1] and as the third-wealthiest American motorsports personage.[6]

He has trained me and coached me 3 times per week for almost one year and I have transformed my body and my mind. Not only has he made me fit and strong (I have visible muscles I never knew existed!) but he has changed my attitude and outlook on life. James' coaching has taught me that I can do anything I set my mind to and that I can change my behavior and food and exercise choices to become the fit and happy person I always wanted to be. It was difficult for me at first, but James was there every step of the way, encouraging and teaching me. I make smarter choices every day and am so proud of myself and James is so proud of me as well. I owe him a huge debt of gratitude.See moreSee lessI worked with James in efforts to achieve personal physical fitness goals resulting unexpected positive results outside of just physical fitness.  His approach encompassed much more than what happened at the gym, or my diet, or physical appearance..... He totally changed my mindset enabling me to re-prioritize many areas of my life translating into a much healthier lifestyle in all aspects of it.  Simply put he inspired me to feel better 1st, and the body will follow..... His dedication, positive attitude and sincerity has had much longer term payoff in my life as a whole than just losing a little weight and toning up... And still impacts my daily life since working with him.. James "Neuro-Fit" program is the real definition of "getting in shape". Thanks James...

Book description 





This major new textbook addresses fundamental questions about the nature of the state in early modern Europe through an analysis of the most important continental state, France. Professor Collins abandons the traditional formulation of the absolute monarchy, and presents in its place a state that evolved to meet the needs of the French elites. Collins offers a detailed analysis of French society, to provide the broader context for the development of the French state. The model that emerges from his synthesis is one that relied more on persuasion and congruity of influence than on arbitrary authority, and Collins argues that fundamental changes in French society made the monarchical, ministerial state a dangerous anachronism by the 1750s, leading to political impasse by the second half of the eighteenth century. Collins offers a fundamental reinterpretation of the state relevant to historians and students of political thought.






Reviews





‘The reader who savours the full pleasures of this book will be able to feel that he or she, at the end of it all, has a real grasp of both what happened in the old Bourbon state and how it functioned, changed and came apart. One could scarcely ask more of an introductory work; and one can only regret that more supposedly ‘introductory’ textbooks do not come up to Professor Collins’s exacting standards.’
