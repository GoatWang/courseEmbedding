To the Thompson Family, May each of you find comfort in knowing that God is "near to those that are broken at heart; and those who are crushed in spirit he saves." Psalm 34;18  He has promised to soon "swallow up death forever...and wipe the tears from all faces." Isaiah 25;8  Take care,

						Message from Mrs. Watkins 

			June 10, 2009 12:00 AM	
		




I want to express my sincere sympathy for the loss of your loved one. You can beassured that comfort and  hope are found in the pages of the Bible. Revelations 21:4 speaks of a time when  sorrow will be no more. This is a wonderful hope during our times of grief and pain.  Please take care of yourselves.Sincerely Mrs. Watkins

I am so thankful, that I had the pleasure to meet and be Bim's sister-in-law. I will miss him very much! Here is a poem I found to share with Bim's family and friends.


You were my dearest friend
Until the day the Lord took you.
In my mind, you will always stay
Memories and love from us, in our hearts.
My brother, My friend
up in Heaven, where you are safe.
I picture you in absolute peace,
up in the sky, dancing with angels.
You are care-free and happy
My brother, My friend
I will always miss you
I will forever love you
I will remember you all of my days
When I leave this world, I know you will be waiting.
I love you
My Brother, My Friend
