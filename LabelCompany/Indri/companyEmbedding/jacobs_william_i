			William I. Jacobs has served as our Chairperson of the Board since June 2016. He has also served as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Global Payments, Inc., a payment processing services company, since June 2014. In addition, he served as Lead Independent Director of that company from 2003 to May 2014 and has served as one of its business advisors since August 2002. Mr. Jacobs currently serves as Chair of its Compensation Committee and as a member of its Governance and Nominating Committee, and previously served on that company's Audit Committee. Prior to joining Global Payments, Mr. Jacobs served as Managing Director and Chief Financial Officer of The New Power Company, a retail energy company, from 2000 to 2002. From 1995 to 2000, Mr. Jacobs served in senior roles at MasterCard International, including serving as it Senior Executive Vice President, Strategic Ventures from 1999 to 2000 and as its Executive Vice President, Global Resources from 1995 to 1999. Prior to MasterCard, Mr. Jacobs served as Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer of Financial Security Assurance, Inc., a bond insurance company, from 1984 to 1994. Mr. Jacobs previously served on the board of directors of Asset Acceptance Capital Corp., a publicly-traded debt collection company, from 2004 to June 2013, when that company merged with Encore Capital Group, Inc. He also served as a member of the board of directors of Investment Technology Group, Inc., a publicly-traded electronic trading resources company, from June 1994 to March 2008 and Alpharma, Inc., a publicly-traded specialty pharmaceutical company, from May 2002 to May 2006. In addition to serving as board chair for Global Payments and Green Dot, Mr. Jacobs currently serves on the board of directors of a private company and serves as an advisor to a private equity firm. Mr. Jacobs holds a B.S. degree in business administration from The American University and a J.D. from The Washington College of Law of The American University. We believe Mr. Jacobs should serve as a member of our Board of Directors based on his extensive management experience in the financial services sector, including in finance and operations and his experience as a board member of other public companies, including committee service. In particular, we believe Mr. Jacobs' experience as a long-serving member on the board of directors of Global Payments, including serving as Chairman during the period of time that company announced one of the largest acquisitions ever in the payments industry, will provide Green Dot with highly relevant and specific expertise in the payments and financial services industries.
