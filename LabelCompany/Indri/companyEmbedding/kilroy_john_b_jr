This tremendous opportunity for growth cemented the company’s enduring focus on innovation and technology. But by the time John Jr. took the helm, he found KI’s private financial structure prevented competition with larger peers. Despite differing opinions, John took the company public in January 1997 when the REIT structure proved viable for investment and provided access to greater capital through public markets. This bold move ultimately unlocked the company’s potential. Now operating in every major West Coast market, Kilroy has over 15.8 million SF either stabilized or in development for today’s creative leaders.In the face of market fluctuations, John consistently turns obstacles into opportunities. From 2005-2007 Kilroy made few acquisitions, instead building campuses for low-risk tenants like Intuit, Cardinal Health and Scripps Health. After the recession, Kilroy was one of the first companies on the West Coast to take advantage of dislocation within the market and expand into some of the strongest markets in the country, including Hollywood, San Francisco and Seattle. In the last five years of market rebound, John assumed more risk, by acquiring strategic properties at below replacement cost and selling non-strategic assets in order to finance more value creating developments, in turn, tripling Kilroy’s enterprise value. From central decisions like design, location and amenities, to providing great customer service to tenants and service providers alike, John takes an active role in the success of each project. Employing smart strategy through his well-coordinated team, John has carried this former family business into the modern age.

	John B. Kilroy Jr.



News After 65 Years, Kilroy Steps Down at Firm
Robert Carr | Feb 28, 2013



































LOS ANGELES—The son has taken over for the father at Kilroy Realty Corp, as John B. Kilroy Sr. has retired, and John Kilroy Jr. replaces him as chairman.

	Kilroy, Sr. founded the businesses in 1947 and has served as the publicly traded real estate investment trust’s chairman since its initial public offering in 1997, though he turned over the day-to-day leadership to son John in 1981. The company has owned, developed, acquired and managed real estate assets primarily in the coastal regions of Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego, the San Francisco Bay Area and greater Seattle, and now has 13.2 million rentable sq. ft. of commercial office space.

	“My father helped create what, today, we take for granted—a professional real estate industry committed to meeting the needs of individual tenants and minimizing the capital investment and management responsibilities associated with owning commercial property,” says John Kilroy Jr.

	In recognition of the senior Kilroy, the company has established the Kilroy Scholarship at Loyola Marymount University with a gift of $100,000 each year for the next 10 years. The Kilroy Scholarship will support undergraduate students in the Frank R. Seaver College of Science and Engineering who are pursuing a degree in Environmental Science. This scholarship will allow academically deserving LMU students in financial need to pursue a high caliber education and enter careers in areas such as environmental protection, environmental education and natural resource management.

Employment Agreement for John B.
Kilroy, Jr.
 



THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT by and
between KILROY REALTY CORPORATION, a Maryland corporation (the
“Company”), Kilroy Realty, L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership (the “Operating Partnership”) and John B.
Kilroy, Jr. (“Executive”) is effective as of
January 1, 2007 (the “Effective Date”). This
Employment Agreement (the “Agreement”) supersedes and
replaces in its entirety Executive’s employment agreement,
dated as of January 1, 1997, with the Company and Operating
Partnership (the “Prior Employment Agreement”). Rights
and obligations of the parties for periods prior to the Effective
Date, and any related remedies, shall remain subject to the terms
of the Prior Employment Agreement, which shall remain enforceable
for that purpose.

W I T N E S S E T H

WHEREAS, the Company desires to
continue to employ Executive as Chief Executive Officer and
President of the Company, and Executive desires to continue in such
employment on the terms and conditions herein set forth.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of
the foregoing, the mutual covenants contained herein, and other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which
the Company and Executive each hereby acknowledge, the Company and
Executive hereby agree as follows:
 



 


1.


Employment.




The Company and Operating
Partnership hereby agree to continue to employ Executive as their
Chief Executive Officer and President, and Executive hereby agrees
to accept and continue in such employment during the Term as
defined in Section 2 (subject to Section 7(c)) and to
serve in such capacities from and after the Effective Date, upon
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. The
allocation of the rights and obligations between the Company and
the Operating Partnership shall be determined by separate agreement
of those parties. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
“Company” shall be understood to include the Operating
Partnership, unless the context otherwise requires.
 



 


2.


Term.




The term of employment of Executive
under this Agreement (the “Term”) shall be the period
commencing on the Effective Date and ending on December 31,
2009 and any period of extension thereof in accordance with this
Section 2, except that the Term will end at a date, prior to
the end of such period or extension thereof, specified in
Section 6 or 7 in the event of termination of
Executive’s employment. The Term, if not previously ended,
shall be extended



automatically without further action by either
party by one additional year (added to the end of the Term) first
on December 31, 2009 (extending the Term to December 31,
2010) and on each succeeding December 31 thereafter, unless
either party shall have served written notice in accordance with
Section 13(d) upon the other party at least 90 days before the
December 31 extension date electing not to extend the Term
further as of that December 31 extension date, in which case
employment shall terminate on that December 31 and the Term
shall end at that date, subject to earlier termination of
employment and earlier termination of the Term in accordance with
Section 6 or 7.
 



 


3.


Offices and
Duties.




The provisions of this
Section 3 will apply during the Term, except as otherwise
provided in Section 7(c):

(a) Generally . Executive
shall serve as the Chief Executive Officer and President of the
Company and shall be nominated and, if elected, shall serve as a
member of the Board of Directors of the Company (the
“Board”) and, for so long as he is serving on the
Board, Executive agrees to serve as a member of any Board committee
if the Board shall elect Executive to such committee. In any and
all such capacities, Executive shall report only to the Board of
Directors of the Company. Executive shall have and perform such
duties, responsibilities, and authorities as are customary for the
chief executive officer and president of a publicly held
corporation of the size, type, and nature of the Company as they
may exist from time to time and consistent with such position and
status. In addition, if the Company and Executive mutually agree,
Executive may serve the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates
in other offices and capacities; provided that, if
Executive’s service in any such additional office or capacity
ceases, such cessation shall have no effect on the compensation
payable hereunder.

(b) Devotion of Time and
Effort . Executive shall devote substantially all of his
business time and attention, and his best efforts, abilities,
experience, and talent, to the positions of Chief Executive Officer
and President and for the businesses of the Company without
commitment to other business endeavors, except that Executive
(i) may make personal investments which are not in conflict
with his duties to the Company and manage personal and family
financial and legal affairs, (ii) may undertake public
speaking engagements, and (iii) may serve as a director of (or
similar position with) any educational, charitable, community,
civic, religious, or similar type of organization, or, with the
approval of the Board, a for-profit business, provided, however,
serving as a director of a for-profit business in which the
Executive is engaged pursuant to subsection (iv) shall not
require the approval of the Board and (iv) may engage in
for-profit activities, which activities may include real estate
development activities in regions in which the Company is not
engaged in business and non-competitive activities in areas with
which the Company is not involved and which are not in conflict
with the companies activities, so long as such activities listed in
clauses (i) through (iv) do not preclude or render
unlawful Executive’s employment or service to the Company or
otherwise materially inhibit the performance of Executive’s
duties under this Agreement or impair the business of the Company
or its subsidiaries.

(c) Place of Employment .
Executive’s principal place of employment shall be at the
Company’s principal executive offices in Los Angeles,
California.

4.


Salary and
Annual Incentive Compensation.




As partial compensation for the
services to be rendered hereunder by Executive, the Company agrees
to pay to Executive during the Term the compensation set forth in
this Section 4.

(a) Base Salary . The Company
will pay to Executive during the Term a base salary at the annual
rate of $950,000, payable commencing at the beginning of the Term
in accordance with the Company’s usual payroll practices with
respect to senior executives (except to the extent deferred under
Section 5(c)). Executive’s annual base salary shall be
reviewed by the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board (the
“Committee”) each year of the Term, beginning in 2007,
and may be increased above, but may not be reduced below, the
then-current rate of such base salary. For purposes of this
Agreement, “Base Salary” means Executive’s
then-current base salary.

(b) Annual Incentive
Compensation . During the Term, Executive will be eligible to
receive an annual cash award (the “Annual Cash Award”)
and an annual stock incentive award (the “Annual Stock
Incentive”) which shall offer to Executive an opportunity to
earn additional compensation based upon performance in amounts
determined by the Committee in accordance with the applicable plan;
provided, however, that (i) the annual target incentive
opportunity for the Annual Cash Award shall be not less than
$2,000,000 (which $2,000,000 is the “Annual Cash
Target”), up to 25% of which may be payable, in the
Company’s sole discretion, in Company stock, and
(ii) the annual target incentive opportunity for the Annual
Stock Incentive shall be not less than $3,000,000 (which $3,000,000
is the “Annual Stock Target”), in either case, for
achievement of target level performance, with the nature of the
performance and the levels of performance triggering payments of
such target Annual Cash Award and target Annual Stock Incentive for
each year to be established after consultation with Executive and
communicated to Executive during the first quarter of such year by
the Committee. The Annual Cash Award and the Annual Stock Incentive
paid may be more or less than the annual target incentive
opportunity based on the Company’s actual performance in
relation to the target level performance. In addition, the
Committee (or the Board) may determine, in its discretion, to
increase Executive’s target incentive opportunity or provide
an additional incentive opportunity, in excess of the target
incentive opportunity, payable for performance in excess of or in
addition to the performance required for payment of the target
incentive amount. Any annual incentive compensation payable to
Executive shall be paid in accordance with the Company’s
usual practices with respect to payment of incentive compensation
to senior executives (except to the extent deferred under
Section 5(c)).
 



 


5.


Long-Term
Compensation, Benefits, Deferred Compensation, and Expense
Reimbursement.




(a) Executive Compensation
Plans . Executive shall be entitled during the Term to
participate, without discrimination or duplication, in all
executive compensation plans and programs intended for general
participation by senior executives of the Company, as presently in
effect or as they may be modified or added to by the Company from
time to time, subject to the eligibility and other requirements of
such plans and programs.
 
3




During the Term, Executive shall be
eligible to participate in any Outperformance Incentive Award plan
(including any similar plan or other substitute plan) that may be
adopted by the Board in its sole discretion on terms that are at
least as favorable to those made available to other senior
executives of the Company in accordance with the terms of the
applicable program document.

(b) Employee and Executive
Benefit Plans . Executive shall be entitled during the Term to
participate, without discrimination or duplication, in all employee
and executive benefit plans and programs of the Company, as
presently in effect or as they may be modified or added to by the
Company from time to time, to the extent such plans are generally
available to other senior executives or employees of the Company,
subject to the eligibility and other requirements of such plans and
programs, including, without limitation, plans providing retirement
benefits, medical insurance, life insurance, disability insurance,
and accidental death or dismemberment insurance, as well as
savings, profit-sharing, 401(k) and stock ownership plans. In
addition, Executive shall be eligible to participate in and receive
or participate in perquisites under policies implemented by the
Board and the Committee. It is understood that no minimum level of
perquisites is guaranteed hereunder, and that the Company may make
available compensation and benefits to one or more individual
executives that will not be deemed “generally
available” to senior executives.

In furtherance of and not in
limitation of the foregoing, during the Term:
 



 


(i)


Executive will
participate as Chief Executive Officer and President in all
executive and employee vacation and time-off programs; provided
that Executive shall be entitled to a minimum of 25 business days
of vacation annually; and



 



 


(ii)


The Company
shall provide Executive with a term or whole life insurance policy
during the Term and the Severance Period in the amount of
$10,000,000 (the “Life Insurance Policy”);
and



 



 


(iii)


The Company
shall pay or reimburse Executive for tax and financial planning
services subject to an annual maximum of $25,000 provided that such
payment or reimbursement by the Company shall be made no later than
the fifteenth day of the third month following the end of the
calendar year in which Executive incurred such expense; provided,
further, that Executive shall have provided a reimbursement request
to the Company no later than 30 days prior to the date the
reimbursement is due; and



 



 


(iv)


The Company
shall reimburse the executive for the cost of an annual physical
examination which is not paid for or reimbursed under the
Company’s medical insurance, and Executive shall be required
under this Agreement to undergo an annual physical examination by a
qualified medical doctor (MD); and



 



 


(v)


The Company
shall provide Executive with a reasonable automobile allowance
during the Term, subject to and on a basis consistent with Company
policy on the Effective Date.




(c) Deferral of Compensation
. If the Company has in effect or adopts any deferral
 
4



program or arrangement permitting executives to
elect to defer any compensation, Executive will be eligible to
participate in such program on terms no less favorable than the
terms of participation of any other senior executive officer of the
Company. Any plan or program of the Company which provides benefits
based on the level of salary, annual incentives, or other
compensation of Executive shall, in determining Executive’s
benefits, take into account the amount of salary, annual
incentives, or other compensation prior to any reduction for
voluntary contributions made by Executive under any deferral or
similar contributory plan or program of the Company, but shall not
treat any payout or settlement under such a deferral or similar
contributory plan or program to be additional salary, annual
incentives, or other compensation for purposes of determining such
benefits, unless otherwise expressly provided under such plan or
program.

(d) Reimbursement of Expenses
. The Company will promptly reimburse Executive for all reasonable
business expenses and disbursements incurred by Executive in the
performance of Executive’s duties during the Term in
accordance with the Company’s reimbursement policies as in
effect from time to time.

(e) Office, Staff and
Equipment . The Company agrees to provide to Executive such
staff, equipment and office space as is reasonably necessary for
Executive to perform his duties hereunder, subject to and on a
basis consistent with Company policy on the Effective
Date.

(f) Company Registration
Obligations . The Company will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and
thereafter maintain the effectiveness of one or more registration
statements registering under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the “1933 Act”), the offer and sale of shares by the
Company to Executive pursuant to any stock option or other
equity-based awards granted to Executive under Company plans or
otherwise or, if shares are acquired by Executive in a transaction
not involving an offer or sale to Executive but resulting in the
acquired shares being “restricted securities” for
purposes of the 1933 Act, registering the reoffer and resale of
such shares by Executive.

(g) Limitations Under Code
Section 409A . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in the event that, as a result of Section 409A of
the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) (and any related
regulations or other pronouncements), any of the payments that
Executive is entitled to under the terms of this Agreement or any
other plan involving deferred compensation (as defined under Code
Section 409A) may not be made at the time contemplated by the
terms thereof without causing the Executive to be subject to
constructive receipt at a date prior to actual payment and/or an
income tax penalty and interest and the timing of payment is the
sole cause of such adverse tax consequences, the Company will make
such payment on the first day permissible under Code
Section 409A without the Executive incurring such adverse tax
consequences. In particular, with respect to any lump sum payment
otherwise required hereunder, in the event of any delay in the
payment date as a result of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) and
(B)(i), the Company will adjust the payments to reflect the
deferred payment date by crediting interest thereon at the prime
rate in effect at the time such amount first becomes payable, as
quoted by the Company’s principal bank. In addition, other
provisions of this Agreement or any other such plan
notwithstanding, the Company shall have no right to accelerate any
such payment or to make any such payment as the result of any
specific event except to the extent permitted under
Section 409A. The Company shall not be obligated to reimburse
Executive for any tax penalty or interest or provide a gross-up in
connection with any
 
5



tax liability of Executive under
Section 409A.

compensation earned by Executive hereunder;



 



 


(iv)


All equity

governed by the plans and programs and the agreements and other
documents pursuant to which such options were granted (subject to

at the date of such termination, and, in other respects, such
awards shall be governed by the plans and programs and the
agreements and other documents pursuant to which such awards were
granted;



 



 


(vi)


All deferral
arrangements under Section 5(c) will be settled in accordance
with the plans and programs governing the deferral; and



 



 


(vii)


All other
rights under any other compensatory or benefit plan, including any
deferral under Section 5(c), shall be governed by such plan.
In addition, at Company’s expense, Executive and his spouse
and dependent children shall be entitled to continuation of health
insurance coverage (i.e., medical, dental and vision) under the
Company’s group health plan(s) in which the Executive was

10




Payments and benefits under this
Section 7(c) are subject to Section 5(g). In particular,
payments under Sections 7(c)(ii) and (iii) likely will be
required under Section 5(g) to be made at the date six months
after termination of employment.

(d) Termination by Executive for
Good Reason . Executive may terminate his employment hereunder
for Good Reason upon 90 days’ written notice to the Company;
provided, however, that, if the basis for such Good Reason is
correctible and the Company has corrected the basis for such Good
Reason within 30 days after receipt of such notice, Executive may
not then terminate his employment for Good Reason with respect to
the matters addressed in the written notice, and therefore
Executive’s notice of termination will automatically become
null and void. At the time Executive’s employment is
terminated by Executive for Good Reason (i.e., at the expiration of
such notice period), the Term will terminate, all obligations of
the Company and Executive under Sections 1 through 5 will
immediately cease (except as expressly provided below), and the
Company will pay Executive, and Executive will be entitled to
receive, the same compensation and rights specified in

clause (vii).

If any payment or benefit under this
Section 7(d) is based on Base Salary or other level of
compensation or benefits at the time of Executive’s
termination and if a reduction in such Base Salary or other level
of compensation or benefit was the basis for Executive’s
termination for Good Reason, then the Base Salary or other level of
compensation in effect before such reduction shall be used to
calculate payments or benefits under this
Section 7(d).

(e) Other Terms Relating to
Certain Terminations of Employment . In the event
Executive’s employment terminates for any reason set forth in
Section 7(b) through (d), Executive will be entitled to the
benefit of any terms of plans or agreements applicable to Executive
which are more favorable than those specified in this
Section 7 (except without duplication of payments or benefits,
including in the case of Annual Incentives in lieu of which amounts
are paid hereunder). Except as otherwise provided under
Section 5(g), amounts payable under this Section 7
following Executive’s termination of employment, other than
those expressly payable on a deferred or installment basis, will be
paid as promptly as practicable after such a termination of
employment. References to the amount of compensation paid as salary
and Annual Incentives in previous years includes payments to
Executive by the Company and Operating Partnership in periods prior
to the Effective Date.

The Company and the Operating
Partnership, and any successor(s) thereto, shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to allow Executive to receive long
term capital gain treatment for federal income tax purposes for all
interests held by Executive in the Operating Partnership at the
time of termination of Executive’s employment (provided,
that, nothing herein shall prevent Company from terminating
Executive’s employment), and the Company and the Operating
Partnership, and any successor(s) thereto, shall reasonably
cooperate with Executive to obtain favorable tax treatment for
Executive with regard to all interests held by Executive in the
Operating Partnership.

An employment agreement is a document which delineates the terms of the relationship between an employer and employee. If you are hiring a new employee, this document can help form a solid foundation for your business relationship. The document will specify expectations for both parties and may include items such as terms of conduct, employee benefits, vacation time, medical leave, hours, and other issues that may be up for consideration, depending on the business' needs.

An employment agreement might also incorporate arbitration conditions, confidentiality terms and non-compete clauses, provided that separate documents do not address these issues. Some employers may include a progressive disciplinary policy section in the agreement, wherein conditions and repercussions for employee misconduct are explained.

Once signed, an employment agreement is a legally binding contract that can be enforced in a court of law. Often an employer or company makes their offer of employment contingent on an employee signing the agreement.
