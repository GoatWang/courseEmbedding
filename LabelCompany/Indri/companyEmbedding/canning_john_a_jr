Shia Kapos Takes Names

John Canning Jr. on why baseball is all


He has stepped away from the day-to-day challenges of running a successful private-equity investment firm, but John Canning Jr. is not out of the game by any means. “Nothing excites me more than generating transactions,” says the chairman of Madison Dearborn Partners LLC, pointing to its most recent purchase, Cary-based Sage Products Inc., a health care product manufacturer. Still, with two CEOs taking care of the business, Mr. Canning, 68, acknowledges that he has more time for other passions—his Brady Bunch family, baseball, a scholarship program for needy kids, and museums. Mr. Canning sat down for a discussion, agreeing to talk about anything but business. He has an easygoing manner and admits to being trigger-happy and gaffe-prone with emails (mistakenly hitting “reply” instead of “forward”).  It was five years ago that Mr. Canning was in the throes of a bidding war for the Cubs. His buyers group was a front-runner, maybe in part because Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig is a friend, but when the bidding got to the billions, he was nudged out. Then the economy tanked and businessman Tom Ricketts' family claimed the team for just less than $1 billion, about the same price Mr. Canning initially had bid. Today, he says he's glad to have lost out on the franchise. “I couldn't stand the spotlight. I started to really dislike that part of it,” says Mr. Canning, talking in his 46th-floor office in the Loop. “Besides, I'm a Sox fan.” And he has a thing for the Brewers. Along with owning an 11 percent stake in the team, he has some sentimental love for Milwaukee. When he was just out of high school, Mr. Canning tried out for the Braves before the team moved to Atlanta. “They had four days of tryouts. And in four days I got one hit in 25 tries. I was the slowest guy there. So I played in college and ended my career,” he says. His passion for the game never waned, however.



















Mr. Canning has a stake in four minor-league teams and is a regular at games in Chicago and Milwaukee, and in Phoenix for spring training. He still had color on his cheeks from a trip to Arizona earlier in March with his wife, Rita, and some of their large brood. “We like to travel together,” says Mr. Canning of bringing their children and grandchildren along for spring training. The Cannings each have three grown children from previous marriages and nine grandchildren, all under age 10. It was a raucous vacation compared to the one he and Ms. Canning took earlier this year to South Africa. Unlike some of their peers, they don't hunt, but they relish views of the countryside. This trip had them lounging on the famed Blue Train. “You can dress for dinner, smoke cigars. It's like Downton Abbey. I loved it,” Mr. Canning says. Back in Chicago, he juggles business with work on the scholarship program he runs through the Big Shoulders Fund. The Cannings offer 100 scholarships to needy children who want to attend Catholic schools. Mr. Canning isn't Catholic—or religious for that matter, he says—but he likes the program. In response to Chicago Public Schools closing some schools, he is adding 50 more scholarships. Mr. Canning also is on the board of Northwestern Memorial Hospital and chairs the Economic Club. And a year after he stepped down as board chair of the Field Museum, his name has popped up as a possible successor to the late David Speer, who was chairman of the Museum of Science and Industry. He says he likes how the museum operates because it relies on exhibits instead of research. The museum world, he says, is facing the challenge of a flat economy and pricey traveling exhibits. “They've all got to think out of the box to succeed.”   Read more from Shia Kapos on her blog.
