DSC Exhaust Wrap       Buy DSC Wrap Now
Sales Territory: Worldwide
Increase engine performance   and improve generator efficiency today. Insulating and heat wrapping generator engine   exhaust system components increases exhaust scavenging and horsepower, removes horsepower-robbing radiant heat that comes from the enclosure or building, and prolongs the life of the   engine and its vital fluids. Maintaining hotter exhaust   gases throughout the exhaust system    decreases density and allows the exhaust gas to exit the system   faster and cleaner (helping to   fight wet stacking).  Furthermore,   it insulates the hot exhaust system from its surroundings, thereby decreasing   the ambient air temperature in the enclosure or generator room. Its a win-win for both you and your customer giving an added level of protection for the equipment and offering a valuable service. We  offer both 1200°F continuous and 2000°F   intermittent in 1" / 2" wide 25' / 50' rolls. In   addition, we offer stainless steel ties to secure it to pipes up to   6" in diameter (stainless steel safety wire & hose clamps are equally   effective). DSC Exhaust Wrap Brochure
