Lawrence David returns to CV Show with new products15 March 2017Roger BrownProduct












Trailer manufacturer Lawrence David will return to the CV Show with a new builder‚Äôs merchant dropside rigid truck with Hiab crane and brick stack grapple on its stand.
The truck has a modular build, enabling equipment to be configured to different customer requirements, and interlocking aluminium flooring suitable for heavy payloads.The crane is mounted on an integral heavy-duty baseframe while the aluminium dropsides have integrated access steps with complete access to the load bay.
There is a 360-degree camera on the truck to eliminate blind spots and a pneumatically raised and lowered spray suppression system.
Lawrence David will also be displaying a new concept home delivery van body that features a bonded box body with better aerodynamics. There is also a rear camera for greater visibility in urban environments.
New innovations on display will include a modular hybrid second deck that includes a pre-galvanised steel frame with non-slip open-grid floor as well as yellow gratings that improve visibility and highlight a deck that is being loaded at height.
Lawrence David said the design means it is easier to replace individual damaged components.

Lawrence David Launches Online Product Support
12/01/2010
Epitomy Solutions, the Product Information Management (PIM) specialist, is pleased to announce the implementation of its PIM portal for Lawrence David Trailers ‚Äì the first of its kind to be introduced to the UK trailer market.
The Peterborough-based manufacturer commissioned Epitomy to design a solution which would support its dealer network, enabling users to quickly and effectively identify parts by chassis number, check stock and place orders via the Internet.
‚ÄúTypically, maintenance of commercial vehicles takes place outside usual business hours‚Äù, recognises Andrew Vernon, Eptiomy‚Äôs Managing Director. ‚ÄúTherefore 24/7 online access to product support information ‚Äì and the capability to place orders at any time ‚Äì adds value to both Lawrence David‚Äôs customer service offering and its customers‚Äô operations.‚Äù
James Walker, Commercial Director at Lawrence David, adds ‚ÄúI am delighted that Lawrence David is at the forefront of customer support with Epitomy‚Äôs PIM service. Early customer feedback suggests dealers like the portal‚Äôs ease of use and have quickly adopted the technology.‚Äù He continues, ‚ÄúThey appreciate that, unlike with a paper catalogue, we can update the portal immediately with new parts, supersessions and offers."
The immediate benefits have been related to better parts identification. In a matter of months order errors from part misidentification have diminished to zero ‚Äì and in-bound product support calls have reduced by 70%. Much of this is due to the Trailer Search facility which returns the Bill of Materials by chassis number for the specified trailer. Narrowing the search in this way dramatically reduces the risk of order error.
Furthermore, these specific trailers can be added to a list of ‚Äòfavourites‚Äô ‚Äì which can then be filtered, sorted and searched ‚Äì making fleet maintenance easier. The introduction of the portal has also helped facilitate the company‚Äôs diversification into offering chassis parts to its dealers.
