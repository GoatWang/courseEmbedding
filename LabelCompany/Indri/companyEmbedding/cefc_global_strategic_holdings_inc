	CAUTION
	REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION





	 




	All
	statements contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”), other than statements of historical facts,
	that address future activities, events or developments are forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements
	containing the words “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect” and words of similar import.  These
	statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by us in light of our experience and our assessment of historical
	trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances.  However,
	whether actual results will conform to the expectations and predictions of management is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties
	that may cause actual results to differ materially.  Such risks may include, among others, the following: national and
	local general economic and market conditions; our ability to sustain, manage or forecast our growth; raw material costs and availability;
	new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government
	regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting
	operating results; changes in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain
	qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; and other factors referenced in this and previous filings.




	 




	Consequently,
	all of the forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-Q are qualified by these cautionary statements and there can be no
	assurance that the actual results anticipated by management will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will
	have the expected consequences to or effects on our business operations.

	CEFC
	GLOBAL STRATEGIC HOLDINGS, INC.








	NOTES
	TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






	November
	30, 2016






	(Unaudited)






	 






	1.              BASIS
	OF PRESENTATION





	 




	CEFC
	Global Strategic Holdings, Inc., (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 23, 2010, and
	its year-end is February 28.  In connection with the change of control which occurred on August 22, 2012, the Company
	intends to operate a trading business for oil, fuel and other petroleum products.  In connection with its planned business
	operations, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, China Ocean Fuel Oil (USA) Co., Limited (“China Ocean”),
	in Hong Kong on October 17, 2012.  However, China Ocean had no operations, assets or liabilities as of November 30,
	2016 and February 29, 2016.




	 




	The
	accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of CEFC Global Strategic Holdings, Inc., have been prepared in
	accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange
	Commission ("SEC"), and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
	contained in the Company's Annual Report filed with the SEC on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting
	of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the
	interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for our interim periods are not necessarily indicative
	of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the consolidated financial statements that would substantially duplicate
	the disclosure contained in the audited consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2016, as reported in the Form 10-K, have
	been omitted.




	 




	The
	consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, China Ocean Fuel Oil (USA)
	Co., Limited (“China Ocean”). All intercompany transactions, if any, are eliminated upon consolidations.




	 





	Going
	Concern






	 





	These
	consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Company has incurred losses since inception
	resulting in an accumulated deficit of $296,496 at November 30, 2016 and further losses are anticipated in the development of
	its business raising substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Its ability to continue
	as a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the Company to generate profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain
	the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come
	due. Management has plans to seek additional capital through a private placement of its common stock or further shareholder loans
	as needed. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded
	assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue.




	 





	2.              RELATED
	PARTY TRANSACTIONS





	 




	Shareholder
	advances represent advances made to us by our majority shareholder, Sino Ocean Fuel Holdings Limited (formerly known as Formula
	One Investments Limited), for working capital purposes amounting to $269,451 and $249,451 at November 30, 2016 and February 29,
	2016, respectively.  These advances are non-interest bearing, due upon demand and are unsecured.

	Item 2.     

	Management’s
	Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operations






	 




	The
	following discussion provides information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the results of operations
	and financial condition of our company.  It should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying
	notes.




	 





	Plan
	of Operation





	 




	Our
	Company was originally incorporated on September 23, 2010 in the State of Nevada under the name “Astra Ventures, Inc.”  On
	December 10, 2013, we filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State which became effective on December 10,
	2013, to change our name to “CEFC Global Strategic Holdings, Inc.”   We originally planned to commence business
	operations by obtaining distribution rights for television programming and specialty films such as reality television and extreme
	sports programming for reproduction and distribution across multiple markets and formats in the United States and worldwide.  However,
	in connection with the change of control transaction that closed on August 22, 2012 and which is more fully described below under
	the section below titled “

	Our Management

	,” we appointed a new executive management team and changed our planned
	business operations.




	 




	We
	now intend to start operating a trading business, leveraging our executive management’s extensive experience in the trading
	of oil, fuel and other petroleum products.  On October 17, 2012, we completed the formation of our new wholly owned
	subsidiary trading company, China Ocean Fuel Oil (USA) Co., Limited (“China Ocean”), in Hong Kong through which we
	plan to engage in trading petroleum and petrochemical products.  Our management team is currently engaging in business development
	and we plan to commence our trading operations through China Ocean.  Our business office will be located in Hong Kong
	and we may also set up sales offices in China in the future.  Our suppliers will be mainly from sources based in the Middle
	East and our targeted customers will be buyers from mainland China, Hong Kong and Asia.  We plan to finance our trading business
	through bank financings and private loans.




	 




	We
	also intend to explore investment opportunities mainly in energy-related projects. We anticipate raising funds for these investments
	through public or private equity or debt financings and bank loans.




	 




	We
	have not yet started operations or generated or realized any revenues from business operations.  Our auditors have issued
	a going concern opinion based on our prior business operations.  This means that there is substantial doubt that we
	can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital.  We do not expect
	to generate any revenue until we commence operations under our new business plan.  Accordingly, we must raise cash from
	other sources.  We currently have no arrangements in place for additional financing.  Our success or failure
	will be initially determined by the availability of additional financing and thereafter by our success in implementing our business
	plan.




	 




	Our
	current cash resources are insufficient to finance our planned expenditures.  To successfully commence our planned operations
	we will need to raise additional financing.  We anticipate raising the funds through either private loans, the public
	and/or private sale of our common stock or bank financing.  We have no third party financing commitments, and our ability
	to raise financing in the equity markets are uncertain as the equity markets, in recent years, have been depressed especially
	for start-up companies.




	 





	Our
	Management





	 




	On
	August 22, 2012, Sino Ocean Fuel Holdings Limited (formerly known as “Formula One Investments Limited”), a British
	Virgin Islands company (“Sino Ocean”) acquired in private stock sale transactions an aggregate 4,200,000 shares (the
	“Shares”) of the Company’s common stock (the “Common Stock”) from Sieg Badke, who prior to the Closing
	Date was the majority shareholder and the sole director and executive officer of the Company, and from other former individual
	stockholders of the Company, through which Sino Ocean acquired an additional 200,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock.
	 Following the closing of these private stock sale transactions and the change in control, Sino Ocean owned an aggregate
	4,200,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock, representing 60.87% of the issued and outstanding the Company’s Common
	Stock as of August 22, 2012 (the “Closing Date”).   In connection with the change of control, effective
	upon the Closing Date: (a) Sieg Badke resigned as the Company’s sole director, Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief
	Financial Officer, Treasurer and Vice President; (b) Jesse Hahn resigned as the Company’s Secretary; (c) Mao Zhao, was appointed
	as the Chief Executive Officer and Director; (d) Chau To Chan was appointed as President and Chairman of the Board of Directors;
	(e) Qinzhen Li was appointed as Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary of the Company; and (f) Yong Li was appointed
	as a member of the Board of Directors.




	 




	Effective
	on March 18, 2014, Ms. Mao Zhao resigned as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and the Company’s board of directors
	appointed Mr. Yadong Liu (“Mr. Liu”) as the Company’s new Chief Executive Officer to replace Ms. Zhao. In addition,
	Mr. Liu was also appointed as a new member of the Company’s board of directors. The Company’s board of directors approved
	an increase in the authorized number of directors from three to four on March 18, 2014 in conjunction with the appointment of
	Mr. Liu as a new member of the board of directors. On May 28, 2014, Ms. Mao Zhao resigned as a member of the Company’s board
	of directors.

	Results
	of Operations





	 






	Three-Month
	Periods Ended November 30, 2016 and 2015






	 




	We
	did not earn any revenues during the three-month periods ended November 30, 2016 and 2015.




	 




	We
	incurred operating expenses in the amount of $9,583 for the three-month period ended November 30, 2016 as compared to $10,818
	for the three-month period ended November 30, 2015.  These operating expenses comprised of general and administrative
	expenses.




	 






	Nine-Month
	Periods Ended November 30, 2016 and 2015






	 




	We
	also did not earn any revenues during the nine-month periods ended November 30, 2016 and 2015.




	 




	We
	incurred operating expenses in the amount of $38,425 for the nine-month period ended November 30, 2016 as compared to $45,751
	for the nine-month period ended November 30, 2015.  These operating expenses comprised of general and administrative
	expenses.




	 






	Liquidity
	and Capital Resources






	 




	Net
	cash used in operating activities for the nine-month period ended November 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to general and
	administrative expenses. Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended November 30, 2015 was also primarily
	attributable to general and administrative expenses.




	 




	We
	are currently dependent on funds raised through shareholder advances from our majority shareholder, Sino Ocean.  Since
	our inception on September 23, 2010, we have raised proceeds of $49,000 in cash from the sale of our common stock, and we have
	received a total of $269,451 in advances from Sino Ocean for working capital purposes.




	 




	We
	currently do not have any credit facilities or other commitments for debt or equity financing.  No assurances can be given
	that advances when needed will be available.  We need additional funding to undertake our operations.  Private
	capital, if sought, will be sought from private and institutional investors.  To date, we have not sought any funding source
	and have not authorized any person or entity to seek out funding on our behalf.  If a market for our shares ever develops,
	of which there can be no assurances, we will use shares to compensate employees/consultants and independent contractors wherever
	possible.




	 




	We
	will incur ongoing expenses associated with professional fees for accounting, legal, and a host of other expenses in connection
	with the required filings with the SEC that are associated with being a public company. We estimate that these costs will be approximately
	$100,000 per year for the next few years and will be higher if we commence operations under our new business plan and our business
	activity increases.  These obligations will reduce our ability and resources to fund other aspects of our business.
	 We hope to be able to use our status as a public company to increase our ability to use non-cash means of settling obligations
	and compensate certain independent contractors who provide professional services to us, although there can be no assurances that
	we will be successful in any of those efforts.





	 







	Item
	3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks





	 




	As
	a smaller reporting company (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act), we are not required to provide the information called
	for by this Item 3.





	 







	Item
	4.     Controls and Procedures





	 






	Evaluation
	of Disclosure Controls






	 




	As
	of November 30, 2016, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
	our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined
	in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).

	Limitations
	on the Effectiveness of Controls






	 




	Our
	management does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error
	and fraud.  A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, but no absolute, assurance
	that the objectives of a control system are met.  Further, any control system reflects limitations on resources, and the
	benefits of a control system must be considered relative to its costs.  These limitations also include the realities that
	judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.  Additionally,
	controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override
	of a control. A design of a control system is also based upon certain assumptions about potential future conditions; over
	time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
	may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud
	may occur and may not be detected.




	 






	Conclusions






	 




	Based
	upon their evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of November 30, 2016, our chief executive officer and chief
	financial officer have concluded that, subject to the limitations noted above, the disclosure controls were effective to provide
	reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted by the Company under the Exchange
	Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s
	rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer
	and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.






	 








	Changes
	in internal control over financial reporting






	 




	There
	have been no changes during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q in our internal control over financial reporting
	that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	Forward-Looking Statements





	 




	This
	annual report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”) contains forward-looking statements that relate to future events or our
	future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may”,
	“should”, “expects”, “plans”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “estimates”,
	“predicts”, “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology.  These
	statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our or our
	industry’s actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results,
	levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.




	 




	Although
	we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results,
	levels of activity, performance or achievements.  Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws
	of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.  The
	following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes thereto included in this
	Annual Report.




	 




	As
	used in this Annual Report, the terms “we”, “us”, “our” and “the Company” refer
	collectively to CEFC Global Strategic Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, China Ocean Fuel Oil (USA) Co., Ltd., unless
	otherwise indicated.

	BUSINESS







	 





	Corporate
	Overview





	 




	Our
	Company was originally incorporated on September 23, 2010 in the State of Nevada.  We originally planned to commence
	business operations by obtaining distribution rights for television programming and specialty films such as reality television
	and extreme sports programming for reproduction and distribution across multiple markets and formats in the United States and
	worldwide.  However, in connection with the change of control transaction that closed on August 22, 2012 and which transaction
	is more fully described below under the section below titled “

	Change of Control

	,” we appointed a new executive
	management team and changed our planned business operations.




	 




	We
	now intend to start operating a trading business, leveraging our executive management’s extensive experience in the trading
	of oil, fuel and other petroleum and petrochemical products.  On October 17, 2012, we completed the formation of our
	wholly-owned subsidiary, China Ocean Fuel Oil (USA) Co., Limited (“China Ocean”), in Hong Kong through which we plan
	to engage in trading petroleum and petrochemical products.  Our management team is currently setting up China Ocean’s
	management system and internal controls and we plan to commence our trading operations through China Ocean.  Our business
	office will be located in Hong Kong and we may also set up sales offices in China in the future.  Our suppliers will be mainly
	from sources based in the Middle East and our targeted customers will be buyers from mainland China, Hong Kong and Asia. 
	We plan to finance our trading business through bank financings and private loans.




	 




	We
	also intend to explore other investment opportunities.  We anticipate raising funds for these investments through public
	or private equity or debt financings and bank loans.




	 





	Change
	of Control





	 




	On
	August 22, 2012, Sino Ocean Fuel Holdings Limited (formerly known as “Formula One Investments Limited”), a British
	Virgin Islands company (“Sino Ocean”) acquired in private stock sale transactions an aggregate 4,200,000 shares (the
	“Shares”) of the Company’s common stock (the “Common Stock”) from Sieg Badke, who prior to the Closing
	Date was the majority shareholder and the sole director and executive officer of the Company, and from other former individual
	stockholders of the Company, through which Sino Ocean acquired an additional 200,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock.
	 Following the closing of these private stock sale transactions and the change in control, Sino Ocean owned an aggregate
	4,200,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock, representing 60.87% of the issued and outstanding the Company’s Common
	Stock as of August 22, 2012 (the “Closing Date”).   In connection with the change of control, effective
	upon the Closing Date: (a) Sieg Badke resigned as the Company’s sole director, Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief
	Financial Officer, Treasurer and Vice President; (b) Jesse Hahn resigned as the Company’s Secretary; (c) Mao Zhao, was appointed
	as the Chief Executive Officer and Director; (d) Chau To Chan was appointed as President and Chairman of the Board of Directors;
	(e) Qinzhen Li was appointed as Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary of the Company; and (f) Yong Li was appointed
	as a member of the Board of Directors.





	 






	Corporate
	History after Change of Control

	 




	 




	On
	December 10, 2013, the Company’s name changed from Astra Ventures, Inc. to “CEFC Global Strategic Holdings, Inc.”  To
	effect the name change, we filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State which became effective on December
	10, 2013.  The name change pursuant to the Certificate of Amendment was approved by our board of directors and by holders
	of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock.  The name change became effective
	on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, where the registrant’s common stock is quoted for trading, at the open of business
	on December 10, 2013, under the new stock symbol “CGSH.”




	 




	Ms.
	Mao Zhao resigned as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, effective on March 18, 2014 but Ms. Zhao remained as a member
	of the Company’s board of directors.  Effective on March 18, 2014, the Company’s board of directors appointed
	Mr. Yadong Liu (“Mr. Liu”) as the Company’s new Chief Executive Officer to replace Ms. Zhao.  In addition,
	Mr. Liu was also appointed as a new member of the Company’s board of directors.  The Company’s board of
	directors approved an increase in the authorized number of directors from three to four on March 18, 2014 in conjunction with
	the appointment of Mr. Liu as a new member of the board of directors. Effective on May 28, 2014, Ms. Mao Zhao resigned as a member
	of the Company’s board of directors.

	Information





	 




	On
	February 27, 2012, our shares of common stock were approved for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (“OTCBB”)
	under the ticker symbol “AAVC”.  As described more fully above under Part I, Item I (Business) under the section
	titled “Change of Name” on December 10, 2013, our ticker symbol was changed to “CGSH” in connection with
	our corporate name change to CEFC Global Strategic Holdings, Inc.  As of the date of filing of this Annual Report, there
	has been no active trading of our securities, and, therefore, no high and low bid pricing.  Trading in stocks quoted
	on the OTCBB is often thin and is characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices due to many factors that may be unrelated
	to a company’s operations or business prospects.  We cannot assure you that there will be a market in the future for
	our common stock.

	MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
	CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION







	 





	Plan
	of Operations





	 




	The
	Company plans to commence business operations through its wholly-owned subsidiary China Ocean Fuel Oil (USA) Co., Limited (“China
	Ocean”), a Hong Kong limited company, through which we plan to engage in trading petroleum and petrochemical products.   On
	October 17, 2012, we completed the formation of China Ocean and our management team is currently setting up China Ocean’s
	management system and internal controls.  Our business office will be located in Hong Kong and we may also set up sales
	offices in China in the future.  Our suppliers will be mainly from sources based in the Middle East and our targeted customers
	will be buyers from mainland China, Hong Kong and Asia.  We plan to finance our trading business through bank financings
	and private loans.




	 




	We
	currently do not have any employees at this time other than our executive officers, who are in process of planning and developing
	our business operations.  When we fully commence our trading business, we plan to hire additional employees and we may
	also retain independent contractors to assist us in operating and managing our business operations on an as-needed basis.




	 




	We
	have not yet fully started operations or generated or realized any revenues from business operations.  Our auditors
	have issued a going concern opinion based on our current minimal business operations.  This means that there is substantial
	doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital.  We
	do not expect to generate any revenue until we commence operations under our new business plan.  Accordingly, we must
	raise cash from other sources.  We currently have no arrangements in place for additional financing.  Our
	success or failure will be initially determined by the availability of additional financing and thereafter by our success in implementing
	our business plan.




	 




	If
	we are unable to implement our business plan because of insufficient funding, we will cease activities until we raise more money.
	If we are unable to obtain funds, we will cease activities. If we cease activities, we have no plans for any other business activity.




	 




	Our
	financial statements are stated in United States Dollars (US$) unless otherwise stated and are prepared in accordance with United
	States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.









	Results
	of Operations






	 






	Fiscal
	Years Ended February 28, 2017 and February 29, 2016





	 




	We
	earned no revenues during the fiscal years ended February 28, 2017 and February 29, 2016.

	We
	incurred operating expenses in the amount of $49,127 for the year ended February 28, 2017 as compared to $64,257 for the year
	ended February 29, 2016.  These operating expenses comprised of general and administrative expenses, including fees
	paid for legal and professional services.




	 




	We
	have not fully commenced business operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to execute our business plan. For
	these reasons, there is substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern.




	 






	Liquidity
	and Capital Resources





	 




	As
	of February 28, 2017, we had $116,227 in cash, $116,227 in total assets, $374,425 in total liabilities and an accumulated deficit
	of $307,198.




	  




	During
	the years ended February 28, 2017 and February 29, 2016, we used net cash of $44,227 and $65,157, respectively, in operations.
	During the years ended February 28, 2017 and February 29, 2016, we generated cash of $119,974 and $49,979 from financing activities,
	respectively. During the years ended February 28, 2017 and February 29, 2016 we had no cash flows from investing activities.




	 




	We
	are currently dependent on funds raised through shareholder advances from our majority shareholder, Sino Ocean.  As
	of February 28, 2017 and February 29, 2016 we received a total of $119,974 and $49,979, respectively, in advances from Sino Ocean
	for working capital purposes. Since our inception on September 23, 2010, we have raised proceeds of $49,000 in cash from the sale
	of our common stock, and we have received a total of $369,425 in advances from Sino Ocean for working capital purposes.




	 




	Over
	the next twelve months, we expect to require $100,000 in financing to commence our planned operations.  Our current
	cash resources are insufficient to finance our planned expenditures.  To successfully commence our planned operations
	we will need to raise additional financing. We anticipate raising the funds through the public and/or private sale of our common
	stock or bank financing. The Company has no third party financing commitments, and our ability to raise financing in the equity
	markets are uncertain as the equity markets, in recent years, have been depressed especially for start-up companies like ourselves.  Our
	majority shareholder, Sino Ocean, has indicated that it will continue lending funds to the Company on an interim basis if an opportunity
	arose for which the Company had no available funds from any other source.  However, there is no firm commitment for
	any such loan and no agreement between the Company and Sino Ocean for such a loan.




	 




	We
	do not have any credit facilities or other commitments for debt or equity financing.  No assurances can be given that advances
	when needed will be available.  We need funding to commence and undertake our planned business operations.  We
	may raise funds through the public or private sale of our securities.  Private capital, if sought, will be sought from
	private and institutional investors.  To date, we have not sought any funding source and have not authorized any person
	or entity to seek out funding on our behalf.  If a market for our shares develops, we hope to be able to use non-cash means
	to settle our obligations and compensate certain persons and/or firms providing services to us or with whom we do business, although
	there can be no assurances that we will be successful in any of those efforts.

	Our
	audited financial statements for the fiscal years ended February 28, 2017 and February 29, 2016, together with the report of the
	independent registered public accounting firm thereon and the notes thereto, are presented beginning at page F-1.

	Report
	of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm





	 




	To
	the Board of Directors of




	CEFC
	Global Strategic Holdings, Inc.




	Shanghai,
	China




	 




	We
	have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CEFC Strategic Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) as of February
	28, 2017 and February 29, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows
	for each of the years in the two-year period ended February 28, 2017 and February 29, 2016. These financial statements are the
	responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
	on our audits.




	 




	We
	conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
	standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
	free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
	over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing
	audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
	of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
	examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
	principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.




	 




	In
	our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of CEFC
	Strategic Holdings, Inc. as of February 28, 2017 and February 29, 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
	each of the years in the two-year period ended February 28, 2017 and February 29, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles
	generally accepted in the United States of America.




	 




	As
	discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company’s absence of significant revenues, recurring losses from operations,
	and its need for additional financing in order to meet its financial obligations raise substantial doubt about its ability to
	continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
	outcome of this uncertainty.

	NOTES
	TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	 




	FEBRUARY
	28, 2017 and February 29, 2016




	 




	NOTE
	1 – NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION




	 



	CEFC
	Global Strategic Holdings, Inc., formerly Astra Ventures, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada
	on September 23, 2010, and its year-end is February 28. In connection with the change of control which occurred on August 22,
	2012 that is described below, the Company has become a development stage company that intends to operate a trading business for
	oil, fuel and other petroleum products. In connection with its planned business operations, the Company formed a wholly owned
	subsidiary, China Ocean Fuel Oil (USA) Co., Limited (“China Ocean”), in Hong Kong on October 17, 2012. However, China
	Ocean had no operations, assets or liabilities as of February 28, 2017.



	 



	On
	December 10, 2013, the registrant’s name changed from Astra Ventures, Inc. to “CEFC Global Strategic Holdings, Inc.”
	To effect the name change, we filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State which became effective on December
	10, 2013. The name change pursuant to the Certificate of Amendment was approved by our board of directors and by holders of a
	majority of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock. The name change became effective on the Over-the-Counter
	Bulletin Board, where the registrant’s common stock is quoted for trading, at the open of business on December 10, 2013,
	under the new stock symbol “CGSH.”



	 




	Going
	concern




	 



	These
	consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Company has incurred losses since inception
	resulting in an accumulated deficit of $307,198 at February 28, 2017 and further losses are anticipated in the development of
	its business raising substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Its ability to continue
	as a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the Company to generate profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain
	the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come
	due. Management has plans to seek additional capital through a private placement of its common stock or further shareholder loans
	as needed. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded
	assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue.



	 




	NOTE
	2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES




	 




	Development
	Stage Company




	 



	The
	Company has elected to adopt application of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination
	of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements; it no longer presents or discloses inception-to-date information and other remaining
	disclosure requirements of Topic 915.



	 




	Basis
	of presentation




	 



	These
	consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars and have been prepared in accordance with United States
	generally accepted accounting principles.



	 



	The
	consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, China Ocean Fuel Oil (USA)
	Co., Limited (“China Ocean”). All intercompany transactions, if any, are eliminated upon consolidations.



	 




	Cash
	and cash equivalents




	 



	The
	Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash
	equivalents.



	 




	Use
	of estimates and assumptions




	 



	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
	and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
	at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company
	bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable
	under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
	and the accrual of costs and expenses that are readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company
	may differ materially from the Company’s estimates.



	 








	 


	F-

	6



	 






	 



	 




	Basic
	and diluted net income (loss) per common share




	 



	The
	Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
	260 “Earnings Per Share” which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face
	of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common stockholders (numerator) by the weighted
	average number of common shares outstanding (denominator) for the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common
	shares outstanding during the period including stock options, using the treasury stock method, and convertible preferred stock,
	using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number
	of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential
	common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. Because the Company does not have any potentially dilutive securities, diluted
	loss per share is equal to the basic loss per share.



	 




	Financial
	instruments




	 



	The
	fair value of the Company’s financial instruments consisting of cash, accounts payable, and amounts due to related party
	approximate their carrying values due to the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The Company operates
	in China and therefore is exposed to foreign exchange risk. It is management’s opinion that the Company is not exposed to
	significant interest or credit risks arising from these financial instruments.



	 




	Fair
	value of financial instruments




	 



	The
	Company adopted ASC 820 “Fair Value Measurements”. ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a three-level valuation
	hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The three levels
	are defined as follows:



	 



	Level
	1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.



	 



	Level
	2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that
	are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.



	 



	Level
	3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair measurement.



	 



	The
	carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, and current liabilities each qualify as financial
	instruments and are a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments
	and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest.



	 




	Income
	taxes




	 



	Deferred
	income taxes are provided for tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of asset and liabilities and their reported
	amounts in the financial statements. The Company uses the liability method to account for income taxes, which requires deferred
	taxes to be recorded at the statutory rate expected to being in effect when the taxes are paid. Valuation allowances are provided
	for a deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that such asset will not be realized.



	 



	Management
	evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position includes a determination
	of whether a tax position should be recognized in the financial statements, and such a position should only be recognized if the
	Company determines that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities,
	based upon the technical merits of the position. For those tax positions that should be recognized, the measurement of a tax position
	is determined as being the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate
	settlement.



	 








	 


	F-

	Stock-based
	compensation




	 



	The
	Company has not adopted a stock option plan and therefore has not granted any stock options. Accordingly, no stock-based compensation
	has been recorded to date.



	 




	Principles
	of Consolidation




	 



	The
	consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary. All significant inter-company transactions
	and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
	accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.



	 




	Recent
	Accounting Pronouncements




	 



	Management
	does not anticipate that the recently issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements will materially impact the Company’s
	financial conditions.



	 




	NOTE
	3 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS




	 



	Shareholder
	advances represent advances made to us by our majority shareholder, Sino Ocean Fuel Holdings Limited (formerly known as Formula
	One Investments Limited), for working capital purposes amounting to $369,425 and $249,451 at February 28, 2017 and February 29,
	2016, respectively. These advances are non-interest bearing, due upon demand and are unsecured.



	 




	NOTE
	4 – INCOME TAXES




	 



	As
	of February 28, 2017, the Company has estimated tax loss carry forwards for tax purpose of approximately $308,000, which expire
	beginning in 2031. These amounts may be applied against future taxable income. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result
	of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization has not been determined to be more
	likely than not to occur.




	 




	The
	Company’s income tax returns are subject to examination by the relevant taxing authorities as follows: U.S.
	Federal income tax returns for tax years 2013 and forward. The State of Nevada has no corporate income tax. There are
	currently no income tax examinations underway for these jurisdictions. 



	 



	The
	actual income tax provisions differ from the expected amounts calculated by applying the statutory income tax rate to the Company’s
	loss before income taxes. The components of these differences are as follows:

	CONTROLS
	AND PROCEDURES







	 





	Evaluation
	of Disclosure Controls and Procedures





	 




	As
	of February 28, 2017, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
	our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures”,
	as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).




	 




	Our
	management does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error
	and fraud.  A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, but no absolute, assurance
	that the objectives of a control system are met.  Further, any control system reflects limitations on resources, and the
	benefits of a control system must be considered relative to its costs.  These limitations also include the realities that
	judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.  Additionally,
	controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override
	of a control.  A design of a control system is also based upon certain assumptions about potential future conditions; over
	time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
	may deteriorate.  Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud
	may occur and may not be detected.




	 




	Based
	upon their evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of February 28, 2017, our chief executive officer and chief
	financial officer have concluded that, subject to the limitations noted above, the disclosure controls were effective to provide
	reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted by the Company under the Exchange
	Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s
	rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer
	and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.





	 






	Internal
	Controls over Financial Reporting





	 




	Internal
	control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and
	Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
	regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
	with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance
	of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide
	reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
	generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization
	of our  management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
	acquisitions, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.




	 




	Internal
	control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its
	inherent limitations.  Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance
	and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.  Internal control over financial
	reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override.  Because of such limitations, there
	is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.  However,
	these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.  Therefore, it is possible to design
	into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.  Management is responsible for establishing
	and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company.




	 




	Our
	management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on criteria in Internal
	Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based
	on such evaluation, our management concluded that as of February 28, 2017, and as of the date that the evaluation of the effectiveness
	of our internal control over financial reporting was completed, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.




	 




	This
	Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
	over financial reporting.  Our internal control over financial reporting was not subject to attestation by our independent
	registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management’s report
	in this Annual Report.





	 






	Changes
	in Internal Control over Financial Reporting





	 




	There
	has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal year that has materially affected,
	or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

	Under
	Rule 13d-3, a beneficial owner of a security includes any person who, directly or indirectly,
	through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares:
	(i) voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of shares;
	and (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose or direct the disposition
	of shares.  Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than
	one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose
	of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if
	the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option)
	within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided.  In computing
	the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to
	include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person)
	by reason of these acquisition rights.  As a result, the percentage of outstanding
	shares of any person as shown in this table does not necessarily reflect the person’s
	actual ownership or voting power with respect to the number of shares of common stock
	actually outstanding.





	 


	 


	 









	(2)




	Unless
	otherwise indicated in the footnotes to the table, each shareholder shown on the table
	has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares beneficially owned by
	him, her or it.

	CERTAIN
	RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE







	 





	Related
	Party Transactions





	 




	During
	the fiscal year ended February 28, 2017, the Company received $119,974 in advances for working capital purposes from Sino Ocean,
	our majority shareholder, whose sole director and majority shareholder is Mr. Chau To Chan, our Company’s President and
	Chairman of the Board of Directors.  This balance is repayable on demand, unsecured and is non-interest bearing.




	 




	Our
	executive management is involved in other business activities and may, in the future become involved in other business opportunities.  If
	a specific business opportunity becomes available, such persons may face a conflict in selecting between our business and their
	other business interests.  In the event that a conflict of interest arises at a meeting of our directors, a director who
	has such a conflict will disclose his interest in a proposed transaction and will abstain from voting for or against the approval
	of such transaction.





	 






	Director
	Independence





	 




	Currently,
	we have no independent directors.  Because our common stock is not currently listed on a national securities exchange,
	we have used the definition of “independence” of The NASDAQ Stock Market to make this determination.  NASDAQ
	Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) provides that an “independent director” is a person other than an officer or employee of the
	company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the company’s board of directors, would interfere
	with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.  The NASDAQ listing rules
	provide that a director cannot be considered independent if:




	 








	●




	the
	director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an employee of the Company;






	 








	●




	the
	director or a family member of the director accepted any compensation from the Company
	in excess of $120,000 during any period of 12 consecutive months within the three years
	preceding the independence determination (subject to certain exclusions, including, among
	other things, compensation for board or board committee service);





	 


	 


	 









	●




	a
	family member of the director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an
	executive officer of the Company;






	 








	●




	the
	director or a family member of the director is a partner in, controlling stockholder
	of, or an executive officer of an entity to which the Company made, or from which the
	Company received, payments in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that
	exceed 5% of the recipient’s consolidated gross revenue for that year or $200,000,
	whichever is greater (subject to certain exclusions);  








	 








	●




	the
	director or a family member of the director is employed as an executive officer of an
	entity where, at any time during the past three years, any of the executive officers
	of the Company served on the compensation committee of such other entity; or






	 








	●




	the
	director or a family member of the director is a current partner of the Company’s
	outside auditor, or at any time during the past three years was a partner or employee
	of the Company’s outside auditor, and who worked on the company’s audit.

	Pre-Approval
	Policies and Procedures







	 




	The
	Company currently does not have a designated Audit Committee, and accordingly, the Company’s Board of Directors’ policy
	is to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent auditors.  These services
	may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services.  The independent auditors and management
	periodically report to the Company’s Board of Directors regarding the extent of services provided by the independent auditors
	in accordance with this pre-approval, and the fees for the services performed to date.  The Board of Directors may also
	pre-approve particular services on a case-by-case basis.
