Demand-Driven Supply Chain: 10 Steps To Take Today (Part 4)
By Sophie Rutherford      
June 2, 2017
In the last few blogs, we’ve talked about what it means to become a more demand-driven supply chain, and we’ve used this definition (albeit, a bit customized for healthcare): “A system of coordinated processes and technologies that senses and reacts to real-time demand signals across a network of suppliers, employees and patients.”

Shift to a Demand-Driven Supply Chain (Part 2)
By Douglas Lowe      
May 5, 2017
It’s (Still) All About the Data
We have data standards in healthcare, right? So do we really have data problems? (And what does this have to do with building a demand-driven supply chain?) If you think of a demand-driven supply chain as an environment where you’re sending real-time demand signals up and down the system, standardized data is probably the most fundamental building block. Yet in healthcare, at the heart of the data issue is still the inconsistency of data standards.

A Demand-Driven Supply Chain - 4 Pillars for Success (Part 1)
By Sophie Rutherford      
April 29, 2017
What does it mean to become a more demand-driven supply chain? I recently saw a good definition and adjusted it to apply it to healthcare - “A system of coordinated processes and technologies that senses and reacts to real-time demand signals across a network of suppliers, employees and patients.”  The crux is this: we need an infrastructure that enables demand signals to be shared up and down the supply chain.

Is Your Hospital Actually Managing Inventory?
By Cheryl Flury      
March 15, 2017
So many hospitals aren't managing inventory!
Our team spends a lot of time in hospital supply rooms and in almost every facility, we see a requisitioning method we call “par replenishment.” This seems to be the most common form of supply ordering found in hospitals today. But people THINK it’s inventory management.

Fixing Your Inventory Processes: Start Small, Think Big
By Douglas Lowe      
November 16, 2016
Several years ago, I started a new job as a supply chain manager in a large hospital with well-established systems and business processes.  As I was getting to know how things worked, I had to wonder “what did I just inherit?” I knew it was time to dig in and find out what was working well, what wasn’t working at all, and build from there.

Since 1999, Jump Technologies, Inc. has innovated new solutions in areas including mobile inventory management, replenishment, procurement, and proof-of-delivery software to automate and streamline supply chain management. Our partnerships with more than 10,000 healthcare, office supply, food logistics, transportation and distribution customers provided us with wide-ranging supply chain experience. Today, we focus this experience on improving supply chain processes in healthcare, with smart, simple and cost-efficient cloud-based mobile solutions. Jump Technologies helps customers streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve efficiency within a single hospital or across a complex provider network.
We were among the first companies to use the cloud to leverage existing smartphone and tablet technology to solve supply chain problems associated with procurement, inventory management and proof-of-delivery. Moving forward, we continue to enhance and develop rich, cloud-based supply chain and logistics solutions. As a business technology solution provider, Jump Technologies is focused on designing products to:
Be fully scalable and customizable to facilitate business growth and adaptability
Integrate with legacy ERP systems through open architecture development
Be implemented in less than a week - including employee training
To provide an intuitive user interface that makes training and usability easy for all skill levels
To support healthcare organizations looking to reduce supply chain costs
Our solutions have been recognized for their cost-efficiency and smart design. JumpTech developed the JumpTrack application, which was named by Forbes as one of the top ten solutions for mobile proof-of-delivery software. Forbes also rated our JumpStock inventory management software as one of the top five best inventory management applications stating, "the software is so interactive that it's almost like having a human inventory manager on staff, saving you man hours over the more time-intensive apps."
A few reasons leading companies choose Jump Technologies for their supply chain solutions include:
Cloud-based delivery platform - Jump Technologies utilizes low-cost, cloud computing technology combined with affordable mobile phones or tablets.
