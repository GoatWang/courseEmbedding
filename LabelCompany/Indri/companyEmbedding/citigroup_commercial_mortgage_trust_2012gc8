For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating.

Fitch to Rate Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2013-GC15 Comm'l Mtge P-T Ctfs; Presale Issued | Business Wire


























































      Fitch to Rate Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2013-GC15 Comm'l Mtge 
      P-T Ctfs; Presale Issued
    





September 11, 2013 05:20 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on Citigroup Commercial 
      Mortgage Trust 2013-GC15 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$57,358,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$236,853,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$150,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$264,191,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$72,224,000 class A-AB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$875,416,000a class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$54,365,000ab class X-B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$18,122,000ab class X-C 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$94,790,000c class A-S 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$54,365,000c class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$204,914,000c class PEZ 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$55,759,000c class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$50,183,000b class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$18,122,000b class E 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$16,727,000b class F 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      A Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      B Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      C Class A-S, B, and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEZ 
      certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for up to the 
      full certificate principal amount of the class A-S, B and C certificates.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Sept. 6, 2013. Fitch does not expect to rate the $44,608,033 class G.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, 
      primary assets of which are 97 loans secured by 129 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.115 
      billion as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by Citigroup Global Markets Realty Corp., Rialto Mortgage Finance, LLC, 
      Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company, Starwood Mortgage Funding I LLC, RAIT 
      Funding, LLC, Redwood Commercial Mortgage Corporation, and The Bancorp 
      Bank.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 74.5% of the properties by balance and 
      cash flow analysis and asset summary reviews on 83.9% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Fitch Leverage: This transaction has higher leverage than the average 
      for Fitch-rated first-half 2013 and 2012 deals. The pool's Fitch debt 
      service coverage ratio (DSCR) and loan to value (LTV) are 1.19x and 
      104.0%, respectively. The average DSCR and LTV for 2013 transactions are 
      1.36x and 99.8%, respectively.
    

      Highly Diverse Pool of Loans: The top 10 loans represent 38.1% of the 
      pool, well below the 54.3% average for Fitch-rated transactions from 
      2012 through June 2013. The loan concentration index (LCI) and sponsor 
      concentration index (SCI) are 223 and 277, respectively, representing 
      one of the more diverse conduit pools by loan size and exposure since 
      2008.
    

      Above-Average Quality Assets in Primary Markets: Three of the top 10 
      loans (15.1% of the pool) received property quality scores of 'A-' or 
      better. Of the inspected properties, 28.6% received asset quality scores 
      of 'B+' or better. In addition, three of the top 10 loans (13.0% of the 
      pool) are secured by properties located in New York, NY.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 11.4% below the 
      most recent net operating income (NOI) (for properties for which most 
      recent NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severity on defaulted 
      loans, and could result in potential rating actions on the certificates. 
      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to CGCMT 
      2013-GC15 certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'Asf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBBsf' could result.
    

      The presale report includes a detailed explanation of additional 
      stresses and sensitivities in the Rating Sensitivity and Rating Stresses 
      sections of the presale.
    

      The master servicer will be Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., rated 'CMS2' by 
      Fitch. The special servicer will be Midland Loan Services, rated 'CSS1' 
      by Fitch.
    

      The presale report is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.
