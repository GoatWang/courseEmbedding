C&O #8272




Chessie Cat Roars Again  
As a tribute to our rail lineage, CSX recently donated a 1980 General Electric B30-7 locomotive to the Lake Shore Railway Historical Society. Before transporting the locomotive to the society’s railroad museum in North East, PA, CSX railroaders restored the locomotive to it’s original, ‘as-delivered” Chessie Cat paint scheme. CSX ties run deep in Pennsylvania, with predecessor roads operating in the region for over 150 years.
Prior to arriving at the Lake Shore Railway Museum, C&O #8272 made a stop at the GE Transportation Erie facility. The locomotive was displayed in Building 10 for a brief private showing, home of the assembly lines that built the engine 37 years ago.

“It was good to see the C&O #8272 return home to a great railroad community. The engine represents the legacy of CSX in Pennsylvania and beyond. The restoration and transport of the locomotive was made possible through collaboration and expertise of a lot of CSX railroaders,” said Robert Rohauer, manager field support. 
Now on display at the Lake Shore Railway Museum, the C&O #8272 joins seven other GE locomotives in the "Locomotives that Dad & Grandpa Built Collection."  
Ray Grabowski, Jr., president of Lake Shore Railway Historical Society, said "Chessie #8272 had a great opportunity to visit its birthplace at Erie GE and we were happy to share it there for a while. Now, thanks to the professionals of CSX Transportation, the locomotive made the final step and is here at Lake Shore Railway Museum." 
 
The Night at the Railroad Museum 
Upon arrival, the C&O #8272 was the star of the annual, “Night at the Railroad Museum” event, where the grounds of the Lake Shore Railway Museum were open around the clock for 28 hours. During the evening hours, the rolling stock were showcased and accented with lights, providing a unique opportunity for the community to see and photograph the locomotives under the night’s sky. This year’s event brought in over 1,000 people, up from previous years due in large part to the appearance of the Chessie Cat. The Lake Shore Railway Museum will host a "Chessie Day" in August, to further celebrate the restored C&O #8272 and the legacy of the Chessie System.

CSX Again Named One of America's Best Employers by Forbes magazine

CSX Again Named One of America’s Best Employers by Forbes magazine
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – May 31, 2017 –­ For the third consecutive year, Forbes magazine has named CSX (Nasdaq: CSX) one of “America’s Best Employers,” according to the results of a nationwide survey on employee satisfaction.
“Being recognized as one of the best employers in America is an honor and a reflection of CSX’s commitment to our talented team of employees,” said E. Hunter Harrison, president and chief executive officer. “Our employees take pride in their work and in their company, and their contributions are shaping a stronger CSX while providing excellent service to customers and vital support to our nation’s economy.”
Forbes Media, in partnership with research firm Statista, interviewed 30,000 workers at 1,800 U.S. companies in a wide range of industries to determine what makes a company an employer of choice. Among the factors considered, CSX was ranked highly among employers with 5,000 or more workers that were most likely to be recommended by employees to family and friends.
CSX takes pride in developing the best and brightest people and working together to meet the needs of customers. The company provides its diverse and proud workforce with challenging and meaningful career opportunities, best-in-class training and competitive pay and benefits to help CSX remain among the most desirable employers in America.
About CSX
CSX, based in Jacksonville, Florida, is a premier transportation company.  It provides rail, intermodal and rail-to-truck transload services and solutions to customers across a broad array of markets, including energy, industrial, construction, agricultural, and consumer products.  For nearly 190 years, CSX has played a critical role in the nation’s economic expansion and industrial development.  Its network connects every major metropolitan area in the eastern United States, where nearly two-thirds of the nation’s population resides.  It also links more than 240 short-line railroads and more than 70 ocean, river and lake ports with major population centers and farming towns alike.  More information about CSX Corporation and its subsidiaries is available at www.csx.com.

Food Products





Rail is the most economical and efficient way to ship food from coast to coast. Each year more than 90 million tons of food and food products move by rail. Plus, it’s safe for even your most temperature-sensitive products. With our express service in refrigerated box cars, we give fresh and frozen food extra care to maintain the high quality your customers expect.
Advantages of Moving Food by Rail

An extensive network spanning large production and consumption areas of the United States, plus seamless importing and exporting
Pricing savings over truck transport
Visibility into your shipments via online tools
Service options to fit timing needs, including a 5-day, cross-country express service
Less impact on the environment
Reliable equipment and considerate product handling

CSX moves food products including refrigerated and frozen foods, rice, edible beans, peas, lentils, alcoholic beverages, canned goods and tomato products. We have several rail service offerings for shipping food, including many specialized services for perishable products.
You Don’t Need Track to Use Rail
Even if your origination or destination isn’t rail served, there are many options to give you the benefits of rail in your supply chain. Especially for longer haul moves, adding rail as part of your transportation strategy will save you money.
We partner with many warehouses that offer food storage. Learn how using a warehouse helps you transfer from rail to truck or truck to rail.
Additionally, we work with partners in other railroads, intermodal shipping and logistics companies to develop customized solutions.
Find out if rail is right for you. Contact one of our food market managers or call our Merchandise Sales team at 1-877-ShipCSX (1-877-744-7279), options 5 - 1.

FAQs





I'm new to rail. How do I get started?

Review New to CSX or Rail. This will help start you off on the right track. Do you have questions about whether shipping by rail is right for you? Contact our New Business Development team at NBD@csx.com, or call 1-877-ShipCSX (1-877-744-7279), options 5 - 1.



How do I know if rail will work at my facility?

Our Service Start-up team can help make sure that your facility is rail served and your track is serviceable, and that CSX serves your location and can meet your service needs. Contact the Service Start-up team member in your area.



What if I am not located on rail? How can I take advantage of the economies of shipping by rail?

If you don't have direct access to tracks, then intermodal service, TRANSFLO or warehousing may be a solution.

With intermodal service, your freight is loaded into trailers, which are trucked to the railroad and loaded onto a train. When the train reaches the destination, the trailers are loaded back onto a truck and delivered to the site of your choice. Learn more .
With TRANSFLO, truckloads of product are consolidated and transferred onto rail cars. At the shipment destination, the product is transferred from the rail cars to trucks, which can deliver to multiple nonrail-served locations. Visit TRANSFLO .
CSX serves more than 300 warehouses located in and near every major market in the Eastern United States. These warehouses link shippers and receivers of raw materials and finished goods. Learn more about Warehouse Services.

CSX Corporation Company Profile
CSX Corporation, together with its subsidiaries, provides rail-based transportation services in the United States and Canada. It offers traditional rail services, and transports intermodal containers and trailers. The company transports crushed stone, sand and gravel, metal, phosphate, fertilizer, food, consumer, agricultural, automotive, paper, and chemical products; and coal, coke, and iron ore to electricity-generating power plants, steel manufacturers, and industrial plants, as well as exports coal to deep-water port facilities. It also provides intermodal transportation services through a network of approximately 50 terminals transporting manufactured consumer goods in containers in the eastern United States, as well as performs drayage services, including pickup and delivery of intermodal shipments; and trucking dispatch services. In addition, the company serves the automotive industry with various distribution centers and storage locations; and connects non-rail served customers through transferring products from rail to trucks, such as plastics and ethanol. Further, it is involved in the acquisition, development, sale, lease, and management of real estate properties. The company operates approximately 21,000 route mile rail network, which serves various population centers in 23 states east of the Mississippi River, the District of Columbia, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec, as well as owns and leases approximately 4,000 locomotives.

Stock-market benchmarks ring up records as Morgan Stanley fosters buying spirits

Railroad stocks and United Airlines trip up Dow transports
The Dow Jones Transportation Average  dropped 83 points, or 0.9%, to buck the rally in the broader stock market, with the selloff in railroad stocks and United Airlines' parent United Continental Holdings Inc. shares  accounting for the bulk of the weakness. United's stock fell $3.29, or 4.2%, in morning trade in the wake of disappointing unit revenue guidance. That was shaving about 20 points off the Dow transports, which is a price-weighted index. Shares of CSX Corp.  slumped $3.43, or 6.3%,  after investors questioned how the railroad operator beat earnings expectations. That selloff knocked the Dow transports down by about 21 points. In sympathy, shares of Norfolk Southern Corp.  shed $3.23, or 2.6%, and Union Pacific Corp.'s stock  gave up $2.13, or 2.0%, to cut a combined 33 points from the Dow transports. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 22 points, or 0.1%, while the S&P 500  tacked on 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite  gained 0.5%. The Dow transports are headed for a third-straight loss, after reaching a record high on July 14.

Stock-market benchmarks ring up records as Morgan Stanley fosters buying spirits

Railroad stocks and United Airlines trip up Dow transports
The Dow Jones Transportation Average  dropped 83 points, or 0.9%, to buck the rally in the broader stock market, with the selloff in railroad stocks and United Airlines' parent United Continental Holdings Inc. shares  accounting for the bulk of the weakness. United's stock fell $3.29, or 4.2%, in morning trade in the wake of disappointing unit revenue guidance. That was shaving about 20 points off the Dow transports, which is a price-weighted index. Shares of CSX Corp.  slumped $3.43, or 6.3%,  after investors questioned how the railroad operator beat earnings expectations. That selloff knocked the Dow transports down by about 21 points. In sympathy, shares of Norfolk Southern Corp.  shed $3.23, or 2.6%, and Union Pacific Corp.'s stock  gave up $2.13, or 2.0%, to cut a combined 33 points from the Dow transports. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 22 points, or 0.1%, while the S&P 500  tacked on 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite  gained 0.5%. The Dow transports are headed for a third-straight loss, after reaching a record high on July 14.

CSX Corp.  shares rose in the extended session Tuesday after the railroad operator reported quarterly results above Wall Street estimates and expanded its share buyback program. Shares of CSX rose 3.1% to $56.32 after hours. The company reported adjusted second-quarter earnings of 64 cents a share on revenue of $2.93 billion.

What are analysts saying about CSX Corporation stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about CSX Corporation stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Shares of CSX Corporation have performed well in the last one year, gaining 82%. The company has outperformed the industry it belongs to as well as fellow railroad operator Union Pacific in the period. While, the industry witnessed a gain of 28%, Union Pacific shares have rallied 17%. Ushering in further good news, CSX reported better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues in the second quarter of 2017. The company witnessed growth across nearly all markets, which can be attributed to coal-related gains, strength in core pricing and volume across markets, and increased fuel recovery. In fact, its efforts to control costs also raise optimism in the stock. However, the company’s third-quarter outlook on its automotive unit raises concerns. Going forward, sluggish auto production is likely to hurt results. The weak crude oil scenario is also remains a major concern." (7/21/2017)
2. TD Securities analysts commented, "We believe CSX is poised for a period of accelerated earnings growth under Mr. Harrison, which will likely attract a premium valuation multiple. While the trajectory of the coal business is a risk to our thesis, we note that our forecast does not factor in the potential for substantial U.S." (4/21/2017)
3. Stifel Nicolaus analysts commented, "Hunter Harrison is in as CEO of CSX effective immediately. We expect that this is a commitment to significant OR improvement over the coming investment horizon. Hunter is quoted as saying the team will implement Precision Scheduled Railroading, a technique used to great success at CP in recent years. This comes shortly after CSX announced a commitment for $160 million in management head count reduction." (3/7/2017)
4. Cowen and Company analysts commented, "In a much expected announcement CSX Corporation named Hunter Harrison as Chief Executive Officer, replacing the retiring Michael Ward who will remain as a consultant. The company also reached an agreement with activist investor Mantle Ridge which gives them five new seats (including Mr. Harrison and Mantle Ridge founder Paul Hilal) on Board of Directors. With three incumbent board members announcing their intent to resign their positions at the end of the year, the board will have 13 members now with current director Edward Kelly III becoming Chairman and Paul Hilal Vice Chairman... While CSX was already in the process of laying off/cutting 1,000 people from its management ranks we fully expect that Mr. Harrison will push that number higher and also cut into the rank and file headcount by reducing/combing yards and shops. It is also expected that the company will now focus on faster growing areas of its network, which could lead to some shedding of lines. Mr. Harrison's proverbial playbook of cutting 'fat' and running a scheduled railroad may not seem complicated but his methods are time tested and we fully expect him to easily exceed the company's previous long term OR target of 65% over the next few years. Our previous estimates are currently under review." (3/7/2017)
5. Deutsche Bank AG analysts commented, "Mantle Ridge will receive about 40% of total board seats, equating to 5 appointees (including Hilal and Hunter) out of 13 total seats, which gives effect for former CEO Mike Ward's retirement and roll-off of 3 incumbent board members at the next annual general meeting sometime in the next 3 months (chairman of audit and finance committees and one regular board member). There does not appear to be any standstill agreement, which likely allows Mantle Ridge to continue pressing for change if need be. Interestingly, CSX has not agreed to Hunter Harrison's make-whole payment, choosing instead of put it up for shareholder vote at the annual general meeting, which we think should easily pass (we believe Hunter Harrison has an effective insurance policy on this payment with Mantle Ridge, creating some risk if shareholders don't agree, though we think there is very little probability of that happening)." (3/7/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 9 Hold Ratings, 18 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.67)Consensus Price Target: $53.78 (7.57% upside)

The CSX Corporation is an American holding company focused on real estate and railways in North America, among other industries. The company was established in 1978 as part of the Chessie System and Seaboard Coast Line Industries merger. The Chessie System and Seaboard Coast Line Industries which includes all railroads of both companies became subsidiaries of the CSX Corporation and both companies were merged into the CSX Corporation in 1980, the third year that the CSX Corporation was in operation.
The various railroads of the former Chessie System and Seaboard Coast Line Industries that are now owned by CSX Corporation were eventually merged into a single line in 1986 and it became known as the CSX Transportation. CSX Corporation currently has a number of subsidiaries beyond CSX Transportation, including Fruit Growers Express, CSX Technology, CSX de Mexico, and CSX Real Property among others. Based in Richmond, Virginia, USA after the merger, in 2003 the CSX Corporation headquarters moved to Jacksonville, Florida.

Staff and management[edit]
The founding chairman of CSX Corporation was Prime F. Osborn III of Seaboard,[10] and the first CEO and second chairman was Hays T. Watkins Jr. of Chessie. Watkins was succeeded by John W. Snow as CEO in 1989 and as chairman in 1991. When Snow left the company in 2003 to become United States Secretary of the Treasury, Michael J. Ward, who then headed CSX Transportation, was promoted to succeed him. Overall in 2003, Ward took on the positions of chairman, president, and CEO.[2] When president Oscar Munoz left CSX in September 2015 after obtaining the role earlier that year from Ward, the company underwent several management changes, with Clarence Gooden appointed president.[11] The company went through further changes in 2017 when activist investor Mantle Ridge, a hedge fund that held 4.9% of CSX's stock, demanded a change in the board, that Michael Ward step down as CEO, and that the company cut middle management, and that the company hire Hunter Harrison as CEO; the proposed package for Harrison was $300 million, which caused controversy.[12]
The following is a list of CSX management as of July 2017:

Edward J. Kelly III, Chairman[1]
Hunter Harrison, President and CEO[13]
Fredrik J. Eliasson Executive Vice President, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer[13]
Ellen M. Fitzsimmons, Executive Vice President of Law and Public Affairs, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary[13]
Frank A. Lonegro, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer[13]
Cindy M. Sanborn, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer[13]
Mark K. Wallace, Executive Vice President of Corporate Affairs and Chief of Staff[13]

Finances[edit]
CSX Corporation's total equity was estimated at USD $9.136 billion in 2012,[14] and that rose the following year to $10.504 billion.[15] The value of the company's assets rose from $30.723 billion in 2012[14] to $31.782 billion in 2013.[15] Total revenue equaled USD $12.026 billion in 2013,[14] an increase from $11.763 billion the year before.[14] Operating income was $3.464 billion in 2012[14] and $3.473 billion in 2013,[14] while net income equaled $1.863 billion in 2012[14] and $1.864 billion in 2013. [14] In 2014, annual net income again equaled around $1.86 billion.[2]

Staff and management[edit]
The founding chairman of CSX Corporation was Prime F. Osborn III of Seaboard,[10] and the first CEO and second chairman was Hays T. Watkins Jr. of Chessie. Watkins was succeeded by John W. Snow as CEO in 1989 and as chairman in 1991. When Snow left the company in 2003 to become United States Secretary of the Treasury, Michael J. Ward, who then headed CSX Transportation, was promoted to succeed him. Overall in 2003, Ward took on the positions of chairman, president, and CEO.[2] When president Oscar Munoz left CSX in September 2015 after obtaining the role earlier that year from Ward, the company underwent several management changes, with Clarence Gooden appointed president.[11] The company went through further changes in 2017 when activist investor Mantle Ridge, a hedge fund that held 4.9% of CSX's stock, demanded a change in the board, that Michael Ward step down as CEO, and that the company cut middle management, and that the company hire Hunter Harrison as CEO; the proposed package for Harrison was $300 million, which caused controversy.[12]
The following is a list of CSX management as of July 2017:

Edward J. Kelly III, Chairman[1]
Hunter Harrison, President and CEO[13]
Fredrik J. Eliasson Executive Vice President, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer[13]
Ellen M. Fitzsimmons, Executive Vice President of Law and Public Affairs, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary[13]
Frank A. Lonegro, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer[13]
Cindy M. Sanborn, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer[13]
Mark K. Wallace, Executive Vice President of Corporate Affairs and Chief of Staff[13]

Finances[edit]
CSX Corporation's total equity was estimated at USD $9.136 billion in 2012,[14] and that rose the following year to $10.504 billion.[15] The value of the company's assets rose from $30.723 billion in 2012[14] to $31.782 billion in 2013.[15] Total revenue equaled USD $12.026 billion in 2013,[14] an increase from $11.763 billion the year before.[14] Operating income was $3.464 billion in 2012[14] and $3.473 billion in 2013,[14] while net income equaled $1.863 billion in 2012[14] and $1.864 billion in 2013. [14] In 2014, annual net income again equaled around $1.86 billion.[2]

The CSX Corporation is an American holding company focused on real estate and railways in North America, among other industries. The company was established in 1978 as part of the Chessie System and Seaboard Coast Line Industries merger. The Chessie System and Seaboard Coast Line Industries which includes all railroads of both companies became subsidiaries of the CSX Corporation and both companies were merged into the CSX Corporation in 1980, the third year that the CSX Corporation was in operation.
The various railroads of the former Chessie System and Seaboard Coast Line Industries that are now owned by CSX Corporation were eventually merged into a single line in 1986 and it became known as the CSX Transportation. CSX Corporation currently has a number of subsidiaries beyond CSX Transportation, including Fruit Growers Express, CSX Technology, CSX de Mexico, and CSX Real Property among others. Based in Richmond, Virginia, USA after the merger, in 2003 the CSX Corporation headquarters moved to Jacksonville, Florida.

Staff and management[edit]
The founding chairman of CSX Corporation was Prime F. Osborn III of Seaboard,[10] and the first CEO and second chairman was Hays T. Watkins Jr. of Chessie. Watkins was succeeded by John W. Snow as CEO in 1989 and as chairman in 1991. When Snow left the company in 2003 to become United States Secretary of the Treasury, Michael J. Ward, who then headed CSX Transportation, was promoted to succeed him. Overall in 2003, Ward took on the positions of chairman, president, and CEO.[2] When president Oscar Munoz left CSX in September 2015 after obtaining the role earlier that year from Ward, the company underwent several management changes, with Clarence Gooden appointed president.[11] The company went through further changes in 2017 when activist investor Mantle Ridge, a hedge fund that held 4.9% of CSX's stock, demanded a change in the board, that Michael Ward step down as CEO, and that the company cut middle management, and that the company hire Hunter Harrison as CEO; the proposed package for Harrison was $300 million, which caused controversy.[12]
The following is a list of CSX management as of July 2017:

Edward J. Kelly III, Chairman[1]
Hunter Harrison, President and CEO[13]
Fredrik J. Eliasson Executive Vice President, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer[13]
Ellen M. Fitzsimmons, Executive Vice President of Law and Public Affairs, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary[13]
Frank A. Lonegro, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer[13]
Cindy M. Sanborn, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer[13]
Mark K. Wallace, Executive Vice President of Corporate Affairs and Chief of Staff[13]

Finances[edit]
CSX Corporation's total equity was estimated at USD $9.136 billion in 2012,[14] and that rose the following year to $10.504 billion.[15] The value of the company's assets rose from $30.723 billion in 2012[14] to $31.782 billion in 2013.[15] Total revenue equaled USD $12.026 billion in 2013,[14] an increase from $11.763 billion the year before.[14] Operating income was $3.464 billion in 2012[14] and $3.473 billion in 2013,[14] while net income equaled $1.863 billion in 2012[14] and $1.864 billion in 2013. [14] In 2014, annual net income again equaled around $1.86 billion.[2]

The CSX Corporation is an American holding company focused on real estate and railways in North America, among other industries. The company was established in 1978 as part of the Chessie System and Seaboard Coast Line Industries merger. The Chessie System and Seaboard Coast Line Industries which includes all railroads of both companies became subsidiaries of the CSX Corporation and both companies were merged into the CSX Corporation in 1980, the third year that the CSX Corporation was in operation.
The various railroads of the former Chessie System and Seaboard Coast Line Industries that are now owned by CSX Corporation were eventually merged into a single line in 1986 and it became known as the CSX Transportation. CSX Corporation currently has a number of subsidiaries beyond CSX Transportation, including Fruit Growers Express, CSX Technology, CSX de Mexico, and CSX Real Property among others. Based in Richmond, Virginia, USA after the merger, in 2003 the CSX Corporation headquarters moved to Jacksonville, Florida.

Staff and management[edit]
The founding chairman of CSX Corporation was Prime F. Osborn III of Seaboard,[10] and the first CEO and second chairman was Hays T. Watkins Jr. of Chessie. Watkins was succeeded by John W. Snow as CEO in 1989 and as chairman in 1991. When Snow left the company in 2003 to become United States Secretary of the Treasury, Michael J. Ward, who then headed CSX Transportation, was promoted to succeed him. Overall in 2003, Ward took on the positions of chairman, president, and CEO.[2] When president Oscar Munoz left CSX in September 2015 after obtaining the role earlier that year from Ward, the company underwent several management changes, with Clarence Gooden appointed president.[11] The company went through further changes in 2017 when activist investor Mantle Ridge, a hedge fund that held 4.9% of CSX's stock, demanded a change in the board, that Michael Ward step down as CEO, and that the company cut middle management, and that the company hire Hunter Harrison as CEO; the proposed package for Harrison was $300 million, which caused controversy.[12]
The following is a list of CSX management as of July 2017:

Edward J. Kelly III, Chairman[1]
Hunter Harrison, President and CEO[13]
Fredrik J. Eliasson Executive Vice President, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer[13]
Ellen M. Fitzsimmons, Executive Vice President of Law and Public Affairs, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary[13]
Frank A. Lonegro, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer[13]
Cindy M. Sanborn, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer[13]
Mark K. Wallace, Executive Vice President of Corporate Affairs and Chief of Staff[13]

Finances[edit]
CSX Corporation's total equity was estimated at USD $9.136 billion in 2012,[14] and that rose the following year to $10.504 billion.[15] The value of the company's assets rose from $30.723 billion in 2012[14] to $31.782 billion in 2013.[15] Total revenue equaled USD $12.026 billion in 2013,[14] an increase from $11.763 billion the year before.[14] Operating income was $3.464 billion in 2012[14] and $3.473 billion in 2013,[14] while net income equaled $1.863 billion in 2012[14] and $1.864 billion in 2013. [14] In 2014, annual net income again equaled around $1.86 billion.[2]

The CSX Corporation is an American holding company focused on real estate and railways in North America, among other industries. The company was established in 1978 as part of the Chessie System and Seaboard Coast Line Industries merger. The Chessie System and Seaboard Coast Line Industries which includes all railroads of both companies became subsidiaries of the CSX Corporation and both companies were merged into the CSX Corporation in 1980, the third year that the CSX Corporation was in operation.
The various railroads of the former Chessie System and Seaboard Coast Line Industries that are now owned by CSX Corporation were eventually merged into a single line in 1986 and it became known as the CSX Transportation. CSX Corporation currently has a number of subsidiaries beyond CSX Transportation, including Fruit Growers Express, CSX Technology, CSX de Mexico, and CSX Real Property among others. Based in Richmond, Virginia, USA after the merger, in 2003 the CSX Corporation headquarters moved to Jacksonville, Florida.

Staff and management[edit]
The founding chairman of CSX Corporation was Prime F. Osborn III of Seaboard,[10] and the first CEO and second chairman was Hays T. Watkins Jr. of Chessie. Watkins was succeeded by John W. Snow as CEO in 1989 and as chairman in 1991. When Snow left the company in 2003 to become United States Secretary of the Treasury, Michael J. Ward, who then headed CSX Transportation, was promoted to succeed him. Overall in 2003, Ward took on the positions of chairman, president, and CEO.[2] When president Oscar Munoz left CSX in September 2015 after obtaining the role earlier that year from Ward, the company underwent several management changes, with Clarence Gooden appointed president.[11] The company went through further changes in 2017 when activist investor Mantle Ridge, a hedge fund that held 4.9% of CSX's stock, demanded a change in the board, that Michael Ward step down as CEO, and that the company cut middle management, and that the company hire Hunter Harrison as CEO; the proposed package for Harrison was $300 million, which caused controversy.[12]
The following is a list of CSX management as of July 2017:

Edward J. Kelly III, Chairman[1]
Hunter Harrison, President and CEO[13]
Fredrik J. Eliasson Executive Vice President, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer[13]
Ellen M. Fitzsimmons, Executive Vice President of Law and Public Affairs, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary[13]
Frank A. Lonegro, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer[13]
Cindy M. Sanborn, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer[13]
Mark K. Wallace, Executive Vice President of Corporate Affairs and Chief of Staff[13]

Finances[edit]
CSX Corporation's total equity was estimated at USD $9.136 billion in 2012,[14] and that rose the following year to $10.504 billion.[15] The value of the company's assets rose from $30.723 billion in 2012[14] to $31.782 billion in 2013.[15] Total revenue equaled USD $12.026 billion in 2013,[14] an increase from $11.763 billion the year before.[14] Operating income was $3.464 billion in 2012[14] and $3.473 billion in 2013,[14] while net income equaled $1.863 billion in 2012[14] and $1.864 billion in 2013. [14] In 2014, annual net income again equaled around $1.86 billion.[2]

The CSX Corporation is an American holding company focused on real estate and railways in North America, among other industries. The company was established in 1978 as part of the Chessie System and Seaboard Coast Line Industries merger. The Chessie System and Seaboard Coast Line Industries which includes all railroads of both companies became subsidiaries of the CSX Corporation and both companies were merged into the CSX Corporation in 1980, the third year that the CSX Corporation was in operation.
The various railroads of the former Chessie System and Seaboard Coast Line Industries that are now owned by CSX Corporation were eventually merged into a single line in 1986 and it became known as the CSX Transportation. CSX Corporation currently has a number of subsidiaries beyond CSX Transportation, including Fruit Growers Express, CSX Technology, CSX de Mexico, and CSX Real Property among others. Based in Richmond, Virginia, USA after the merger, in 2003 the CSX Corporation headquarters moved to Jacksonville, Florida.

Staff and management[edit]
The founding chairman of CSX Corporation was Prime F. Osborn III of Seaboard,[10] and the first CEO and second chairman was Hays T. Watkins Jr. of Chessie. Watkins was succeeded by John W. Snow as CEO in 1989 and as chairman in 1991. When Snow left the company in 2003 to become United States Secretary of the Treasury, Michael J. Ward, who then headed CSX Transportation, was promoted to succeed him. Overall in 2003, Ward took on the positions of chairman, president, and CEO.[2] When president Oscar Munoz left CSX in September 2015 after obtaining the role earlier that year from Ward, the company underwent several management changes, with Clarence Gooden appointed president.[11] The company went through further changes in 2017 when activist investor Mantle Ridge, a hedge fund that held 4.9% of CSX's stock, demanded a change in the board, that Michael Ward step down as CEO, and that the company cut middle management, and that the company hire Hunter Harrison as CEO; the proposed package for Harrison was $300 million, which caused controversy.[12]
The following is a list of CSX management as of July 2017:

Edward J. Kelly III, Chairman[1]
Hunter Harrison, President and CEO[13]
Fredrik J. Eliasson Executive Vice President, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer[13]
Ellen M. Fitzsimmons, Executive Vice President of Law and Public Affairs, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary[13]
Frank A. Lonegro, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer[13]
Cindy M. Sanborn, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer[13]
Mark K. Wallace, Executive Vice President of Corporate Affairs and Chief of Staff[13]

Finances[edit]
CSX Corporation's total equity was estimated at USD $9.136 billion in 2012,[14] and that rose the following year to $10.504 billion.[15] The value of the company's assets rose from $30.723 billion in 2012[14] to $31.782 billion in 2013.[15] Total revenue equaled USD $12.026 billion in 2013,[14] an increase from $11.763 billion the year before.[14] Operating income was $3.464 billion in 2012[14] and $3.473 billion in 2013,[14] while net income equaled $1.863 billion in 2012[14] and $1.864 billion in 2013. [14] In 2014, annual net income again equaled around $1.86 billion.[2]
