Wine Access Client Rave: 116 5-stars Ratings
In Paris, the sommeliers at Michelin-starred Le George V, Le Bristol, Le Pré Catelan, and Le Royal Monceau have adopted Diebolt-Vallois’ Blanc des Blancs Brut NV as their own. In New York City, this blew away the competition at Daniel, Marea, and Le Bernardin, earning a place on the list of each. The Diebolt-Vallois Blanc de Blancs NV, drawn from Grand Cru Chardonnay hillsides above the storied Grand Cru villages of Cuis, Chouilly, and Cramant. It is crafted with precision and exquisite refinement in what many believe to be the one of the Côte des Blancs’ most extraordinary cellars. Awarding it 93 points, Wine & Spirits praised its “supple” texture, while Wine Spectator chimed in with 92 points. But Wine Access clients spoke the loudest: so far 116 have rated it a perfect 5 stars.
A quick peek into the estate’s history reveals how an impeccable pedigree of experience has helped us all arrive at the near-unanimous consensus — delicious — on the Diebolt-Vallois Blanc de Blancs. The Vallois half of the family has been cultivating vines in the Côtes des Blancs since the 15th century. The Diebolts arrived in the 19th century. Jacques, the current patriarch, started working the vineyards with his grandfather in the late 1950s. The Diebolts were farmers, but under Jacques’ vision, they ultimately started making their own wines in the auspiciously spectacular 1978 vintage.
We’ve been drinking Diebolt-Vallois Blanc de Blancs as our “anytime” Champagne for years, so we’re just pleased that we’ve found more to offer to our clients, and that so many people seem to agree with our assessment of this sparkler’s stellar quality and value.








Tasting Notes


NV Diebolt-Vallois Blanc de Blancs Brut
 Wine Access
The Diebolt-Vallois Blanc de Blancs is pale gold-green in hue. Tiny bubbles of great persistence. Precise nose of citrus, orange pith, ripe green apple, and freshly baked brioche. Taut, tightly wound, and complex on the attack, with a chalk-infused core of apple, pear and ripe lemon, finishing with terrific tension and vibrancy.
93 Points Wine & Spirits
The texture is supple, the flavors succulent and appetite inducing.
92 Points Wine Spectator
This is fresh and floral on the nose, with a chalky mousse and clean-cut acidity framing flavors of poached pear and white cherry fruit, clover honey and slivered almond on the palate. Lasting, zesty finish of grated ginger and ground spice. Drink now through 2019.

                                The 2014 Teeter-Totter Cabernet boasts the fingerprints of a master craftsman. Bold and dark ruby/purple in the glass, bursting with classic Cabernet notes of blackcurrant, mocha, anise, and subtle toasty notes framed by new wood cedar. Full bodied, boasting silky black fruit, alluring earthy notes and purple florals, a rich and lingering finish is braced by fine-grained tannins. Enjoy now for its opulent, youthful, black-fruited purity, or cellar for at least a decade.

Grape Varietals




Of the many factors that determine the characteristics of a given wine, the grape varietal is perhaps the most important. Although there are over 10,000 different documented varietals within the species Vitis Vinifera (regarded as the "true" wine grapes), the grapes listed on this page are the ones most commonly cultivated for fine wines.
Each grape varietal has differing aroma and flavor characteristics when it is made into wine. But wines made from individual varietals will also vary in character depending on where in the world the grapes are grown: for example, vineyards in New World growing regions will produce wines with different flavors and aromas than vineyards from Old World growing regions, even when the wines are made from the exact same grape varietal.
Use the links below to find top-rated wines for each of the varietals and learn about what makes each varietal unique.

In November, Leyden returned as finance chief at Western Digital for the second time in six years.
His first stint ran from 1983 to 2000, and he rejoined the company in 2007 as executive vice president, finance. 
Last year, Leyden replaced CFO Wolfgang Nickl, who took a similar position with ASML Holding N.V. in the Netherlands to be closer to friends and family in his native Germany.
During his Amgen tenure, Leonetti managed the finances of the company’s global commercial group, which posted revenue of $19 billion in 2013. He also took a leadership role in defining and implementing global product development and commercial strategies, according to Western Digital.
Western Digital shares are flat in after-hours trading Monday, with a market value of about $23.9 billion.

Wine Access Client Rave: 116 5-stars Ratings
In Paris, the sommeliers at Michelin-starred Le George V, Le Bristol, Le Pré Catelan, and Le Royal Monceau have adopted Diebolt-Vallois’ Blanc des Blancs Brut NV as their own. In New York City, this blew away the competition at Daniel, Marea, and Le Bernardin, earning a place on the list of each. The Diebolt-Vallois Blanc de Blancs NV, drawn from Grand Cru Chardonnay hillsides above the storied Grand Cru villages of Cuis, Chouilly, and Cramant. It is crafted with precision and exquisite refinement in what many believe to be the one of the Côte des Blancs’ most extraordinary cellars. Awarding it 93 points, Wine & Spirits praised its “supple” texture, while Wine Spectator chimed in with 92 points. But Wine Access clients spoke the loudest: so far 116 have rated it a perfect 5 stars.
A quick peek into the estate’s history reveals how an impeccable pedigree of experience has helped us all arrive at the near-unanimous consensus — delicious — on the Diebolt-Vallois Blanc de Blancs. The Vallois half of the family has been cultivating vines in the Côtes des Blancs since the 15th century. The Diebolts arrived in the 19th century. Jacques, the current patriarch, started working the vineyards with his grandfather in the late 1950s. The Diebolts were farmers, but under Jacques’ vision, they ultimately started making their own wines in the auspiciously spectacular 1978 vintage.
We’ve been drinking Diebolt-Vallois Blanc de Blancs as our “anytime” Champagne for years, so we’re just pleased that we’ve found more to offer to our clients, and that so many people seem to agree with our assessment of this sparkler’s stellar quality and value.








Tasting Notes


NV Diebolt-Vallois Blanc de Blancs Brut
 Wine Access
The Diebolt-Vallois Blanc de Blancs is pale gold-green in hue. Tiny bubbles of great persistence. Precise nose of citrus, orange pith, ripe green apple, and freshly baked brioche. Taut, tightly wound, and complex on the attack, with a chalk-infused core of apple, pear and ripe lemon, finishing with terrific tension and vibrancy.
93 Points Wine & Spirits
The texture is supple, the flavors succulent and appetite inducing.
92 Points Wine Spectator
This is fresh and floral on the nose, with a chalky mousse and clean-cut acidity framing flavors of poached pear and white cherry fruit, clover honey and slivered almond on the palate. Lasting, zesty finish of grated ginger and ground spice. Drink now through 2019.

                                The 2014 Teeter-Totter Cabernet boasts the fingerprints of a master craftsman. Bold and dark ruby/purple in the glass, bursting with classic Cabernet notes of blackcurrant, mocha, anise, and subtle toasty notes framed by new wood cedar. Full bodied, boasting silky black fruit, alluring earthy notes and purple florals, a rich and lingering finish is braced by fine-grained tannins. Enjoy now for its opulent, youthful, black-fruited purity, or cellar for at least a decade.

Grape Varietals




Of the many factors that determine the characteristics of a given wine, the grape varietal is perhaps the most important. Although there are over 10,000 different documented varietals within the species Vitis Vinifera (regarded as the "true" wine grapes), the grapes listed on this page are the ones most commonly cultivated for fine wines.
Each grape varietal has differing aroma and flavor characteristics when it is made into wine. But wines made from individual varietals will also vary in character depending on where in the world the grapes are grown: for example, vineyards in New World growing regions will produce wines with different flavors and aromas than vineyards from Old World growing regions, even when the wines are made from the exact same grape varietal.
Use the links below to find top-rated wines for each of the varietals and learn about what makes each varietal unique.
