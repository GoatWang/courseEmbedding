Tim Kennedy is a native New Orleanian who grew up on the corner of Magazine and Calhoun Sts. next to Audubon Park. He attended De La Salle High School and graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from LSU in 1973. That same year, he began working as head artist and backdrop painter for Spangenberg Studios, then known as the premier scenic decorator for all of the major Mardi Gras balls. During the 1980's, he worked for famous float builders, Louis Massett and Barth Bros. Tim was promoted to Art Director at Spangenberg Studios in 1986. In addition to painting and sculpting, he began to design the decor for major events. In 1995, Tim met Blain Kern, Jr. and became Art Director of his company, Mardi Gras Productions. His next 10 years were spent designing, painting and sculpting five warehouses full of fabulous inventory.
During Tim's tenure, MGP became a considerable player in the national and international special events scene. With Blaine, Tim worked with the likes of CA World, Microsoft, Miller Beer, Coca Cola, the NFL and many other major entities when they came to New Orleans to party. Post Katrina found Tim collaborating with old friend and eccentric genius, Joe Barth, III. Together they fabricated three floats that became the focal point of the Orange Beach Mardi Gras. Upon returning to New Orleans, in February 2006, Tim met up with old friends; float builder, Dale Ducote, Captain of Thoth, Penny Larson and Captain of Zeus, Phil Lundgren. Tim designed and painted floats, murals and ball sets for Thoth, Zeus and Carrolton Mardi Gras organizations. He also designed Zeus' court costumes for the 2007 season. Tim did reunite with Blaine Kern, Jr. at Mardi Gras Productions in March 2007 and collaborated on renowned projects such as, "The Miracle on Fulton Street", the set for the Regis and Kelly Show, the NOMA "Blue Winds Dancing" exhibit and events for the NBA All-Star weekend just to name a few. If you would like to own one of the native New Orleanians' cool and funky sculptures, he has joined the family of artists at Sandy Kasten's Teri Galleries, LTD.
