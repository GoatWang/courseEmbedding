We issued an updated research report on AGCO Corporation (AGCO  -  Free Report)	 on Jul 4. The manufacturer of farm equipment is likely to benefit from focus on product development. Increased investments through capital expenditures and engineering spend, as well as long-term capital allocation plan will also aid growth.AGCO continues to invest in initiatives which will drive long-term benefits, raise the efficiency of factories, improve service levels, as well as strengthen the company’s product offerings. The company’s consistent efforts to refresh its full line of equipment, with focus on high horsepower products for the growing professional farming sector, as well as new products, will expand the current product offering.AGCO’s new products have been performing very well in the market as evident from the number of awards received in Feb 2017 at the SIMA Farm Show in Paris, including the Machine of the Year Award for the Massey Ferguson 6718 S.Despite the soft demand environment, the company continues to make strategic investments. AGCO intends to increase the level of investment to execute product development plans, resulting in increased capital expenditures and engineering spend during 2017. The company’s spending plan in 2017 is needed to maintain competitiveness and support the long-term prospects of its business.In the first-quarter conference call, AGCO raised its net sales guidance to approximately $7.7 billion for 2017. The company projects earnings per share for 2017 to be approximately $2.70. For the long term, it expects elevated grain demand, driven by population growth and increased protein consumption, which will result in favorable income levels for farmers.Despite these positives, AGCO underperformed the Zacks classified Machinery Farm sub-industry with respect to price performance over the past one year, mainly due to lower industry equipment demand and elevated expenses. The stock gained around 45.4%, while the industry recorded growth of 53.4%, over the same time frame.AGCO currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the sector include Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (APOG  -  Free Report)	, Worthington Industries, Inc. (WOR  -  Free Report)	 and Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report)	. All three stocks boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Apogee has an average positive earnings surprise of 3.42% for the trailing four quarters.Worthington generated an average positive earnings surprise of 4.05% over the past four quarters.Deere has a remarkable average positive earnings surprise of 70.41% for the last four quarters.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation. See Them Free>>

History[edit]




Hesston 5670 round baler, in 2010


AGCO was established in 1990 when executives at Deutz-Allis bought out Deutz-Allis North American operations from the parent corporation KHD (Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz), a German company that owned the Deutz-Fahr brand of agriculture equipment. KHD had purchased portions of the Allis-Chalmers agricultural equipment business five years earlier.[3]
The company was first called Gleaner-Allis Corporation, then rearranged to be Allis-Gleaner Corporation, or AGCO. The Deutz-Allis line of tractors were renamed AGCO-Allis, and Gleaner became a brand of its own for combines. The Deutz-Allis brand continued in South America until 2001, when they were renamed AGCO-Allis. In 2001, AGCO Allis was renamed AGCO in North America.
In March 1991, AGCO purchased the Hesston Corporation[4][5] gaining hay and forage equipment as well as technologies such as the grain auger (used to unload grain quickly from combines), invented in 1947 by Lyle Yost.[6] Hesston had a 50 percent joint venture with Case International, now a part of CNH Global. AGCO purchased the White Tractor line from the Allied Corporation's White-New Idea company.[7] In 1993, AGCO purchased the remainder of White-New Idea,[8] gaining New Idea hay equipment and manure spreaders, and White planters. White New Idea had a large manufacturing plant operating in Coldwater, Ohio, USA.




Massey Ferguson 6490 tractor, in 2008


Also in 1993, AGCO purchased the North American distribution rights to Massey Ferguson, a worldwide agricultural equipment company. In 1994, they purchased McConnell Tractors,[4] manufacturer of the large articulated Massey Ferguson tractors. AGCO developed the Agcostar line of articulated tractors. Later in 1994, the Black Machine line of planters was purchased.
1995 saw the purchase of the AgEquipment Group,[7] which manufactured tillage equipment and loaders under the Glenco, Tye and Farmhand brands. In 1996, acquisitions went international with the purchase of Iochpe-Maxion in Brazil.[4] This was the Brazilian company that had rights to the Massey Ferguson brand and manufacturing in the region, as well as the Maxion brand of industrial equipment. This was also the year that AGCO purchased Deutz Argentina, the number one leader of tractors in Argentina.[8] Also in 1996, AGCO purchased Western Combine Corporation and Portage Manufacturing in Canada.[9] Western Combine had previously purchased the assets of the Massey Combine Corporation's combine operation, which had been spun off by Massey-Ferguson.




Fendt 930 Vario tractor, in 2009


1997 was the year of the major purchase of Fendt in Germany, the leading German tractor company.[10] Fendt is well known for its advanced technology. AGCO also acquired Dronningborg Industries in Denmark, the manufacturer of European Massey-Ferguson combines, and former manufacturer of Dronningborg combines.[11]
In 1998, AGCO made a joint venture with Deutz AG to produce engines in Argentina, and purchased the Spra-Coupe and Willmar companies.[12] Spra-Coupe and Willmar are leading sprayer companies in North America. SpraCoupe originated in Bismarck, ND. Upon purchase by AGCO, the manufacturing of SpraCoupes was moved to Willmar, Minnesota where the Willmar branded fertilizer tenders and "Wrangler" articulated loaders were being manufactured. SpraCoupe and Willmar products were manufactured in Willmar from 1998 to 2001.
For the year 2000, AGCO bought out its partner CNH Global N.V. in the Hay and Forage Industries joint venture.[13]
In 2001, AGCO purchased Ag-Chem Equipment, expanding its application equipment business.[14] Ag-Chem Equipment was based in Jackson, Minnesota and developed the TerraGator flotation-type and RoGator rowcrop-type applicators. Also that year, the SpraCoupe and Willmar brands moved their manufacturing from Willmar, MN to the Jackson, Minnesota facility and the Agco-Allis and White tractor lines were merged in North America under the AGCO brand, continuing in the orange color.
2002 was the year that AGCO purchased rights to the Challenger name and the tracked tractors from the Caterpillar Corporation,[15] giving AGCO a well-known brand name and high-power tracked tractors. AGCO further developed the Challenger line into: wheeled tractors, using tractors manufactured by Iseki, Agritalia, the Massey Ferguson factory and the Brazilian Valtra factory; combines, rebranding some Massey Ferguson/Gleaner -built combines; and hay equipment, using Hesston-built hay equipment. AGCO also purchased the Sunflower Manufacturing Company in Beloit, Kansas, which manufactures tillage, seeding and specialty harvesting equipment.[16]
2004 brought about the purchase of the Valtra tractor company from the Kone Group, in Finland. Valtra has some licensing agreements with the Eicher company in India for tractor production, and also with the HEMA group in Turkey. The purchase of Valtra also included SISU POWER engines.[17][18]




Valtra T170 tractor, in 2008


2006 saw a re-focusing of the various brands, and the reduction of individual brands. AGCO announced plans to combine some, and make some only part of a larger brand, or co-branding. Examples include the Massey Ferguson 9635 Hesston self-propelled swather, and the AGCO 9365 Hesston self-propelled swather. Challenger has seen further expansion with the further consolidation of the AgChem brand into Challenger, and the introduction of Agritalia built tractors and an articulated Challenger tractor.
In 2007, AGCO bought 50% of Laverda S.p.A from ARGO SpA, which included the Gallagnani and Fella-Werke hay equipment brands.[19][20]
In 2008/2009 AGCO, the Challenger, Valtra, and Massey Ferguson large row crop tractors were launched in Europe and North America respectively with AGCO's e3 Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) emission reduction technology.[21]
Late in 2009, AGCO announced that it would phase out the orange AGCO Tractors by 2011.[22]
In late 2010, AGCO announced the plan to acquire the remaining 50% of Laverda, which included Fella-Werke as well. The acquisition was finalized in March 2011.[23][24][25]
In 2011, AGCO plans to transfer its high-horsepower wheeled-tractor assembly of tractors sold in North America from Beauvais, France to Jackson, Minnesota, where it will expand the plant by 75,000 square feet (7,000 m2).[26]
In 2011, AGCO said that it will invest $40 million in its Hesston plant by building a new 200,000-square-foot (19,000 m2) painting and finishing building. Construction began June 2011 and was completed in 2013.[27][28][29]
In October 2011, AGCO purchased GSI. It was based in Assumption, Illinois and manufactures grain storage and handling equipment as the GSI Group.[30]
In 2012. AGCO acquired 60% of Santal Equipamentos, a sugar cane planting and harvesting equipment. AGCO purchased 80% of Shandong Dafeng Machinery Co, a combine harvester manufacturer in China. AGCO formed the Algerian Tractors Company joint venture with the Algerian brand Etrag with 49% ownership.
In 2013, AGCO’s GSI acquired Johnson System, a manufacturer of catwalks and towers.

History[edit]




Hesston 5670 round baler, in 2010


AGCO was established in 1990 when executives at Deutz-Allis bought out Deutz-Allis North American operations from the parent corporation KHD (Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz), a German company that owned the Deutz-Fahr brand of agriculture equipment. KHD had purchased portions of the Allis-Chalmers agricultural equipment business five years earlier.[3]
The company was first called Gleaner-Allis Corporation, then rearranged to be Allis-Gleaner Corporation, or AGCO. The Deutz-Allis line of tractors were renamed AGCO-Allis, and Gleaner became a brand of its own for combines. The Deutz-Allis brand continued in South America until 2001, when they were renamed AGCO-Allis. In 2001, AGCO Allis was renamed AGCO in North America.
In March 1991, AGCO purchased the Hesston Corporation[4][5] gaining hay and forage equipment as well as technologies such as the grain auger (used to unload grain quickly from combines), invented in 1947 by Lyle Yost.[6] Hesston had a 50 percent joint venture with Case International, now a part of CNH Global. AGCO purchased the White Tractor line from the Allied Corporation's White-New Idea company.[7] In 1993, AGCO purchased the remainder of White-New Idea,[8] gaining New Idea hay equipment and manure spreaders, and White planters. White New Idea had a large manufacturing plant operating in Coldwater, Ohio, USA.




Massey Ferguson 6490 tractor, in 2008


Also in 1993, AGCO purchased the North American distribution rights to Massey Ferguson, a worldwide agricultural equipment company. In 1994, they purchased McConnell Tractors,[4] manufacturer of the large articulated Massey Ferguson tractors. AGCO developed the Agcostar line of articulated tractors. Later in 1994, the Black Machine line of planters was purchased.
1995 saw the purchase of the AgEquipment Group,[7] which manufactured tillage equipment and loaders under the Glenco, Tye and Farmhand brands. In 1996, acquisitions went international with the purchase of Iochpe-Maxion in Brazil.[4] This was the Brazilian company that had rights to the Massey Ferguson brand and manufacturing in the region, as well as the Maxion brand of industrial equipment. This was also the year that AGCO purchased Deutz Argentina, the number one leader of tractors in Argentina.[8] Also in 1996, AGCO purchased Western Combine Corporation and Portage Manufacturing in Canada.[9] Western Combine had previously purchased the assets of the Massey Combine Corporation's combine operation, which had been spun off by Massey-Ferguson.




Fendt 930 Vario tractor, in 2009


1997 was the year of the major purchase of Fendt in Germany, the leading German tractor company.[10] Fendt is well known for its advanced technology. AGCO also acquired Dronningborg Industries in Denmark, the manufacturer of European Massey-Ferguson combines, and former manufacturer of Dronningborg combines.[11]
In 1998, AGCO made a joint venture with Deutz AG to produce engines in Argentina, and purchased the Spra-Coupe and Willmar companies.[12] Spra-Coupe and Willmar are leading sprayer companies in North America. SpraCoupe originated in Bismarck, ND. Upon purchase by AGCO, the manufacturing of SpraCoupes was moved to Willmar, Minnesota where the Willmar branded fertilizer tenders and "Wrangler" articulated loaders were being manufactured. SpraCoupe and Willmar products were manufactured in Willmar from 1998 to 2001.
For the year 2000, AGCO bought out its partner CNH Global N.V. in the Hay and Forage Industries joint venture.[13]
In 2001, AGCO purchased Ag-Chem Equipment, expanding its application equipment business.[14] Ag-Chem Equipment was based in Jackson, Minnesota and developed the TerraGator flotation-type and RoGator rowcrop-type applicators. Also that year, the SpraCoupe and Willmar brands moved their manufacturing from Willmar, MN to the Jackson, Minnesota facility and the Agco-Allis and White tractor lines were merged in North America under the AGCO brand, continuing in the orange color.
2002 was the year that AGCO purchased rights to the Challenger name and the tracked tractors from the Caterpillar Corporation,[15] giving AGCO a well-known brand name and high-power tracked tractors. AGCO further developed the Challenger line into: wheeled tractors, using tractors manufactured by Iseki, Agritalia, the Massey Ferguson factory and the Brazilian Valtra factory; combines, rebranding some Massey Ferguson/Gleaner -built combines; and hay equipment, using Hesston-built hay equipment. AGCO also purchased the Sunflower Manufacturing Company in Beloit, Kansas, which manufactures tillage, seeding and specialty harvesting equipment.[16]
2004 brought about the purchase of the Valtra tractor company from the Kone Group, in Finland. Valtra has some licensing agreements with the Eicher company in India for tractor production, and also with the HEMA group in Turkey. The purchase of Valtra also included SISU POWER engines.[17][18]




Valtra T170 tractor, in 2008


2006 saw a re-focusing of the various brands, and the reduction of individual brands. AGCO announced plans to combine some, and make some only part of a larger brand, or co-branding. Examples include the Massey Ferguson 9635 Hesston self-propelled swather, and the AGCO 9365 Hesston self-propelled swather. Challenger has seen further expansion with the further consolidation of the AgChem brand into Challenger, and the introduction of Agritalia built tractors and an articulated Challenger tractor.
In 2007, AGCO bought 50% of Laverda S.p.A from ARGO SpA, which included the Gallagnani and Fella-Werke hay equipment brands.[19][20]
In 2008/2009 AGCO, the Challenger, Valtra, and Massey Ferguson large row crop tractors were launched in Europe and North America respectively with AGCO's e3 Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) emission reduction technology.[21]
Late in 2009, AGCO announced that it would phase out the orange AGCO Tractors by 2011.[22]
In late 2010, AGCO announced the plan to acquire the remaining 50% of Laverda, which included Fella-Werke as well. The acquisition was finalized in March 2011.[23][24][25]
In 2011, AGCO plans to transfer its high-horsepower wheeled-tractor assembly of tractors sold in North America from Beauvais, France to Jackson, Minnesota, where it will expand the plant by 75,000 square feet (7,000 m2).[26]
In 2011, AGCO said that it will invest $40 million in its Hesston plant by building a new 200,000-square-foot (19,000 m2) painting and finishing building. Construction began June 2011 and was completed in 2013.[27][28][29]
In October 2011, AGCO purchased GSI. It was based in Assumption, Illinois and manufactures grain storage and handling equipment as the GSI Group.[30]
In 2012. AGCO acquired 60% of Santal Equipamentos, a sugar cane planting and harvesting equipment. AGCO purchased 80% of Shandong Dafeng Machinery Co, a combine harvester manufacturer in China. AGCO formed the Algerian Tractors Company joint venture with the Algerian brand Etrag with 49% ownership.
In 2013, AGCO’s GSI acquired Johnson System, a manufacturer of catwalks and towers.
Other Brands[edit]

Sunflower Manufacturing is the tillage and seeding division of the AGCO Corporation, and manufactures all equipment used for tillage of land, including discs, cultivators and finishing tillage equipment, as well as seeding equipment for grains. [31]

History[edit]




Hesston 5670 round baler, in 2010


AGCO was established in 1990 when executives at Deutz-Allis bought out Deutz-Allis North American operations from the parent corporation KHD (Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz), a German company that owned the Deutz-Fahr brand of agriculture equipment. KHD had purchased portions of the Allis-Chalmers agricultural equipment business five years earlier.[3]
The company was first called Gleaner-Allis Corporation, then rearranged to be Allis-Gleaner Corporation, or AGCO. The Deutz-Allis line of tractors were renamed AGCO-Allis, and Gleaner became a brand of its own for combines. The Deutz-Allis brand continued in South America until 2001, when they were renamed AGCO-Allis. In 2001, AGCO Allis was renamed AGCO in North America.
In March 1991, AGCO purchased the Hesston Corporation[4][5] gaining hay and forage equipment as well as technologies such as the grain auger (used to unload grain quickly from combines), invented in 1947 by Lyle Yost.[6] Hesston had a 50 percent joint venture with Case International, now a part of CNH Global. AGCO purchased the White Tractor line from the Allied Corporation's White-New Idea company.[7] In 1993, AGCO purchased the remainder of White-New Idea,[8] gaining New Idea hay equipment and manure spreaders, and White planters. White New Idea had a large manufacturing plant operating in Coldwater, Ohio, USA.




Massey Ferguson 6490 tractor, in 2008


Also in 1993, AGCO purchased the North American distribution rights to Massey Ferguson, a worldwide agricultural equipment company. In 1994, they purchased McConnell Tractors,[4] manufacturer of the large articulated Massey Ferguson tractors. AGCO developed the Agcostar line of articulated tractors. Later in 1994, the Black Machine line of planters was purchased.
1995 saw the purchase of the AgEquipment Group,[7] which manufactured tillage equipment and loaders under the Glenco, Tye and Farmhand brands. In 1996, acquisitions went international with the purchase of Iochpe-Maxion in Brazil.[4] This was the Brazilian company that had rights to the Massey Ferguson brand and manufacturing in the region, as well as the Maxion brand of industrial equipment. This was also the year that AGCO purchased Deutz Argentina, the number one leader of tractors in Argentina.[8] Also in 1996, AGCO purchased Western Combine Corporation and Portage Manufacturing in Canada.[9] Western Combine had previously purchased the assets of the Massey Combine Corporation's combine operation, which had been spun off by Massey-Ferguson.




Fendt 930 Vario tractor, in 2009


1997 was the year of the major purchase of Fendt in Germany, the leading German tractor company.[10] Fendt is well known for its advanced technology. AGCO also acquired Dronningborg Industries in Denmark, the manufacturer of European Massey-Ferguson combines, and former manufacturer of Dronningborg combines.[11]
In 1998, AGCO made a joint venture with Deutz AG to produce engines in Argentina, and purchased the Spra-Coupe and Willmar companies.[12] Spra-Coupe and Willmar are leading sprayer companies in North America. SpraCoupe originated in Bismarck, ND. Upon purchase by AGCO, the manufacturing of SpraCoupes was moved to Willmar, Minnesota where the Willmar branded fertilizer tenders and "Wrangler" articulated loaders were being manufactured. SpraCoupe and Willmar products were manufactured in Willmar from 1998 to 2001.
For the year 2000, AGCO bought out its partner CNH Global N.V. in the Hay and Forage Industries joint venture.[13]
In 2001, AGCO purchased Ag-Chem Equipment, expanding its application equipment business.[14] Ag-Chem Equipment was based in Jackson, Minnesota and developed the TerraGator flotation-type and RoGator rowcrop-type applicators. Also that year, the SpraCoupe and Willmar brands moved their manufacturing from Willmar, MN to the Jackson, Minnesota facility and the Agco-Allis and White tractor lines were merged in North America under the AGCO brand, continuing in the orange color.
2002 was the year that AGCO purchased rights to the Challenger name and the tracked tractors from the Caterpillar Corporation,[15] giving AGCO a well-known brand name and high-power tracked tractors. AGCO further developed the Challenger line into: wheeled tractors, using tractors manufactured by Iseki, Agritalia, the Massey Ferguson factory and the Brazilian Valtra factory; combines, rebranding some Massey Ferguson/Gleaner -built combines; and hay equipment, using Hesston-built hay equipment. AGCO also purchased the Sunflower Manufacturing Company in Beloit, Kansas, which manufactures tillage, seeding and specialty harvesting equipment.[16]
2004 brought about the purchase of the Valtra tractor company from the Kone Group, in Finland. Valtra has some licensing agreements with the Eicher company in India for tractor production, and also with the HEMA group in Turkey. The purchase of Valtra also included SISU POWER engines.[17][18]




Valtra T170 tractor, in 2008


2006 saw a re-focusing of the various brands, and the reduction of individual brands. AGCO announced plans to combine some, and make some only part of a larger brand, or co-branding. Examples include the Massey Ferguson 9635 Hesston self-propelled swather, and the AGCO 9365 Hesston self-propelled swather. Challenger has seen further expansion with the further consolidation of the AgChem brand into Challenger, and the introduction of Agritalia built tractors and an articulated Challenger tractor.
In 2007, AGCO bought 50% of Laverda S.p.A from ARGO SpA, which included the Gallagnani and Fella-Werke hay equipment brands.[19][20]
In 2008/2009 AGCO, the Challenger, Valtra, and Massey Ferguson large row crop tractors were launched in Europe and North America respectively with AGCO's e3 Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) emission reduction technology.[21]
Late in 2009, AGCO announced that it would phase out the orange AGCO Tractors by 2011.[22]
In late 2010, AGCO announced the plan to acquire the remaining 50% of Laverda, which included Fella-Werke as well. The acquisition was finalized in March 2011.[23][24][25]
In 2011, AGCO plans to transfer its high-horsepower wheeled-tractor assembly of tractors sold in North America from Beauvais, France to Jackson, Minnesota, where it will expand the plant by 75,000 square feet (7,000 m2).[26]
In 2011, AGCO said that it will invest $40 million in its Hesston plant by building a new 200,000-square-foot (19,000 m2) painting and finishing building. Construction began June 2011 and was completed in 2013.[27][28][29]
In October 2011, AGCO purchased GSI. It was based in Assumption, Illinois and manufactures grain storage and handling equipment as the GSI Group.[30]
In 2012. AGCO acquired 60% of Santal Equipamentos, a sugar cane planting and harvesting equipment. AGCO purchased 80% of Shandong Dafeng Machinery Co, a combine harvester manufacturer in China. AGCO formed the Algerian Tractors Company joint venture with the Algerian brand Etrag with 49% ownership.

History[edit]




Hesston 5670 round baler, in 2010


AGCO was established in 1990 when executives at Deutz-Allis bought out Deutz-Allis North American operations from the parent corporation KHD (Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz), a German company that owned the Deutz-Fahr brand of agriculture equipment. KHD had purchased portions of the Allis-Chalmers agricultural equipment business five years earlier.[3]
The company was first called Gleaner-Allis Corporation, then rearranged to be Allis-Gleaner Corporation, or AGCO. The Deutz-Allis line of tractors were renamed AGCO-Allis, and Gleaner became a brand of its own for combines. The Deutz-Allis brand continued in South America until 2001, when they were renamed AGCO-Allis. In 2001, AGCO Allis was renamed AGCO in North America.
In March 1991, AGCO purchased the Hesston Corporation[4][5] gaining hay and forage equipment as well as technologies such as the grain auger (used to unload grain quickly from combines), invented in 1947 by Lyle Yost.[6] Hesston had a 50 percent joint venture with Case International, now a part of CNH Global. AGCO purchased the White Tractor line from the Allied Corporation's White-New Idea company.[7] In 1993, AGCO purchased the remainder of White-New Idea,[8] gaining New Idea hay equipment and manure spreaders, and White planters. White New Idea had a large manufacturing plant operating in Coldwater, Ohio, USA.




Massey Ferguson 6490 tractor, in 2008


Also in 1993, AGCO purchased the North American distribution rights to Massey Ferguson, a worldwide agricultural equipment company. In 1994, they purchased McConnell Tractors,[4] manufacturer of the large articulated Massey Ferguson tractors. AGCO developed the Agcostar line of articulated tractors. Later in 1994, the Black Machine line of planters was purchased.
1995 saw the purchase of the AgEquipment Group,[7] which manufactured tillage equipment and loaders under the Glenco, Tye and Farmhand brands. In 1996, acquisitions went international with the purchase of Iochpe-Maxion in Brazil.[4] This was the Brazilian company that had rights to the Massey Ferguson brand and manufacturing in the region, as well as the Maxion brand of industrial equipment. This was also the year that AGCO purchased Deutz Argentina, the number one leader of tractors in Argentina.[8] Also in 1996, AGCO purchased Western Combine Corporation and Portage Manufacturing in Canada.[9] Western Combine had previously purchased the assets of the Massey Combine Corporation's combine operation, which had been spun off by Massey-Ferguson.




Fendt 930 Vario tractor, in 2009


1997 was the year of the major purchase of Fendt in Germany, the leading German tractor company.[10] Fendt is well known for its advanced technology. AGCO also acquired Dronningborg Industries in Denmark, the manufacturer of European Massey-Ferguson combines, and former manufacturer of Dronningborg combines.[11]
In 1998, AGCO made a joint venture with Deutz AG to produce engines in Argentina, and purchased the Spra-Coupe and Willmar companies.[12] Spra-Coupe and Willmar are leading sprayer companies in North America. SpraCoupe originated in Bismarck, ND. Upon purchase by AGCO, the manufacturing of SpraCoupes was moved to Willmar, Minnesota where the Willmar branded fertilizer tenders and "Wrangler" articulated loaders were being manufactured. SpraCoupe and Willmar products were manufactured in Willmar from 1998 to 2001.
For the year 2000, AGCO bought out its partner CNH Global N.V. in the Hay and Forage Industries joint venture.[13]
In 2001, AGCO purchased Ag-Chem Equipment, expanding its application equipment business.[14] Ag-Chem Equipment was based in Jackson, Minnesota and developed the TerraGator flotation-type and RoGator rowcrop-type applicators. Also that year, the SpraCoupe and Willmar brands moved their manufacturing from Willmar, MN to the Jackson, Minnesota facility and the Agco-Allis and White tractor lines were merged in North America under the AGCO brand, continuing in the orange color.
2002 was the year that AGCO purchased rights to the Challenger name and the tracked tractors from the Caterpillar Corporation,[15] giving AGCO a well-known brand name and high-power tracked tractors. AGCO further developed the Challenger line into: wheeled tractors, using tractors manufactured by Iseki, Agritalia, the Massey Ferguson factory and the Brazilian Valtra factory; combines, rebranding some Massey Ferguson/Gleaner -built combines; and hay equipment, using Hesston-built hay equipment. AGCO also purchased the Sunflower Manufacturing Company in Beloit, Kansas, which manufactures tillage, seeding and specialty harvesting equipment.[16]
2004 brought about the purchase of the Valtra tractor company from the Kone Group, in Finland. Valtra has some licensing agreements with the Eicher company in India for tractor production, and also with the HEMA group in Turkey. The purchase of Valtra also included SISU POWER engines.[17][18]




Valtra T170 tractor, in 2008


2006 saw a re-focusing of the various brands, and the reduction of individual brands. AGCO announced plans to combine some, and make some only part of a larger brand, or co-branding. Examples include the Massey Ferguson 9635 Hesston self-propelled swather, and the AGCO 9365 Hesston self-propelled swather. Challenger has seen further expansion with the further consolidation of the AgChem brand into Challenger, and the introduction of Agritalia built tractors and an articulated Challenger tractor.
In 2007, AGCO bought 50% of Laverda S.p.A from ARGO SpA, which included the Gallagnani and Fella-Werke hay equipment brands.[19][20]
In 2008/2009 AGCO, the Challenger, Valtra, and Massey Ferguson large row crop tractors were launched in Europe and North America respectively with AGCO's e3 Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) emission reduction technology.[21]
Late in 2009, AGCO announced that it would phase out the orange AGCO Tractors by 2011.[22]
In late 2010, AGCO announced the plan to acquire the remaining 50% of Laverda, which included Fella-Werke as well. The acquisition was finalized in March 2011.[23][24][25]
In 2011, AGCO plans to transfer its high-horsepower wheeled-tractor assembly of tractors sold in North America from Beauvais, France to Jackson, Minnesota, where it will expand the plant by 75,000 square feet (7,000 m2).[26]
In 2011, AGCO said that it will invest $40 million in its Hesston plant by building a new 200,000-square-foot (19,000 m2) painting and finishing building. Construction began June 2011 and was completed in 2013.[27][28][29]
In October 2011, AGCO purchased GSI. It was based in Assumption, Illinois and manufactures grain storage and handling equipment as the GSI Group.[30]
In 2012. AGCO acquired 60% of Santal Equipamentos, a sugar cane planting and harvesting equipment. AGCO purchased 80% of Shandong Dafeng Machinery Co, a combine harvester manufacturer in China. AGCO formed the Algerian Tractors Company joint venture with the Algerian brand Etrag with 49% ownership.
In 2013, AGCO’s GSI acquired Johnson System, a manufacturer of catwalks and towers.
Other Brands[edit]

Sunflower Manufacturing is the tillage and seeding division of the AGCO Corporation, and manufactures all equipment used for tillage of land, including discs, cultivators and finishing tillage equipment, as well as seeding equipment for grains. [31]

History[edit]




Hesston 5670 round baler, in 2010


AGCO was established in 1990 when executives at Deutz-Allis bought out Deutz-Allis North American operations from the parent corporation KHD (Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz), a German company that owned the Deutz-Fahr brand of agriculture equipment. KHD had purchased portions of the Allis-Chalmers agricultural equipment business five years earlier.[3]
The company was first called Gleaner-Allis Corporation, then rearranged to be Allis-Gleaner Corporation, or AGCO. The Deutz-Allis line of tractors were renamed AGCO-Allis, and Gleaner became a brand of its own for combines. The Deutz-Allis brand continued in South America until 2001, when they were renamed AGCO-Allis. In 2001, AGCO Allis was renamed AGCO in North America.
In March 1991, AGCO purchased the Hesston Corporation[4][5] gaining hay and forage equipment as well as technologies such as the grain auger (used to unload grain quickly from combines), invented in 1947 by Lyle Yost.[6] Hesston had a 50 percent joint venture with Case International, now a part of CNH Global. AGCO purchased the White Tractor line from the Allied Corporation's White-New Idea company.[7] In 1993, AGCO purchased the remainder of White-New Idea,[8] gaining New Idea hay equipment and manure spreaders, and White planters. White New Idea had a large manufacturing plant operating in Coldwater, Ohio, USA.




Massey Ferguson 6490 tractor, in 2008


Also in 1993, AGCO purchased the North American distribution rights to Massey Ferguson, a worldwide agricultural equipment company. In 1994, they purchased McConnell Tractors,[4] manufacturer of the large articulated Massey Ferguson tractors. AGCO developed the Agcostar line of articulated tractors. Later in 1994, the Black Machine line of planters was purchased.
1995 saw the purchase of the AgEquipment Group,[7] which manufactured tillage equipment and loaders under the Glenco, Tye and Farmhand brands. In 1996, acquisitions went international with the purchase of Iochpe-Maxion in Brazil.[4] This was the Brazilian company that had rights to the Massey Ferguson brand and manufacturing in the region, as well as the Maxion brand of industrial equipment. This was also the year that AGCO purchased Deutz Argentina, the number one leader of tractors in Argentina.[8] Also in 1996, AGCO purchased Western Combine Corporation and Portage Manufacturing in Canada.[9] Western Combine had previously purchased the assets of the Massey Combine Corporation's combine operation, which had been spun off by Massey-Ferguson.




Fendt 930 Vario tractor, in 2009


1997 was the year of the major purchase of Fendt in Germany, the leading German tractor company.[10] Fendt is well known for its advanced technology. AGCO also acquired Dronningborg Industries in Denmark, the manufacturer of European Massey-Ferguson combines, and former manufacturer of Dronningborg combines.[11]
In 1998, AGCO made a joint venture with Deutz AG to produce engines in Argentina, and purchased the Spra-Coupe and Willmar companies.[12] Spra-Coupe and Willmar are leading sprayer companies in North America. SpraCoupe originated in Bismarck, ND. Upon purchase by AGCO, the manufacturing of SpraCoupes was moved to Willmar, Minnesota where the Willmar branded fertilizer tenders and "Wrangler" articulated loaders were being manufactured. SpraCoupe and Willmar products were manufactured in Willmar from 1998 to 2001.
For the year 2000, AGCO bought out its partner CNH Global N.V. in the Hay and Forage Industries joint venture.[13]
In 2001, AGCO purchased Ag-Chem Equipment, expanding its application equipment business.[14] Ag-Chem Equipment was based in Jackson, Minnesota and developed the TerraGator flotation-type and RoGator rowcrop-type applicators. Also that year, the SpraCoupe and Willmar brands moved their manufacturing from Willmar, MN to the Jackson, Minnesota facility and the Agco-Allis and White tractor lines were merged in North America under the AGCO brand, continuing in the orange color.
2002 was the year that AGCO purchased rights to the Challenger name and the tracked tractors from the Caterpillar Corporation,[15] giving AGCO a well-known brand name and high-power tracked tractors. AGCO further developed the Challenger line into: wheeled tractors, using tractors manufactured by Iseki, Agritalia, the Massey Ferguson factory and the Brazilian Valtra factory; combines, rebranding some Massey Ferguson/Gleaner -built combines; and hay equipment, using Hesston-built hay equipment. AGCO also purchased the Sunflower Manufacturing Company in Beloit, Kansas, which manufactures tillage, seeding and specialty harvesting equipment.[16]
2004 brought about the purchase of the Valtra tractor company from the Kone Group, in Finland. Valtra has some licensing agreements with the Eicher company in India for tractor production, and also with the HEMA group in Turkey. The purchase of Valtra also included SISU POWER engines.[17][18]




Valtra T170 tractor, in 2008


2006 saw a re-focusing of the various brands, and the reduction of individual brands. AGCO announced plans to combine some, and make some only part of a larger brand, or co-branding. Examples include the Massey Ferguson 9635 Hesston self-propelled swather, and the AGCO 9365 Hesston self-propelled swather. Challenger has seen further expansion with the further consolidation of the AgChem brand into Challenger, and the introduction of Agritalia built tractors and an articulated Challenger tractor.
In 2007, AGCO bought 50% of Laverda S.p.A from ARGO SpA, which included the Gallagnani and Fella-Werke hay equipment brands.[19][20]
In 2008/2009 AGCO, the Challenger, Valtra, and Massey Ferguson large row crop tractors were launched in Europe and North America respectively with AGCO's e3 Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) emission reduction technology.[21]
Late in 2009, AGCO announced that it would phase out the orange AGCO Tractors by 2011.[22]
In late 2010, AGCO announced the plan to acquire the remaining 50% of Laverda, which included Fella-Werke as well. The acquisition was finalized in March 2011.[23][24][25]
In 2011, AGCO plans to transfer its high-horsepower wheeled-tractor assembly of tractors sold in North America from Beauvais, France to Jackson, Minnesota, where it will expand the plant by 75,000 square feet (7,000 m2).[26]
In 2011, AGCO said that it will invest $40 million in its Hesston plant by building a new 200,000-square-foot (19,000 m2) painting and finishing building. Construction began June 2011 and was completed in 2013.[27][28][29]
In October 2011, AGCO purchased GSI. It was based in Assumption, Illinois and manufactures grain storage and handling equipment as the GSI Group.[30]
In 2012. AGCO acquired 60% of Santal Equipamentos, a sugar cane planting and harvesting equipment. AGCO purchased 80% of Shandong Dafeng Machinery Co, a combine harvester manufacturer in China. AGCO formed the Algerian Tractors Company joint venture with the Algerian brand Etrag with 49% ownership.
In 2013, AGCO’s GSI acquired Johnson System, a manufacturer of catwalks and towers.
Other Brands[edit]

Sunflower Manufacturing is the tillage and seeding division of the AGCO Corporation, and manufactures all equipment used for tillage of land, including discs, cultivators and finishing tillage equipment, as well as seeding equipment for grains. [31]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
