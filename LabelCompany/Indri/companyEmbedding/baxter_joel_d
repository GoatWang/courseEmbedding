Anesthesia & Critical Care

Baxter is a leading manufacturer of products for general anesthesia. These include anesthetic gases, or inhaled anesthetics, and anesthesia-related critical care drugs. 
View Products


BioSurgery

Baxter's BioSurgery business unit offers a comprehensive line of biologics, devices and combination products.
View Products


Drug Delivery

Baxter is one of the world's leading manufacturers of commercially prepared IV solutions in flexible containers. Baxter also has a range of irrigation solutions and sets to suit a wide range of patient needs.
View Products


Infusion Systems

Large Volume Pumps (LVP) are used to deliver medication and solutions through various routes (e.g. Intravenous and epidural) for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. They are designed for more accurate fluid delivery than manually adjusted gravity infusions. 
View Products


Access

Baxter's comprehensive Access portfolio includes Pump Administration sets, Gravity Sets, and ONE-LINK Neutral Displacement Needleless Connector.  Baxter’s Access portfolio offers a variety of different components and configurations to meet a broad range of clinical applications.

Enteral & Oral Syringes


View Products


IV Preparation & Compounding

It takes spikes, syringes, and pumps to make an intravenous (IV) solution. A pharmacy workflow management system and automated compounding system can help streamline pharmacy operations. Though vastly different, these tools share a basic truth. Behind every IV dose there is a pharmacist and behind every pharmacist there is the means to not only make that dose, but also support pharmacy workflow. 
View Products


Parenteral Nutrition Solutions & Additives

One size does not fit all for nutrition therapy. Prescribing practices are as unique as patient populations, and pharmacies have varying levels of nutrition compounding capability and expertise.  Baxter's leading Parenteral Nutrition Portfolio offers pharmacy technology, premixes and a comprehensive selection of macro and micronutrients to support specific requirements.
