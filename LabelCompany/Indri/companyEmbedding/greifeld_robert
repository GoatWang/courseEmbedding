Robert Greifeld in 2012


Robert Greifeld (born 1957)[1] is an American businessman and is the chairman of Nasdaq, the largest electronic screen-based equity securities market in the United States. He served as CEO from 2003-2016 and was succeeded by Adena Friedman. Greifeld focused the NASDAQ-OMX mission on being the premier U.S equities market, leveraging NASDAQ-OMX's fundamental market structure advantage.
Early life[edit]
Greifeld was born in Queens, New York, to an Italian American mother and a father of Irish and German descent.[1]
Career[edit]
He has a 20-year history in technology, and as an entrepreneur created one of the first electronic stock order matching systems. He has led NASDAQ-OMX to nine straight quarters of top line growth. The year 2006 was NASDAQ-OMX's most successful since it began reporting financials in 1997; and in 2005, NASDAQ-OMX's stock was the number one performer across all markets.
Greifeld is an outspoken advocate for efficient capital markets, good regulation and ensuring that the U.S. markets continue to support business growth and innovation. He is a current member of the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation.
Prior to joining NASDAQ in May 2003, Greifeld was an Executive Vice-President with SunGard Data Systems, Inc., a $6.2 billion market cap company. Greifeld holds a master's degree in business from the New York University Stern School of Business, and a B.A. in English from Iona College.
Greifeld gave the commencement address at Iona College for the undergraduates of 2016 on May 21.[2]
Early in Greifeld's career in the 1980s,he was a District Manager for Unisys in Jericho, NY. From there he joined Automated Securities Clearance, Inc. and then Sunguard.
Greifeld has resided with his wife and family in Westfield, New Jersey[3] and Readington Township, New Jersey.[4][5][6][7][8]

Jeff Patterson  |  Executive Moves (Executives) |  Thursday, 15/06/2017|15:42 GMT  Photo: Bob Greifeld, CEO, Nasdaq
BloombergShare this articleVirtu Financial Inc., the group responsible for acquiring KCG Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:KCG) in a landmark deal earlier this year in April, has added a household name to its board of directors with the appointment of former Nasdaq CEO Robert Greifeld. He will be stepping into the new senior role following the completion of Virtu Financial’s $1.4 billion takeover of rival KCG.The London Summit 2017 is coming, get involved!Mr. Greifeld stepped down as CEO of Nasdaq earlier this year – Adena Friedman, who now leads the exchange operator, has since succeeded him. Mr. Greifeld served as the CEO of Nasdaq since 2003, radically transforming the group into the more diversified entity that it is now with an active market presence in the US and Europe.New DirectionPer the appointment, Mr. Greifeld will be taking over from Virtu Financial’s founder, Vincent Viola, as Chairman of its board. A transition has been in the works since May 2017, with Viola opting to hand over responsibilities to one of the industry’s foremost experts and veterans.BloombergThe addition of Mr. Greifeld represents a huge asset for the group, who will benefit from the vast wealth of knowledge garnered during his time as the leader of one of the largest exchanges in the world by market capitalization. Mr. Greifeld’s two-decade long tenure at Nasdaq speaks for itself, having developed one of the industry’s first electronic stock order matching systems.Moreover, he led Nasdaq OMX to an unprecedented level of growth spanning over nine consecutive quarters, including its most successful period since it began reporting its financials in 1997. He also is one of the industry’s leading outspoken advocates for efficient capital markets, improved regulation, and market transparency in the US, also pushing for sustained business growth and innovation – he currently serves as a member of the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation.Mr. Viola’s position as Chairman had been in a state of flux since being nominated and floated by President Donald Trump as be Secretary of the Army, a position he has since withdrawn from. The appointment is pending the completion of Virtu Financial’s acquisition, which has already been approved by the board of directors of each company. Virtu Financial had agreed to acquire KCG in a cash transaction valued at $20.00 per KCG share, or a total of approximately $1.4 billion, in a bid to expand its growing execution business.Share this article Tags: moves / nasdaq / Virtu Financial Got a news tip?

Robert Greifeld (born 1957)[1] is an American businessman and is the chairman of Nasdaq, the largest electronic screen-based equity securities market in the United States. He served as CEO from 2003-2016 and was succeeded by Adena Friedman. Greifeld focused the NASDAQ-OMX mission on being the premier U.S equities market, leveraging NASDAQ-OMX's fundamental market structure advantage.

He has a 20-year history in technology, and as an entrepreneur created one of the first electronic stock order matching systems. He has led NASDAQ-OMX to nine straight quarters of top line growth. The year 2006 was NASDAQ-OMX's most successful since it began reporting financials in 1997; and in 2005, NASDAQ-OMX's stock was the number one performer across all markets.
Greifeld is an outspoken advocate for efficient capital markets, good regulation and ensuring that the U.S. markets continue to support business growth and innovation. He is a current member of the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation.
Prior to joining NASDAQ in May 2003, Greifeld was an Executive Vice-President with SunGard Data Systems, Inc., a $6.2 billion market cap company. Greifeld holds a master's degree in business from the New York University Stern School of Business, and a B.A. in English from Iona College.
Greifeld gave the commencement address at Iona College for the undergraduates of 2016 on May 21.[2]
Early in Greifeld's career in the 1980s,he was a District Manager for Unisys in Jericho, NY. From there he joined Automated Securities Clearance, Inc. and then Sunguard.
Greifeld has resided with his wife and family in Westfield, New Jersey[3] and Readington Township, New Jersey.[4][5][6][7][8]

Retour d'exp�rience Humanis : Quand un intranet collaboratif contribue � la consolidation du Groupe

T�l�charger



Pas de chance pour Facebook. Son introduction en bourse, m�diatis�e depuis des semaines, ne s'est pas d�roul�e dans les meilleures conditions. Le syst�me informatique du Nasdaq a rencontr� divers soucis techniques qui ont perturb� l'ouverture et la journ�e de cotation. Le titre n'avait pris que 0,27 dollars � la fin de la s�ance. Cr�dit photo : � Copyright 2012, The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.

Robert Greifeld, CEO du march� Nasdaq OMX Group, a reconnu qu'il y avait eu des probl�mes techniques lors de la cotation du titre de Facebook vendredi dernier, jour de l'entr�e en bourse de la soci�t� cr��e par Mark Zuckerberg. Un moment dont il �tait pourtant question depuis plusieurs mois. Les difficult�s rencontr�es, principalement centr�es sur les ordres d'annulation, ont embarrass� le Nasdaq qui ne s'est, par cons�quent, pas montr� sous son meilleur jour, ainsi que l'a confi� son CEO au Wall Street Journal.   La cotation des actions de Facebook devait d�buter � 11 heures (c�te Est des Etats-Unis), mais elle a �t� diff�r�e d'environ 30 minutes. D'autres disfonctionnements ont �maill� la journ�e ce qui a suscit� une certaine confusion parmi les investisseurs, selon ce qui a �t� rapport� dans la presse.   Une premi�re journ�e d�cevante  Le comit� ex�cutif du Nasdaq s'est r�uni samedi pour aviser de la conduite � tenir et pr�voit de revoir sa proc�dure de mise sur le march� � la lumi�re des probl�mes rencontr�s vendredi, a indiqu� Robert Greifeld au WSJ. Toutefois, ces soucis techniques n'ont pas eu d'impact sur la performance des actions de Facebook, selon le CEO du Nasdaq OMX Group, rapport� cette fois par le New York Times. Le premier jour de cotation de Facebook a �t� largement consid�r� comme d�cevant parce que ses actions n'avaient pris que 0,27 dollar � la cl�ture, � 38,27 dollars.
Pour expliquer le retard subi lors de l'introduction du titre Facebook, Robert Greifeld a mis en cause la faiblesse de conception du logiciel utilis� pour g�rer la mise aux ench�res de l'IPO (initial public offering). Les syst�mes charg�s de fixer un prix d'ouverture ont croul� sous le flot des annulations d'ordre et des mises � jour, selon Businessweek. �Ce dimanche, ni Facebook ni le Nasdaq n'�taient disponibles pour fournir des d�tails sur le sujet. Robert Greifeld, CEO du Nasdaq OMX Group (Cr�dit :�� Copyright 2012, The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.) Vendredi, l'agence de presse financi�re Bloomberg a indiqu� que la SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), le gendarme am�ricain de la bourse, pr�voyait de se pencher sur les probl�mes ayant touch� la mise en vente des actions de Facebook sur le Nasdaq.

Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
