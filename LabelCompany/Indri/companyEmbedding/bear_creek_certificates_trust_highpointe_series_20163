Introducing the NEW BORON III X. We have improved the greatest all-around rod series ever made. For 2016, we have upgraded the Boron III X rods incorporating our new friction-free ‘Shooting Guides” to take the world’s best performing fly rods and make them even better. These rods now shoot line effortlessly, allowing you to generate even more line speed without compromising the smooth feel of the rod. Featuring advanced Boron III materials and technology, these incredibly lightweight, powerful, fast action rods have an even broader casting range – the widest casting range of any series we make. The added energy of Boron allows the angler to effortlessly control the line speed by speeding up or slowing down the casting stroke while maintaining pinpoint accuracy. This makes them ideal all-around rods for the vast majority of situations an angler may encounter, whether it’s making highly accurate, long distance casts or delicate, precise presentations up clos

The reason I'm willing to pay more, is because Digicert service is excellent.  It ends up costing me less in the long run, because they help answer everything.  Before, using GeoTrust it was taking days to get a cert installed.  We got so frustrated , we switched to Digicert, and were up and running in 1 hour.  Now, they helped us transfer our cert from one domain, to another at no additional cost.  I'm now a loyal customer.  Enough with wasting time on other sites.     Helpful?
