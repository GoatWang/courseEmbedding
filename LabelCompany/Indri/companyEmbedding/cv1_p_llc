Product Overview





			            The CV1 ridge vent is a patented single piece screened foam closure that allows hot air to circulate from the inside of your building out through the ridge cap, keeping your metal building ventilated and free of damaging condensation. Even small amounts of condensation can substantially reduce the "R" value of the insulation, creating faster heat loss into the attic space and eventually leading to mold, mildew, rot, ice damming and loss of energy efficiency. CV1 is an affordable, easy to install, self-cleaning, totally concealed option to safely vent the hot air from your metal building. It provides a continuous line of ventilation down the entire ridge line. When used in conjunction with intake or soffit vents, air moves outward through the screened closure, allowing fresh air to flow while blocking debris. It is die cut to perfectly fit the Classic Rib panel profile and is a safe and affordable ventilation choice for higher pitched roofs.
			        

Extends the life of your building by eliminating condensation
Made with the highest quality foam available
Intended for a roof pitch of 6/12 and higher, it is recommended to use the CV3 vent for a roof pitch of 5/12 and lower
Installed without cutting or altering the roof structure
Made with fiberglass screen, making it a mold and mildew free, permanent solution to your ventilation needs while providing over 7 sq. in. of airflow per linear feet of ridge
Naturally increase the energy efficiency of your building by allowing hot air to escape
Completely assembled and includes an adhesive for easy installation
No maintenance required, CV1's screened windows work the same way the windows on your home work

Cheap!! Screens come apart when moved ever slightly! A little early to tell but my bet is they wont last long! Will see!

It's a shame because this could have been made better with little impact to the unit cost!

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
