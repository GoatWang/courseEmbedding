Director since January 2015
Age 64
Mr. Bracken is the former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of HCA, Inc. and HCA Holdings, Inc. (collectively, “HCA”), one of the nation’s leading providers of health care services. At the time of Mr. Bracken’s retirement, HCA’s facilities included approximately 165 hospitals and 115 freestanding surgery centers in 20 states and England. Mr. Bracken served in a number of executive roles in his 33 year career at HCA, including President of HCA’s Pacific Division in 1995, Western Group President in 1997, Chief Operating Officer of HCA in July 2001, and President and Chief Operating Officer in January 2002. He was elected to the HCA Board of Directors in November 2002, became President and Chief Executive Officer in January 2009, and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in December, 2009. He retired as CEO in December 2013, and as Chairman in December 2014.
Mr. Bracken’s experience in leading a large, publicly traded health care company lends expertise and perspective greatly valued by the Board. In addition, his experience operating in the highly-regulated health care industry with significant experience in enterprise clinical quality is also greatly valued by the Board. In fact, that experience led the Board to appoint Mr. Bracken as Chair of the Patient Safety and Clinical Quality Committee.
