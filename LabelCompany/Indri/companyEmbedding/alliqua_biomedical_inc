Alliqua BioMedical, Inc. to Acquire Celleration, Inc.

Expands Proprietary Product Portfolio and Salesforce in the Advanced Wound Care Market
LANGHORNE, Pa., Feb. 2, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alliqua BioMedical, Inc. (Nasdaq:ALQA) ("Alliqua" or "the Company"), a provider of advanced wound care products, today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Celleration, Inc. ("Celleration") for an initial purchase price of approximately $30.4 million, which is comprised of both cash and stock. The merger agreement provides for additional contingent payments in stock and cash, under certain circumstances, if stated revenue thresholds are reached over the next two years ending December 31, 2016 or if certain milestones are satisfied in connection with product sales in the U.K.

 Celleration is a privately held medical device company, based in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, which is focused on developing and commercializing the MIST Therapy® therapeutic ultrasound platform for the treatment of acute and chronic wounds. Celleration's MIST Therapy System is an FDA 510(k) cleared device that uses painless, noncontact low-frequency ultrasound to stimulate cells below the wound bed in order to promote the healing process. Celleration generated total revenue of approximately $8.7 million during its fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. Since Celleration's MIST Therapy System was commercialized in 2005, MIST therapy has been performed more than 1.2 million times on over 85,000 patients in the U.S. and the U.K.

 Celleration's MIST Therapy System is supported by extensive clinical study data which has been produced in the past several years showing that MIST Therapy positively impacts critical aspects of the wound healing process. Most recently, in a prospective, randomized controlled trial conducted in 22 U.S. outpatient healthcare facilities and published in the January 2015 edition of Ostomy & Wound Management(1), MIST therapy demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the healing rate over the standard of care treatment for venous leg ulcers. It is with this body of clinical data that the Mist Therapy was given a new reimbursement payment for outpatient services that became effective January 1, 2015, and we believe now more effectively reflects both the clinical efficacy and the economic benefits of the technology.

 "Celleration's innovative MIST therapy technology is positioned perfectly within Alliqua's business model," said David Johnson, Chief Executive Officer of Alliqua. "MIST therapy is a differentiated wound care treatment which is supported by a breadth of data that demonstrates its clinical efficacy and strong economic value proposition. Celleration's therapeutic devices, MIST and UltraMIST™, are FDA 510(k) cleared, receive favorable reimbursement and carry a high-margin profile.

 "Likewise, Celleration's focus on developing novel approaches for the treatment of wounds aligns exceptionally well with our vision of building a suite of advanced wound care solutions," continued David Johnson. "In addition to the differentiated product offering, we were attracted to Celleration's leadership role in advancing the science and practice of wound healing in working with medical professionals and providers, which, we believe, has helped the Company earn the favorable reimbursement decision in recent months. Further, this transaction will nearly double our sales force and we look forward to incremental improvements in sales force productivity as we begin marketing the combined company's suite of proprietary products. Finally, we are very pleased to welcome Mark Wagner, Celleration's President and CEO, who will be joining our Board of Directors upon the closing of the transaction."

 "This transaction presents an exciting opportunity for the two companies and their employees, who will be able to market a broader portfolio of treatments to a combined customer base and a common call point," commented Mark Wagner, Celleration's President and CEO. "With an impressive product portfolio and sales infrastructure, the combined company will be well-positioned to capitalize on the large and rapidly growing market for advanced wound care treatments. Both companies believe strongly in Evidence Based Medicine and delivering products that accelerate healing and minimize retreatment rates which, most importantly, benefits patients, payers and providers."

 Cowen and Company, LLC served as the Alliqua's exclusive financial advisor in connection with this transaction.

Financing 

 Alliqua has entered into a commitment letter for a Senior Secured Term Loan with Perceptive Advisors in the principal amount of $15.5 million in order to finance the initial cash purchase price.

 Further details of the acquisition and commitment letter can be found in Alliqua's Form 8-K that will be filed with the SEC.

Terms and Approvals 

 The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2015 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including Alliqua shareholder approval.

Conference Call Alliqua will host a conference call for analysts and investors tomorrow Tuesday, February 3, 2015 beginning at 8:00 a.m. ET to discuss the Celleration transaction. Individuals interested in listening to the conference call may dial 888-337-8198 for domestic callers or 719-325-2469 for international callers and provide access code 2955591. A replay of the call will be available for 14 days and can be accessed by dialing 888-203-1112 for domestic callers or 719-457-0820 for international callers.

 The conference call will also be available via a webcast on the "Investors Relations" section of the Company's Web site at: http://ir.alliqua.com/.

					Full Description



Alliqua BioMedical, Inc., incorporated on April 15, 2014, is a provider of wound care solutions. The Company operates in commercial wound care segment, which consists of approximately five product categories, such as Wound Bed Preparation & Stimulation; Human Biologics; Antimicrobial Protection; Exudate Management, and Contract Manufacturing. The Company has a suite of wound care solutions that enable surgeons, clinicians and wound care practitioners to address the challenges in chronic and acute wounds. The Company has built its portfolio through its hydrogel technology platform, targeted acquisitions, and through licensing and distribution agreements. Its contract manufacturing business provides custom hydrogels to the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) market.Wound Bed Preparation & StimulationThe Company, through Celleration, Inc. (Celleration), is focused on developing and commercializing the MIST Therapy (MIST Therapy) therapeutic ultrasound platform for the treatment of acute and chronic wounds. MIST Therapy is a noncontact, low-frequency ultrasound delivered through a saline mist to the wound bed. The MIST Therapy System and UltraMIST (UltraMIST) consist of a small countertop generator and handheld transducer. Attached to the transducer is a single-use disposable applicator, which includes an inlet for sterile saline. As the device is activated, the saline is introduced to the head of the transducer where it is atomized. This saline mist is the medium through which the ultrasonic energy is transmitted to the wound site inducing a non-painful, cool sensation to the patient. The disposable applicator is designed for a single use only in order to avoid infection from patient to patient.Human BiologicsThe Company, through Celgene Cellular Therapeutics (CCT), licenses placental-based products, including the wound care products Extracellular Matrix (ECM), a suite of wound management products made from extracellular matrix derived from the human placenta, and Biovance, a decellularized and dehydrated allograft produced from human amniotic membrane for the management of non-infected partial and full-thickness wounds. Biovance is intended for application to open traumatic wounds; complex wounds, such as burns, open surgical wounds and Mohs procedure (microscopically controlled surgery for skin cancer), and chronic wounds, such as diabetic, venous, arterial, pressure and other ulcers.Antimicrobial ProtectionThe Company markets approximately two products, including SilverSeal, a hydrogel wound dressing with silver coated fibers, and Hydress, an over-the-counter hydrogel wound dressing. Both types of dressing are used to provide and maintain a moist wound environment. SilverSeal dressings also provide an antimicrobial barrier. The Company, through Choice Therapeutics, Inc. (Choice), provides wound care products using TheraBond 3D Antimicrobial Barrier Systems (TheraBond). The TheraBond product line includes contact dressings, island dressings and wraps. Based on its manufacturing process, silver is bonded to the entire surface of the nylon fibers of the TheraBond dressing. When the TheraBond products are placed on the wound, bioactive ionic silver is released at a controlled rate.Exudate ManagementThe Company, through Sorbion GmbH & Co KG (Sorbion), distributes sorbion sachet S, sorbion sana and products with hydrokinetic fibers as primary dressings in the United States, Canada and Latin America. Intended for wound bed preparation (an approach to remove barriers to healing and stimulating the healing process), sorbion sachet S is indicated as a primary dressing for moderately to exudating wounds, such as some surgical wounds, venous leg ulcers and diabetic ulcers. It assists in the removal of slough (dead skin tissue) and toxins, and locks bacteria into the dressing. Sorbion sachet S's hydration response technology combines mechanically modified cellulose fibers with gelling agents and the close interaction of the two components allows for active regulation of the wound climate. Sorbion sana is indicated as a primary wound dressing and provides another form of wound treatment. It maintains a wound climate, which supports healing, supports granulation (the formation of a new connective tissue and tiny blood vessels on the surface of a wound) by protecting tissue, and offers a reduction in pain during dressing changes. Sorbion sana consists of an absorbent core with hydration response technology and a three-dimensional outer cover made of polyethylene. Selected materials and an optimized manufacturing process allow the avoidance of glues and adhesives, making the sorbion sana dressings less likely to cause an allergic reaction.Contract ManufacturingThe Company, in connection with its contract manufacturing business, develops, manufactures and markets high water content, electron beam cross-linked, aqueous polymer hydrogels, or gels, used for wound care, medical diagnostics, transdermal drug delivery and cosmetics. The Company specializes in custom gels by capitalizing on manufacturing technologies. Its products are manufactured using proprietary and non-proprietary mixing, coating and cross-linking technologies. Together, these technologies enable the Company to produce gels for tolerance specifications with respect to a range of physical characteristics, such as thickness, water content, adherence, absorption, moisture vapor transmission rate and release rate.The Company competes with Smith & Nephew, ConvaTec, Acelity, MiMedx Group, LLC, Osiris, Organogenesis, Derma Sciences, Medline, Stead Med and Osnovative Systems.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

TENS Units from LGMedSupply
LGMedSupply has a large selection of portable TENS units for pain relief. Whether you�re looking for pain relief from back pain or in other areas of your body, you will find that we offer the best TENS machines and warranties. TENS units are often used as a non-invasive way of electric stimulation for pain relief. A substantial amount of pain relief can be achieved by using a TENS unit properly as the electrode pads cause electric stimulation that travels along nerve fibers, thus creating a pain relieving sensation.
EMS Units from LGMedSupply
We also carry many EMS units. An EMS unit, also known as an electrical muscle stimulator, electronic muscle stimulator, electric muscle stimulator or electro muscle stimulator, can be used as a therapy tool for patients, a strength training tool for athletes and healthy individuals, and even as a testing tool for the evaluation of neural and muscular function.
Electrical muscle stimulation is the use of electric impulses to cause muscle contraction. EMS units provide electrical current that passes through the muscle and causes the muscle to contract. Electrical impulses generated by the EMS machine are delivered through electrodes placed on the skin next to the muscles that need electronic muscle stimulation.  Electrical muscle stimulation can also accelerate the muscle learning process by providing its users with repeated contractions.
A Large Selection of TENS EMS Combo Units
TENS units and EMS units work the same way. An EMS unit will stimulate muscles, whereas a TENS unit will stimulate nerve endings. Many pain sufferers use a combination of both TENS and EMS to provide a maximum amount of relief and muscle stimulation. We carry a large selection of portable Combo TENS / EMS units to combine the benefits of nerve ending stimulation and electronic muscle stimulation.
Portable Ultrasound Machines for the Home from LGMedSupply
We also carry a large selection of portable ultrasonic machines for use at home. These home ultrasound machines stimulate tissue beneath the skin surface by using very high frequency sound waves. Home ultrasound machines can make the healing process much faster by increasing blood flow. They can also diminish the amount of pain due to a decrease in swelling and edema. Portable ultrasound machines provides the user a gentle massage of tendons and/or ligaments without adding any stress, all while softening scar tissue.
Having a portable ultrasound machine at home offers long-term pain relief, cost savings, portable therapy, and can reduce healing time and chronic inflammation.


Google Trusted Store Customer RatingsHave brought many items for LG Medical since 2012 and never had an issue. Service is always great and the products are excellent quality for a great price. If you have a question and call they are knowledgeable about their products plus the LG web site has many videos and tip. I will continue to buy from LG Medical as I feel the are one of the best in their field. DMD- Written on June 17, 2016 READ MORE REVIEWSA family member ordered from LGMedSupply in the past and had great service, and that is why I felt safe ordering from them. And they didn't let me down. I got exactly what I ordered and it got to me when it was supposed to so that is why I gave them the top rating.- Written on July 19, 2016 READ MORE REVIEWSGreat product, Great Shipping, Great Customer service. AAA+++- Written on July 17, 2016 READ MORE REVIEWS I was very happy with the service that I got from the staff at LG Med Supply. I looked all over the net for over a year to see who was the main Co. that had not only what I needed but who was the Co. that seemed to be the main Manufacturer of the Tens Unit. Then I started checking who had all of the Conductive Designed Pads That my Dr. wanted me to have and here again LG Med Supply had all of the items and were offering the best prices on all of the items that I needed. LG Med Supply was hands down the best in all of the categories as far as who had all of the items that I needed from the Back Belt Strap/Neck electrode/Shoulder and Knee Conductive Designed Pads that my Dr. wanted me to start therapy with. LG Med Supply is the only web site that had a vast selection of different shaped Electrodes which deliver a totally different stimulation that really gives you a completely different feeling then a straight square pad electrode. Thank You LG Med Supply for being there in my time of need.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
