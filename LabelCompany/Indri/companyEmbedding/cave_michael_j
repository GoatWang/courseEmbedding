 Esterline Corporation (NYSE:ESL) (www.esterline.com), a leading specialty manufacturer serving the global aerospace and defense markets, today announced the appointment of Michael J. Cave, former Senior Vice President of The Boeing Company, to the company’s board of directors effective November 23, 2015.  

Cave was appointed to the class of directors whose term will expire at the 2017 annual meeting. He will be nominated for election by the shareholders at the company’s 2016 annual meeting of shareholders for the initial one-year term. With the addition, Esterline’s Board now consists of nine directors. Eight of the directors meet New York Stock Exchange standards for independence; the ninth director is Curtis Reusser, who is Esterline’s Chairman, President & CEO.

Reusser said he was pleased to welcome Cave to the board, saying, "We have an experienced, well-rounded board of directors and Mike will continue that tradition for us with his extensive skills and experience in financial services, strategic planning, operations management and business development through senior leadership roles at The Boeing Company. His insights into various aerospace products produced by original equipment manufacturers and experience in mergers and acquisitions will be particularly valuable in guiding Esterline on strategic matters."

A Form 8-K has been filed by Esterline today with the Securities and Exchange Commission to announce the appointment.

Michael J. Cave

Senior Vice President 
Business Development and Strategy 
The Boeing Company 
BSE '82

For his financial and managerial leadership in the commercial aircraft industry

As a child growing up in Virginia, Michael J. Cave was a sports fanatic. He loved basketball; maybe the result of having a father from Indiana. He learned from charismatic coaches who took their squads to state championships and rallied their teams week after week. Now, as a vice president for The Boeing Company, Cave is using that insight to lead the aviation industry.

Cave came to Purdue from the East Coast to prepare for a career in a high tech or defense business. He spent his first two years in the Krannert School, but knew success would come through the marriage of business and engineeringor what he calls "the two languages of business" he found this in the interdisciplinary engineering program.

"The program provided a very good blend of skills in understanding how things work, how they can be efficiently manufactured, why they will cost what they will, and how to market and distribute them profitably," Cave says.

Since leaving Purdue, Cave has spent the last two decades in the aviation industry; first with McDonnell Douglas, where his appointments included heading the team that merged commercial airplane units of The Boeing Company and McDonnell Douglas. In 2000, he was named vice president and chief financial officer for Boeing Commercial Airplanes and faced perhaps the greatest challenge of his careerthe turnaround of Boeing Commercial Airplanes in the aftermath of September 11, 2001.

Boeing was in trouble. The company had not launched a new airplane in a decade, was challenged by Airbus, and was said to be no longer competitive in the commercial airplane business. In 2001, the industry's customer base faced the worst downturn in its history. But Cave and his team at Boeing prevailed.

"In the past few years we have regained our leadership in innovation, profitability and sales, and we have secured the United States' leadership in this great industry for a long time to come," Cave says. "It may be one of the great industrial turn-arounds of all time." 

Cave likens the development of commercial air travel to that of the Internet in terms of connecting the world and nurturing global economic growth.  

"If we are to continue to provide that impact we need to be able to grow the world's air transportation system rapidly, safely and efficiently, while continuing to minimize our environmental footprint," he says.

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

About Michael J. Harner

                            The pioneering work of MICHAEL HARNER, PhD, brought shamanism to the West. In 1979, he and his wife, Sandra Harner, created the Center for Shamanic Studies, which later became the Foundation for Shamanic Studies, the world's foremost shamanic training organization. In 1987, he left academia to devote himself full-time to shamanism. His classic books on the subject have been translated into many languages.show more

Review Text

                            Praise for Michael Harner and The Way of the Shaman 

"What Yogananda did for Hinduism and D. T. Suzuki did for Zen, Michael Harner has done for shamanism-namely, bring the tradition and its richness to Western awareness."
-from Higher Wisdom, by Roger Walsh and Charles S. Grob

"Wonderful, fascinating.... Harner really knows what he's talking about."
-Carlos Castaneda, best-selling author of The Teachings of Don Juan and The Active Side of Infinity

"An intimate and practical guide to the art of shamanic healing and the technology of the sacred. Michael Harner is not just an anthropologist who has studied shamanism; he is an authentic white shaman."
-Stanislav Grof, author of The Adventure of Self-Discovery

"Harner has impeccable credentials, both as an academic and as a practicing shaman. Without doubt (since the recent death of Mircea Eliade) the world's leading authority on shamanism."
-Nevill Drury, author of The Elements of Shamanism

"Michael Harner is a great shaman. He also proves that a person can be both a scientist and a shaman."
-Bo Bair Rinchinov, Siberian Buryat shaman

"Michael Harner is the world's best-known expert on shamanism."
- Parabola magazine

"Without doubt essential reading and destined to be a classic on the subject-just as much as his ground breaking Way of the Shaman, written all those years ago."
- Sacred Hoop magazine

"A contemporary classic of shamanic studies."
-Nefer Khepri, Magickal Musings

" Cave and Cosmos demonstrates with many examples of shamanic journeys from [Harner's] students that spirits really do exist and they want us to know that they exist."
-Riverdrum.com

" Cave and Cosmos is likely the most important modern work on the perservation of shamanism and our renunion with humanity's original spiritual heritage."
-Marc Star, New Dawn magazine
