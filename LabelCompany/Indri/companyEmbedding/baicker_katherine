Will the Real Professor Katherine Baicker Please Stand Up?

By AL LEWIS and VIK KHANNA 
Harvard Professor Katherine Baicker is arguably most acclaimed health policy researcher at arguably the most acclaimed (and not even arguably, the best-endowed) school of public health in the country. Her seminal account of the effect of Medicaid coverage on utilization and health status is a classic. As luck would have it, in 2008 Oregon used a lottery to ration available Medicaid slots. A lottery controls for motivation and as such eliminates participant-non-participant bias, since everyone who enters the lottery wants to participate. That meant only one major variable was in play, which was enrollment in Medicaid or not.
Chance favors the well-prepared, and Professor Baicker jumped on this research windfall. She found that providing Medicaid–and thereby facilitating access to basic preventive medical care–for the previously uninsured did not improve physical health status, but did increase diagnoses and utilization. Because of the soundness of the methodology, the conclusion were unassailable – more access to medical care does not improve outcomes or optimize utilization, which is a proxy for spending. (We ourselves reached a similar conclusion based on a similar analysis on North Carolina Medicaid’s medical home model.)
Yet Professor Baicker herself used exactly the opposite methodology to reach the exact opposite conclusion for workplace wellness.  And that’s where the identity crisis begins.
She and two colleagues published a meta-analysis in 2010 of participant-vs-non-participant workplace wellness programs. Somehow—despite her affinity for Oregon’s lottery control—she found this opposite methodology to be acceptable.  She concluded that workplace wellness generated a very specific two significant-digit 3.27-to-1 ROI from health care claims reduction alone, with another 2.37-to-1 from absenteeism reduction. The title of the article–now celebrating its fifth anniversary as the only work by a well-credentialed author in a prestigious journal ever published in support of wellness ROI—was equally unambiguous:  Workplace Wellness Can Generate Savings.

This article wasn’t just an academic exercise. It gave the Obama administration academic cover for what has proven to be the most unpopular, dishonest, and even hazardous component of the Affordable Care Act:  allowing employers to financially and clinically punish employees with coercive directives to lose weight, get unnecessary checkups, and answer intrusive, distasteful, and counterproductive questions about (for example) checking their testicles.
Professor Baicker did not question her too-good-to-be-true conclusion. Yet the Law of Diminishing Returns clearly contradicts her finding. Compelling privately insured people to get more healthcare is very unlikely to improve health status and reduce healthcare expense if provision of basic insurance to a medically needy population doesn’t noticeably improve health status while increasing healthcare expense.
Instead, she reveled in the limelight, receiving 307 citations, vs. 18 and 9 for two other Health Affairs articles on wellness that didn’t support more spending on vendors and consultants. (Even 307 citations aren’t enough to satisfy one of the leaders of the wellness movement, Larry Chapman, who says this study should be cited much more frequently since it’s basically the one that supports the entire industry.) However, at some point in 2013, overwhelming evidence totally invalidated her findings. At that point – like Dee Edington and Al Lewis, both of whom had previously reversed positions when the data didn’t support their previous positions—she could have acknowledged that her initial findings had been wrong and moved on.
Instead, she neither defended her position nor clearly refuted it, choosing instead a yin and yang middle ground that shifted with every interview. The metamorphosis from Queen of Significant Digits into the Queen of Significant Doubt started in July 2013, when she announced on NPR’s Marketplace that “it’s too early to tell” if wellness saves money, and that employers need to “experiment” with these programs to “see what happens to participants’ weight and blood pressure.” Right there, she invalidated herself. First, by then she certainly knew that a participants-vs-non-participants methodology was invalid since the key “smoking gun” slide in our Health Affairs posting was already widely circulated and her own opposing Oregon methodology was being widely praised. Second, even if she is right, the financial payoff for the modest “weight and blood pressure” improvements that the best programs might generate is 10-20 years in the future — and even then only if the improvements are sustained.
But then came another personality change.
In February 2014, she blamed readers for focusing on her attention-grabbing headline, the certainty of her two significant digits, and the gist of the conclusion…while ignoring the fine print, such as a caution about publication bias. Publication bias? You think? Start with the standard publication bias that negative articles rarely get published because they don’t get cited and hence reduce the all-important “impact factor” – recall the difference in Health Affairs citations in her own wellness article vs. the others.
Add to that a publication bias specific to those journals:  most of the articles comprising her meta-analysis were published in third-tier journals. Among them, these journals have exactly once published an article critical of wellness (twice if you include a book review by the esteemed Norton Hadler, whom a third-tier journal is thrilled to publish regardless of what he says, and three times if you include publication of an article by a graduate student at the University of Tasmania that accidentally undercut the true believers’ own storyline, that they are now having to explain away).
Weeks later, a totally different personality emerged:  she told the editor of Insurance Thought Leadership that she no longer focused on wellness and consequently has no opinions to share.  Leaving aside the irony that the wellness true believers continue to cite as gospel someone who says she has no interest in what they are citing her for, this spin further invalidates her next comment, delivered in December 2014 – when suddenly, as a result of yet another personality change, she has opines again. She told All Things Considered: “It could be that when the full set of evidence comes in, [wellness] will have huge returns on investment.”
Oops. First, she has just admitted she doesn’t follow wellness, so why speculate on future studies she has no knowledge of in a field she’s not involved in? Second, there is a rule of thumb in epidemiology:  the bigger the impact, the smaller the sample size needed to discern it. An example would be smoking and lung cancer, a previously very rare disease whose cause was discernable from a handful of cases. A sample of only hundreds of veterans was needed to prove that very high blood pressure causes strokes, and studies of exercise almost always show either a physical or emotional benefit, even in small groups of people with significant disease. On the other hand, there have been probably close to a half-billion employee-years of wellness with nothing to show for themselves except results going the other way and a bunch of self-invalidating vendor lies.
So we are going to make a radical proposal to the true believers:  you can continue to cite Katherine Baicker but must also note that she herself no longer supports the study you are citing — until and unless she says she does. In exchange for this disclosure, when do you cite her, we will acknowledge that you are telling the truth for a change.
Al Lewis and Vik Khanna are co-authors of Surviving Workplace Wellness with Your Dignity, Finances, and Major Organs Intact. Their website, They Said What, regales readers with stories of wellness innumeracy and deception.

GuestSoeren MattkeJan 4, 2015Gentlemen
Great post. Like you, I am disappointed that researchers of the caliber of Kate Baicker and David Cutler do not respond to the mounting debate about their paper. They should defend or disown their work rather than hope that the debate goes away. 
In my mind, their paper is a product typical of high-end academic research. Two brilliant professors spot a gap in the evidence on a hot policy topic and decide to go after it. But the actual work gets done by a graduate student in his cubicle without windows or guidance, and then hastily published. 
Then the problem arises that the paper becomes hugely influential and people start having a closer look. For our paper on the PepsiCo program, we reviewed in detail the seven publications that Baicker and colleagues called “high quality evidence”. We found that five of those analyzed programs that operated over 20 years ago and most of them had severe methodologic flaws. (John P. Caloyeras, Hangsheng Liu, Ellen Exum, Megan Broderick and Soeren Mattke. Managing Manifest Diseases, But Not Health Risks, Saved PepsiCo Money Over Seven Years. Health Affairs, 33, no.1 (2014):124-131)
Unfortunately, many defenders of the industry continue to take the Baicker paper at face value, while closely scrutinizing or ignoring more nuanced and scientifically sound findings. 
So I herewith support your motion!

GuestAl LewisJan 2, 2015So many targets, so few electrons on the internet… Thanks for the headsup– We’ll take a looksee at Mr. Robbins but we just need to get current business taken care of. And Mr. Robbins may be bogus science, but invalidating bogus science requires actual talent, whereas invalidating most vendor statements requires only knowledge of fifth grade math, which most of the industry seems to have been absent for.
This posting is not that situation. in this case, it’s just a question of a very talented and accomplished researcher perhaps assuming that wellness vendors did understand basic arithmetic, and not realizing that most of wellness is so ridiculously bogus that you can’t assume that peer-reviewing things in wellness promotional journals means anything, as she could have safely assumed in a legitimate corner of health services research. So doing a meta-analysis of bogus papers just gives a very bogus number. 
Still, I don’t know why she didn’t cut-and-run a long time ago, like I did, when I realized my own advocacy of this activity was sorely misguided. 
This posting was more so that all Professor Baicker’s comments are in one place. That way when the wellness ignorati cite her (again), and we have already drawn their attention to this posting, which we have, we can point out that they know they are misrepresenting the situation. To date, we have only been able to speculate that they are misrepresenting the situation, since all of her recantations were in different venues.

GuestcivisisusJan 2, 2015I find Lewis & Khanna’s wellness gotcha games as amusing as anyone else does – still, god help me – but I’m starting to wonder where it’s all going. 
Wow, wellness is not physics, and there are people who will enthusiastically over-promote the value of its grab-bag of concepts & tactics – who, without Al & Vic’s help, would have guessed? :eyeroll:
If you want to take on big-time smoke/mirrors purveyors, guys, at leastr train your sites on bigger targets – I hear Tony Robbins has dipped a toe into the wellness/health care pool…

GuestAl LewisJan 2, 2015Steve, thanks for your thoughts. Someone is clearly listening to these researchers and other wellness ignorati (the “Wellness ignorati” are people whose business depends on making sure facts are ignored)– wellness programs are ubitquitous, discussed at the White House, and a major agenda item for the Business Roundtable, for reasons that elude me since presumably they do have an internet connection. 
By the way, one other comment was tweeted but not posted. We were attacked for this “personal attack.” The irony is that the person who attacked us didn’t do it publicly, perhaps having learned the fate of attackers from ShapeUp (Dr. Kumar, how’d that work out for ya? http://theysaidwhat.net/2014/07/23/shapeup001/ ) 
However, unlike ShapeUp’s personality-driven self-indulgent rant, this other guy raised a good point that we would be happy to address: why the personal attack? First, it isn’t a personal attack–we have great respect for her primary-sourced work and called her the #1 researcher. I would love to be attacked like that. Second, all we are asking is for her to answer the question: does she support her own 3.27-to-1 or not? One could argue that the fate of the industry depends on this answer: the wellness ignorati have cited her 307 times (and that’s just in journals — try googling “Wellness” and “3.27”) so I think it’s a fair question. The ignorati have no other legitimate academic source–they sink or swim on 3.27-to-1. 
Finally, I did write to her directly twice in the last few months and got no response, before going public. Likewise, before we posted columns showing that the Koop Committee completely lacks the ability or willingness to identify phony outcomes when they give out awards to their sponsors, we wrote to some Committee members ahead of time to point out their incompetence and ask them to address the mistakes before going public. Even Rachel Carson didn’t go public until her protestations got totally ignored by the chemical industry.

GuestSteveJan 1, 2015I don’t understand the comparison between blood pressure or smoking and wellness programs. Wellness is something being designed, it is a product, and it is going to change over time. In a market economy you’d hope it’s change for the better, improving since businesses will learn and adapt to earn and keep business. I know it’s optimistic but we teach this stuff to freshmen so I sort of believe it. Blood pressure and smoking on the other hand are not going to evolve to have a different impact on your health, not much anyway.
I think that is part of what Baicker means when she says “all the evidence is in.” Right now wellness programs probably do suck on average, but will they always suck? Does they ALL suck or are their positive deviants we can learn from?
That said, I get it that wellness backers aren’t promising results some day, they are grossly overselling the benefits of their product which is their job. Similarly researchers are grossly overselling their findings and that is their job. But does anyone actually listen to these people?

GuestVik KhannaJan 2, 2015Is anybody listening? I’d say so. My wife and I are embroiled in her employer’s wellness program for simple reason that not participating was too onerous financially. This large employer, with a wellness program run by a major league (well, as major league as a wellness vendor can get, anyway) vendor who is a litigant in at least one major case we know of, is a poke-prod-pry-punish program that would make Kate Baicker proud. Because, apparently, nothing makes her contrite.

GuestPaul SlobodianJan 1, 2015Thank you Al Lewis, Vik Khanna (and Nortin Hadler cited in the piece)…..all experts who stay close to what sound research methodology tells us. It is astounding how rare that is.
-   Share             
GuestBob HertzJan 1, 2015This is indeed an important post…..almost like a new Rand study.
Let me make two points:
1. Medicaid probably reduced debt a lot. It may also have extended life spans by earlier detection of some cancers.\
That is about all that most health insurance does
2. I had to chuckle about absenteeism.
If a firm wants to cut absentees, all they need to do is go to hourly pay and limit sick days.
Try to run a school district for a year.
The number of sick days is stunning, despite good health insurance.

GuestAl LewisJan 1, 2015Hey guys, thanks very much for taking the time to comment on New Years Day. A couple of things. First, just to be clear, the rarely cited papers were not specifically refuting hers but rather refuting workplace wellness generally. but your point is a good one regardless.
Second, as a Democrat (Vik is a libertarian/Republican so we don’t have a political agenda about wellness), I do want to make clear that there was wellness before Obamacare came along. the ACA did raise the stakes quite a bit, for God knows what reason. I think it was to mollify the Business Roundtable, which has not wavered in its support of the wellness provision no matter what the data says. Their position reminds me of what Stephen Colbert said about George W. Bush’s consistency: “He will believe the same thinkg on Wednesday he believed on Monday regardless of what happened on Tuesday.
-   Share             Hide Replies ∧GuestVik KhannaJan 2, 2015In defense of my own political affiliations, I am not a Republican. In fact, I find the major leadership of the Republican Party as repugnant, stupid, and ineffective as most of their peers across the isle. I am an Independent conservative with a libertarian bent. 
That clarified, Bob’s point about government approval being a marketplace propellant is right on. Nothing can advance the pointless like an endorsement from the clueless but powerful.

GuestSaurabh JhaJan 1, 2015Sticky research.
The point about the number of citations of the original paper versus papers that have subsequently refuted the findings is an interesting phenomenon in its own right.

GuestBob MerbergJan 1, 2015Hi, Gents. This is an important post. While I do not know Prof Baicker and can’t comment regarding her personal actions or motives, I do (as you may know) share your exasperation with her flawed wellness study and the way it was swallowed — hook, line, and sinker — by the wellness industry. If anything, I think you’ve understated the case, as you don’t mention the phrase that was repeated in the study, “medical costs fall by about $3.27 for every dollar spent on wellness programs,” which is more absolute than the study title and, in my analysis, was wholly unsupported by the data presented in the study findings. I’m hoping you can elaborate on a matter that is more incidental to this particular post — namely, the straight line you draw from Obamacare to so-called outcomes-based wellness programs. Certainly, it is true that ACA “allow[s] employers to financially and clinically punish employees with coercive directives.” And this inclusion in ACA is inexcusable. But readers of this and other posts, who might not know better, may conclude that the Obama administration invented these programs. As you know, ACA expanded the permissible limits of these incentives/penalties — from 20% to 30% of the cost of coverage (in some cases more) — that were established in HIPAA in 2006, prior to Pres Obama’s election. Don’t get me wrong: By the very inclusion of these programs in ACA, and by expanding permissible limits, Pres Obama and ACA endorsed these programs, and presidential and gov’t endorsement is powerful. But readers would be served well to understand that outcomes-based programs were around long before ACA or the Obama presidency, and they were codified in government regulation in HIPAA (during the administration of Pres Bush). Ironically, in light of the recent EEOC lawsuits, the 2006 HIPAA codification of outcomes-based wellness was dubbed, “Wellness Exception to HIPAA Nondiscrimination Provisions.” The RAND Workplace Wellness Programs Study (p. xx) suggested that, at the time the study was conducted, “the average amount of results based incentives for these employers [who used so-called outcomes-based models] was less than 10 percent of the total cost of health coverage,” which could bring into question whether raising the permissible limit from 20% to 30% really had such a big impact. In my opinion, outcomes-based programs are nothing but an unfounded, desperado move on the part of employers. As such, isn’t it possible that they would have continued to see uptake from desperate employers, even in the absence of ACA? And is it correct to pin these programs on ACA, when ACA simply modified something that already was enacted and had already attracted the interest of employers? I look forward to your response. (For those interested in the HIPAA wellness provisions, which were enacted during Pres. Bush’s administration, and how they were expanded in ACA under Pres. Obama’s administration, I direct you to the Federal Register at https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/06/03/2013-12916/incentives-for-nondiscriminatory-wellness-programs-in-group-health-plans#h-9 )

The Coming DRexit 
Mar 19, 2017 2 

BRIAN JOONDEPH, MD
Brexit was a British version of “I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it anymore,” a famous line from the film “Network.” Brits were fed up with intrusive and nonsensical regulations from the European Union, including whether eggs could be sold by the dozen — really important stuff affecting the lives and well-being of our neighbors across the pond.
“Frexit” may be the next iteration, as one of the leading French presidential candidates, Marine Le Pen, promises voters a referendum to leave the E.U. Donald Trump’s election to the presidency is the American version, in which voters chose to leave behind the political and media Establishment and favored a new direction.
Now, in medicine, a similar movement is called “DRexit,” as described by Dr. Niran Al-Agba, a pediatrician in Washington State, who wrote about this in a blog post — and it may be pushing physicians away from stifling bureaucracies of government-run health care. Endless rules, regulations, and mandates are turning physicians from healers into robots and transforming the medical clinic into the post office or the Department of Motor Vehicles.

The Vanishing Hospital: ASCs Follow the Consumer 
Mar 14, 2017 43 

by JOHN MORROW
Call it what you want, disruption or evolution, but when two of the largest for-profit hospital chains, HCA Healthcare and Tenet Healthcare, and one of the largest insurance intermediary services companies, Optum (part of UnitedHealth Group), invest billions of dollars in capital for building new care settings, everyone should take notice. From freestanding ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs), to urgent care centers, to retail pharmacy-sponsored clinics and employer co-located clinics, the disruption of care delivery is all around us.
How does General Community Hospital compete with Walmart, CVS and Walgreens (retail clinics)? How does it compete with Urgent Care Centers? How will it compete with freestanding ASCs? How does a hospital stop consumers’ desire for savings and convenience? How does it stop physicians’ own desire for convenience and efficiency? This is the disintermediation of hospitals in a very big way! General Community Hospitals can zero base care, but they need to have answers more in line with a consumer retail operation than those of a charity. How many product lines does a focused factory operate?

Headlines We Won’t See In 2017 
Feb 2, 2017 1 

By BILL REID
Earlier, I offered a sarcastic headline view of the coming year.  Yet, underlying these headlines are some more serious issues that we as an industry have to address.  They may not happen this year, but we need to continue to make progress.  Wouldn’t it be awesome if for once we under predicted what will happen?
Healthcare Organization Wakes Up In Strange Place, Reports Massive Headache
Reality:  Many organizations are not quite sure what hit them – they have purchased and implemented a number of systems, sometime more than once, in the last several years and now are waking up to the reality that that might not be enough or even the right set of technologies for the emerging payment models.  Return on investment is hard to show, debt used to finance purchases along with stimulus funds are coming due.  System after system has had to report negative results on financial reports due to higher than expected costs, longer than anticipated implementations.  It’s enough to give any CIO a headache.
Healthcare Interoperability Finally A Reality
Reality:  Interoperability remains elusive despite ongoing talk and the creation of various coalitions.  Sometimes it seems that few want to actually solve the problem.  Healthcare organizations are afraid to lose patients to competitors.  Vendors are fighting for the last remaining market share, and aggressively seeking to displace others, and using local market coverage as a selling point.    Sure there are lots of sites now propped up showing FHIR APIs – but in reality these are mostly read-only and not particularly functional.
Foolproof Security Strategy Unveiled:  Don’t Click on $h!t
Reality:  We expect to continue to see rise in reported security incidents.  Attackers are not script-kiddies, but sophisticated hacking businesses making hundreds of millions a year in paid ransoms.  Our industry has a large surface area – with lots of organizations and millions of employees on millions of computing devices.  Our treatment facilities are filled with millions of connected devices monitoring at the bedside.  Like in any public health crisis, we need to not just wait around for the all-powerful anti-biotic.  We need to do basic hygiene well – patching, training, monitoring and rapidly responding to small outbreaks before they become bigger.  We are an industry that has experience in facing one set of viruses – we need to turn that thinking on securing our systems and keeping them healthy.
Affordable Care Act Files for Divorce, Claims Infidelity
Reality:  It is uncertain what the final fate of the Affordable Care Act will be.  Chances are that some changes will be made – too much public bluster was made about repeal for there to be any backing down, but the potential real harm that may come to the electorate that loses coverage or sees prices resume their rapid rise, will prove to be a check on full-scale repeal.
Family Physician Found Dead in Pool of Alphabet Soup
Reality:  It is challenging to remain in a small practice today.  There is an ever changing set of requirements and initiative from payers and from government entities and it can all sound like a pool of random letters.  For example, MACRA is now in effect and yet surveys show that many providers have no idea what it means or what is involved.  Radiology providers will soon have to ensure that ordering doctors begin using clinical decision support management (CDSM) tools to subject orders to appropriate use criteria (AUC) that were developed by Provider Led Entities (PLEs).  This is on top of HIPAA, HITECH, OPPS, and many others.
Consumer-Driven Healthcare Recalled, Engagement Engine Too Weak
Reality:  For all the talk about consumer driven healthcare, there seems to be little change in the position patients find themselves.  There remains little pricing information, payment terms and coverages are difficult to understand for the average reader, and Health Savings Accounts aren’t much other than a new form of deductible for insurance companies.  Most consumer online tools provide little utility, other than provider-out reporting.  Patients continue to have difficulty getting access to medical records in any useable form.  Mobile applications seldom exist, and when they do few if any are on par with the experiences of other tools like Uber, Amazon, Snapchat or Facebook.  It’s bad enough if you are reasonably healthy; it’s worse if you are trying to manage a chronic illness.  You can completely organize a complex trip on a phone, but just try to pay a healthcare claim, set up a number of visits to a variety of providers, or understand what you need to do next to care for yourself.

Headlines We Expect To See In 2017 
Jan 27, 2017 2 

By BILL REID

Every year, around this time, we are inundated with healthcare industry predictions. Most of these seem to be more retrospective than forward thinking – taking what seem to be fairly obvious trends and simply saying “Finally, this year will be the year that [fill in the blank] happens!”  Well, here are my predicted headlines for 2017.

Healthcare Organization Wakes Up In Strange Place, Reports Massive Headache

A Healthcare Organization reportedly just woke up this morning in a stranger’s apartment, with a massive hangover. Note on pillow says, “Thanks for a great night, big spender. I haven’t had so much fun in a long time. Had to go run a few API errands, but feel free to stay as long as you’d like. Oh, it looked like you may have overdone it – aspirin in the bathroom. Love, EMR xxoo. ”

Healthcare Interoperability Finally A Reality

Today Epic announced that it had finally penetrated 100 percent of the healthcare market and therefore interoperability was no longer an issue. The final CIO holdout was quoted saying, “We decided that we could no longer resist the movement. We give up.”

Foolproof Security Strategy Unveiled: Don’t Click on $h!t

After years of investment and study, one Chief Information Security Officer seems to have found the cure to all information security problems plaguing hospitals. “After careful observation, we noticed a common pattern among our users: they click on links sent to them in email. Once we told them to stop clicking on them. As a result, we noticed our ransomware problem begin to clear up. Sure, our employees don’t get to find out if they’ve won a vacation package, or if they can help out a Nigerian princess, but we are safer.”

Esther Dyson & Rick Brush Interview at Health 2.0 
Jan 13, 2017 0 

By JESSICA DAMASSA
Five communities. Ten years. One objective: to create business models that make better health attainable – and sustainable – for all. Esther Dyson and Rick Brush joined me at Health 2.0’s Fall Conference to talk about the exciting launch of their innovative population health initiative, The Way to Wellville.






Jonathan Bush Interview at Health 2.0 
Dec 19, 2016 0 

By JESSICA DAMASSA
Hello THCB Readers, I’m Jessica DaMassa. At Health 2.0’s Fall Conference, Matthew Holt and Indu Subaiya set me up with a camera crew and open access to the influencers, leaders, investors, and startups who graced the stage at this November’s meeting in Santa Clara. Over the course of two days, I asked more than 60 different interviewees from across the health continuum to share their point-of-view on the future of healthcare. Our goal was to capture the “state-of-play” in health innovation and contribute as many answers as possible to that elusive question: What’s going to be disrupted next?
All 60+ interviews are available for your guilty binge-watching pleasure on Health 2.0 TV, or you can stay tuned to THCB as we share some of the best-of-the-best. If you have any recommendations for future interviews (live or online), or want me to talk to you, I’ll be starting a longer series of interviews including showing tech demos. So please get in touch via @jessdamassa on Twitter. Thanks for watching! —Jessica DaMassa
Jonathan Bush, CEO of AthenaHealth, spoke at Health 2.0’s Fall Conference about the potential of networked medicine as a way to transform both the way healthcare is delivered and consumed. After his panel discussion, we got his take on where we can expect the next big disruption in healthcare. Here’s a hint (and a Jonathan Bush-ism to look out for): “ACO’s are kind of a training bra for becoming your own insurance company…”






Harnessing Data and Analytics to Transform the Healthcare Industry 
Dec 15, 2016 0 

By SAM OSBORN
As organizations in every industry invest heavily in business intelligence and analytics to transform their business models, healthcare providers are looking for opportunities to catch up. The challenges to digital transformation in the healthcare industry are significant, but the opportunities are tremendous as applying modern analytics can dramatically speed and improve quality of care while also creating opportunities for new revenue streams and customer retention.
Take, for example, the transformational opportunities presented by applying analytics to Electronic Health Records (EHRs). By applying a layer of advanced analytics to EHRs, providers can identify areas for improvement and opportunity, which is especially important when you consider that these insights can anticipate outcomes and inform actions that can directly affect (and improve) the standard of care.
Analytics aren’t just improving the quality of patient care; they are creating entirely new revenue opportunities in the healthcare industry. MediGain for example, which provides revenue cycle management services to medical practices, hospitals and other care providers, was able to harness advanced analytics to combine data from 300+ sources to deliver on-demand revenue management analytics to their clients. As a result, reporting time was reduced from weeks to near real-time, greatly improving client performance while earning MediGain 1044 percent ROI.
These are just a few examples of healthcare companies leveraging their data and analytics to transform their businesses. These services are no longer optional offerings; Nucleus Research confirms that customers are demanding accessibility to analytics in their daily workflow, meaning that organizations need adapt and offer these solutions in order to remain competitive.
GoodData recently partnered with Anne Moxie, Sr. Analyst of Nucleus Research and Ian Maurer, CIO at MediGain to create a webinar that features the latest strategies and tactics that healthcare companies are using to turn their data and analytics into a profit center, click this link to view on-demand session.

Ian Morrison Interview at Health 2.0 
Dec 3, 2016 0 

By JESSICA DAMASSA
Hi, today on THCB I’m glad to introduce Jessica DaMassa a new face who’ll be doing many more interviews in the future, focusing on thought leaders in health and health technology.–Matthew Holt
Ian Morrison is probably the best known health care futurist in America, despite being a Scottish-Canadian-Californian. He gave the keynote at last Fall’s Health 2.0 Conference, and gave his thoughts about the role of technology in the future of care delivery.






Want to help Technologies for Healthy Communities? 
Nov 22, 2016 2 

By ALEXANDRA CAMESAS

Health 2.0 is actively expanding Technology for Healthy Communities and looking for large healthcare organizations and foundations to help support technology adoption at a community level.
Technology for Healthy Communities is a dynamic pilot program designed to catalyze the adoption of technologies in communities. The program fosters the development of sustainable partnerships to address the social determinants of health in the under-served regions that need it the most. Over 200 innovators across the U.S. submitted applications to the program, and through curated matchmaking and access to funding, selected innovators were matched with three participating communities to conduct pilot projects. 
Snapshot of the three pilots:

Spartanburg, SC: ACCESS Health Spartanburg, a non-profit agency primarily working with the uninsured population, is piloting with Healthify to provide community interventions for social determinants of health at the point of care. With support from Spartanburg Way to Wellville and the Mary Black Foundation, the pilot aims to address current pain points in community health care, such as the inefficiency of addressing social needs of patients and helping to make case management easier. 
Jacksonville, FL: The City of Jacksonville and the Health Planning Council of NE Florida, with support from the Clinton Foundation is piloting with CTY to deploy its signature product, NuminaTM. With this technology, bicycle and pedestrian traffic data will be collected to assess current safety conditions and plan improvements in the built environment for residents to be more physically active.
Alameda County, CA: The Community Health Center Network is piloting with Welkin Health to implement a case management tool that engages members and eases current healthcare worker burden. Together, they will pilot this case management tool in four centers to help community health workers to effectively and efficiently coordinate care.

Due to the high demand from tech innovators and communities, Health 2.0 is expanding the program to new communities, tech startups and organizations who can benefit from technology adoption. By addressing the social determinants of health, the program has the potential to implement unique tech applications and address some of the most important systemic issues at the community level. 
Health 2.0 is looking for partners such as foundations, large health systems and corporations who want to support pilots to test innovations in communities, interact with the fastest growing startups in the tech scene, and help create business opportunities for technology companies. Program sponsors will also have the opportunity to address local health needs by bringing exciting, new technologies to under-served regions across the U.S.
The program will focus on tools that support access to a healthy lifestyle, in categories such as:

Access to healthcare services
Food insecurity
Affordable housing
Behavioral/mental health

If you are interested in partnering with Health 2.0 to help deliver technology to communities, contact [email protected] to learn about opportunities to support the program.
Alexandra Camesas is a program manager at Catalyst @ Health 2.0

Biography[edit]
She received her B.A. in Economics from Yale University in 1993 and her Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard University in 1998. She has served on the faculty of the UCLA School of Public Affairs at the University of California, Los Angeles; Harris School of Public Policy Studies at the University of Chicago; the Economics Department at Dartmouth College; and the Department of Community and Family Medicine at Dartmouth Medical School. She will become Dean of the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago effective August 15, 2017.
From 2005 to 2007, Baicker served as a Senate-confirmed Member of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers, where she played a leading role in the development of health care policy. She currently serves on the Editorial Boards of Health Affairs, the Journal of Health Economics, and the Forum for Health Economics and Policy; as Vice Chair of the Board of Directors of AcademyHealth; on the Congressional Budget Office's Panel of Health Advisers; and as a Commissioner on the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. She is a Director at Eli Lilly.[2]
Research[edit]
Her research areas include health economics, welfare, and public finance, with a particular focus on the financing of health insurance, spending on public programs, and fiscal federalism.
She believes in Medicare copayments as a way of reducing medical spending on unnecessary care. Copayments should be limited to a maximum patient contribution, to avoid patients having to pay catastrophic expenses that would defeat the purpose of insurance. Medicare clients should not have to buy supplemental insurance to avoid that risk. But copayments should be low for services that are effective at improving health.[3]
Her research has been published in journals such as Health Affairs, the Journal of Public Economics, and the Quarterly Journal of Economics, and has been featured in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Business Week, and on National Public Radio. She is currently one of the leaders of a research program investigating the many effects of expanding health insurance coverage in the context of a randomized Medicaid expansion in Oregon.
Teaching[edit]
She taught “American Economic Policy" course together with Martin Feldstein, Robert Stavins, and Robert Z. Lawrence at Harvard College and Harvard Kennedy School in Spring 2009.[4]

ArticleThe pressure the Medicare program puts on the federal budget has been much discussed, but financing Medicare also has broader implications for the economy. Medicare expenditures currently account for 15% of federal spending and 3.6% of the total gross domestic product (GDP).1 Moreover, Medicare spending grew an average of about 2.5 percentage points faster than the GDP from 1975 through 2008,2 consuming a rapidly increasing share of the country's total resources.Health care services provided to Medicare beneficiaries are paid for by a combination of dedicated taxes and general revenues — in addition to the care financed by supplemental plans and the 25% of care that beneficiaries pay for through premiums or out of pocket.3 Medicare Part A (mainly for inpatient expenses) accounts for about 1.7% of the GDP and is largely financed by a dedicated tax on wages (2.9% of earnings, split evenly between workers and their employers but ultimately all coming out of workers' wages). Starting in 2013, high-income workers are scheduled to pay an additional 0.9% tax imposed by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The payroll taxes are paid into a trust fund, but since 2009 spending has grown more quickly than the revenue stream, and the Part A trust fund is forecast to be exhausted in 2024.1 At that time, benefits would need to be reduced or other revenue sources found, since there's no provision for filling the projected long-range (75-year) gap between resources coming in and benefits promised (almost 1% of the GDP, under realistic assumptions).Program costs for Medicare Parts B (physicians and other outpatient care) and D (drugs) are financed mostly through general revenues (about 75%) and beneficiaries' premiums. The cost of these two Medicare components is about 1.9% of the GDP, and it's projected to rise to 3.4% by 2035 — even under the improbable assumption that substantial cuts to physician payments under the sustainable growth rate (SGR) formula will be implemented.1 Since spending on these components of the program is rising rapidly, the share of financing from general revenues is also rising rapidly (see graphMedicare Sources of Non-Interest Income and Expenditures as a Percentage of the Gross Domestic Product.Data are from the Boards of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance and Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Funds.1
).The public financing of Medicare has particular implications for the economy. Specifically, raising taxes to pay for public insurance exerts a structural drag on the economy even if the revenue is spent on care; the same is not true of unsubsidized, privately purchased care or insurance. The net size and timing of the economic consequences depend on how the taxes are raised and how the revenue is spent. Deficit spending on health care also carries an economic cost: taxes are required to pay back any borrowed money (with interest), and rising debt-to-GDP ratios may have calamitous effects on the country's future ability to borrow. Moreover, increased spending on health care is not necessarily good for the economy even if it increases health care employment: spending on low-value health care diverts resources from other uses that could do more to boost the GDP and create jobs.Although the economy can probably bear some tax increases to help finance Medicare, if recent rates of spending growth continue, taxes would have to increase precipitously. An analysis performed by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) before the ACA was passed suggested that income tax rates would have to increase by more than 70% to finance health care spending that grew just 1 percentage point faster than the GDP — and by more than 160% to finance growth at the historical rate of 2.5 percentage points faster than GDP growth, increasing the income tax rate in the top bracket, for example, to 92% from 35%.2 Even with just 1 percentage point excess growth in health care spending, the CBO estimates that the tax increase would reduce the GDP by 3 to 16%.2 Of course, such tax-financed spending may be worthwhile — the cost of raising the revenue must be weighed against the good done by the program, and Medicare has many costs and benefits beyond its effect on the GDP. Its pooling of risk is crucial to the functioning of insurance markets. If sicker people are disproportionately likely to obtain insurance, premiums will increase, even fewer people will enroll, and insurance markets may eventually collapse. Before Medicare, health insurance was purchased almost exclusively through employers that provided the main source of risk pooling. In 1963, only an estimated 25% of seniors had comprehensive insurance, but shortly after Medicare was created in 1965, virtually all did.4 The heavy public subsidy of Medicare coverage ensures wide participation and risk pooling.Although this coverage provides important financial protection and access to care, Medicare's design generates inefficient utilization, which imposes broad indirect costs on all patients. For example, fee-for-service payment discourages coordinated care, and if Medicare benefit or payment design encourages investment in inefficient resources or inefficient care patterns, that can also drive higher and inefficient private spending.On paper, the ACA significantly reduces the fiscal burden associated with Medicare: the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimates that it will slow per-beneficiary spending growth to about the rate of GDP growth, largely by reducing payments to providers and health plans. The ACA also establishes pilot mechanisms for transforming fee-for-service Medicare into a bundled-payment system with broader integration of care, which could promote cost containment by enabling providers to better capture practice efficiencies. Nevertheless, Medicare spending would still consume a growing share of the GDP because of increasing numbers of beneficiaries. Thus, even if the ACA achieves its ambitious goals, Medicare would still need extra resources to solve this demographic problem. Although some additional resources could come from reducing waste in the system, no industrialized country has ever achieved sustained growth rates of health care spending below that of the GDP, so it seems unlikely that Medicare's growth could be reduced below the projected ACA trajectory.More important, it's unclear how successfully the ACA's fiscal provisions will be implemented. Political will may wane, and the projected savings may not materialize. The use of temporary “patches” to the SGR rather than a longer-term fix illustrates the political challenges involved, and relatively disappointing results from many Medicare demonstration programs illustrate the difficulty of achieving savings.If the payment-reform and delivery-system strategies in the ACA fail, alternatives will probably involve shifting costs and risk to beneficiaries. One avenue for enacting such a shift would be fixed vouchers (or premium support), which would limit federal liability but, by relying on market mechanisms, place a greater burden on beneficiaries to control spending. The use of market competition is not new: the rationale for the Medicare Advantage (Part C) program included introducing more competition among plans to improve the program's value. Consumers' ability to “discipline the market” depends on the competitiveness of insurers and providers, however, and there is limited evidence that competition among Medicare Advantage plans can sufficiently control spending growth.Reforms might make competition more effective. For example, competitive pressure might be increased by increasing beneficiaries' incentives to choose low-cost plans, but shifting financial responsibility to beneficiaries can also exacerbate disparities and expose beneficiaries to greater financial risk as health care costs rise relative to their vouchers' value. Or responsibility can be shifted by increasing beneficiaries' cost sharing, a strategy that could discourage the use of lower-value care and limit the program's economic drag — but that must be well designed and operating in a well-regulated environment, particularly if it's to avoid discouraging use of high-value care.Although Medicare provides invaluable financial protection and access to care for almost 50 million beneficiaries,1 there's a limit to what we can finance with limited public resources — public programs cannot pay for all possible care for all people. Different plans for limiting Medicare's public resources impose risk on different stakeholders: bundled payments shift financial responsibility and risk to providers; fixed premium support shifts them to beneficiaries. Ultimately, benefit and payment structures must be improved in a clinically informed way that's consistent with high-value care but that also moderates spending growth to keep the program — and the economy — afloat.

The Effect of Malpractice Liability on the Delivery of Health Care

Abstract
The growth of medical malpractice liability costs has the potential to affect the delivery of health care in the U.S. along two dimensions. If growth in malpractice payments results in higher malpractice insurance premiums for physicians, these premiums may affect the size and composition of the physician workforce. The growth of potential losses from malpractice liability might also encourage physicians to practice 'defensive medicine.' We use rich new data to examine the relationship between the growth of malpractice costs and the delivery of health care along both of these dimensions. We pose three questions. First, are increases in payments responsible for increases in medical malpractice premiums? Second, do increases in malpractice liability drive physicians to close their practices or not move to areas with high payments? Third, do increases in malpractice liability change the way medicine is practiced by increasing the use of certain procedures? First, we find that increases in malpractice payments made on behalf of physicians do not seem to be the driving force behind increases in premiums. Second, increases in malpractice costs (both premiums overall and the subcomponent factors) do not seem to affect the overall size of the physician workforce, although they may deter marginal entry, increase marginal exit, and reduce the rural physician workforce. Third, there is little evidence of increased use of many treatments in response to malpractice liability at the state level, although there may be some increase in screening procedures such as mammography.

Katherine Baicker (born May 23, 1971) is an American economist and a professor of health economics in the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Harvard School of Public Health.[1] In late March 2017 she was appointed to be the next dean of the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy.

Biography[edit]
She received her B.A. in Economics from Yale University in 1993 and her Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard University in 1998. She has served on the faculty of the UCLA School of Public Affairs at the University of California, Los Angeles; Harris School of Public Policy Studies at the University of Chicago; the Economics Department at Dartmouth College; and the Department of Community and Family Medicine at Dartmouth Medical School. She will become Dean of the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago effective August 15, 2017.
From 2005 to 2007, Baicker served as a Senate-confirmed Member of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers, where she played a leading role in the development of health care policy. She currently serves on the Editorial Boards of Health Affairs, the Journal of Health Economics, and the Forum for Health Economics and Policy; as Vice Chair of the Board of Directors of AcademyHealth; on the Congressional Budget Office's Panel of Health Advisers; and as a Commissioner on the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. She is a Director at Eli Lilly.[2]
Research[edit]
Her research areas include health economics, welfare, and public finance, with a particular focus on the financing of health insurance, spending on public programs, and fiscal federalism.
She believes in Medicare copayments as a way of reducing medical spending on unnecessary care. Copayments should be limited to a maximum patient contribution, to avoid patients having to pay catastrophic expenses that would defeat the purpose of insurance. Medicare clients should not have to buy supplemental insurance to avoid that risk. But copayments should be low for services that are effective at improving health.[3]
Her research has been published in journals such as Health Affairs, the Journal of Public Economics, and the Quarterly Journal of Economics, and has been featured in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Business Week, and on National Public Radio. She is currently one of the leaders of a research program investigating the many effects of expanding health insurance coverage in the context of a randomized Medicaid expansion in Oregon.
Teaching[edit]
She taught “American Economic Policy" course together with Martin Feldstein, Robert Stavins, and Robert Z. Lawrence at Harvard College and Harvard Kennedy School in Spring 2009.[4]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
