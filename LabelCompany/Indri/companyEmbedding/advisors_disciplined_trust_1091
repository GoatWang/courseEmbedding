Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) are sold only by prospectus. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing which contains a detailed explanation of the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Investors should consult their accounting, legal, or tax advisor.


* Information labeled “Fee-Based Account” provides information pertaining to units purchased through registered investment advisers, certified financial planners or registered broker-dealers who in each case either charge investor accounts periodic fees for brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such services in connection with an investment account for which a comprehensive “wrap fee” charge is imposed. You should consult your financial advisor to determine whether you can benefit from these accounts and whether your unit purchases are eligible for this discount. To purchase units in these accounts, your financial advisor must purchase units designated with one of the Fee Account CUSIP numbers, if available. The amounts shown are different from what would be applicable for units purchased in other accounts (i.e. “Commission-Based Accounts”) not eligible for this discount.  See your prospectus and consult your financial advisor for more information about eligibility and applicability of the Fee-Based Account discount.

Our VisionOur Team 






 





Capturing Results Through Innovation and Discipline Through a structured and disciplined approach we will provide exclusivity and customized investment strategies for our clients.  We will be distinguishable by the personal relationships we build with our clients, truly listening to and understanding their financial goals and objectives.


Right around the midpoint in life, humans tend to learn that if you make a decision in an emotional state of mind, you have a great chance of making the wrong choice.  Among the most damaging emotions of all are greed and fear.


Fortunately, life experience serves you well and success is achieved in family and in business.  This wisdom brings financial rewards.  Sound decision making allows you to achieve substantial life goals and to surround yourself with friends and colleagues who have the same long-range vision.  


Yet when it comes to investing in the market, seasoned life veterans inadvertently join hands with an entire population that never learned the same lessons.  Unknowingly, their investments are commingled with approximately 85% of the marketplace who make investment decisions based on greed and fear.  This herd mentality drives the market impacting your holdings at this very moment…

              The dollar was narrowly mixed against major rivals in Tuesday trading, leaving a broad index tracking the greenback little changed ahead of a two-day Federal Reserve meeting that could reveal policymaker thinking on a batch of fuzzy economic readings of late.

INVESTMENT SUMMARY                                                              
------------------                                                              

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE

 The trust seeks to provide above average total return through dividend income
and capital appreciation.                                                       

 PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY

The trust seeks to provide total return, through dividend income and capital
appreciation, by investing in a portfolio consisting of the 10 stocks with the  
highest dividend yield chosen from among the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones         
Industrial Average(SM) ("DJIA(SM)") as of May 13, 2011.  The stocks are         
held in approximately equal dollar amounts as of the trust's inception.         

Please note that the strategy was applied to select the portfolio at a      
particular time.  If we<F1>* create additional units of the trust after the     
trust's inception date, the trust will purchase the securities originally       
selected by applying the strategy.  This is true even if a later application of 
the strategy would have resulted in the selection of different securities.  We  
disregard any stock in the DJIA(SM) where the U.S. government or any of its     
agencies can exercise any veto power over any current or future dividends,      
whether common or preferred, to be distributed in connection with such stock.   
In such cases, we will automatically select the next highest dividend yielding  
stock in the DJIA(SM).  In addition, companies which, based on publicly         
available information as of two business days prior to the date of this         
prospectus, are the target of an announced business acquisition which are       
expected to happen within six months of the date of this prospectus have been   
excluded from the universe of securities from which the trust's securities are  
selected.                                                                       

 PRINCIPAL RISKS

As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in this trust.  The
trust also might not perform as well as you expect.  This can happen for reasons
such as these:                                                                  

*  STOCK PRICES WILL FLUCTUATE.  The value of your investment may fall over     
time.                                                                     

*  AN ISSUER MAY BE UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO DECLARE DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE, OR  
 MAY REDUCE THE LEVEL OF DIVIDENDS DECLARED.  This may result in a reduction
in the value of your units.                                               

*  THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AN ISSUER MAY WORSEN OR ITS CREDIT RATINGS MAY    
DROP, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF YOUR UNITS.  This may occur
at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.       

*  THE TRUST IS CONSIDERED TO BE CONCENTRATED IN SECURITIES ISSUED BY COMPANIES 
  IN THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR.  Negative developments in this sector will affect
the value of your investment more than would be the case in a more        
diversified investment.                                                   

*  THE TRUST'S PERFORMANCE MIGHT NOT SUFFICIENTLY CORRESPOND TO PUBLISHED       
HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE OF THE TRUST'S INVESTMENT STRATEGY.  This can    
 happen for reasons such as an inability to exactly replicate the weightings
of stocks in the strategy or be fully invested, timing of the trust       
offering or timing of your investment, and trust expenses.                

*  WE DO NOT ACTIVELY MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO.  Except in limited circumstances,   
 the trust will hold, and continue to buy, shares of the same stocks even if
their market value declines.

of 2.95% of the unit offering price) and the sum of the remaining deferred sales
fee and the total creation and development fee.  The deferred sales fee is fixed
at $0.170 per unit and is paid in three monthly installments beginning          
September 20, 2011.  The creation and development fee is fixed at $0.025 per    
unit and is paid at the end of the initial offering period (anticipated to be   
three months).                                                                  

 EXAMPLE

This example helps you compare the cost of this trust with other unit trusts
and mutual funds.  In the example we assume that the expenses do not change and 
that the trust's annual return is 5%.  Your actual returns and expenses will    
vary.  Based on these assumptions, you would pay these expenses for every       
$10,000 you invest in the trust:                                                

1 year              $375                                  
3 years             $944                                  
5 years           $1,539                                  
10 years          $3,153                                  

This example assumes that you continue to follow the trust strategy and roll
your investment, including all distributions, into a new series of the trust    
each year subject to a reduced rollover sales charge of 1.95%.

HOW TO BUY UNITS

You can buy units of the trust on any business day the New York Stock       
Exchange is open by contacting your financial professional.  Unit prices are    
available daily on the Internet at WWW.AAMPORTFOLIOS.COM.  The public offering  
price of units includes:                                                        

*  the net asset value per unit plus                                        

*  organization costs plus                                                  

*  the sales fee.                                                           

 The "net asset value per unit" is the value of the securities, cash and other
assets in the trust reduced by the liabilities of the trust divided by the total
units outstanding.  We often refer to the public offering price of units as the 
"offer price" or "purchase price."  The offer price will be effective for all   
orders received prior to the close of regular trading on the New York Stock     
Exchange (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time).  If we receive your order prior to  
the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange or authorized       
financial professionals receive your order prior to that time and properly      
transmit the order to us by the time that we designate, then you will receive   
the price computed on the date of receipt.  If we receive your order after the  
close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, if authorized financial
professionals receive your order after that time or if orders are received by   
such persons and are not transmitted to us by the time that we designate, then  
you will receive the price computed on the date of the next determined offer    
price provided that your order is received in a timely manner on that date.  It 
is the responsibility of the authorized financial professional to transmit the  
orders that they receive to us in a timely manner.  Certain broker-dealers may  
charge a transaction or other fee for processing unit purchase orders.          

VALUE OF THE SECURITIES.  We determine the value of the securities as of the
close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on each day that        
exchange is open.  We generally determine the value of securities using the last
sale price for securities traded on a national securities exchange.  For this   
purpose, the trustee provides us closing prices from a reporting service        
approved by us.  In some cases we will price a security based on its fair value 
after considering appropriate factors relevant to value of the security.  We    
will only do this if a security is not principally traded on a national         
securities exchange, or if the market quotes are unavailable or inappropriate.  

 We determined the initial prices of the securities shown under "Portfolio" in
this prospectus as described above at the close of regular trading on the New   
York Stock Exchange on the business day before the date of this prospectus.  On 
the first day we sell units we will compute the unit price as of the close of   
regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange or the time the registration     
statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission becomes effective,  
if later.                                                                       

 ORGANIZATION COSTS.  During the initial offering period, part of the value of
the securities represents an amount that will pay the costs of creating your    
trust.  These costs include the costs of preparing the registration statement   
and legal documents, federal and state registration fees, the initial fees and  
expenses of the trustee and the initial audit.  Your trust will sell securities 
to reimburse us for these costs at the end of the initial offering period or    
after six months, if earlier.  The value of your units will decline when the    
trust pays these costs.

P-->4877th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�7th
TRANSACTIONAL SALES FEE.  You pay a fee in connection with purchasing units.
We refer to this fee as the "transactional sales fee."  The transactional sales 
fee has both an initial and a deferred component and equals 2.70% of the public 
offering price per unit based on a $10 public offering price per unit.  This    
percentage amount of the transactional sales fee is based on the unit price on  
the trust's inception date.  The transactional sales fee equals the difference  
between the total sales fee and the creation and development fee.  As a result, 
the percentage and dollar amount of the transactional sales fee will vary as the
public offering price per unit varies.  The transactional sales fee does not    
include the creation and development fee which is described under "Expenses."   

The maximum sales fee equals 2.95% of the public offering price per unit at 
the time of purchase.  You pay the initial sales fee at the time you buy units. 
The initial sales fee is the difference between the total sales fee percentage  
(maximum of 2.95% of the public offering price per unit) and the sum of the     
remaining fixed dollar deferred sales fee and the total fixed dollar creation   
and development fee.  The initial sales fee will be approximately 1.00% of the  
public offering price per unit depending on the public offering price per unit. 
The deferred sales fee is fixed at $0.170 per unit.  Your trust pays the        
deferred sales fee in equal monthly installments as described on page 3.  If you
redeem or sell your units prior to collection of the total deferred sales fee,  
you will pay any remaining deferred sales fee upon redemption or sale of your   
units.                                                                          

If you purchase units after the last deferred sales fee payment has been    
assessed, the secondary market sales fee is equal to 2.95% of the public        
offering price and does not include deferred payments.                          

REDUCING YOUR SALES FEE.  We offer a variety of ways for you to reduce the  
fee you pay.  It is your financial professional's responsibility to alert us of 
any discount when you order units.  Since the deferred sales fee and the        
creation and development fee are fixed dollar amounts per unit, your trust must 
charge these fees per unit regardless of any discounts.  However, if you are    
eligible to receive a discount such that your total sales fee is less than the  
fixed dollar amounts of the deferred sales fee and the creation and development 
fee, we will credit you the difference between your total sales fee and these   
fixed dollar fees at the time you buy units.                                    

Large Purchases.  You can reduce your sales fee by increasing the size of   
your investment:                                                                

IF YOU PURCHASE:        YOUR FEE WILL BE:                           
------------------------------------------                            

Less than $50,000             2.95%                                   
$50,000 - $99,999             2.70                                    
$100,000 - $249,999           2.45                                    
$250,000 - $499,999           2.20                                    
$500,000 - $999,999           1.95                                    
$1,000,000 or more            1.40                                    

 We apply these fees as a percent of the public offering price per unit at the
time of purchase.  We also apply the different purchase levels on a unit basis  
using a $10 unit equivalent.  For example, if you purchase between 10,000 and   
24,999 units, your fee is 2.45% of your public offering price per unit.         

You may AGGREGATE unit orders submitted by the same person for units of any 
of the trusts we sponsor on any single day from any one broker-dealer to qualify
for a purchase level.  You can also include these orders as your own for        
purposes of this aggregation:                                                   

*  orders submitted by your spouse or minor children living in the same     
household and

P-->4878th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�8th
*  orders submitted by your trust estate or fiduciary accounts.             

The discounts described above apply during the initial offering period.     

Fee Accounts.  Investors may purchase units through registered investment   
advisers, certified financial planners or registered broker-dealers who in each 
case either charge investor accounts ("Fee Accounts") periodic fees for         
brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management 
services, or provide such services in connection with an investment account for 
which a comprehensive "wrap fee" charge ("Wrap Fee") is imposed.  You should    
consult your financial advisor to determine whether you can benefit from these  
accounts.  To purchase units in these Fee Accounts, your financial advisor must 
purchase units designated with one of the Fee Account CUSIP numbers, if         
available.  Please contact your financial advisor for more information.  If     
units of the trust are purchased for a Fee Account and the units are subject to 
a Wrap Fee in such Fee Account (i.e., the trust is "Wrap Fee Eligible") then    
investors may be eligible to purchase units of the trust in these Fee Accounts  
that are not subject to the transactional sales fee but will be subject to the  
creation and development fee that is retained by the sponsor.  For example, this
table illustrates the sales fee you will pay as a percentage of the initial $10 
public offering price per unit (the percentage will vary with the unit price).  

Initial sales fee                0.00%

This discount applies only during the initial offering period.  Certain Fee 
Account investors may be assessed transaction or other fees on the purchase     
and/or redemption of units by their broker-dealer or other processing           
organizations for providing certain transaction or account activities.  We      
reserve the right to limit or deny purchases of units in Fee Accounts by        
investors or selling firms whose frequent trading activity is determined to be  
detrimental to the trust.                                                       

Employees.  We waive the transactional sales fee for purchases made by      
officers, directors and employees of the sponsor and its affiliates and their   
family members (spouses, children and parents).  These purchases are not subject
to the transactional sales fee but will be subject to the creation and          
development fee.  We also waive a portion of the sales fee for purchases made by
registered representatives of selling firms and their family members (spouses,  
children and parents).  These purchases may be made at the public offering price
per unit less the applicable regular dealer concession.  These discounts apply  
during the initial offering period and in the secondary market.  All employee   
discounts are subject to the policies of the related selling firm.  Only        
officers, directors and employees of companies that allow their employees to    
participate in this employee discount program are eligible for the discounts.   

Rollover/Exchange Option.  We waive a portion of the sales fee on units of  
the trust offered in this prospectus if you buy your units with redemption or   
termination proceeds from any of our other unit trusts.  You may also purchase  
units of the trust offered in this prospectus at this reduced fee if you        
purchase your units with (1) termination proceeds from an unaffiliated unit     
trust or (2) redemption proceeds from an unaffiliated unit trust if such trust  
is scheduled to terminate within 30 days of the redemption.  The discounted

these transactions is equal to the regular public offering price per unit less  
1.00%.  However, if you invest redemption or termination proceeds of $500,000 or
more in units of the trust, the maximum sales fee on your units will be limited 
to the maximum sales fee for the applicable amount invested in the table under  
"Large Purchases" above.  To qualify for this discount, the termination or      
redemption proceeds used to purchase units of the trust offered in this         
prospectus must be derived from a transaction that occurred within 30 days of   
your purchase of units of the trust offered in this prospectus.  In addition,   
the discount will only be available for investors that utilize the same broker- 
dealer (or a different broker-dealer with appropriate notification) for both the
unit purchase and the transaction resulting in the receipt of the termination or
redemption proceeds used for the unit purchase.  You may be required to provide 
appropriate documentation or other information to your broker-dealer to evidence
your eligibility for this sales fee discount.                                   

Please note that if you purchase units of the trust in this manner using    
redemption proceeds from trusts which assess the amount of any remaining        
deferred sales fee at redemption, you should be aware that any deferred sales   
fee remaining on these units will be deducted from those redemption proceeds.   
These discounts apply only during the initial offering period.                  

 Dividend Reinvestment Plan.  We do not charge any sales fee when you reinvest
distributions from your trust into additional units of the trust.  This sales   
fee discount applies during the initial offering period and in the secondary    
market.  Since the deferred sales fee and the creation and development fee are  
fixed dollar amounts per unit, your trust must charge these fees per unit       
regardless of this discount.  If you elect the distribution reinvestment plan,  
we will credit you with additional units with a dollar value sufficient to cover
the amount of any remaining deferred sales fee or creation and development fee  
that will be collected on such units at the time of reinvestment.  The dollar   
value of these units will fluctuate over time.                                  

RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS.  The portfolio may be suitable for purchase in tax-    
advantaged retirement accounts.  You should contact your financial professional 
about the accounts offered and any additional fees imposed.                     

HOW TO SELL YOUR UNITS

You can sell or redeem your units on any business day the New York Stock    
Exchange is open by contacting your financial professional.  Unit prices are    
available daily on the Internet at WWW.AAMPORTFOLIOS.COM or through your        
financial professional.  The sale and redemption price of units is equal to the 
net asset value per unit, provided that you will not pay any remaining creation 
and development fee or organization costs if you sell or redeem units during the
initial offering period.  The sale and redemption price is sometimes referred to
as the "liquidation price."  You pay any remaining deferred sales fee when you  
sell or redeem your units.  Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction or  
other fee for processing unit redemption or sale requests.                      

SELLING UNITS.  We may maintain a secondary market for units.  This means   
that if you want to sell your units, we may buy them at the current net asset   
value, provided that you will not pay any remaining creation and development fee
or organization costs if you sell units during the

P-->48710th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�10th
initial offering period.  We may then resell the units to other investors at the
public offering price or redeem them for the redemption price.  Our secondary   
market repurchase price is the same as the redemption price.  Certain broker-   
dealers might also maintain a secondary market in units.  You should contact    
your financial professional for current repurchase prices to determine the best 
price available.  We may discontinue our secondary market at any time without   
notice.  Even if we do not make a market, you will be able to redeem your units 
with the trustee on any business day for the current redemption price.          

REDEEMING UNITS.  You may also redeem your units directly with the trustee, 
The Bank of New York Mellon, on any day the New York Stock Exchange is open.    
The redemption price that you will receive for units is equal to the net asset  
value per unit, provided that you will not pay any remaining creation and       
development fee or organization costs if you redeem units during the initial    
offering period.   You will pay any remaining deferred sales fee at the time you
redeem units.  You will receive the net asset value for a particular day if the 
trustee receives your completed redemption request prior to the close of regular
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  Redemption requests received by        
authorized financial professionals prior to the close of regular trading on the 
New York Stock Exchange that are properly transmitted to the trustee by the time
designated by the trustee, are priced based on the date of receipt.  Redemption 
requests received by the trustee after the close of regular trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange, redemption requests received by authorized financial       
professionals after that time or redemption requests received by such persons   
that are not transmitted to the trustee until after the time designated by the  
trustee, are priced based on the date of the next determined redemption price   
provided they are received in a timely manner by the trustee on such date.  It  
is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to transmit         
redemption requests received by them to the trustee so they will be received in 
a timely manner.  If your request is not received in a timely manner or is      
incomplete in any way, you will receive the next net asset value computed after 
the trustee receives your completed request.                                    

If you redeem your units, the trustee will generally send you a payment for 
your units no later than seven days after it receives all necessary             
documentation (this will usually only take three business days).  The only time 
the trustee can delay your payment is if the New York Stock Exchange is closed  
(other than weekends or holidays), the Securities and Exchange Commission       
determines that trading on that exchange is restricted or an emergency exists   
making sale or evaluation of the securities not reasonably practicable, and for 
any other period that the Securities and Exchange Commission permits.           

You can request an in-kind distribution of the securities underlying your   
units if you tender at least 2,500 units for redemption (or such other amount as
required by your financial professional's firm).  This option is generally      
available only for securities traded and held in the United States.  The trustee
will make any in-kind distribution of securities by distributing applicable     
securities in book entry form to the account of your financial professional at  
Depository Trust Company.  You will receive whole shares of the applicable      
securities and cash equal to any fractional shares.  You may not request this   
option in the last 30 days of your

trust's life.  We may discontinue this option at any time without notice.       

EXCHANGE OPTION.  You may be able to exchange your units for units of our   
other unit trusts at a reduced sales fee.  You can contact your financial       
professional for more information about trusts currently available for          
exchanges.  Before you exchange units, you should read the prospectus carefully 
and understand the risks and fees.  You should then discuss this option with    
your financial professional to determine whether your investment goals have     
changed, whether current trusts suit you and to discuss tax consequences.  We   
may discontinue this option upon sixty days notice.                             

 DISTRIBUTIONS

MONTHLY DISTRIBUTIONS.  Your trust generally pays distributions of its net  
investment income along with any excess capital on each monthly distribution    
date to unitholders of record on the preceding record date, provided that the   
total cash held for distribution equals at least 0.1% of the trust's net asset  
value as determined under the trust agreement.  The record and distribution     
dates are shown under "Essential Information" in the "Investment Summary"       
section of this prospectus.  In some cases, your trust might pay a special      
distribution if it holds an excessive amount of cash pending distribution.  For 
example, this could happen as a result of a merger or similar transaction       
involving a company whose stock is in your portfolio.  The amount of your       
distributions will vary from time to time as companies change their dividends or
trust expenses change.                                                          

The issuers in the trust's portfolio make dividend payments at various times
during the year.  When the trust receives dividends from issuers, the trustee   
credits the dividends to the trust's accounts.  Because the trust does not      
necessarily receive dividends from the underlying issuers at a constant rate    
throughout the year, the trust's income distributions to unitholders will       
fluctuate from month to month.                                                  

ESTIMATED ANNUAL DISTRIBUTIONS.  The estimated net annual distributions are 
shown under "Essential Information" in the "Investment Summary" section of this 
prospectus.  We generally base the estimate of the income the trust may receive 
on annualizing the most recent ordinary dividend declared by an issuer (or      
adding the most recent interim and final dividends declared for certain foreign 
issuers) or on scheduled income payments.  However, dividend conventions for    
certain companies and/or certain countries differ from those typically used in  
the United States and in certain instances, dividends paid or declared over     
several years or other periods were used to estimate annual distributions.  Due 
to this and various other factors, actual income payments received by the trust 
will most likely differ from the most recent annualized dividends or scheduled  
income payments.  The actual net annual distributions you will receive will vary
with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in income payments received and  
with the sale of securities.  The estimated net annual distributions for        
subsequent years are expected to be less than estimated distributions for the   
first year because a portion of the securities included in the trust portfolio  
will be sold during the first year to pay for organization costs, the creation  
and development fee and the deferred sales fee.                                 

REPORTS.  The trustee or your financial professional will make available to 
you a statement

showing income and other receipts of your trust for each distribution.  Each    
year the trustee will also provide an annual report on your trust's activity and
certain tax information.  You can request copies of security evaluations to     
enable you to complete your tax forms and audited financial statements for your 
trust, if available.                                                            

INVESTMENT RISKS

 All investments involve risk.  This section describes the main risks that can
impact the value of the securities in your portfolio.  You should understand    
these risks before you invest.  If the value of the securities falls, the value 
of your units will also fall.  We cannot guarantee that your trust will achieve 
its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period.  

MARKET RISK is the risk that the value of the securities in your trust will 
fluctuate.  This could cause the value of your units to fall below your original
purchase price.  Market value fluctuates in response to various factors.  These 
can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the financial condition of a  
security's issuer, perceptions of the issuer, or ratings on a security.  Even   
though we supervise your portfolio, you should remember that we do not manage   
your portfolio.  Your trust will not sell a security solely because the market  
value falls as is possible in a managed fund.                                   

DIVIDEND PAYMENT RISK is the risk that an issuer of a security is unwilling 
or unable to pay income on a security.  Stocks represent ownership interests in 
the issuers and are not obligations of the issuers.  Common stockholders have a 
right to receive dividends only after the company has provided for payment of   
its creditors, bondholders and preferred stockholders.  Common stocks do not    
assure dividend payments.  Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer's 
board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time.           

STRATEGY CORRELATION RISK is the risk that the trust's performance will not 
sufficiently correspond with the hypothetical performance of the trust's        
investment strategy.  This can happen for reasons such as:                      

*  the impracticability of owning each of the strategy stocks with the exact
weightings at a given time,                                           

 *  strategy performance is based on a calendar year strategy while trusts may
 be created at various times during the year and generally have 15 month
terms,                                                                

*  the trust may not be fully invested at all times, and                    

*  trust fees and expenses.                                                 

CONCENTRATION RISK is the risk that the value of your trust is more         
susceptible to fluctuations based on factors that impact a particular industry  
because the portfolio concentrates in companies within that industry.  A        
portfolio "concentrates" in an industry when stocks in a particular industry    
make up 25% or more of the portfolio.                                           

 The trust invests primarily in stocks of HEALTH CARE COMPANIES.  Companies in
the health care industry are subject to governmental regulation of their        
products and services, a factor which could have a significant and possibly     
unfavorable effect on the price and availability of such products or services.  
Furthermore, such companies face the risk of increasing competition from new    
products or services, generic drug sales, termination of patent protection for  
drug or medical supply products and the risk that technological advances        

                                            Understanding Your Investment     11

will render their products obsolete.  The research and development costs of     
bringing a drug to market are substantial, and include lengthy governmental     
review processes with no guarantee that the product will ever come to market.   
Many of these companies may have losses and not offer certain products for      
several years.  Such companies may also have persistent losses during a new     
product's transition from development to production, and revenue patterns may be
erratic.  In addition, healthcare facility operators may be affected by events  
and conditions including, among other things, demand for services, the ability  
of the facility to provide the services required, physicians' confidence in the 
facility, management capabilities, competition with other hospitals, efforts by 
insurers and governmental agencies to limit rates, legislation establishing     
state rate-setting agencies, expenses, government regulation, the cost and      
possible unavailability of malpractice insurance and the termination or         
restriction of governmental financial assistance, including that associated with
Medicare, Medicaid and other similar third-party payor programs.                

LEGISLATION/LITIGATION.  From time to time, various legislative initiatives 
are proposed in the United States and abroad which may have a negative impact on
certain of the companies represented in the trust.  In addition, litigation     
regarding any of the issuers of the securities or of the industries represented 
by these issuers may negatively impact the share prices of these securities.  No
one can predict what impact any pending or threatened litigation will have on   
the share prices of the securities.                                             

LIQUIDITY RISK is the risk that the value of a security will fall if trading
in the security is limited or absent.  No one can guarantee that a liquid       
trading market will exist for any security.                                     

NO FDIC GUARANTEE.  An investment in the trust is not a deposit of any bank 
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or
any other government agency.                                                    

HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

The following table compares hypothetical performance information for the   
strategy employed by the trust and the actual performance of the DJIA(SM) in    
each of the years listed below (and as of the most recent month).  These        
hypothetical returns should not be used to predict future performance of the    
trust.  Returns from the trust will differ from the hypothetical strategy       
returns for several reasons, such as:                                           

 *  total return figures shown do not reflect commissions paid by the trust on
the purchase of securities or taxes you will incur;                   

*  strategy returns are for calendar years (and through the most recent     
month), while trusts begin and end on various dates;                  

*  the trust has a scheduled term longer than one year;                     

  *  the trust may not be fully invested at all times or equally weighted in all
stocks comprising its strategy; and                                   

 *  the trust often purchases or sells securities at prices different from the
closing prices used in buying and selling units.                      

You should note that the trust is not designed to parallel movements in any 
index, and it is not expected that it will do so.  In fact, the trust's strategy
underperformed its comparative index in certain years and we cannot guarantee   
that the trust will outperform its related index

Past performance is no guarantee of future results.  Past performance of the
strategy stocks is hypothetical (not any actual trust), is shown for            
illustrative purposes only and is not intended to indicate the future           
performance of any investment, including the trust.  The strategy stocks for a  
given year consist of the common stocks selected by applying the strategy as of 
the beginning of the period (and not the date the trust actually sells units).  
Total return represents the sum of the change in market value of each group of  
stocks between the first and last trading day of a period plus the total        
dividends paid on each group of stocks during such period divided by the opening
market value of each group of stocks as of the first trading day of a period.   
Total return figures assume that all dividends are reinvested semi-annually.    
Strategy figures reflect the deduction of sales charges and expenses but have   
not been reduced by estimated brokerage commissions paid by the trust in        
acquiring securities or any taxes incurred by investors.                        

The trust's strategy begins with the DJIA(SM).  The DJIA(SM) consists of 30 
U.S. stocks chosen by the editors of The Wall Street Journal as being           
representative of the broad market and of American industry.  Changes in the    
component stocks of the DJIA(SM) are made entirely by the editors of The Wall   
Street Journal without consulting the companies, the stock exchange or any      
official agency.  For the sake of continuity, changes are made rarely.

 HOW THE TRUST WORKS

YOUR TRUST.  Your trust is a unit investment trust registered under the     
Investment Company Act of 1940.  We created the trust under a trust agreement   
between Advisors Asset Management, Inc. (as depositor/sponsor, evaluator and    
supervisor) and The Bank of New York Mellon (as trustee).  To create your trust,
we deposited securities with the trustee (or contracts to purchase securities   
along with an irrevocable letter of credit or other consideration to pay for the
securities).  In exchange, the trustee delivered units of                       

14     Understanding Your Investment                                            

P-->48716th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�16th
your trust to us.  Each unit represents an undivided interest in the assets of  
your trust.  These units remain outstanding until redeemed or until your trust  
terminates.  At the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the trust's         
inception date, the number of units may be adjusted so that the public offering 
price per unit equals $10.  The number of units and fractional interest of each 
unit in the trust will increase or decrease to the extent of any adjustment.    

 CHANGING YOUR PORTFOLIO.  Your trust is not a managed fund.  Unlike a managed
fund, we designed your portfolio to remain relatively fixed.  Your trust will   
generally buy and sell securities:                                              

*  to pay expenses,                                                         

*  to issue additional units or redeem units,                               

*  in limited circumstances to protect the trust,                           

*  as permitted by the trust agreement.                                     

When your trust sells securities, the composition and diversity of the      
securities in the portfolio may be altered.  If a public tender offer has been  
made for a security or a merger, acquisition or similar transaction has been    
announced affecting a security, the trustee may either sell the security or     
accept a tender offer if the supervisor determines that the action is in the    
best interest of unitholders.  The trustee will distribute any cash proceeds to 
unitholders.  If your trust receives securities or other property, it will      
either hold the securities or property in the portfolio or sell the securities  
or property and distribute the proceeds.                                        

We will increase the size of your trust as we sell units.  When we create   
additional units, we will seek to replicate the existing portfolio.  When your  
trust buys securities, it may pay brokerage or other acquisition fees.  You     
could experience a dilution of your investment because of these fees and        
fluctuations in security prices between the time we create units and the time   
your trust buys the securities.  When your trust buys or sells securities, we   
may direct that it place orders with and pay brokerage commissions to brokers   
that sell units or are affiliated with us, your trust or the trustee.           

 Pursuant to an exemptive order, your trust may be able to purchase securities
from other trusts that we sponsor when we create additional units.  Your trust  
may also be able to sell securities to other trusts that we sponsor to satisfy  
unit redemption, pay deferred sales charges or expenses, in connection with     
periodic tax compliance or in connection with the termination of your trust.    
The exemption may enable each trust to eliminate commission costs on these      
transactions.  The price for those securities will be the closing price on the  
sale date on the exchange where the securities are principally traded as        
certified by us to the trustee.                                                 

AMENDING THE TRUST AGREEMENT.  The sponsor and the trustee can change the   
trust agreement without your consent to correct any provision that may be       
defective or to make other provisions that will not materially adversely affect 
your interest (as determined by the sponsor and the trustee).  We cannot change 
this agreement to reduce your interest in your trust without your consent.      
Investors owning two-thirds of the units in your trust may vote to change this  
agreement.                                                                      

 TERMINATION OF YOUR TRUST.  Your trust will terminate on the termination date
set forth under "Essential Information" in the "Investment Summary" section of  
this prospectus.  The trustee may terminate your trust early if the value of the
trust is less than 40% of the

original value of the securities in the trust at the time of deposit.  At this  
size, the expenses of your trust may create an undue burden on your investment. 
Investors owning two-thirds of the units in your trust may also vote to         
terminate the trust early.  The trustee will liquidate the trust in the event   
that a sufficient number of units not yet sold to the public are tendered for   
redemption so that the net worth of the trust would be reduced to less than 40% 
of the value of the securities at the time they were deposited in the trust.  If
this happens, we will refund any sales charge that you paid.                    

The trustee will notify you of any termination and sell any remaining       
securities.  The trustee will send your final distribution to you within a      
reasonable time following liquidation of all the securities after deducting     
final expenses.  Your termination distribution may be less than the price you   
originally paid for your units.                                                 

 THE SPONSOR.  The sponsor of the trust is Advisors Asset Management, Inc.  We
are a broker-dealer specializing in providing trading and support services to   
broker-dealers, registered representatives, investment advisers and other       
financial professionals.  Our headquarters are located at 18925 Base Camp Road, 
Monument, Colorado 80132.  You can contact our unit investment trust division at
8100 East 22nd Street North, Suite 900B, Wichita, Kansas 67226-2309 or by using 
the contacts listed on the back cover of this prospectus.  AAM is a registered  
broker-dealer and investment adviser, a member of FINRA and Securities Investor 
Protection Corporation (SIPC) and a registrant of the Municipal Securities      
Rulemaking Board (MSRB).  If we fail to or cannot perform our duties as sponsor 
or become bankrupt, the trustee may replace us, continue to operate your trust  
without a sponsor, or terminate your trust.                                     

We and your trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring our employees who 
have access to information on trust transactions to report personal securities  
transactions.  The purpose of the code is to avoid potential conflicts of       
interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct with respect to your     
trust.                                                                          

The sponsor or an affiliate may use the list of securities in the trust in  
its independent capacity (which may include acting as an investment adviser or  
broker-dealer) and distribute this information to various individuals and       
entities.  The sponsor or an affiliate may recommend or effect transactions in  
the securities.  This may also have an impact on the price your trust pays for  
the securities and the price received upon unit redemption or trust termination.
The sponsor may act as agent or principal in connection with the purchase and   
sale of securities, including those held by the trust, and may act as a         
specialist market maker in the securities.  The sponsor may also issue reports  
and make recommendations on the securities in the trust.  The sponsor or an     
affiliate may have participated in a public offering of one or more of the      
securities in the trust.  The sponsor, an affiliate or their employees may have 
a long or short position in these securities or related securities.  An officer,
director or employee of the sponsor or an affiliate may be an officer or        
director for the issuers of the securities.                                     

THE TRUSTEE.  The Bank of New York Mellon is the trustee of your trust.  Its
principal unit investment trust division office is located at 2 Hanson Place,   
12th Floor, Brooklyn, New York 11217.  You can contact the trustee by calling   
the telephone number on the back cover of this prospectus or by writing to its  
unit investment trust office.  We may remove and replace the trustee in some    
cases without your

consent.  The trustee may also resign by notifying us and investors.            

HOW WE DISTRIBUTE UNITS.  We sell units to the public through broker-dealers
and other firms.  We pay part of the sales fee to these distribution firms when 
they sell units.  During the initial offering period, the distribution fee (the 
broker-dealer concession or agency commission) for broker-dealers and other     
firms is as follows:                                                            

TRANSACTION             CONCESSION OR                             
AMOUNT:             AGENCY COMMISSION:                        
------------------------------------------                            

Less than $50,000             2.25%                                   
$50,000 - $99,999             2.00                                    
$100,000 - $249,999           1.75                                    
$250,000 - $499,999           1.50                                    
$500,000 - $999,999           1.25

We apply these concessions or agency commissions as a percent of the public 
offering price per unit at the time of the transaction.  We also apply the      
different levels on a unit basis using a $10 unit equivalent.  The broker-dealer
concession or agency commission is 65% of the sales fee for secondary market    
sales.  For transactions involving unitholders of other unit investment trusts  
who use their redemption or termination proceeds to purchase units of the trust,
the distribution fee is 1.30% of the public offering price per unit.  No        
distribution fee is paid to broker-dealers or other selling firms in connection 
with unit sales in Fee Accounts subject to a Wrap Fee.  In addition to the      
foregoing, we will pay UBS an additional concession within a reasonable time    
following the initial offering period equal to 0.15% of the public offering     
price per unit sold by UBS during the initial offering period, excluding units  
sold to Fee Accounts subject to a Wrap Fee.                                     

Broker-dealers and other firms that sell units of certain unit investment   
trusts for which AAM acts as sponsor are eligible to receive additional         
compensation for volume sales.  The sponsor offers two separate volume          
concession structures for certain trusts that are referred to as "Volume        
Concession A" and "Volume Concession B."  The trust offered in this prospectus  
is a Volume Concession A trust.  Broker-dealers and other firms that sell units 
of any Volume Concession A trust are eligible to receive the additional         
compensation described below.  Such payments will be in addition to the regular 
concessions paid to firms as set forth in the applicable trust's prospectus.    
The additional concession is based on total initial offering period sales of all
Volume Concession A trusts during a calendar quarter as set forth in the        
following table:

This volume concession will be paid on units of all Volume Concession A     
trusts sold in the initial offering period, except as described below.  For a   
trust to be eligible for this additional Volume Concession A compensation for   
calendar quarter sales, the trust's prospectus must include disclosure related  
to this additional Volume Concession A compensation; a trust is not eligible for
this additional Volume Concession A compensation

if the prospectus for such trust does not include disclosure related to this    
additional Volume Concession A compensation.  Broker-dealer firms will not      
receive additional compensation unless they sell at least $5.0 million of units 
of Volume Concession A trusts during a calendar quarter.  For example, if a firm
sells $4.5 million of units of Volume Concession A trusts in the initial        
offering period during a calendar quarter, the firm will not receive any        
additional compensation with respect to such trusts.  Once a firm reaches a     
particular breakpoint during a quarter, the firm will receive the stated volume 
concession on all initial offering period sales of Volume Concession A trusts   
during the applicable quarter.  For example, if a firm sells $7.5 million of    
units of Volume Concession A trusts in the initial offering period during a     
calendar quarter, the firm will receive additional compensation of 0.05% of $7.5
million and if a firm sells $12.5 million of units of Volume Concession A trusts
in the initial offering period during a calendar quarter, the firm will receive 
additional compensation of 0.075% of $12.5 million.                             

In addition, dealer firms will not receive volume concessions on the sale of
units which are not subject to a transactional sales charge.  However, such     
sales will be included in determining whether a firm has met the sales level    
breakpoints for volume concessions.  Secondary market sales of all unit trusts  
are excluded for purposes of these volume concessions.  We will pay these       
amounts out of our own assets within a reasonable time following each calendar  
quarter.                                                                        

Any sales fee discount is borne by the broker-dealer or selling firm out of 
the distribution fee.  We reserve the right to change the amount of concessions 
or agency commissions from time to time.                                        

We currently provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits,        
additional compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell units of this   
trust and our other products.  This compensation is intended to result in       
additional sales of our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial 
advisors for past sales.  A number of factors are considered in determining     
whether to pay these additional amounts.  Such factors may include, but are not 
limited to, the level or type of services provided by the intermediary, the     
level or expected level of sales of our products by the intermediary or its     
agents, the placing of our products on a preferred or recommended product list  
and access to an intermediary's personnel.  We may make these payments for      
marketing, promotional or related expenses, including, but not limited to,      
expenses of entertaining retail customers and financial advisors, advertising,  
sponsorship of events or seminars, obtaining information about the breakdown of 
unit sales among an intermediary's representations or offices, obtaining shelf  
space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities designed to promote the sale
of our products.  We make such payments to a substantial majority of            
intermediaries that sell our products.  We may also make certain payments to, or
on behalf of, intermediaries to defray a portion of their costs incurred for the
purpose of facilitating unit sales, such as the costs of developing or          
purchasing trading systems to process unit trades.  Payments of such additional 
compensation described in this paragraph and the volume concessions described   
above, some of which may be characterized as "revenue sharing," may create an   
incentive for financial intermediaries and their agents to sell or recommend our
products, including this trust, over other products.  These arrangements will   
not change the price you pay for your units.                                    

 We generally register units for sale in various states in the U.S.  We do not
register units for

sale in any foreign country.  This prospectus does not constitute an offer of   
units in any state or country where units cannot be offered or sold lawfully.   
We may reject any order for units in whole or in part.                          

We may gain or lose money when we hold units in the primary or secondary    
market due to fluctuations in unit prices.  The gain or loss is equal to the    
difference between the price we pay for units and the price at which we sell or 
redeem them.  We may also gain or lose money when we deposit securities to      
create units.  The amount of our profit or loss on the initial deposit of       
securities into the trust is shown in the "Notes to Portfolio."
 TAXES

 This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax consequences
of owning units of the trust.  This section is current as of the date of this   
prospectus.  Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these summaries
do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers.  For example,     
these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a           
corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, or other investor with special 
circumstances.  In addition, this section does not describe your state, local or
foreign tax consequences.                                                       

 This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice and opinion of
counsel to the sponsor.  The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any   
conclusions set forth in this section.  In addition, our counsel was not asked  
to review, and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income  
tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust.  This may not be      
sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal   
tax law.                                                                        

As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual     
circumstances from your own tax advisor.                                        

ASSETS OF THE TRUST.  The trust is expected to hold shares of stock in      
corporations (the "Stocks") that are treated as equity for federal income tax   
purposes.  It is possible that the trust will also hold other assets, including 
assets that are treated differently for federal income tax purposes from those  
described above, in which case you will have federal income tax consequences    
different from or in addition to those described in this section.  All of the   
assets held by the trust constitute the "Trust Assets."  Neither our counsel nor
we have analyzed the proper federal income tax treatment of the Trust Assets and
thus neither our counsel nor we have reached a conclusion regarding the federal 
income tax treatment of the Trust Assets.                                       

TRUST STATUS.  If the trust is at all times operated in accordance with the 
documents establishing the trust and certain requirements of federal income tax 
law are met, the trust will not be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax
purposes.  As a unit owner, you will be treated as the owner of a pro rata      
portion of each of the Trust Assets, and as such you will be considered to have 
received a pro rata share of income (e.g., dividends and capital gains, if any) 
from each Trust Asset when such income would be considered to be received by you
if you directly owned the Trust Assets.  This is true even if you elect to have 
your distributions reinvested into additional units.  In addition, the income   
from Trust Assets that you must take into account for federal income tax        
purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay sales charges or trust expenses. 
Under the "Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010," income from   
the trust may also be subject to a new 3.8 percent "medicare tax"  imposed for  
taxable years beginning after 2012.  This tax

will generally apply to your net investment income if your adjusted gross income
exceeds certain threshold amounts, which are $250,000 in the case of married    
couples filing joint returns and $200,000 in the case of single individuals.    

YOUR TAX BASIS AND INCOME OR LOSS UPON DISPOSITION.  If your trust disposes 
of Trust Assets, you will generally recognize gain or loss.  If you dispose of  
your units or redeem your units for cash, you will also generally recognize gain
or loss.  To determine the amount of this gain or loss, you must subtract your  
tax basis in the related Trust Assets from your share of the total amount       
received in the transaction.  You can generally determine your initial tax basis
in each Trust Asset by apportioning the cost of your units, including sales     
charges, among the Trust Assets ratably according to their values on the date   
you acquire your units.  In certain circumstances, however, you may have to     
adjust your tax basis after you acquire your units (for example, in the case of 
certain dividends that exceed a corporation's accumulated earnings and profits, 
as discussed below).                                                            

If you are an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net     
capital gain is generally 15% (generally 0% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and
15% tax brackets).  These capital gains rates are generally effective for       
taxable years beginning before January 1, 2013.  For later periods, if you are  
an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is    
generally 20% (10% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax brackets).  The 
20% rate is reduced to 18% for net capital gains from most property acquired    
after December 31, 2000 with a holding period of more than five years, and the  
10% rate is reduced to 8% for net capital gains from most property (regardless  
of when acquired) with a holding period of more than five years.                

Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term     
capital loss for the taxable year.  Capital gain or loss is long-term if the    
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the     
holding period for the asset is one year or less.  You must exclude the date you
purchase your units to determine your holding period.  The tax rates for capital
gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as  
for ordinary income.  The Internal Revenue Code, however, treats certain capital
gains as ordinary income in special situations.                                 

 DIVIDENDS FROM STOCKS.  Certain dividends received with respect to the Stocks
may qualify to be taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain (as    
discussed above), provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied.   
These special rules relating to the taxation of dividends at capital gains rates
generally apply to taxable years beginning before January 1, 2013.              

 DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION.  Generally, a domestic corporation owning units
in a trust may be eligible for the dividends received deduction with respect to 
such unit owner's pro rata portion of certain types of dividends received by the
trust.  However, a corporation generally will not be entitled to the dividends  
received deduction with respect to dividends from most foreign corporations.    

IN-KIND DISTRIBUTIONS.  Under certain circumstances as described in this    
prospectus, you may request an In-Kind Distribution of Trust Assets when you    
redeem your units or at your trust's termination.  By electing to receive an In-
Kind Distribution, you will receive Trust Assets plus, possibly, cash.  You will
not recognize gain or loss if you only receive whole Trust Assets in exchange   
for the identical amount of your pro rata portion of the same Trust Assets held 
by your trust.

P-->48722nd�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�22nd
However, if you also receive cash in exchange for a Trust Asset or a fractional 
portion of a Trust Asset, you will generally recognize gain or loss based on the
difference between the amount of cash you receive and your tax basis in such    
Trust Asset or fractional portion.                                              

ROLLOVERS AND EXCHANGES.  If you elect to have your proceeds from your trust
rolled over into a future trust, it is considered a sale for federal income tax 
purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain, and any    
loss will be treated as a capital loss.  However, any loss you incur in         
connection with the exchange of your units of your trust for units of the next  
series will generally be disallowed with respect to this deemed sale and        
subsequent deemed repurchase, to the extent the two trusts have substantially   
identical Trust Assets under the wash sale provisions of the Internal Revenue   
Code.                                                                           

LIMITATIONS ON THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF TRUST EXPENSES.  Generally, for federal 
income tax purposes, you must take into account your full pro rata share of your
trust's income, even if some of that income is used to pay trust expenses.  You 
may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by your trust to the same   
extent as if you directly paid the expense.  You may be required to treat some  
or all of the expenses of your trust as miscellaneous itemized deductions.      
Individuals may only deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions to the    
extent they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income.                                 

FOREIGN INVESTORS, TAXES AND INVESTMENTS.  Distributions by your trust that 
are treated as U.S. source income (e.g., dividends received on Stocks of        
domestic corporations) will generally be subject to U.S. income taxation and    
withholding in the case of Units held by nonresident alien individuals, foreign 
corporations or other non-U.S. persons, subject to any applicable treaty.  If   
you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other than a U.S. citizen or      
resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or trust), you may not be   
subject to U.S. federal income taxes, including withholding taxes, on some or   
all of the income from your trust or on any gain from the sale or redemption of 
your Units, provided that certain conditions are met.  You should consult your  
tax advisor with respect to the conditions you must meet in order to be exempt  
for U.S. tax purposes.  Distributions after December 31, 2012 may be subject to 
a U.S. withholding tax of 30% in the case of distributions to (i) certain non-  
U.S. financial institutions that have not entered into an agreement with the    
U.S. Treasury to collect and disclose certain information and (ii) certain other
non-U.S. entities that do not provide certain certifications and information    
about the entity's U.S. owners.  You should also consult your tax advisor with  
respect to other U.S. tax withholding and reporting requirements.               

 Some distributions by your trust may be subject to foreign withholding taxes.
Any income withheld will still be treated as income to you.  Under the grantor  
trust rules, you are considered to have paid directly your share of any foreign 
taxes that are paid.  Therefore, for U.S. tax purposes, you may be entitled to a
foreign tax credit or deduction for those foreign taxes.                        

If any U.S. investor is treated as owning directly or indirectly 10 percent 
or more of the combined voting power of the stock of a foreign corporation, and 
all U.S. shareholders of that corporation collectively own more than 50 percent 
of the vote or value of the stock of that corporation, the foreign corporation  
may be treated as a controlled foreign corporation (CFC).  If you own 10 percent
or more of a CFC (through the trust and in combination with your other          
investments) you

P-->48723rd�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�23rd
will be required to include certain types of the CFC's income in your taxable   
income for federal income tax purposes whether or not such income is distributed
to the trust or to you.                                                         

A foreign corporation will generally be treated as a passive foreign        
investment company (PFIC) if 75 percent or more of its income is passive income 
or if 50 percent or more of its assets are held to produce passive income.  If  
the trust purchases shares in a PFIC, you may be subject to U.S. federal income 
tax on a portion of certain distributions or on gains from the disposition of   
such shares at rates that were applicable in prior years and any gain may be    
recharacterized as ordinary income that is not eligible for the lower net       
capital gains tax rate.  Additional charges in the nature of interest may also  
be imposed on you.  Certain elections may be available with respect to PFICs    
that would limit these consequences.  However, these elections would require you
to include certain income of the PFIC in your taxable income even if not        
distributed to the trust or to you, or require you to annually recognize as     
ordinary income any increase in the value of the shares of the PFIC, thus       
requiring you to recognize income for federal income tax purposes in excess of  
your actual distributions from PFICs and proceeds from dispositions of PFIC     
stock during a particular year.  Dividends paid by PFICs will not be eligible to
be taxed at the net capital gains tax rate.                                     

NEW YORK TAX STATUS.  Under the existing income tax laws of the State and   
City of New York, your trust will not be taxed as a corporation subject to the  
New York state franchise tax or the New York City general corporation tax.  You 
should consult your tax advisor regarding potential foreign, state or local     
taxation with respect to your units.                                            

EXPENSES

Your trust will pay various expenses to conduct its operations.  The "Fees
and Expenses" section of the "Investment Summary" in this prospectus shows the  
estimated amount of these expenses.                                             

The sponsor will receive a fee from your trust for creating and developing  
the trust, including determining the trust's objectives, policies, composition  
and size, selecting service providers and information services and for providing
other similar administrative and ministerial functions.  This "creation and     
development fee" is a charge of $0.025 per unit.  The trustee will deduct this  
amount from your trust's assets as of the close of the initial offering period. 
No portion of this fee is applied to the payment of distribution expenses or as 
compensation for sales efforts.  This fee will not be deducted from proceeds    
received upon a repurchase, redemption or exchange of units before the close of 
the initial public offering period.                                             

Your trust will pay a fee to the trustee for its services.  The trustee also
benefits when it holds cash for your trust in non-interest bearing accounts.    
Your trust will reimburse us as supervisor, evaluator and sponsor for providing 
portfolio supervisory services, for evaluating your portfolio and for providing 
bookkeeping and administrative services.  Our reimbursements may exceed the     
costs of the services we provide to your trust but will not exceed the costs of 
services provided to all of our unit investment trusts in any calendar year.    
All of these fees may adjust for inflation without your approval.               

Your trust will also pay its general operating expenses.  Your trust may pay
expenses such as trustee expenses (including legal and auditing expenses),      
various governmental charges, fees for extraordinary trustee services, costs of 
taking

action to protect your trust, costs of indemnifying the trustee and the sponsor,
legal fees and expenses, expenses incurred in contacting you and costs incurred 
to reimburse the trustee for advancing funds to meet distributions.  Your trust 
will pay a license fee for the use of certain service marks, trademarks and/or  
trade names of Dow Jones.  Your trust may pay the costs of updating its         
registration statement each year.  The trustee will generally pay trust expenses
from distributions received on the securities but in some cases may sell        
securities to pay trust expenses.

ADVISORS DISCIPLINED TRUST 701                                                  

We have audited the accompanying statement of financial condition, including    
the trust portfolio on page 4, of Advisors Disciplined Trust 701, as of         
May 17, 2011, the initial date of deposit.  The statement of financial          
condition is the responsibility of the trust's sponsor.  Our responsibility is  
to express an opinion on this statement of financial condition based on our     
audit.                                                                          

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards of the Public      
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require    
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the statement of financial condition is free of material misstatement.  The     
trust is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its   
internal control over financial reporting.  Our audit included consideration of 
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit        
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the trust's internal control over 
financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also   
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and        
disclosures in the statement of financial condition, assessing the accounting   
principles used and significant estimates made by the sponsor, as well as       
evaluating the overall statement of financial condition presentation.  Our      
procedures included confirmation with The Bank of New York Mellon, trustee, of  
cash or an irrevocable letter of credit deposited for the purchase of securities
as shown in the statement of financial condition as of May 17, 2011.  We        
believe that our audit of the statement of financial condition provides a       
reasonable basis for our opinion.                                               

In our opinion, the statement of financial condition referred to above presents 
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Advisors Disciplined
Trust 701 as of May 17, 2011, in conformity with accounting principles          
generally accepted in the United States of America.

     securities in the trust represented by purchase contracts.                                          
(3)  A portion of the public offering price represents an amount sufficient to                           
     pay for all or a portion of the costs incurred in establishing and offering                         
     the trust.  These costs have been estimated at $0.05 per unit for the                               
     trust.  A distribution will be made as of the earlier of the close of the                           
     initial offering period or six months following the trust's inception date                          
     to an account maintained by the trustee from which this obligation of the                           
     investors will be satisfied.  To the extent the actual organization costs                           
     are greater than the estimated amount, only the estimated organization                              
     costs added to the public offering price will be reimbursed to the sponsor                          
     and deducted from the assets of the trust.                                                          
(4)  The total sales fee consists of an initial sales fee, a deferred sales fee                          
     and a creation & development fee.  The initial sales fee is equal to the                            
     difference between the maximum sales fee and the sum of the remaining                               
     deferred sales fee and the total creation & development fee.  On the                                
     inception date, the total sales fee is 2.95% of the public offering price                           
     per unit.  The deferred sales fee is equal to $0.170 per unit and the                               
     creation & development fee is equal to $0.025 per unit.                                             
(5)  The aggregate cost to investors includes the applicable sales fee assuming                          
     no reduction of sales fees.

GENERAL INFORMATION                                                             

  Each trust is one of a series of separate unit investment trusts created
under the name Advisors Disciplined Trust and registered under the Investment   
Company Act of 1940.  Each trust was created as a common law trust on the       
inception date described in the prospectus under the laws of the state of       
New York.  Each trust was created under a trust agreement among Advisors Asset  
Management, Inc. (as sponsor, evaluator and supervisor) and The Bank of New York
Mellon (as trustee).                                                            

When your trust was created, the sponsor delivered to the trustee     
securities or contracts for the purchase thereof for deposit in the trust and   
the trustee delivered to the sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of  
units of the trust.  At the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the trust's 
inception date, the number of units may be adjusted so that the public offering 
price per unit equals $10.  The number of units, fractional interest of each    
unit in the trust and estimated interest distributions per unit will increase or
decrease to the extent of any adjustment.  Additional units of each trust may be
issued from time to time by depositing in the trust additional securities (or   
contracts for the purchase thereof together with cash or irrevocable letters of 
credit) or cash (including a letter of credit or the equivalent) with           
instructions to purchase additional securities.  As additional units are issued 
by a trust as a result of the deposit of additional securities by the sponsor,  
the aggregate value of the securities in the trust will be increased and the    
fractional undivided interest in the trust represented by each unit will be     
decreased.  The sponsor may continue to make additional deposits of securities  
into a trust, provided that such additional deposits will be in amounts, which  
will generally maintain the existing relationship among the shares of the       
securities in such trust.  Thus, although additional units will be issued, each 
unit will generally continue to represent the same number of shares of each     
security.  If the sponsor deposits cash to purchase additional securities,      
existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a 
reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of  
the securities between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the          
securities and because the trust will pay any associated brokerage fees.        

The trustee has not participated in the selection of the securities   
deposited in the trust and has no responsibility for the composition of the     
trust portfolio.                                                                

     Each unit initially offered represents an undivided interest in the related
trust.  To the extent that any units are redeemed by the trustee or additional  
units are issued as a result of additional securities being deposited by the    
sponsor, the fractional undivided interest in a trust represented by each       
unredeemed unit will increase or decrease accordingly, although the actual      
interest in such trust represented by such fraction will remain unchanged.      
Units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender to the trustee by      
unitholders, which may include the sponsor, or until the termination of the     
trust agreement.                                                                

A trust consists of (a) the securities listed under "Portfolio" in the
prospectus as may continue to be held from time to time in the trust, (b) any   
additional securities acquired and held by the trust pursuant to the provisions 
of the trust agreement and (c) any cash held in the accounts of the trust.      
Neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any failure  
in any of the securities.  However, should any contract for the purchase of any 
of the securities initially

deposited in a trust fail, the sponsor will, unless substantially all of the    
moneys held in the trust to cover such purchase are reinvested in substitute    
securities in accordance with the trust agreement, refund the cash and sales fee
attributable to such failed contract to all unitholders on the next distribution
date.                                                                           

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES                                               

The trust seeks to provide total return, through dividend income and  
capital appreciation, by investing in a portfolio consisting of the 10 stocks   
with the highest dividend yield chosen from among the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average(SM) ("DJIA(SM)") as of the trust's selection date.  There is,
of course, no guarantee that the trust will achieve its objective.  The         
prospectus provides additional information regarding the trust's objective and  
investment strategy.                                                            

     The trust is a unit investment trust and is not an "actively managed" fund.
Traditional methods of investment management for a managed fund typically       
involve frequent changes in a portfolio of securities on the basis of economic, 
financial and market analysis.  The portfolio of a trust, however, will not be  
actively managed and therefore the adverse financial condition of an issuer will
not necessarily require the sale of its securities from a portfolio.            

     The sponsor may not alter the portfolio of a trust by the purchase, sale or
substitution of securities, except in special circumstances as provided in the  
trust agreement.  Thus, the assets of a trust will generally remain unchanged   
under normal circumstances.  The trust agreement provides that the sponsor may  
(but need not) direct the trustee to dispose of a security in certain events    
such as the issuer having defaulted on the payment on any of its outstanding    
obligations or the price of a security has declined to such an extent or other  
such credit factors exist so that in the opinion of the supervisor the retention
of such securities would be detrimental to the trust.  If a public tender offer 
has been made for a security or a merger or acquisition has been announced      
affecting a security, the trustee may either sell the security or accept a      
tender offer for cash if the supervisor determines that the sale or tender is in
the best interest of unitholders.  The trustee will distribute any excess cash  
proceeds to unitholders.  Pursuant to the trust agreement and with limited      
exceptions, the trustee may sell any securities or other properties acquired in 
exchange for securities such as those acquired in connection with a merger or   
other transaction.  If offered such new or exchanged securities or property     
other than cash, trustee shall generally reject the offer.  However, in the     
event such securities or property are nonetheless acquired by the trust, they   
may be accepted for deposit in a trust and either sold by the trustee or held in
a trust pursuant to the direction of the sponsor.                               

     The trustee may sell securities, designated by the supervisor, from a trust
for the purpose of redeeming units of such trust tendered for redemption and the
payment of expenses.                                                            

   Proceeds from the sale of securities (or any securities or other property
received by a trust in exchange for securities) are credited to the Capital     
Account of a trust for distribution to unitholders or to meet redemptions.      
Except for failed securities and as provided herein, in the prospectus or in the
trust agreement, the acquisition by a trust of any securities other than the    
portfolio securities is prohibited.

P-->48730th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�30th
     Because certain of the securities in certain of the trusts may from time to
time under certain circumstances be sold or otherwise liquidated and because the
proceeds from such events will be distributed to unitholders and will not be    
reinvested, no assurance can be given that a trust will retain for any length of
time its present size and composition.  Neither the sponsor nor the trustee     
shall be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in any security.  
In the event of a failure to deliver any security that has been purchased for a 
trust under a contract ("Failed Securities"), the sponsor is authorized under   
the trust agreement to direct the trustee to acquire other securities           
("Replacement Securities") to make up the original corpus of such trust.        

    The Replacement Securities must be purchased within 20 days after delivery
of the notice that a contract to deliver a security will not be honored and the 
purchase price may not exceed the amount of funds reserved for the purchase of  
the Failed Securities.  The Replacement Securities must be equity securities of 
the type selected for the trust and must not adversely affect the federal income
tax status of the trust.  Whenever a Replacement Security is acquired for a     
trust, the trustee shall notify all unitholders of the trust of the acquisition 
of the Replacement Security and shall, on the next monthly distribution date    
which is more than 30 days thereafter, make a pro rata distribution of the      
amount, if any, by which the cost to the trust of the Failed Security exceeded  
the cost of the Replacement Security.  Once all of the securities in a trust are
acquired, the trustee will have no power to vary the investments of the trust,  
i.e., the trustee will have no managerial power to take advantage of market     
variations to improve a unitholder's investment.                                

    If the right of limited substitution described in the preceding paragraphs
is not utilized to acquire Replacement Securities in the event of a failed      
contract, the sponsor will refund the sales fee attributable to such Failed     
Securities to all unitholders of the trust and the trustee will distribute the  
cash attributable to such Failed Securities not more than 30 days after the date
on which the trustee would have been required to purchase a Replacement         
Security.  In addition, unitholders should be aware that, at the time of receipt
of such cash, they may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in other securities
at a return equal to or in excess of the return which such proceeds would have  
earned for unitholders of such trust.                                           

  In the event that a Replacement Security is not acquired by a trust, the
income for such trust may be reduced.                                           

   To the best of the sponsor's knowledge, there is no litigation pending as
of the trust's inception in respect of any security that might reasonably be    
expected to have a material adverse effect on the trust.  At any time after the 
trust's inception, litigation may be instituted on a variety of grounds with    
respect to the securities.  The sponsor is unable to predict whether any such   
litigation may be instituted, or if instituted, whether such litigation might   
have a material adverse effect on the trust.  The sponsor and the trustee shall 
not be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in any security.    

RISK FACTORS                                                                    

  MARKET RISK.  Because the trust invests in stocks, you should understand
the risks of investing in stocks before purchasing units.  These risks include  
the risk that the financial condition of the company or the general condition of
the stock market may worsen and the value

P-->48731st�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�31st
of the stocks (and therefore units) will fall.  Stocks are especially           
susceptible to general stock market movements.  The value of stocks often rises 
or falls rapidly and unpredictably as market confidence and perceptions of      
companies change.  These perceptions are based on factors including expectations
regarding government economic policies, inflation, interest rates, economic     
expansion or contraction, political climates and economic or banking crises.    
The value of units will fluctuate with the value of the stocks in the trust and 
may be more or less than the price you originally paid for your units.  As with 
any investment, we cannot guarantee that the performance of the trust will be   
positive over any period of time.  Because the trust is unmanaged, the Trustee  
will not sell stocks in response to market fluctuations as is common in managed 
investments.  In addition, because some trusts hold a relatively small number of
stocks, you may encounter greater market risk than in a more diversified        
investment.                                                                     

   DIVIDENDS.  Stocks represent ownership interests in a company and are not
obligations of the company.  Common stockholders have a right to receive        
payments from the company that is subordinate to the rights of creditors,       
bondholders or preferred stockholders of the company.  This means that common   
stockholders have a right to receive dividends only if a company's board of     
directors declares a dividend and the company has provided for payment of all of
its creditors, bondholders and preferred stockholders.  If a company issues     
additional debt securities or preferred stock, the owners of these securities   
will have a claim against the company's assets before common stockholders if the
company declares bankruptcy or liquidates its assets even though the common     
stock was issued first.  As a result, the company may be less willing or able to
declare or pay dividends on its common stock.                                   

HEALTH CARE ISSUERS. The trust may invest significantly in health care
companies.  Healthcare companies involved in advanced medical devices and       
instruments, drugs and biotech, managed care, hospital management/health        
services and medical supplies have potential risks unique to their sector of the
healthcare field.  These companies are subject to governmental regulation of    
their products and services, a factor which could have a significant and        
possibly unfavorable effect on the price and availability of such products or   
services.  Furthermore, such companies face the risk of increasing competition  
from new products or services, generic drug sales, termination of patent        
protection for drug or medical supply products and the risk that technological  
advances will render their products obsolete.  The research and development     
costs of bringing a drug to market are substantial, and include lengthy         
governmental review processes with no guarantee that the product will ever come 
to market.  Many of these companies may have losses and not offer certain       
products for several years.  Such companies may also have persistent losses     
during a new product's transition from development to production, and revenue   
patterns may be erratic.  In addition, healthcare facility operators may be     
affected by events and conditions including, among other things, demand for     
services, the ability of the facility to provide the services required,         
physicians' confidence in the facility, management capabilities, competition    
with other hospitals, efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit    
rates, legislation establishing state rate-setting agencies, expenses,          
government regulation, the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice      
insurance and the termination or restriction of governmental financial          
assistance, including that associated with Medicare, Medicaid and other similar 
third-party payor programs.

   Legislative proposals concerning healthcare are proposed in Congress from
time to time.  These proposals span a wide range of topics, including cost and  
price controls (which might include a freeze on the prices of prescription      
drugs), national health insurance incentives for competition in the provision of
healthcare services, tax incentives and penalties related to healthcare         
insurance premiums and promotion of prepaid healthcare plans.  The sponsor is   
unable to predict the effect of any of these proposals, if enacted, on the      
issuers of securities in your trust.                                            

ADDITIONAL DEPOSITS.  The trust agreement authorizes the sponsor to   
increase the size of a trust and the number of units thereof by the deposit of  
additional securities, or cash (including a letter of credit or the equivalent) 
with instructions to purchase additional securities, in such trust and the      
issuance of a corresponding number of additional units.  In connection with     
these deposits, existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their   
investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations 
in the prices of the securities between the time of the deposit and the purchase
of the securities and because a trust will pay the associated brokerage fees and
other acquisition costs.                                                        

ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUST                                                     

  DISTRIBUTIONS TO UNITHOLDERS.  Income received by a trust is credited by
the trustee to the Income Account for the trust.  All other receipts are        
credited by the trustee to a separate Capital Account for the trust.  The       
trustee will normally distribute any income received by a trust on each         
distribution date or shortly thereafter to unitholders of record on the         
preceding record date.  Unitholders will receive an amount substantially equal  
to their pro rata share of the available balance of the Income Account of the   
trust.  All distributions will be net of applicable expenses.  There is no      
assurance that any actual distributions will be made since all dividends        
received may be used to pay expenses.  In addition, excess amounts from the     
Capital Account of a trust, if any, will be distributed on each distribution    
date or shortly thereafter to unitholders of record on the preceding record     
date.  The trustee is not required to make a distribution from the Income       
Account or the Capital Account unless the total cash held for distribution      
equals at least 0.1% of the trust's net asset value as determined under the     
trust agreement.  Proceeds received from the disposition of any of the          
securities after a record date and prior to the following distribution date will
be held in the Capital Account and not distributed until the next distribution  
date applicable to the Capital Account.  The trustee shall be required to make a
distribution from the Capital Account if the cash balance on deposit therein    
available for distribution shall be sufficient to distribute at least $1.00 per 
unit.  The trustee is not required to pay interest on funds held in the Capital 
or Income Accounts (but may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits 
from the use of such funds).                                                    

    The distribution to the unitholders as of each record date will be made on
the following distribution date or shortly thereafter and shall consist of an   
amount substantially equal to the unitholders' pro rata share of the available  
balance of the Income Account of the trust after deducting estimated expenses.  
Because dividends are not received by a trust at a constant rate throughout the 
year, such distributions to unitholders are expected to fluctuate.  Persons who 
purchase units will commence receiving distributions only after such person     
becomes a record owner.  A person will become the owner of units, and thereby a 
unitholder of record, on the date

P-->48733rd�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�33rd
of settlement provided payment has been received.  Notification to the trustee  
of the transfer of units is the responsibility of the purchaser, but in the     
normal course of business the selling broker-dealer provides such notice.       

 The trustee will periodically deduct from the Income Account of a trust
and, to the extent funds are not sufficient therein, from the Capital Account of
a trust amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the trust.  The trustee also   
may withdraw from said accounts such amounts, if any, as it deems necessary to  
establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of a trust.        
Amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of a trust's assets until   
such time as the trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the    
appropriate accounts.  In addition, the trustee may withdraw from the Income and
Capital Accounts of a trust such amounts as may be necessary to cover           
redemptions of units.                                                           

 DISTRIBUTION REINVESTMENT.  Unitholders may reinvest distributions into
additional units of their trust without a sales fee.  Your trust will pay any   
deferred sales fee and creation and development fee per unit regardless of any  
sales fee discounts.  However, if you are eligible to receive a discount such   
that the sales fee you must pay is less than the applicable deferred sales fee  
and creation and development fee, you will be credited the difference between   
your sales fee and the deferred sales fee and the creation and development fee  
at the time you buy your units.  Accordingly, if you reinvest distributions into
additional units of your trust, you will be credited the amount of any remaining
deferred sales fee and creation and development fee on such units at the time of
reinvestment.                                                                   

STATEMENTS TO UNITHOLDERS.  With each distribution, the trustee will  
furnish to each unitholder a statement of the amount of income and the amount of
other receipts, if any, which are being distributed, expressed in each case as a
dollar amount per unit.                                                         

     The accounts of a trust are required to be audited annually, at the related
trust's expense, by independent public accountants designated by the sponsor,   
unless the sponsor determines that such an audit would not be in the best       
interest of the unitholders of the trust.  The accountants' report will be      
furnished by the trustee to any unitholder upon written request.  Within a      
reasonable period of time after the end of each calendar year, the trustee shall
furnish to each person who at any time during the calendar year was a unitholder
of a trust a statement, covering the calendar year, setting forth for the trust:

(A)  As to the Income Account:                                        

          (1)  the amount of income received on the securities (including income
         received as a portion of the proceeds of any disposition of
securities);                                      

        (2)  the amounts paid for purchases of replacement securities or for
     purchases of securities otherwise pursuant to the trust
agreement, if any, and for redemptions;           

         (3)  the deductions, if any, from the Income Account for payment into
the Reserve Account;

auditors and any other expenses paid by the trust;

       (5)  the amounts reserved for purchases of contract securities, for
              purchases made pursuant to replace failed contract securities or
         for purchases of securities otherwise pursuant to the trust

  (6)  the deductions for payment of the depositor's expenses of
      maintaining the registration of the trust units, if any;

(7)  the aggregate distributions to unitholders; and        

       (8)  the balance remaining after such deductions and distributions,
            expressed both as a total dollar amount and as a dollar amount

            liquidation or disposition of any of the securities, excluding
 any portion thereof credited to the Income Account;

       (2)  the amount paid for purchases of replacement securities or for
     purchases of securities otherwise pursuant to the trust
agreement, if any, and for redemptions;           

      (3)  the deductions, if any, from the Capital Account for payments
into the Reserve Account;                         

    (4)  the deductions for payment of applicable taxes and fees and
        expenses of the trustee, the depositor, the evaluator, the
              supervisor, counsel, auditors and any other expenses paid by the
trust;                                            

  (5)  the deductions for payment of the depositor's expenses of
organizing the trust;                             

       (6)  the amounts reserved for purchases of contract securities, for
              purchases made pursuant to replace failed contract securities or

agreement, if any;                                

          (7)  the deductions for payment of deferred sales fee and creation and
development fee, if any;

(9)  the aggregate distributions to unitholders; and        

       (10) the balance remaining after such distributions and deductions,
            expressed both as a total dollar amount and as a dollar amount
            per unit outstanding on the last business day of such calendar
year; and                                         

(C)  the following information:                                       

          (1)  a list of the securities held as of the last business day of such

  RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS.  A unitholder may at any time tender units to the
trustee for redemption.  The death or incapacity of any unitholder will not     
operate to terminate a trust nor entitle legal representatives or heirs to claim
an accounting or to bring any action or proceeding in any court for partition or
winding up of a trust.  No unitholder shall have the right to control the       
operation and management of a trust in any manner, except to vote with respect  
to the amendment of the trust agreement or termination of a trust.              

     AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION.  The trust agreement may be amended from time to
time by the sponsor and trustee or their respective successors, without the     
consent of any of the unitholders, (i) to cure any ambiguity or to correct or   
supplement any provision which may be defective or inconsistent with any other  
provision contained in the trust agreement, (ii) to make such other provision in
regard to matters or questions arising under the trust agreement as shall not   
materially adversely affect the interests of the unitholders or (iii) to make   
such amendments as may be necessary (a) for the trust to continue to qualify as 
a regulated investment company for federal income tax purposes if the trust has 
elected to be taxed as such under the United States Internal Revenue Code of    
1986, as amended, or (b) to prevent the trust from being deemed an association  
taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes if the trust has not   
elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company under the United States   
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  The trust agreement may not be      
amended, however, without the consent of all unitholders then outstanding, so as
(1) to permit, except in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof, the  
acquisition hereunder of any securities other than those specified in the       
schedules to the trust agreement or (2) to reduce the percentage of units the   
holders of which are required to consent to certain of such amendments.  The    
trust agreement may not be amended so                                           

 -9-

P-->48736th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�36th
as to reduce the interest in a trust represented by units without the consent of
all affected unitholders.  Except for the amendments, changes or modifications  
described above, neither the sponsor nor the trustee may consent to any other   
amendment, change or modification of the trust agreement without the giving of  
notice and the obtaining of the approval or consent of unitholders representing 
at least 66 2/3% of the units then outstanding of the affected trust.  No       
amendment may reduce the aggregate percentage of units the holders of which are 
required to consent to any amendment, change or modification of the trust       
agreement without the consent of the unitholders of all of the units then       
outstanding of the affected trust and in no event may any amendment be made     
which would (1) alter the rights to the unitholders as against each other, (2)  
provide the trustee with the power to engage in business or investment          
activities other than as specifically provided in the trust agreement, (3)      
adversely affect the tax status of the trust for federal income tax purposes or 
result in the units being deemed to be sold or exchanged for federal income tax 
purposes or (4) unless the trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated         
investment company for federal income tax purposes, result in a variation of the
investment of unitholders in the trust.  The trustee will notify unitholders of 
the substance of any such amendment.                                            

The trust agreement provides that a trust shall terminate upon the    
liquidation, redemption or other disposition of the last of the securities held 
in the trust but in no event is it to continue beyond the mandatory termination 
date.  If the value of a trust shall be less than the applicable minimum value  
stated in the prospectus (generally 40% of the total value of securities        
deposited in the trust during the initial offering period), the trustee may, in 
its discretion, and shall, when so directed by the sponsor, terminate the trust.
A trust may be terminated at any time by the holders of units representing 66   
2/3% of the units thereof then outstanding.  In addition, the sponsor may       
terminate a trust if it is based on a security index and the index is no longer 
maintained.  A trust will be liquidated by the trustee in the event that a      
sufficient number of units of the trust not yet sold are tendered for redemption
by the sponsor, so that the net worth of the trust would be reduced to less than
40% of the value of the securities at the time they were deposited in the trust.
If a trust is liquidated because of the redemption of unsold units by the       
sponsor, the sponsor will refund to each purchaser of units the entire sales fee
paid by such purchaser.                                                         

 Beginning nine business days prior to, but no later than, the scheduled
termination date described in the prospectus, the trustee may begin to sell all 
of the remaining underlying securities on behalf of unitholders in connection   
with the termination of the trust.  The sponsor may assist the trustee in these 
sales and receive compensation to the extent permitted by applicable law.  The  
sale proceeds will be net of any incidental expenses involved in the sales.     

   The sponsor will generally instruct the trustee to sell the securities as
quickly as practicable during the termination proceedings without in its        
judgment materially adversely affecting the market price of the securities, but 
it is expected that all of the securities will in any event be disposed of      
within a reasonable time after a trust's termination.  The sponsor does not     
anticipate that the period will be longer than one month, and it could be as    
short as one day, depending on the liquidity of the securities being sold.  The 
liquidity of any security depends on the daily trading volume of the security   
and the amount that the sponsor has available for sale on any particular day.   
Of course, no assurances can be given that the market value of the securities   
will not be adversely affected during the termination proceedings.              

-10-

P-->48737th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�37th
     Approximately thirty days prior to termination of a trust, the trustee will
notify unitholders of the termination and provide a form allowing qualifying    
unitholders to elect an in-kind distribution.  A unitholder who owns the minimum
number of units described in the prospectus may request an in-kind distribution 
from the trustee instead of cash.  The trustee will make an in-kind distribution
through the distribution of each of the securities of the trust in book entry   
form to the account of the unitholder's bank or broker-dealer at Depository     
Trust Company.  The unitholder will be entitled to receive whole shares of each 
of the securities comprising the portfolio of a trust and cash from the Capital 
Account equal to the fractional shares to which the unitholder is entitled.  The
trustee may adjust the number of shares of any security included in a           
unitholder's in-kind distribution to facilitate the distribution of whole       
shares.  The sponsor may terminate the in-kind distribution option at any time  
upon notice to the unitholders.  Special federal income tax consequences will   
result if a unitholder requests an in-kind distribution.                        

 Within a reasonable period after termination, the trustee will sell any
securities remaining in a trust and, after paying all expenses and charges      
incurred by the trust, will distribute to unitholders thereof their pro rata    
share of the balances remaining in the Income and Capital Accounts of the trust.

The sponsor may, but is not obligated to, offer for sale units of a   
subsequent series of a trust at approximately the time of the mandatory         
termination date.  If the sponsor does offer such units for sale, unitholders   
may be given the opportunity to purchase such units at a public offering price  
that includes a reduced sales fee.  There is, however, no assurance that units  
of any new series of a trust will be offered for sale at that time, or if       
offered, that there will be sufficient units available for sale to meet the     
requests of any or all unitholders.                                             

   THE TRUSTEE.  The trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company
organized under the laws of New York.  The Bank of New York Mellon has its      
principal unit investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, 
Brooklyn, New York 11217, (800) 848-6468.  The Bank of New York Mellon is       
subject to supervision and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the    
State of New York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and 
its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the    
extent permitted by law.                                                        

   The trustee, whose duties are ministerial in nature, has not participated
in selecting the portfolio of any trust.  In accordance with the trust          
agreement, the trustee shall keep records of all transactions at its office.    
Such records shall include the name and address of, and the number of units held
by, every unitholder of a trust.  Such books and records shall be open to       
inspection by any unitholder at all reasonable times during usual business      
hours.  The trustee shall make such annual or other reports as may from time to 
time be required under any applicable state or federal statute, rule or         
regulation.  The trustee shall keep a certified copy or duplicate original of   
the trust agreement on file in its office available for inspection at all       
reasonable times during usual business hours by any unitholder, together with a 
current list of the securities held in each trust.  Pursuant to the trust       
agreement, the trustee may employ one or more agents for the purpose of custody 
and safeguarding of securities comprising a trust.

P-->48738th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�38th
    Under the trust agreement, the trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of a trust created by the trust agreement by executing an     
instrument in writing and filing the same with the sponsor.                     

The trustee or successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of    
resignation to all unitholders then of record, not less than sixty days before  
the date specified in such notice when such resignation is to take effect.  The 
sponsor upon receiving notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a     
successor trustee promptly.  If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has
been appointed and has accepted the appointment within thirty days after        
notification, the retiring trustee may apply to a court of competent            
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor.  In case at any time the       
trustee shall not meet the requirements set forth in the trust agreement, or    
shall become incapable of acting, or if a court having jurisdiction in the      
premises shall enter a decree or order for relief in respect of the trustee in  
an involuntary case, or the trustee shall commence a voluntary case, under any  
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in      
effect, or any receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator 
(or similar official) for the trustee or for any substantial part of its        
property shall be appointed, or the trustee shall generally fail to pay its     
debts as they become due, or shall fail to meet such written standards for the  
trustee's performance as shall be established from time to time by the sponsor, 
or if the sponsor determines in good faith that there has occurred either (1) a 
material deterioration in the creditworthiness of the trustee or (2) one or more
grossly negligent acts on the part of the trustee with respect to a trust, the  
sponsor, upon sixty days' prior written notice, may remove the trustee and      
appoint a successor trustee, as hereinafter provided, by written instrument, in 
duplicate, one copy of which shall be delivered to the trustee so removed and   
one copy to the successor trustee.  Notice of such removal and appointment shall
be mailed to each unitholder by the sponsor.  Upon execution of a written       
acceptance of such appointment by such successor trustee, all the rights,       
powers, duties and obligations of the original trustee shall vest in the        
successor.  The trustee must be a corporation organized under the laws of the   
United States, or any state thereof, be authorized under such laws to exercise  
trust powers and have at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided  
profits of not less than $5,000,000.                                            

   THE SPONSOR.  The sponsor of the trust is Advisors Asset Management, Inc.
acting through its unit investment trust division.  The sponsor is a broker-

dealer and investment adviser and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory 
Authority, Inc. (FINRA) and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation

  If at any time the sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under
the trust agreement or shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a  
bankrupt or insolvent or shall have its affairs taken over by public            
authorities, then the trustee may (a) appoint a successor sponsor at rates of   
compensation deemed by the trustee to be reasonable and not exceeding such      
reasonable amounts as may be prescribed by the Securities and Exchange          
Commission, (b) terminate the

trust agreement and liquidate any trust as provided therein, or (c) continue to 
act as trustee without terminating the trust agreement.                         

THE EVALUATOR AND SUPERVISOR.  Advisors Asset Management, Inc., the   
sponsor, also serves as evaluator and supervisor.  The evaluator and supervisor 
may resign or be removed by the sponsor and trustee in which event the sponsor  
or trustee is to use its best efforts to appoint a satisfactory successor.  Such
resignation or removal shall become effective upon acceptance of appointment by 
the successor evaluator.  If upon resignation of the evaluator no successor has 
accepted appointment within thirty days after notice of resignation, the        
evaluator may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of 
a successor.  Notice of such resignation or removal and appointment shall be    
mailed by the trustee to each unitholder.                                       

LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY.  The sponsor, evaluator, and supervisor are 
liable for the performance of their obligations arising from their              
responsibilities under the trust agreement but will be under no liability to the
unitholders for taking any action or refraining from any action in good faith   
pursuant to the trust agreement or for errors in judgment, except in cases of   
its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or its reckless       
disregard for its duties thereunder.  The sponsor shall not be liable or        
responsible in any way for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale  
of any securities.                                                              

   The trust agreement provides that the trustee shall be under no liability
for any action taken in good faith in reliance upon prima facie properly        
executed documents or for the disposition of moneys, securities or certificates 
except by reason of its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct,  
or its reckless disregard for its duties under the trust agreement, nor shall   
the trustee be liable or responsible in any way for depreciation or loss        
incurred by reason of the sale by the trustee of any securities.  In the event  
that the sponsor shall fail to act, the trustee may act and shall not be liable 
for any such action taken by it in good faith.  The trustee shall not be        
personally liable for any taxes or other governmental charges imposed upon or in
respect of the securities or upon the interest thereof.  In addition, the trust 
agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the     
trustee.                                                                        

 The trustee and unitholders may rely on any evaluation furnished by the
evaluator and shall have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof.  The trust 
agreement provides that the determinations made by the evaluator shall be made  
in good faith upon the basis of the best information available to it, provided, 
however, that the evaluator shall be under no liability to the trustee or       
unitholders for errors in judgment, but shall be liable for its gross           
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or its reckless disregard for its   
obligations under the trust agreement.                                          

  EXPENSES OF THE TRUST.  The sponsor will not charge a trust any fees for
services performed as sponsor.  The sponsor will receive a portion of the sale  
commissions paid in connection with the purchase of units and will share in     
profits, if any, related to the deposit of securities in the trust.             

   The sponsor may receive a fee from your trust for creating and developing
the trust, including determining the trust's objectives, policies, composition  
and size, selecting service providers and information services and for providing
other similar administrative and ministerial                                    

-13-

P-->48740th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�40th
functions.  The amount of this "creation and development fee" is set forth in   
the prospectus.  The trustee will deduct this amount from your trust's assets as
of the close of the initial offering period.  No portion of this fee is applied 
to the payment of distribution expenses or as compensation for sales efforts.   
This fee will not be deducted from proceeds received upon a repurchase,         
redemption or exchange of units before the close of the initial public offering 
period.                                                                         

     The trustee receives for its services that fee set forth in the prospectus.
The trustee's fee which is calculated and paid monthly is based on the total    
number of units of the related trust outstanding as of January 1 for any annual 
period, except during the initial offering period the fee will be based on the  
units outstanding at the end of each month.  The trustee benefits to the extent 
there are funds for future distributions, payment of expenses and redemptions in
the Capital and Income Accounts since these Accounts are non-interest bearing   
and the amounts earned by the trustee are retained by the trustee.  Part of the 
trustee's compensation for its services to a trust is expected to result from   
the use of these funds.                                                         

The supervisor will charge a trust a surveillance fee for services    
performed for the trust in an amount not to exceed that amount set forth in the 
prospectus but in no event will such compensation, when combined with all       
compensation received from other unit investment trusts for which the sponsor   
both acts as sponsor and provides portfolio surveillance, exceed the aggregate  
cost to the sponsor of providing such services.  Such fee shall be based on the 
total number of units of the related trust outstanding as of January 1 for any  
annual period, except during the initial offering period the fee will be based  
on the units outstanding at the end of each month.                              

     For evaluation of the securities in a trust, the evaluator shall receive an
evaluation fee in an amount not to exceed that amount set forth in the          
prospectus but in no event will such compensation, when combined with all       
compensation from other unit investment trusts for which the sponsor acts as    
sponsor and provides evaluation services, exceed the aggregate cost of providing
such services.  Such fee shall be based on the total number of units of the     
related trust outstanding as of January 1 for any annual period, except during  
the initial offering period the fee will be based on the units outstanding at   
the end of each month.                                                          

For providing bookkeeping and administrative services to a trust, the 
sponsor shall receive an administration fee in an amount not to exceed that     
amount set forth in the prospectus but in no event will such compensation, when 
combined with all compensation from other unit investment trusts for which the  
sponsor acts as sponsor and provides evaluation services, exceed the aggregate  
cost of providing such services.  Such fee shall be based on the total number of
units of the related trust outstanding as of January 1 for any annual period,   
except during the initial offering period the fee will be based on the units    
outstanding at the end of each month.                                           

The trustee's fee, sponsor's fee for providing bookkeeping and        
administrative services to the trust, supervisor's fee and evaluator's fee are  
deducted from the Income Account of the related trust to the extent funds are   
available and then from the Capital Account.  Each such fee (other than any     
creation and development fee) may be increased without approval of unitholders  
by amounts not exceeding a proportionate increase in the Consumer Price Index or
any equivalent index substituted therefor.

The following additional charges are or may be incurred by the trust: 
(a) fees for the trustee's extraordinary services; (b) expenses of the trustee  
(including legal and auditing expenses and reimbursement of the cost of advances
to the trust for payment of expenses and distributions, but not including any   
fees and expenses charged by an agent for custody and safeguarding of           
securities) and of counsel, if any; (c) various governmental charges;           
(d) expenses and costs of any action taken by the trustee to protect the trust  
or the rights and interests of the unitholders; (e) indemnification of the      
trustee for any loss, liability or expense incurred by it in the administration 
of the trust not resulting from negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on  
its part or its reckless disregard of its obligations under the trust agreement;
(f) indemnification of the sponsor for any loss, liability or expense incurred  
in acting in that capacity without gross negligence, bad faith or willful       
misconduct or its reckless disregard for its obligations under the trust        
agreement; and (g) expenditures incurred in contacting unitholders upon         
termination of the trust.  The fees and expenses set forth herein are payable   
out of a trust and, when owing to the trustee, are secured by a lien on the     
trust.  If the balances in the Income and Capital Accounts are insufficient to  
provide for amounts payable by the trust, the trustee has the power to sell     
securities to pay such amounts.  These sales may result in capital gains or     
losses to unitholders.  A trust may pay the costs of updating its registration  
statement each year.                                                            

PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS AND BROKERAGE ALLOCATION                                 

When a trust sells securities, the composition and diversity of the   
securities in the trust may be altered.  In order to obtain the best price for a
trust, it may be necessary for the sponsor to specify minimum amounts in which  
blocks of securities are to be sold.  In effecting purchases and sales of a     
trust's portfolio securities, the sponsor may direct that orders be placed with 
and brokerage commissions be paid to brokers, including brokers which may be    
affiliated with the trust, the sponsor or dealers participating in the offering 
of units.                                                                       

PURCHASE, REDEMPTION AND PRICING OF UNITS                                       

     PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE.  Units of a trust are offered at the public offering
price thereof.  The public offering price per unit is equal to the net asset    
value per unit plus organization costs plus the applicable sales fee referred to
in the prospectus.  The initial sales fee is equal to the difference between the
maximum sales fee and the sum of the remaining deferred sales fee and the total 
creation and development fee.  The sales fee as a percentage of the public      
offering price and the net amount invested is set forth in the prospectus.  The 
deferred sales fee is a fixed dollar amount and will be collected in            
installments as described in the prospectus.  The creation and development fee  
is a fixed dollar amount and will be collected at the end of the initial        
offering period as described in the prospectus.  Units purchased after the      
initial deferred sales fee payment will be subject to the remaining deferred    
sales fee payments.  Units sold or redeemed prior to such time as the entire    
applicable deferred sales fee has been collected will be assessed the remaining 
deferred sales fee at the time of such sale or redemption.  Units sold or       
redeemed prior to such time as the entire applicable creation and development   
fee has been collected will not be assessed the remaining creation and          
development fee at the time of such sale or redemption.  During the initial     
offering period, a portion of the public offering price includes an amount of   
securities to pay for all or a portion of the costs incurred in establishing a  
trust.  These costs                                                             

-15-

P-->48742nd�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�42nd
include the cost of preparing the registration statement, the trust indenture   
and other closing documents, registering units with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and states, the initial audit of the trust portfolio, legal fees and 
the initial fees and expenses of the trustee.  These costs will be deducted from
a trust as of the end of the initial offering period or after six months, if    
earlier.  Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction fee for processing    
unit purchases.                                                                 

As indicated above, the initial public offering price of the units was
established by dividing the aggregate underlying value of the securities by the 
number of units outstanding.  Such price determination as of the opening of     
business on the date a trust was created was made on the basis of an evaluation 
of the securities in the trust prepared by the evaluator.  After the opening of 
business on this date, the evaluator will appraise or cause to be appraised     
daily the value of the underlying securities as of the close of regular trading 
on the New York Stock Exchange on days the New York Stock Exchange is open and  
will adjust the public offering price of the units commensurate with such       
valuation.  Such public offering price will be effective for all orders received
at or prior to the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on   
each such day as discussed in the prospectus.  Orders received by the trustee,  
sponsor or authorized financial professionals for purchases, sales or           
redemptions after that time, or on a day when the New York Stock Exchange is    
closed, will be held until the next determination of price as discussed in the  
prospectus.                                                                     

  Had units of a trust been available for sale at the close of business on
the business day before the inception date of the trust, the public offering    
price would have been as shown under "Essential Information" in the prospectus. 
The public offering price per unit of a trust on the date of the prospectus or  
on any subsequent date will vary from the amount stated under "Essential
Information" in the prospectus in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of 
the underlying securities.  Net asset value per unit is determined by dividing  
the value of a trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all    
liabilities, by the total number of units outstanding.  The portfolio securities
are valued by the evaluator as follows: If the security is listed on a national 
securities exchange, the evaluation will generally be based on the last sale    
price on the exchange (unless the evaluator deems the price inappropriate as a  
basis for evaluation).  If the security is not so listed or, if so listed and   
the principal market for the security is other than on the exchange, the        
evaluation will generally be made by the evaluator in good faith based on an    
appraisal of the fair value of the securities using recognized pricing methods. 

     The foregoing evaluations and computations shall be made as of the close of
regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, on each business day commencing 
with the trust's inception date of the securities, effective for all sales made 
during the preceding 24-hour period.                                            

   Although payment is normally made three business days following the order
for purchase, payments may be made prior thereto.  A person will become the     
owner of units on the date of settlement provided payment has been received.    
Cash, if any, made available to the sponsor prior to the date of settlement for 
the purchase of units may be used in the sponsor's business and may be deemed to
be a benefit to the sponsor, subject to the limitations of the Securities       
Exchange Act of 1934.                                                           

-16-

P-->48743rd�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�43rd
     PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION OF UNITS.  The sponsor intends to qualify the units for
sale in a number of states.  Units will be sold through dealers who are members 
of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.  and through others.    
Sales may be made to or through dealers at prices which represent discounts from
the public offering price as set forth in the prospectus.  Certain commercial   
banks may be making units available to their customers on an agency basis.  The 
sponsor reserves the right to change the discounts from time to time.           

   We may provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits, additional
compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell shares of units of this    
trust and our other products.  This compensation is intended to result in       
additional sales of our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial 
advisors for past sales.  We may make these payments for marketing, promotional 
or related expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining    
retail customers and financial advisors, advertising, sponsorship of events or  
seminars, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities   
designed to promote the sale of the our products.  These arrangements will not  
change the price you pay for your units.                                        

  The sponsor reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any order
for the purchase of units.                                                      

     PROFITS OF SPONSOR.  The sponsor will receive gross sales fees equal to the
percentage of the offering price of the units of such trusts stated in the      
prospectus and will pay a portion of such sales fees to dealers and agents.  In 
addition, the sponsor may realize a profit or a loss resulting from the         
difference between the purchase prices of the securities to the sponsor and the 
cost of such securities to a trust.  The sponsor may also realize profits or    
losses with respect to securities deposited in a trust which were acquired from 
underwriting syndicates of which the sponsor was a member.  An underwriter or   
underwriting syndicate purchases securities from the issuer on a negotiated or  
competitive bid basis, as principal, with the motive of marketing such          
securities to investors at a profit.  The sponsor may realize additional profits
or losses during the initial offering period on unsold units as a result of     
changes in the daily evaluation of the securities in a trust.                   

   MARKET FOR UNITS.  After the initial offering period, while not obligated
to do so, the sponsor may, subject to change at any time, maintain a market for 
units of the trust offered hereby and to continuously offer to purchase said    
units at the net asset value determined by the evaluator, provided that the     
repurchase price will not be reduced by any remaining creation and development  
fee or organization costs during the initial offering period.  While the sponsor
may repurchase units from time to time, it does not currently intend to maintain
an active secondary market for units.  Unitholders who wish to dispose of their 
units should inquire of their broker as to current market prices in order to    
determine whether there is in existence any price in excess of the redemption   
price and, if so, the amount thereof.  Unitholders who sell or redeem units     
prior to such time as the entire deferred sales fee on such units has been      
collected will be assessed the amount of the remaining deferred sales fee at the
time of such sale or redemption.  Unitholders who sell or redeem units prior to 
such time as the entire creation and development fee on such units has been     
collected will not be assessed the amount of the remaining creation and         
development fee at the time of such sale or redemption.  The offering price of  
any units resold by the sponsor will be in accord with that described in the    
currently effective prospectus describing                                       

-17-

P-->48744th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�44th
such units.  Any profit or loss resulting from the resale of such units will    
belong to the sponsor.  If the sponsor decides to maintain a secondary market,  
it may suspend or discontinue purchases of units of the trust if the supply of  
units exceeds demand, or for other business reasons.                            

  REDEMPTION.  A unitholder who does not dispose of units in the secondary
market described above may cause units to be redeemed by the trustee by making a
written request to the trustee at its unit investment trust division office.    
Unitholders must sign the request exactly as their names appear on the records  
of the trustee.  Additional documentation may be requested, and a signature     
guarantee is always required, from corporations, executors, administrators,     
trustees, guardians or associations.  The signatures must be guaranteed by a    
participant in the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program ("STAMP") or    
such other signature guaranty program in addition to, or in substitution for,   
STAMP, as may be accepted by the trustee.                                       

Redemption shall be made by the trustee no later than the seventh day 
following the day on which a tender for redemption is received (the "Redemption 
Date") by payment of cash equivalent to the redemption price, determined as set 
forth below under "Computation of Redemption Price," as of the close of regular 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange next following such tender, multiplied by
the number of units being redeemed.  Any units redeemed shall be canceled and   
any undivided fractional interest in the related trust extinguished.  The price 
received upon redemption might be more or less than the amount paid by the      
unitholder depending on the value of the securities in the trust at the time of 
redemption.  Unitholders who sell or redeem units prior to such time as the     
entire deferred sales fee on such units has been collected will be assessed the 
amount of the remaining deferred sales fee at the time of such sale or          
redemption.  Unitholders who sell or redeem units prior to such time as the     
entire creation and development fee on such units has been collected will not be
assessed the amount of the remaining creation and development fee at the time of
such sale or redemption.  Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction fee   
for processing redemption requests.                                             

  Under regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service, the trustee is
required to withhold a specified percentage of the principal amount of a unit   
redemption if the trustee has not been furnished the redeeming unitholder's tax 
identification number in the manner required by such regulations.  Any amount so
withheld is transmitted to the Internal Revenue Service and may be recovered by 
the unitholder only when filing a tax return.  Under normal circumstances, the  
trustee obtains the unitholder's tax identification number from the selling     
broker.  However, any time a unitholder elects to tender units for redemption,  
such unitholder should make sure that the trustee has been provided a certified 
tax identification number in order to avoid this possible "back-up withholding."
In the event the trustee has not been previously provided such number, one must 
be provided at the time redemption is requested.  Any amounts paid on redemption
representing interest shall be withdrawn from the Income Account of a trust to  
the extent that funds are available for such purpose.  All other amounts paid on
redemption shall be withdrawn from the Capital Account for a trust.             

  Unitholders tendering units for redemption may request a distribution in
kind (a "Distribution In Kind") from the trustee in lieu of cash redemption of  
an amount and value of securities per unit equal to the redemption price per    
unit as determined as of the evaluation time next following the tender, provided
that the tendering unitholder meets the requirements stated in

the prospectus and the unitholder has elected to redeem at least thirty days    
prior to the termination of the trust.  If the unitholder meets these           
requirements, a Distribution In Kind will be made by the trustee through the    
distribution of each of the securities of the trust in book entry form to the   
account of the unitholder's bank or broker-dealer at Depository Trust Company.  
The tendering unitholder shall be entitled to receive whole shares of each of   
the securities comprising the portfolio of the trust and cash from the Capital  
Account equal to the fractional shares to which the tendering unitholder is     
entitled.  The trustee shall make any adjustments necessary to reflect          
differences between the redemption price of the units and the value of the      
securities distributed in kind as of the date of tender.  If funds in the       
Capital Account are insufficient to cover the required cash distribution to the 
tendering unitholder, the trustee may sell securities.  The in kind redemption  
option may be terminated by the sponsor at any time.                            

The trustee is empowered to sell securities in order to make funds    
available for the redemption of units.  To the extent that securities are sold  
or redeemed in-kind, the size of a trust will be, and the diversity of a trust  
may be, reduced but each remaining unit will continue to represent approximately
the same proportional interest in each security.  Sales may be required at a    
time when securities would not otherwise be sold and may result in lower prices 
than might otherwise be realized.  The price received upon redemption may be    
more or less than the amount paid by the unitholder depending on the value of   
the securities in the portfolio at the time of redemption.                      

 The trustee is irrevocably authorized in its discretion, if the sponsor
does not elect to purchase any unit tendered for redemption, in lieu of         
redeeming such units, to sell such units in the over-the-counter market for the 
account of tendering unitholders at prices which will return to the unitholders 
amounts in cash, net after brokerage commissions, transfer taxes and other      
charges, equal to or in excess of the redemption price for such units.  In the  
event of any such sale, the trustee shall pay the net proceeds thereof to the   
unitholders on the day they would otherwise be entitled to receive payment of   
the redemption price.                                                           

    The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed (1) for any
period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than customary 
weekend and holiday closings, or during which (as determined by the Securities  
and Exchange Commission) trading on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted;  
(2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which        
disposal by the trustee of securities is not reasonably practicable or it is not
reasonably practicable to fairly determine the value of the underlying          
securities in accordance with the trust agreement; or (3) for such other period 
as the Securities and Exchange Commission may by order permit.  The trustee is  
not liable to any person in any way for any loss or damage which may result from
any such suspension or postponement.                                            

COMPUTATION OF REDEMPTION PRICE.  The redemption price for units of each
trust is computed by the evaluator as of the evaluation time stated in the      
prospectus next occurring after the tendering of a unit for redemption and on   
any other business day desired by it, by:                                       

A.   Adding: (1) the cash on hand in the trust other than cash deposited in the 
     trust to purchase securities not applied to the purchase of such securities
and (2) the aggregate value of                                        

-19-

P-->48746th�Page�of�50TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�46th
each issue of the securities held in the trust as determined by the   
evaluator as described above;                                         

B.   Deducting therefrom (1) amounts representing any applicable taxes or       
   governmental charges payable out of the trust and for which no deductions
have been previously made for the purpose of additions to the Reserve 
   Account; (2) an amount representing estimated accrued expenses, including
  but not limited to fees and expenses of the trustee (including legal and
  auditing fees), the evaluator, the sponsor and counsel, if any; (3) cash
     held for distribution to unitholders of record as of the business day prior
 to the evaluation being made; and (4) other liabilities incurred by the
trust, provided that the redemption price will not be reduced by any  
 remaining creation and development fee or organization costs during the
initial offering period; and                                          

C.   Finally dividing the results of such computation by the number of units of 
the trust outstanding as of the date thereof.                         

RETIREMENT PLANS.  A trust may be suited for purchase by Individual   
Retirement Accounts, Keogh Plans, pension funds and other qualified retirement  
plans.  Generally, capital gains and income received under each of the foregoing
plans are deferred from Federal taxation.  All distributions from such plans are
generally treated as ordinary income but may, in some cases, be eligible for    
special income averaging or tax-deferred rollover treatment.  Investors         
considering participation in any such plan should review specific tax laws      
related thereto and should consult their attorneys or tax advisers with respect 
to the establishment and maintenance of any such plan.  Such plans are offered  
by brokerage firms and other financial institutions.  The trust will lower the  
minimum investment requirement for IRA accounts.  Fees and charges with respect 
to such plans may vary.                                                         

OWNERSHIP OF UNITS.  Ownership of units will not be evidenced by      
certificates.  Units may be purchased in denominations of one unit or any       
multiple thereof, subject to the minimum investment requirement.  Fractions of  
units, if any, will be computed to three decimal places.                        

PERFORMANCE INFORMATION                                                         

    Information contained in this Information Supplement or in the prospectus,
as it currently exists or as further updated, may also be included from time to 
time in other prospectuses or in advertising material.  Information on the      
performance of a trust strategy or the actual performance of a trust may be     
included from time to time in other prospectuses or advertising material and may
reflect sales fees and expenses of a trust.  The performance of a trust may also
be compared to the performance of money managers as reported in SEI Fund        
Evaluation Survey or of mutual funds as reported by Lipper Analytical Services  
Inc.  (which calculates total return using actual dividends on ex-dates         
accumulated for the quarter and reinvested at quarter end), Money Magazine Fund 
Watch (which rates fund performance over a specified time period after sales fee
and assuming all dividends reinvested) or Wiesenberger Investment Companies     
Service (which states fund performance annually on a total return basis) or of  
the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index, the American Stock Exchange Index  
(unmanaged indices of stocks traded on the New York and American Stock          
Exchanges, respectively), the Dow Jones Industrial
