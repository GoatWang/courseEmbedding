We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling 
security holders. All of the net proceeds from the sale of our common stock 
will go to the selling security holders as described below in the sections. 
We have agreed to bear the expenses relating to the registration of the common
stock for the selling security holders.


The primary source of competition will come from the manufacturers and 
distributors directly. Those that have the resources and inclination to 
handle these tasks in-house will not need our services. Developing and 
executing such promotions and other marketing techniques is typically one 
of their responsibilities. However, because many do not have the time, 
money or people to do so, they use outside companies such as: 

· Large National and local marketing agencies, such as Digitas 
  (http://digitas.com), Interpublic (http://intercomagency) and Omnicom 
  (http://omnicomgroup.com)  

· Alcoholic beverage sampling companies, such as HausPromotions 
  (http://hauspromotions.com) and CEA (http://classieentertainmentagency.com)
  
·  Local merchandising companies  

The large marketing agencies do not have an expertise in Craft beer, and 
are often too expensive for much of our target market to engage. While the 
sampling companies do have expertise in the alcoholic beverage industry, 
they are geared primarily towards the mass brewers - Anheuser Busch, Miller,
Coors, Crown Imports and Heineken - and other image-driven wine and spirits
companies. As a result, they do not generally have expertise in the 
education needed to effectively promote Craft beers. Local merchandising 
companies are too small to identify and are not widely spread throughout 
all of the major markets. In between these competitors, there is a niche 
area that we plan to fill.


Company Description
We were incorporated on October 15, 2013 under the laws of the state of 
Nevada. We are in the business of providing merchandising and consulting
services to Craft beer brewers and distributors, as well as providing 
additional marketing support within the craft beer industry to retailers 
and


 other organizations as needed. While we do not directly produce 
alcoholic beverages, we provide services to help businesses in the industry
improve their marketing, sales and operations. Our business activities thus
far have been concentrated in and around the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 
market. 

The company was founded by Andrew Gavrin, a seasoned businessman who has 
worked in the alcoholic beverage field for the past 5 years after working 
as a strategy consultant for consumer product and other companies. 
Mr. Gavrin recognized the need for an independent third party company that
could help Craft brewers and distributors create and implement marketing, 
promotional and merchandising plans while working in the industry following
3 years as a strategy consultant. His experience of developing strategies 
and watching a sales force and distributor implement them with limited 
success due to competing priorities led him to launch the Company. 
Mr. Gavrin began working on our business model in the summer of 2013 and 
formed the Company in October 2013. 

Alcoholic beverages are sold in the on-premise class of trade (bars, 
restaurants, taverns, and similar businesses where drinkers consume the 
alcohol immediately at the location) and the off-premise class of trade 
(grocery stores, convenience stores, liquor stores, package stores and 
other retail locations where drinkers purchase their alcohol to consume 
later outside of the property of the store). The three-tier alcohol 
beverage system in the United States mandates that - with some minor 
exceptions - alcohol beverage manufacturers such as breweries and wineries 
must sell their product through a distributor, who in turn sells it to the 
retailer. Manufacturers and distributors together market the brand in order
to sell it to consumers. Both tiers, manufacturers and distributors, have 
sales forces that have numerous priorities that include executing 
promotions for the brand in the on-premise class of trade, holding sampling
events (where legal) in both on-premise and off-premise locations and 
building displays of the product in the off-premise class of trade. Due to 
limited resources and competing priorities, these sales forces are not as 
effective as they can be, and therefore would benefit from an outside party
that could assist in developing and executing these strategies. 

Based on the experience of Mr. Gavrin, who developed such strategies and the 
implementation plan for the country's largest craft brewer, we will develop 
and execute the following marketing techniques for alcohol beverage 
manufacturers and distributors:

· Providing general branding support, including marketing research, naming,
  and graphic design help  

· Building and merchandising displays of product in the off-premise class
  of trade  

· Executing sampling promotions, where legal, in the on-premise and
  off-premise class of trade  

· Developing and/or executing promotions in the on-premise class of trade  

· Manning sampling booths at local beer festivals  

· Development and/or execution of other sales and marketing strategies  

Additionally, we will provide services for retailers and other organizations 
using craft beer, including but not limited to:

· Organizing, promoting and managing beer festivals  

· Improving merchandising and promoting and executing sampling efforts in
  order to drive more customers into the store and increase basket ring

create a Craft beer culture in the United States and around the world. Hey, we
never said we weren't ambitious. At ABV, we truly believe that we are at a
tipping point in the beer industry. Craft beer is not a fad. It is here to stay.
And, distributors, retailers and drinkers are seeing the value that Craft
brewers provide for them. But, Craft beer is still a small minority of all beer
sold. We want to change that...  read more. With years of experience marketing and selling
Craft beer, we understand what is needed to open people's eyes to these more
flavorful artisinal brews. Whether our client is a large Craft brewer, a
distributor, a bottle shop, a start-up cidery, a regional chain of bars or even
a charitable organization looking to use Craft beer to drive excitement with
their members, we can help. While we can draw on our experience consulting in
fields from consumer products to pharmaceuticals, we are unlike a typical
marketing agency. We have a keen understanding of the world of Craft beer. We do
not need to be brought up to speed. Our solutions will be tailored specifically
to your needs. Understanding your place in the market will drive us to create
programs, events and strategies that will be implementable and effective. See
