BRENTWOOD, Tenn., Sept. 28, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Brookdale Senior Living Inc. (NYSE:   BKD) today announced that its Board of Directors has appointed Daniel A. Decker as a Class I director and as the Non-Executive Chairman of the Board, effective October 1, 2015.  Mr. Decker will fill the vacancy on the Board resulting from the recent passing of Granger Cobb.
Mr. Decker has been investing in the senior living industry for more than 20 years. During that period, he has been involved in the investment, through one private and four public companies, of approximately $2.5 billion of assets across a spectrum of independent living, assisted living, memory care, and skilled nursing communities and operations.  His recent investments include joining with KKR and Beecken Petty O'Keefe & Company to acquire the operations of Sunrise Senior Living in 2013.  During his career, Mr. Decker has served on the boards of several REITs and senior housing companies, including Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc. (where he served as Executive Chairman and then as Chairman of the Board), Sentio Healthcare Properties, Inc., Health Care REIT, Inc. and Forum Group, Inc.
"Dan is a wonderful addition to the Board, and we are excited to welcome him to lead our Board and to advise and counsel Brookdale's management team as we continue to refine and execute our strategy to create shareholder value," said Jeffrey R. Leeds, Non-Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of Brookdale.  "Dan is a demonstrated leader and has been a successful investor in the senior housing industry for many years.  We look forward to benefiting from his significant industry experience and insight."
Mr. Decker will succeed Mr. Leeds as Non-Executive Chairman of the Board.  Mr. Leeds has served in such role since 2012 and will continue to serve as an independent director.  "Jeff has been a vital member of the Board for nearly a decade, and as Chairman for the past three years has been a thoughtful and cohesive leader," said T. Andrew Smith, Brookdale's CEO.  "On behalf of the Board, I thank Jeff for his many contributions, and we certainly look forward to his continued service and influence on the Board."
Daniel A. Decker
Mr. Decker is the President and owner of CoastWood Senior Housing Partners, LLC, an investment firm specializing in seniors housing and related services, which he founded in 2006. In January 2013, CoastWood joined with KKR and Beecken Petty O'Keefe & Company to acquire the operations of Sunrise Senior Living, one of the leading operators of assisted living properties in the United States.  The group sold its interest in Sunrise in 2014.  Prior to forming CoastWood, Mr. Decker was a partner from 1990 to 2006 at The Hampstead Group, LLC, a private equity firm with a focus on real estate related, operating intensive businesses such as lodging and seniors housing.  Mr. Decker was an attorney at the law firm of Decker, Hardt, Kopf, Harr, Munsch & Dinan (now known as Munsch Hardt Kopf & Harr, P.C.) from 1985 to 1990, which he co-founded in 1985, and was an attorney at Winstead PC from 1980 to 1985.
Mr. Decker served on the Boards of Directors of Sentio Healthcare Properties, Inc. (a public, non-listed REIT) from March 2013 until September 2015, during which time he served as a member of the Investment Committee, and Health Care REIT, Inc. from October 2011 until August 2012, during which time he served as a member of the Audit, Investment, Nominating/Corporate Governance and Planning Committees. Mr. Decker earned his Bachelor of Science in Business Administration degree in economics from the University of Missouri-Columbia, and his J.D. from the University of Missouri-Kansas City.

One of The Most Important Things Any New Author or Speaker Must Do

If you have something to say or sell, whether that be through a book, speaking or releasing a product… there is something you must do if you want to build an audience or achieve any level of significant impact.
It’s to define your unique value proposition and differentiate yourself from everyone else.
In other words, you have to figure out what makes you unique… what will help you stand out.

Why Simply Serving Others Won’t Grow Your Platform

Just serve others. Create good content. Provide value. Give, give, give.
Do those things, do them with consistency and you’ll see your platform explode. Your list will grow and you’ll significantly attract more readers, followers and customers.
That’s basically what you’ve been told, right?

Paralysis by Analysis… it’s a condition that holds many of us back.
I know because I’ve been guilty of it myself. Maybe you can relate.
Have you ever found yourself wanting to do something… like write a book, start a business, create a nonprofit or pursue an idea? Or maybe you follow others who have done it and you find yourself wishing you could emulate their success.

One of the things many authors do when launching their book is to run a “giveaway” promotion on their blog, social media or on other blogs, etc.
But that strategy could actually HURT your sales and here’s why…
In most cases a book giveaway promotion requires people to register, comment or engage in some way to win.
Here comes the problem…

Self Promotion – How to Make It Not All About You

“I struggle with promoting myself. How do you navigate that in a tasteful way that doesn’t make it seem like it’s all about me? I just want to get the message out.”
It’s a common concern for a lot of people (authors, speakers, pastors, and thought leaders especially).
No matter who you are, if you have something to say or sell, there will likely come a time when you are faced with the tension of self-promotion. Most of us despise it but often it’s for the wrong reasons.
In reality what it boils down to is this…

What’s Your Value Proposition?


4 Comments
Share 
Tweet 
Print
Email

When I am working with clients who have a product or service they are trying to sell, I always begin with two questions…
1.	What’s your Value Proposition?
2.	Is your Value Proposition clearly stated and easily understood?
The answers are critical to the long term success and sustainability of a business.
The Value Proposition is what’s in it for the potential customer… it’s the value that you are proposing they will get.
Think about it this way… What need are you fulfilling? What solution are you offering? What pain are you relieving? What are you giving them in exchange for their money and/or time, and is it worth it (to them for the exchange)? And… how can you state that in a clear, simple, succinct way that will get their attention immediately?
It plays off an understanding of the WIIFM Factor – What’s In It For Me?
But here’s one of the most important parts…
You are not your customer. 
Many times our own Curse of Knowledge can get in the way of being able to see or understand what our REAL Value Proposition is or should be in relationship to who we are trying to sell too. It’s hard but necessary to step out of our own shoes and into theirs (“theirs” being our potential customers). You must remove any emotional attachment that you might have (because it’s your baby) and see it through the eyes of someone new.
As I watched this intriguing “Web Tips” video with Chris Brogan and Derek Halpern of Social Triggers, I was reminded yet again of the significance of the Value Proposition, especially when you are trying to convert online visitors into online buyers or members… but the principles hold true regardless of what action you are trying to get someone to take. Even if you are simply trying to build a following and get more blog or RSS subscribers… go watch the video and you’ll see what I mean.
Do yourself a favor and spend some time with your offerings and see if the Value Proposition is there and if it’s clear enough and compelling enough to elicit a response. One thing is for sure… if it’s not, you’ll know because you won’t be getting the return on your investment like you had hoped (but that can be turned around, IF your Value Proposition becomes your emphasis).
Thoughts? Comments?

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. SoftCover. Book Condition: New. Reprinted from 1759 edition. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper.
