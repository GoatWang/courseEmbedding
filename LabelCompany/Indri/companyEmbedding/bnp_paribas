BNP Paribas is in the early stages of a plan to boost its profitability, as its retail businesses in Europe struggle from a low interest rate environment. The French bank's insurance unit BNP Paribas Cardif has  agreed with Ageas to buy out its 50 percent stake in Cargeas Assicurazioni that sells non-life insurance cover to companies and individuals in Italy, the two companies said on Wednesday. BNP Paribas and Ageas had previously run CARGEAS as a roughly 50/50 joint venture. "Thanks to the acquisition of Cargeas, we will have a complete insurance offer for our individual clients, with support of our partners UBI Banca and BNL in Italy," said Virginie Korniloff, a deputy managing director who is responsible for domestic markets at BNP Paribas Cardiff.  BNP Paribas has been developing its business in Italy since its landmark acquisition of retail bank BNL in 2006. BNL has started to refocus its business more on "better corporate and small business segments" to try to lower loan-loss provisions. Analysts at Jefferies see BNL achieving a 6 percent return on equity by 2020, below the 10 percent target on the group level. No financial details of the acquisition were disclosed, but CARGEAS' gross premiums in 2016 stood at 227 million euros and its net income was at 44 million euros.

BNP Paribas is in the early stages of a plan to boost its profitability, as its retail businesses in Europe struggle from a low interest rate environment. The French bank's insurance unit BNP Paribas Cardif has  agreed with Ageas to buy out its 50 percent stake in Cargeas Assicurazioni that sells non-life insurance cover to companies and individuals in Italy, the two companies said on Wednesday. BNP Paribas and Ageas had previously run CARGEAS as a roughly 50/50 joint venture. "Thanks to the acquisition of Cargeas, we will have a complete insurance offer for our individual clients, with support of our partners UBI Banca and BNL in Italy," said Virginie Korniloff, a deputy managing director who is responsible for domestic markets at BNP Paribas Cardiff.  BNP Paribas has been developing its business in Italy since its landmark acquisition of retail bank BNL in 2006. BNL has started to refocus its business more on "better corporate and small business segments" to try to lower loan-loss provisions. Analysts at Jefferies see BNL achieving a 6 percent return on equity by 2020, below the 10 percent target on the group level. No financial details of the acquisition were disclosed, but CARGEAS' gross premiums in 2016 stood at 227 million euros and its net income was at 44 million euros.

BNP Paribas Cardif announced today the signature of an agreement with the company Ageas to take full ownership of Cargeas Assicurazioni (CARGEAS), a major non-life bancassurance provider in Italy.


        BNP Paribas Cardif (50% - 1 share) and Ageas (50% + 1 share) have jointly owned CARGEAS, a company selling health, homeowner, automobile and creditor insurance to both individuals and businesses in Italy.
      

        The two shareholders in this joint-venture have expanded CARGEAS' business in Italy since 2009, developing non-life insurance products and services such as automobile and homeowner cover.

With the acquisition of Cargeas Assicurazioni (CARGEAS), we will now offer a complete range of insurance for our individual policyholders, working closely with our partners particularly UBI Banca and BNL in Italy' concludes Virginie Korniloff, BNP Paribas Cardif Chief Operating Officer Domestic Markets.

Regulated information – Ageas sells its share in Cargeas to BNP Paribas Cardif

Posted by: Nasdaq NewsFeed 
in Top News
11 hours ago



Today Ageas announces it has reached an agreement with BNP Paribas Cardif to sell its 50% + 1 share in the share capital of Cargeas Assicurazioni (CARGEAS), its Italian Non-Life operations.
The divestment of the Italian activities, where Ageas only had a limited market share in a mature market, is in line with Ageas’s strategy to concentrate its efforts on further developing businesses where it holds stronger positions or where growth prospects are better. The sale also offered an opportunity to crystallise the value that has been created in the past years. 
Ageas entered the Italian Non-Life insurance market in 2009, in partnership with BNP Paribas Cardif, acquiring 50%+1 share of UBI Assicurazioni (UBIA) from UBI Banca, while establishing a long term distribution agreement with UBI Banca.
In 2014, Ageas and BNP Paribas Cardif acquired UBI Banca’s remaining 50% – 1 share in the share capital of UBIA, with Ageas holding 50% + 1 share, and BNP Paribas Cardif 50% – 1 share in the new joint venture. 
The transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close before the end of 2017. The divestment is expected to generate a capital gain of approximately EUR 75 million for Ageas.
Commenting on the transaction, Bart De Smet, CEO of Ageas, says: I would like to take this opportunity to thank the management team, staff, and our partners for their hard work and valuable contribution over the past 8 years. We believe CARGEAS will be in good hands to pursue its activities to the benefit of all its stakeholders.”
Ageas is a listed international insurance Group with a heritage spanning 190 years. It offers Retail and Business customers Life and Non-Life insurance products designed to suit their specific needs, today and tomorrow. As one of Europe’s larger insurance companies, Ageas concentrates its activities in Europe and Asia, which together make up the major part of the global insurance market. It operates successful insurance businesses in Belgium, the UK, Luxembourg, France, Italy, Portugal, Turkey, China, Malaysia, India, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Singapore, and the Philippines through a combination of wholly owned subsidiaries and long term partnerships with strong financial institutions and key distributors. Ageas ranks among the market leaders in the countries in which it operates. It represents a staff force of over 40,000 people and reported annual inflows close to EUR 32 billion in 2016 (all figures at 100%).

History[edit]
Name in brief[edit]
The Banque Nationale de Paris S.A. (BNP) resulted from a merger of two French banks – Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie (BNCI) and Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris (CNEP) – in 1966.
The Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas S.A. (Bank of Paris and the Netherlands), or Paribas, was formed from two investment banks based respectively in Paris and Amsterdam, in 1872. Les Pays-Bas ("The Low Countries") is French for the Netherlands.
In May 2000, BNP and Paribas merged to form BNP Paribas, which is thus descended from four founding banking institutions.
Background and heritage as four banks: 1820–2000[edit]
BNP (Banque Nationale de Paris)[edit]
Main articles: Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris and Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie
On 7 March 1848, the French Provisional Government founded the Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris (CNEP) in response to the financial shock caused by the revolution of February 1848. The upheaval destroyed the old credit system, which was already struggling to provide sufficient capital to meet the demands of the railway boom and the resulting growth of industry. The CEP grew steadily in France and overseas, although in 1889 there was a crisis in which it was temporarily placed in receivership.
Separately, on 18 April 1932, the French government replaced Banque nationale de crédit (BNC), which failed as a result of the 1930s recession, with the new bank Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie (BNCI). The former banks headquarter and staff were used to create BNCI with fresh capital of 100 million francs. The bank initially grew rapidly through absorbing a number of regional banks that got into financial trouble. After the Second World War, it continued to grow steadily. It grew its retail business in France and its commercial business overseas in the French colonial empire.
After the end of the Second World War, the French state decided to "put banks and credit to work for national reconstruction". René Pleven, then Minister of Finance, launched a massive reorganization of the banking industry. A law passed on 2 December 1945 and which went into effect on 1 January 1946 nationalized the four leading French retail banks: Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie (BNCI), Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris (CNEP), Crédit Lyonnais, and Société Générale.
In 1966, the French government decided to merge Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris with Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie to create one new bank called Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP).
The bank was re-privatised in 1993 under the leadership of Michel Pébereau as part of a second Chirac government's privatization policy.[5][6]
Paribas (Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas)[edit]
See also: Paribas and Bischoffsheim family
Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas (Paribas) was established on 27 January 1872, through the merger of Banque de Crédit et de Dépôt des Pays-Bas, which had been established in 1820 by Louis-Raphaël Bischoffsheim in Amsterdam, and Banque de Paris, which had been founded in 1869 by a group of Parisian bankers. It went on to develop a strong investment banking business both domestically in France and overseas.
During the period 1872 to 1913, it was involved in raising funds for the French and other governments as well as big businesses through a number of bond issues. It helped the French government raise funds during the First World War and raised further capital and expanded into investments into industrial companies during the Great Depression. It stagnated and lost assets during the Second World War.
After World War II, it missed the nationalisation of the other French banks due to its status as an investment bank and managed to take advantage of that by expanding its operations overseas. It also directs its activity towards businesses and participates in the development and restructuring of French industry, including names such as Groupe Bull and Thomson-CSF.
The bank was nationalized in 1982 by the government of Pierre Mauroy under François Mitterrand as part of a law that nationalized five major industrial companies, thirty-nine registered banks, and two financial companies, Suez and Paribas. It was re-privatized in January 1987 by the Chirac government.
In the 1990s, Paribas had an active policy of acquisitions and divestiture. This included selling the Ottoman Bank to Doğuş Holding, and setting up the joint venture lending company Cetelem in Germany. It sold Crédit du Nord to Société Générale and in 1998 it merged with Compagnie Bancaire, renaming the bank with the official name Compagnie Financière de Paribas.
Founding of BNP Paribas till date: 2000–present[edit]
In 1999, BNP and Société Générale fought a complex battle on the stock market, with Société Générale bidding for Paribas and BNP bidding for Société Générale and counter-bidding for Paribas. BNP's bid for Société Générale failed, while its bid for Paribas succeeded leading to a merger of BNP and Paribas one year later on 22 May 2000.
On 9 August 2007, BNP Paribas became the first major financial group to acknowledge the impact of the sub-prime crisis by closing two funds exposed to it. This day is now generally seen as the start of the credit crisis and the bank's quick reaction saved it from the fate of other large European banks such as UBS.[7][8]
On 6 October 2008, BNP took over 75% of troubled bank Fortis' activities in Belgium, and 66% in Luxembourg, in exchange for the Belgian government becoming the new group's major shareholder. The sales of the Fortis shares was suspended by a court order from the Court of Appeal on Friday 12 December[9][10]
On 14 December 2008, BNP announced it could lose €350 million as a victim of the Madoff fraud.[11]
In the end of January, the Belgian government and BNP negotiated for a 75% partnership in Fortis Bank Belgium. Fortis Insurance Belgium would be reintegrated in Fortis Holding.
On 11 February, Fortis' shareholders decided that Fortis Bank Belgium and Fortis Insurance Belgium should not become property of BNP Paribas. However the acquisition was completed and BNP Paribas took 75% share holding and renamed the new subsidiary BNP Paribas Fortis. After this only Fortis Insurance International was left in Fortis Holding and this was renamed as Ageas, a business that had Insurance all over Europe and Asia. The remaining Fortis Bank Netherlands was in the hands of the Dutch Government which merged it with other ABN AMRO holdings it already owned under the name ABN AMRO.
In May 2009, BNP Paribas became the majority shareholder (65.96%) of BGL (formerly Fortis Bank Luxembourg), the State of Luxembourg retaining 34% making BNP the eurozone's largest bank by deposits held.[12]
On 21 September, the bank's registered name was changed to BGL BNP Paribas and in February 2010, BGL BNP Paribas became the 100% owner of BNP Paribas Luxembourg. The transfer was finalised on 1 October 2010 with the incorporation of BNP Paribas Luxembourg's business in the operational platforms of BGL BNP Paribas.[13] In 2013 BNP Paribas was awarded the Bank of the Year award by The International Financing Review ("IFR"), Thomson Reuters' leading financial industry publication. The IFR awards are a key industry benchmark and Bank of the Year is the top honour awarded.[14][15][16]
BNP Paribas reached an agreement in December 2013 to acquire Rabobank's Polish unit BGZ Bank for around $1.4 billion.[17] In September 2014, BNP completed the purchase of BGZ Bank for a final fee stated in the media to be $1.3 billion.[18]
In June 2014, BNP Paribas pleaded guilty to falsifying business records and conspiracy, having violated U.S. sanctions against Cuba, Iran, and Sudan. It agreed to pay an $8.9 billion fine, the largest ever for violating U.S. sanctions at that time.[19][20]
Corporate Identity[edit]
The BNP Paribas logo since 2000 (designed by Laurent Vincent under the leadership of the Communications Director, Antoine Sire) is called the "courbe d'envol" (curve of taking flight). The stars allude to Europe and universality. The transformation of the stars into birds conveys openness, freedom, growth, and the ability to change and adapt. The shape and movement of the curve places the logo in the universe of life. The green square symbolises nature and optimism.
Business units[edit]
In 2015, the BNP Paribas Group was organized around two business areas:
Retail Banking & Services, a global network of nearly 7,000 branches, comprising Domestic Markets and International Financial Services, and Corporate & Institutional Banking (CIB).
At the end of 2015, outstanding deposits stood at EUR700.3 billion and outstanding loans at EUR682.5 billion. The geographic breakdown of revenues was as follows: Europe (73.3%), Americas (11.8%), Asia Pacific (7.5%) and others (7.4%).
Retail banking[edit]
Retail banking is BNP Paribas' largest business unit representing 72% of its 2015 revenues. Its operations are concentrated in Europe, especially in the group's three domestic markets of France, Italy (where it operates as Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL)), and Belgium (as BNP Paribas Fortis). The group also owns an American subsidiary BancWest which operates as Bank of the West in the western United States and First Hawaiian Bank in Hawaii. BNP Paribas's Europe Mediterranean group also runs large retail banks in Poland, Turkey, Ukraine, and northern Africa.
BNP Paribas is the largest bank in the Eurozone by total assets and second largest by market capitalization according to The Banker magazine, just behind Banco Santander. It employs over 189,000 people, according to the bank as of 31 December 2015, of which 147,000 work in Europe, and maintains a presence in 75 countries.
Domestic markets[edit]

France: BNP Paribas runs one of France's largest retail banking networks with 2,200 branches and over 3,200 ATMs. In Paris alone the bank has 187 agencies. BNP Paribas serves over 6 million French households and 60,000 corporate customers. In 2009 The French Retail Banking unit (FRB) had revenues of €6.1 billion (15.2% of total group's), income of €1.5 billion (15% of total group's), and employs 31,000 people (15.4% of total group's workforce)[21]
Italy: In 2006 BNP Paribas purchased Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), Italy's sixth largest bank at the time. In 2009 BNL had 810 branches in Italy, 2.5 million individual clients, and over 150,000 corporate clients. It grossed €2.9 billion in revenue (7.2% of the total group's) and €540 million of net income (9.3% of the total group's), and employs around 13,000 employees (6.5% of the total group's).[21]
Belgium: BNP Paribas acquired BNP Paribas Fortis when it acquired the retail banking assets of the Belgian lender Fortis in 2009. This deal also included Fortis's subsidiaries in Poland and Turkey, now grouped in the "Europe Mediterranean" division.

United States[edit]
In the United States, BNP Paribas owns BancWest, which in turn operates retail banking subsidiaries Bank of the West and First Hawaiian Bank. Bank of the West operates in 19 Western US states (where it ranks as the 7th largest bank by assets), while First Hawaiian is Hawaii's leading bank with a 40% market share in deposits. Together the two banks operate 710 branches, and service 5 million clients.
The two banks were merged into BancWest 1998, and BNP Paribas took full control of the combined entity in 2001.
The group has a strong presence on niche markets such as lending for marine and recreational vehicles, church lending, and agribusiness. In 2009 BancWest had €2.1 billion in revenues (5.2% of the total group's), and 11,200 employees (5.5% of the total group's headcount).[21] BancWest lost €223 million in 2009 largely due to its exposure in the subprime mortgage crisis in California, Arizona, and Nevada.
Emerging markets[edit]
In 2009, BNP Paribas reorganized its retail banking divisions renaming its "Emerging Markets" group the "Europe Mediterranean" group. This change was made because after the integration of Fortis Bank's Polish and Turkish subsidiaries, BNP Paribas's emerging market activities are now heavily concentrated in Eastern Europe and the southern half of the Mediterranean basin.
BNP Paribas is a member of the Global ATM Alliance, a joint venture of several major international banks that allows customers of the banks to use their ATM card or check card at another bank within the Global ATM Alliance with no ATM surcharges when traveling internationally. Other participating banks are Barclays (United Kingdom), Bank of America (United States), China Construction Bank (China), Deutsche Bank (Germany), Santander Serfin (Mexico), UkrSibbank (Ukraine), Scotiabank (Canada) and Westpac (Australia and New Zealand).[22]

Fixed Income: BNP Paribas' fixed income team helps companies hedge their exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate, and credit risks, primarily though the structuring and sale of derivative products such as interest rate and foreign exchange swaps, foreign exchange options and credit derivatives. It also trades in these markets on behalf of clients or for its own proprietary account. On an average day, a quarter of a trillion dollars in fixed income instruments are traded at BNP Paribas Americas’ fixed income trading floor located just blocks from the NASDAQ MarketSite in Manhattan, New York City.[23][24]
Equity & Derivatives: BNP Paribas' Equity & Derivatives team helps companies manage their risks and investment portfolios with equity derivatives such as options, futures, and swaps, as well as highly complex, customized solutions such as structured products. It also trades in these markets on behalf of clients or for its own proprietary account.
Commodity Derivatives: BNP Paribas' Commodity Derivatives team helps clients hedge their exposure to commodity risk though the structuring and sale of commodity futures and OTC commodity swaps. It also trades in these markets on behalf of its clients or proprietary account.
Investment Banking: BNP Paribas' Corporate Finance team performs most of the traditional investment banking functions of the group including mergers and acquisitions advisory, and equity raising operations such as Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), rights issues, and convertible bond issues.
Structured Finance: BNP Paribas' Structured Finance group offers clients project finance solutions, export financing, syndicated loans, and financing for acquisitions and leveraged buyouts.
Corporate & Transaction Group: BNP Paribas' Corporate and Transaction group offers clients simplified flow banking services including trade finance, international cash management, and basic hedging solutions.

In 2009, BNP CIB earned €12.2 billion in revenue (30% of total group's), €4.4 billion in pre-tax income (48.9% of total group's), and 18,000 employees (9.0% of total group's headcount.)[21]
Investment solutions[edit]
BNP Paribas's "Investment Solutions" unit includes its asset management, custodial banking, real estate, insurance, online brokerage, "Personal Investors" and wealth management activities.[21]
On 11 June 2008, BNP Paribas formally signed an agreement to purchase the Prime Brokerage Services division of Bank of America Securities. The sale was expected to be completed by the end of the 2008 third quarter.
In 2016, BNP Paribas set up a dedicated fintech accelerator to support start-ups that are seeking to improve the customer experience. The programme provided funding of up to €100,000 to chosen fintech firms in order to help develop new products, services and opportunities across the company.[25]

Asset Management: The asset management activities of BNP Paribas are grouped under BNP Paribas Investment Partners. In 2009 BNP Paribas IP had 2,400 employees in more than 70 countries and US $395.1 billion in assets under management (AuM) in 2014 according to the Scorpio Partnership,[26] an increase of 11% over 2013.[26]

Events in 2005[edit]
On 23 September 2005, BNP Paribas was set to take a 20 percent stake in China's Nanjing City Commercial Bank, a Chinese official and state press reports said. "BNP is going to sign a deal with us to buy a stake next month," an official from Nanjing City Commercial told AFP. The Shanghai-based Oriental Morning Post said BNP would pay up to US$100 million, although the bank official said the figure was incorrect. He declined to give further details. The French newspaper La Tribune reported in August 2005 that BNP Paribas had talked to four Chinese commercial banks—Ningbo, Wuxi, Nanjing and Suzhou—and was prepared to invest US$50–100 million. "We've talked to different financial institutions, but only BNP showed its good faith. It was not easy for us to reach an agreement," the Nanjing City Commercial Bank official said. BNP Paribas refused to comment. The International Financial Corporation, the investment arm of the World Bank, already owns 15 percent of Nanjing City Commercial Bank, which has regulatory approval to list on the country's domestic stock markets.

Controversies[edit]
Check processing[edit]
In 2010 the French government's Autorité de la concurrence fined BNP and 10 other banks €384 million for colluding to charge unjustified fees on check processing, including extra fees during the transition from paper check transfer to "Exchanges Check-Image" electronic transfer.[34] On 19 January 2011 BNP sued Russian grain trader, OOO Rosinteragroservis, and its subsidiary OAO Kubankhlebprodukt, claiming US$20 million in debts and penalties.[35]
Nuclear investments[edit]
BNP Paribas is the biggest investor in the nuclear sector as a bank, according to Profundo, with more than €13.5 billion in nuclear investments. On 23 October 2011 Greenpeace organised a protest against BNP Paribas in 24 French cities.[36]
Sanctions violations[edit]
On 30 May 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that the United States Department of Justice was negotiating a possible guilty plea with BNP Paribas as well as the size of the resulting fine for violating U.S. regulations and evading US sanctions. The Justice Department sought a fine of more than US $10 billion, which was expected to be reduced to $8 or $9 billion in negotiations.[37] BNP Paribas was said to have laundered up to US $100 billion from the sanctioned countries of Sudan, Iran, and Cuba.[38]
On 1 July 2014, BNP Paribas pled guilty in a New York state court to falsifying business records as well as conspiracy in connection to those falsifications. It is also expected to plead guilty in federal court to violating laws against money-laundering.[39] It agreed to pay $8.9 billion, the largest fine ever for violating U.S. sanctions, and substantially more than the previous record of $1.9 billion.[19][39] BNP Paribas was also barred for one year under the plea agreement from certain US dollar-dominated transactions. The fine exceeded the bank's $6.4 billion 2013 annual income and the $1.1 billion it previously had allocated for the anticipated fine.[39][40]
The bank's failure to cooperate with the multi-year investigation was given as a significant factor in the size of the fine. Additionally, BNP Paribas continued to process sanctioned transactions after the investigation began. About 30 employees left the bank as a result of the investigation.[39] According to the FBI’s New York Field Office and Chief Richard Weber of the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) "BNPP deliberately disregarded the law and provided rogue nations, and Sudan in particular, with vital access to the global financial system, helping that country’s lawless government to harbor and support terrorists and to persecute its own people. Today’s sentence demonstrates that financial institutions will be punished severely but appropriately for violating sanctions laws and risking our national security interests."[41]
After the fine was announced, BNP said it would be "just fine" and that it had "a comprehensive plan" to avoid similar violations in the future. The company's stock, which had fallen 12% since news of the investigation first leaked, rose 4% on the announcement.[39][40] To comply with the transaction ban, BNP Paribas will use a third party to clear its US transactions. Standard & Poor's said it was reviewing the bank's financial standing[when?] in light of the fine and penalties for a possible downgrade.[39]
Russian president Vladimir Putin alleged without providing any supporting evidence that the US government was using the case to punish France for selling Mistral amphibious assault ships to Russia. He said the large fine and the imposition of sanctions on the French bank were the result of US displeasure with France's decision not to stop the sale.[42] Former European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet had previously said that a large fine was neither fair nor proportionate to the violations and could disrupt the global banking system.[39]
152 Million Erroneous Trade case[edit]
The German FOCUS magazine and the French Les Echos newspaper published an article regarding a 163 Million EUR mistrade (erroneous trade) in which BNP Paribas Arbitrage is allegedly involved.[43][44] The bank has sold securities for 326,400 EUR to the investor Armin S. but the value of the securities is 163 Million EUR according to the bank.
According to the article, the error remained unnoticed for several days. BNP has even reconfirmed the original price. However, a trade-cancellation was only possible until the next day according to prevailing mistrade rules.
A German lawyer stated in the article that a bank not recognizing an error of this magnitude should not be protected by law.[43][45] [46]
Sponsorship[edit]
BNP Paribas has been a major sponsor of tennis. In 1973 it became the major sponsor of the French Open, one of the four prestigious Grand Slam tournaments in the sport. In 2001 the bank began to sponsor the Davis Cup before becoming the title sponsor in 2002. Also in 2002 it became the sponsor of the Paris Masters, one of the nine high-profile tournaments of the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 series. It also expanded to the United States in 2009 when it became the title sponsor of the Indian Wells Masters, a two-week tournament in California which is also one of the nine Masters 1000 series. The Stanford Classic, since 1992, is instead directly sponsored by the Bank of the West subsidiary.
Corporate philanthropy[edit]
Under the aegis of the Fondation de France, the BNP Paribas Foundation[47] has been playing a key role in corporate philanthropy for more than 30 years. It is also encouraging to developing the BNP Paribas international philanthropic policy where the Group does business.
The BNP Paribas Foundation[47] aims at developing its activities through a corporate philanthropic approach, dedicated to three fields of action:

The Arts: contemporary dance, new circus arts, jazz music, restoration of artworks, classical music festivals;
Solidarity : programme focusing on equal opportunities, social entrepreneurship, fight against exclusion and situations of extreme deprivation;
The Environmental research: support to laboratories in France, in Europe and on an international collaboration so as to implement the research projects on climate change.

The BNP Paribas Foundation supports since 1984, more than 300 cultural projects, 40 programmes on research, and a thousand of social & educational initiatives in France and worldwide. Its major programmes are:

Dream Up, new international educational programme based on the practice of the arts;
BNP Paribas for Art, programme supporting restoration of works of arts since 1994;
Climate Initiative, in support of fundamental research on climate change;
Projet Banlieues, initiative created in connection with the BNP Paribas network of agencies inside the Solidarity activity;
Help to Help, a programme that promotes the Group staff initiative as volunteers.

In 2015, BNP Paribas Corporate Philanthropy in the world represented a commitment of almost 40 million euros.
In 2015, Standard Ethics Aei has given a Sustainability Rating to BNP Paribas (EE+) in order to include it in its Standard Ethics French Index.[48]

History[edit]
Name in brief[edit]
The Banque Nationale de Paris S.A. (BNP) resulted from a merger of two French banks – Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie (BNCI) and Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris (CNEP) – in 1966.
The Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas S.A. (Bank of Paris and the Netherlands), or Paribas, was formed from two investment banks based respectively in Paris and Amsterdam, in 1872. Les Pays-Bas ("The Low Countries") is French for the Netherlands.
In May 2000, BNP and Paribas merged to form BNP Paribas, which is thus descended from four founding banking institutions.
Background and heritage as four banks: 1820–2000[edit]
BNP (Banque Nationale de Paris)[edit]
Main articles: Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris and Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie
On 7 March 1848, the French Provisional Government founded the Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris (CNEP) in response to the financial shock caused by the revolution of February 1848. The upheaval destroyed the old credit system, which was already struggling to provide sufficient capital to meet the demands of the railway boom and the resulting growth of industry. The CEP grew steadily in France and overseas, although in 1889 there was a crisis in which it was temporarily placed in receivership.
Separately, on 18 April 1932, the French government replaced Banque nationale de crédit (BNC), which failed as a result of the 1930s recession, with the new bank Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie (BNCI). The former banks headquarter and staff were used to create BNCI with fresh capital of 100 million francs. The bank initially grew rapidly through absorbing a number of regional banks that got into financial trouble. After the Second World War, it continued to grow steadily. It grew its retail business in France and its commercial business overseas in the French colonial empire.
After the end of the Second World War, the French state decided to "put banks and credit to work for national reconstruction". René Pleven, then Minister of Finance, launched a massive reorganization of the banking industry. A law passed on 2 December 1945 and which went into effect on 1 January 1946 nationalized the four leading French retail banks: Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie (BNCI), Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris (CNEP), Crédit Lyonnais, and Société Générale.
In 1966, the French government decided to merge Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris with Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie to create one new bank called Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP).
The bank was re-privatised in 1993 under the leadership of Michel Pébereau as part of a second Chirac government's privatization policy.[5][6]
Paribas (Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas)[edit]
See also: Paribas and Bischoffsheim family
Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas (Paribas) was established on 27 January 1872, through the merger of Banque de Crédit et de Dépôt des Pays-Bas, which had been established in 1820 by Louis-Raphaël Bischoffsheim in Amsterdam, and Banque de Paris, which had been founded in 1869 by a group of Parisian bankers. It went on to develop a strong investment banking business both domestically in France and overseas.
During the period 1872 to 1913, it was involved in raising funds for the French and other governments as well as big businesses through a number of bond issues. It helped the French government raise funds during the First World War and raised further capital and expanded into investments into industrial companies during the Great Depression. It stagnated and lost assets during the Second World War.
After World War II, it missed the nationalisation of the other French banks due to its status as an investment bank and managed to take advantage of that by expanding its operations overseas. It also directs its activity towards businesses and participates in the development and restructuring of French industry, including names such as Groupe Bull and Thomson-CSF.
The bank was nationalized in 1982 by the government of Pierre Mauroy under François Mitterrand as part of a law that nationalized five major industrial companies, thirty-nine registered banks, and two financial companies, Suez and Paribas. It was re-privatized in January 1987 by the Chirac government.
In the 1990s, Paribas had an active policy of acquisitions and divestiture. This included selling the Ottoman Bank to Doğuş Holding, and setting up the joint venture lending company Cetelem in Germany. It sold Crédit du Nord to Société Générale and in 1998 it merged with Compagnie Bancaire, renaming the bank with the official name Compagnie Financière de Paribas.
Founding of BNP Paribas till date: 2000–present[edit]
In 1999, BNP and Société Générale fought a complex battle on the stock market, with Société Générale bidding for Paribas and BNP bidding for Société Générale and counter-bidding for Paribas. BNP's bid for Société Générale failed, while its bid for Paribas succeeded leading to a merger of BNP and Paribas one year later on 22 May 2000.
On 9 August 2007, BNP Paribas became the first major financial group to acknowledge the impact of the sub-prime crisis by closing two funds exposed to it. This day is now generally seen as the start of the credit crisis and the bank's quick reaction saved it from the fate of other large European banks such as UBS.[7][8]
On 6 October 2008, BNP took over 75% of troubled bank Fortis' activities in Belgium, and 66% in Luxembourg, in exchange for the Belgian government becoming the new group's major shareholder. The sales of the Fortis shares was suspended by a court order from the Court of Appeal on Friday 12 December[9][10]
On 14 December 2008, BNP announced it could lose €350 million as a victim of the Madoff fraud.[11]
In the end of January, the Belgian government and BNP negotiated for a 75% partnership in Fortis Bank Belgium. Fortis Insurance Belgium would be reintegrated in Fortis Holding.
On 11 February, Fortis' shareholders decided that Fortis Bank Belgium and Fortis Insurance Belgium should not become property of BNP Paribas. However the acquisition was completed and BNP Paribas took 75% share holding and renamed the new subsidiary BNP Paribas Fortis. After this only Fortis Insurance International was left in Fortis Holding and this was renamed as Ageas, a business that had Insurance all over Europe and Asia. The remaining Fortis Bank Netherlands was in the hands of the Dutch Government which merged it with other ABN AMRO holdings it already owned under the name ABN AMRO.
In May 2009, BNP Paribas became the majority shareholder (65.96%) of BGL (formerly Fortis Bank Luxembourg), the State of Luxembourg retaining 34% making BNP the eurozone's largest bank by deposits held.[12]
On 21 September, the bank's registered name was changed to BGL BNP Paribas and in February 2010, BGL BNP Paribas became the 100% owner of BNP Paribas Luxembourg. The transfer was finalised on 1 October 2010 with the incorporation of BNP Paribas Luxembourg's business in the operational platforms of BGL BNP Paribas.[13] In 2013 BNP Paribas was awarded the Bank of the Year award by The International Financing Review ("IFR"), Thomson Reuters' leading financial industry publication. The IFR awards are a key industry benchmark and Bank of the Year is the top honour awarded.[14][15][16]
BNP Paribas reached an agreement in December 2013 to acquire Rabobank's Polish unit BGZ Bank for around $1.4 billion.[17] In September 2014, BNP completed the purchase of BGZ Bank for a final fee stated in the media to be $1.3 billion.[18]
In June 2014, BNP Paribas pleaded guilty to falsifying business records and conspiracy, having violated U.S. sanctions against Cuba, Iran, and Sudan. It agreed to pay an $8.9 billion fine, the largest ever for violating U.S. sanctions at that time.[19][20]
Corporate Identity[edit]
The BNP Paribas logo since 2000 (designed by Laurent Vincent under the leadership of the Communications Director, Antoine Sire) is called the "courbe d'envol" (curve of taking flight). The stars allude to Europe and universality. The transformation of the stars into birds conveys openness, freedom, growth, and the ability to change and adapt. The shape and movement of the curve places the logo in the universe of life. The green square symbolises nature and optimism.
Business units[edit]
In 2015, the BNP Paribas Group was organized around two business areas:
Retail Banking & Services, a global network of nearly 7,000 branches, comprising Domestic Markets and International Financial Services, and Corporate & Institutional Banking (CIB).
At the end of 2015, outstanding deposits stood at EUR700.3 billion and outstanding loans at EUR682.5 billion. The geographic breakdown of revenues was as follows: Europe (73.3%), Americas (11.8%), Asia Pacific (7.5%) and others (7.4%).
Retail banking[edit]
Retail banking is BNP Paribas' largest business unit representing 72% of its 2015 revenues. Its operations are concentrated in Europe, especially in the group's three domestic markets of France, Italy (where it operates as Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL)), and Belgium (as BNP Paribas Fortis). The group also owns an American subsidiary BancWest which operates as Bank of the West in the western United States and First Hawaiian Bank in Hawaii. BNP Paribas's Europe Mediterranean group also runs large retail banks in Poland, Turkey, Ukraine, and northern Africa.
BNP Paribas is the largest bank in the Eurozone by total assets and second largest by market capitalization according to The Banker magazine, just behind Banco Santander. It employs over 189,000 people, according to the bank as of 31 December 2015, of which 147,000 work in Europe, and maintains a presence in 75 countries.
Domestic markets[edit]

France: BNP Paribas runs one of France's largest retail banking networks with 2,200 branches and over 3,200 ATMs. In Paris alone the bank has 187 agencies. BNP Paribas serves over 6 million French households and 60,000 corporate customers. In 2009 The French Retail Banking unit (FRB) had revenues of €6.1 billion (15.2% of total group's), income of €1.5 billion (15% of total group's), and employs 31,000 people (15.4% of total group's workforce)[21]
Italy: In 2006 BNP Paribas purchased Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), Italy's sixth largest bank at the time. In 2009 BNL had 810 branches in Italy, 2.5 million individual clients, and over 150,000 corporate clients. It grossed €2.9 billion in revenue (7.2% of the total group's) and €540 million of net income (9.3% of the total group's), and employs around 13,000 employees (6.5% of the total group's).[21]
Belgium: BNP Paribas acquired BNP Paribas Fortis when it acquired the retail banking assets of the Belgian lender Fortis in 2009. This deal also included Fortis's subsidiaries in Poland and Turkey, now grouped in the "Europe Mediterranean" division.

United States[edit]
In the United States, BNP Paribas owns BancWest, which in turn operates retail banking subsidiaries Bank of the West and First Hawaiian Bank. Bank of the West operates in 19 Western US states (where it ranks as the 7th largest bank by assets), while First Hawaiian is Hawaii's leading bank with a 40% market share in deposits. Together the two banks operate 710 branches, and service 5 million clients.
The two banks were merged into BancWest 1998, and BNP Paribas took full control of the combined entity in 2001.
The group has a strong presence on niche markets such as lending for marine and recreational vehicles, church lending, and agribusiness. In 2009 BancWest had €2.1 billion in revenues (5.2% of the total group's), and 11,200 employees (5.5% of the total group's headcount).[21] BancWest lost €223 million in 2009 largely due to its exposure in the subprime mortgage crisis in California, Arizona, and Nevada.
Emerging markets[edit]
In 2009, BNP Paribas reorganized its retail banking divisions renaming its "Emerging Markets" group the "Europe Mediterranean" group. This change was made because after the integration of Fortis Bank's Polish and Turkish subsidiaries, BNP Paribas's emerging market activities are now heavily concentrated in Eastern Europe and the southern half of the Mediterranean basin.
BNP Paribas is a member of the Global ATM Alliance, a joint venture of several major international banks that allows customers of the banks to use their ATM card or check card at another bank within the Global ATM Alliance with no ATM surcharges when traveling internationally. Other participating banks are Barclays (United Kingdom), Bank of America (United States), China Construction Bank (China), Deutsche Bank (Germany), Santander Serfin (Mexico), UkrSibbank (Ukraine), Scotiabank (Canada) and Westpac (Australia and New Zealand).[22]

Equity & Derivatives: BNP Paribas' Equity & Derivatives team helps companies manage their risks and investment portfolios with equity derivatives such as options, futures, and swaps, as well as highly complex, customized solutions such as structured products. It also trades in these markets on behalf of clients or for its own proprietary account.

Investment solutions[edit]
BNP Paribas's "Investment Solutions" unit includes its asset management, custodial banking, real estate, insurance, online brokerage, "Personal Investors" and wealth management activities.[21]
On 11 June 2008, BNP Paribas formally signed an agreement to purchase the Prime Brokerage Services division of Bank of America Securities. The sale was expected to be completed by the end of the 2008 third quarter.
In 2016, BNP Paribas set up a dedicated fintech accelerator to support start-ups that are seeking to improve the customer experience. The programme provided funding of up to €100,000 to chosen fintech firms in order to help develop new products, services and opportunities across the company.[25]

Asset Management: The asset management activities of BNP Paribas are grouped under BNP Paribas Investment Partners. In 2009 BNP Paribas IP had 2,400 employees in more than 70 countries and US $395.1 billion in assets under management (AuM) in 2014 according to the Scorpio Partnership,[26] an increase of 11% over 2013.[26]

Events in 2005[edit]
On 23 September 2005, BNP Paribas was set to take a 20 percent stake in China's Nanjing City Commercial Bank, a Chinese official and state press reports said. "BNP is going to sign a deal with us to buy a stake next month," an official from Nanjing City Commercial told AFP. The Shanghai-based Oriental Morning Post said BNP would pay up to US$100 million, although the bank official said the figure was incorrect. He declined to give further details. The French newspaper La Tribune reported in August 2005 that BNP Paribas had talked to four Chinese commercial banks—Ningbo, Wuxi, Nanjing and Suzhou—and was prepared to invest US$50–100 million. "We've talked to different financial institutions, but only BNP showed its good faith. It was not easy for us to reach an agreement," the Nanjing City Commercial Bank official said. BNP Paribas refused to comment. The International Financial Corporation, the investment arm of the World Bank, already owns 15 percent of Nanjing City Commercial Bank, which has regulatory approval to list on the country's domestic stock markets.

Controversies[edit]
Check processing[edit]
In 2010 the French government's Autorité de la concurrence fined BNP and 10 other banks €384 million for colluding to charge unjustified fees on check processing, including extra fees during the transition from paper check transfer to "Exchanges Check-Image" electronic transfer.[34] On 19 January 2011 BNP sued Russian grain trader, OOO Rosinteragroservis, and its subsidiary OAO Kubankhlebprodukt, claiming US$20 million in debts and penalties.[35]
Nuclear investments[edit]
BNP Paribas is the biggest investor in the nuclear sector as a bank, according to Profundo, with more than €13.5 billion in nuclear investments. On 23 October 2011 Greenpeace organised a protest against BNP Paribas in 24 French cities.[36]
Sanctions violations[edit]
On 30 May 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that the United States Department of Justice was negotiating a possible guilty plea with BNP Paribas as well as the size of the resulting fine for violating U.S. regulations and evading US sanctions. The Justice Department sought a fine of more than US $10 billion, which was expected to be reduced to $8 or $9 billion in negotiations.[37] BNP Paribas was said to have laundered up to US $100 billion from the sanctioned countries of Sudan, Iran, and Cuba.[38]
On 1 July 2014, BNP Paribas pled guilty in a New York state court to falsifying business records as well as conspiracy in connection to those falsifications. It is also expected to plead guilty in federal court to violating laws against money-laundering.[39] It agreed to pay $8.9 billion, the largest fine ever for violating U.S. sanctions, and substantially more than the previous record of $1.9 billion.[19][39] BNP Paribas was also barred for one year under the plea agreement from certain US dollar-dominated transactions. The fine exceeded the bank's $6.4 billion 2013 annual income and the $1.1 billion it previously had allocated for the anticipated fine.[39][40]
The bank's failure to cooperate with the multi-year investigation was given as a significant factor in the size of the fine. Additionally, BNP Paribas continued to process sanctioned transactions after the investigation began. About 30 employees left the bank as a result of the investigation.[39] According to the FBI’s New York Field Office and Chief Richard Weber of the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) "BNPP deliberately disregarded the law and provided rogue nations, and Sudan in particular, with vital access to the global financial system, helping that country’s lawless government to harbor and support terrorists and to persecute its own people. Today’s sentence demonstrates that financial institutions will be punished severely but appropriately for violating sanctions laws and risking our national security interests."[41]
After the fine was announced, BNP said it would be "just fine" and that it had "a comprehensive plan" to avoid similar violations in the future. The company's stock, which had fallen 12% since news of the investigation first leaked, rose 4% on the announcement.[39][40] To comply with the transaction ban, BNP Paribas will use a third party to clear its US transactions. Standard & Poor's said it was reviewing the bank's financial standing[when?] in light of the fine and penalties for a possible downgrade.[39]
Russian president Vladimir Putin alleged without providing any supporting evidence that the US government was using the case to punish France for selling Mistral amphibious assault ships to Russia. He said the large fine and the imposition of sanctions on the French bank were the result of US displeasure with France's decision not to stop the sale.[42] Former European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet had previously said that a large fine was neither fair nor proportionate to the violations and could disrupt the global banking system.[39]
152 Million Erroneous Trade case[edit]
The German FOCUS magazine and the French Les Echos newspaper published an article regarding a 163 Million EUR mistrade (erroneous trade) in which BNP Paribas Arbitrage is allegedly involved.[43][44] The bank has sold securities for 326,400 EUR to the investor Armin S. but the value of the securities is 163 Million EUR according to the bank.
According to the article, the error remained unnoticed for several days. BNP has even reconfirmed the original price. However, a trade-cancellation was only possible until the next day according to prevailing mistrade rules.
A German lawyer stated in the article that a bank not recognizing an error of this magnitude should not be protected by law.[43][45] [46]
Sponsorship[edit]
BNP Paribas has been a major sponsor of tennis. In 1973 it became the major sponsor of the French Open, one of the four prestigious Grand Slam tournaments in the sport. In 2001 the bank began to sponsor the Davis Cup before becoming the title sponsor in 2002. Also in 2002 it became the sponsor of the Paris Masters, one of the nine high-profile tournaments of the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 series. It also expanded to the United States in 2009 when it became the title sponsor of the Indian Wells Masters, a two-week tournament in California which is also one of the nine Masters 1000 series. The Stanford Classic, since 1992, is instead directly sponsored by the Bank of the West subsidiary.
Corporate philanthropy[edit]
Under the aegis of the Fondation de France, the BNP Paribas Foundation[47] has been playing a key role in corporate philanthropy for more than 30 years. It is also encouraging to developing the BNP Paribas international philanthropic policy where the Group does business.
The BNP Paribas Foundation[47] aims at developing its activities through a corporate philanthropic approach, dedicated to three fields of action:

The Arts: contemporary dance, new circus arts, jazz music, restoration of artworks, classical music festivals;
Solidarity : programme focusing on equal opportunities, social entrepreneurship, fight against exclusion and situations of extreme deprivation;
The Environmental research: support to laboratories in France, in Europe and on an international collaboration so as to implement the research projects on climate change.

The BNP Paribas Foundation supports since 1984, more than 300 cultural projects, 40 programmes on research, and a thousand of social & educational initiatives in France and worldwide. Its major programmes are:

Dream Up, new international educational programme based on the practice of the arts;
BNP Paribas for Art, programme supporting restoration of works of arts since 1994;
Climate Initiative, in support of fundamental research on climate change;
Projet Banlieues, initiative created in connection with the BNP Paribas network of agencies inside the Solidarity activity;
Help to Help, a programme that promotes the Group staff initiative as volunteers.

In 2015, BNP Paribas Corporate Philanthropy in the world represented a commitment of almost 40 million euros.
In 2015, Standard Ethics Aei has given a Sustainability Rating to BNP Paribas (EE+) in order to include it in its Standard Ethics French Index.[48]

BNP Paribas (French pronunciation: ​[be ɛn pe paʁibɑ]) is an international banking group with a presence in 75 countries. It is listed on the First Market of Euronext Paris and is included in the CAC 40 index. At 31 December 2016, net income attributable to equity holders was EUR7,702 million.[3]
BNP Paribas is one of the largest banks in the world. The bank serves more than 30 million customers between its retail banking networks in its four domestic markets, France, Belgium, Italy and Luxembourg, through several brands such as BNL, BGL BNP Paribas or BNP Paribas Fortis.
The retail bank also operates in the Mediterranean region and in the west of the United States.

History[edit]
Name in brief[edit]
The Banque Nationale de Paris S.A. (BNP) resulted from a merger of two French banks – Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie (BNCI) and Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris (CNEP) – in 1966.
The Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas S.A. (Bank of Paris and the Netherlands), or Paribas, was formed from two investment banks based respectively in Paris and Amsterdam, in 1872. Les Pays-Bas ("The Low Countries") is French for the Netherlands.
In May 2000, BNP and Paribas merged to form BNP Paribas, which is thus descended from four founding banking institutions.
Background and heritage as four banks: 1820–2000[edit]
BNP (Banque Nationale de Paris)[edit]
Main articles: Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris and Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie
On 7 March 1848, the French Provisional Government founded the Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris (CNEP) in response to the financial shock caused by the revolution of February 1848. The upheaval destroyed the old credit system, which was already struggling to provide sufficient capital to meet the demands of the railway boom and the resulting growth of industry. The CEP grew steadily in France and overseas, although in 1889 there was a crisis in which it was temporarily placed in receivership.
Separately, on 18 April 1932, the French government replaced Banque nationale de crédit (BNC), which failed as a result of the 1930s recession, with the new bank Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie (BNCI). The former banks headquarter and staff were used to create BNCI with fresh capital of 100 million francs. The bank initially grew rapidly through absorbing a number of regional banks that got into financial trouble. After the Second World War, it continued to grow steadily. It grew its retail business in France and its commercial business overseas in the French colonial empire.
After the end of the Second World War, the French state decided to "put banks and credit to work for national reconstruction". René Pleven, then Minister of Finance, launched a massive reorganization of the banking industry. A law passed on 2 December 1945 and which went into effect on 1 January 1946 nationalized the four leading French retail banks: Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie (BNCI), Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris (CNEP), Crédit Lyonnais, and Société Générale.
In 1966, the French government decided to merge Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris with Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie to create one new bank called Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP).
The bank was re-privatised in 1993 under the leadership of Michel Pébereau as part of a second Chirac government's privatization policy.[5][6]
Paribas (Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas)[edit]
See also: Paribas and Bischoffsheim family
Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas (Paribas) was established on 27 January 1872, through the merger of Banque de Crédit et de Dépôt des Pays-Bas, which had been established in 1820 by Louis-Raphaël Bischoffsheim in Amsterdam, and Banque de Paris, which had been founded in 1869 by a group of Parisian bankers. It went on to develop a strong investment banking business both domestically in France and overseas.
During the period 1872 to 1913, it was involved in raising funds for the French and other governments as well as big businesses through a number of bond issues. It helped the French government raise funds during the First World War and raised further capital and expanded into investments into industrial companies during the Great Depression. It stagnated and lost assets during the Second World War.
After World War II, it missed the nationalisation of the other French banks due to its status as an investment bank and managed to take advantage of that by expanding its operations overseas. It also directs its activity towards businesses and participates in the development and restructuring of French industry, including names such as Groupe Bull and Thomson-CSF.
The bank was nationalized in 1982 by the government of Pierre Mauroy under François Mitterrand as part of a law that nationalized five major industrial companies, thirty-nine registered banks, and two financial companies, Suez and Paribas. It was re-privatized in January 1987 by the Chirac government.
In the 1990s, Paribas had an active policy of acquisitions and divestiture. This included selling the Ottoman Bank to Doğuş Holding, and setting up the joint venture lending company Cetelem in Germany. It sold Crédit du Nord to Société Générale and in 1998 it merged with Compagnie Bancaire, renaming the bank with the official name Compagnie Financière de Paribas.
Founding of BNP Paribas till date: 2000–present[edit]
In 1999, BNP and Société Générale fought a complex battle on the stock market, with Société Générale bidding for Paribas and BNP bidding for Société Générale and counter-bidding for Paribas. BNP's bid for Société Générale failed, while its bid for Paribas succeeded leading to a merger of BNP and Paribas one year later on 22 May 2000.
On 9 August 2007, BNP Paribas became the first major financial group to acknowledge the impact of the sub-prime crisis by closing two funds exposed to it. This day is now generally seen as the start of the credit crisis and the bank's quick reaction saved it from the fate of other large European banks such as UBS.[7][8]
On 6 October 2008, BNP took over 75% of troubled bank Fortis' activities in Belgium, and 66% in Luxembourg, in exchange for the Belgian government becoming the new group's major shareholder. The sales of the Fortis shares was suspended by a court order from the Court of Appeal on Friday 12 December[9][10]
On 14 December 2008, BNP announced it could lose €350 million as a victim of the Madoff fraud.[11]
In the end of January, the Belgian government and BNP negotiated for a 75% partnership in Fortis Bank Belgium. Fortis Insurance Belgium would be reintegrated in Fortis Holding.
On 11 February, Fortis' shareholders decided that Fortis Bank Belgium and Fortis Insurance Belgium should not become property of BNP Paribas. However the acquisition was completed and BNP Paribas took 75% share holding and renamed the new subsidiary BNP Paribas Fortis. After this only Fortis Insurance International was left in Fortis Holding and this was renamed as Ageas, a business that had Insurance all over Europe and Asia. The remaining Fortis Bank Netherlands was in the hands of the Dutch Government which merged it with other ABN AMRO holdings it already owned under the name ABN AMRO.
In May 2009, BNP Paribas became the majority shareholder (65.96%) of BGL (formerly Fortis Bank Luxembourg), the State of Luxembourg retaining 34% making BNP the eurozone's largest bank by deposits held.[12]
On 21 September, the bank's registered name was changed to BGL BNP Paribas and in February 2010, BGL BNP Paribas became the 100% owner of BNP Paribas Luxembourg. The transfer was finalised on 1 October 2010 with the incorporation of BNP Paribas Luxembourg's business in the operational platforms of BGL BNP Paribas.[13] In 2013 BNP Paribas was awarded the Bank of the Year award by The International Financing Review ("IFR"), Thomson Reuters' leading financial industry publication. The IFR awards are a key industry benchmark and Bank of the Year is the top honour awarded.[14][15][16]
BNP Paribas reached an agreement in December 2013 to acquire Rabobank's Polish unit BGZ Bank for around $1.4 billion.[17] In September 2014, BNP completed the purchase of BGZ Bank for a final fee stated in the media to be $1.3 billion.[18]
In June 2014, BNP Paribas pleaded guilty to falsifying business records and conspiracy, having violated U.S. sanctions against Cuba, Iran, and Sudan. It agreed to pay an $8.9 billion fine, the largest ever for violating U.S. sanctions at that time.[19][20]
Corporate Identity[edit]
The BNP Paribas logo since 2000 (designed by Laurent Vincent under the leadership of the Communications Director, Antoine Sire) is called the "courbe d'envol" (curve of taking flight). The stars allude to Europe and universality. The transformation of the stars into birds conveys openness, freedom, growth, and the ability to change and adapt. The shape and movement of the curve places the logo in the universe of life. The green square symbolises nature and optimism.
Business units[edit]
In 2015, the BNP Paribas Group was organized around two business areas:
Retail Banking & Services, a global network of nearly 7,000 branches, comprising Domestic Markets and International Financial Services, and Corporate & Institutional Banking (CIB).
At the end of 2015, outstanding deposits stood at EUR700.3 billion and outstanding loans at EUR682.5 billion. The geographic breakdown of revenues was as follows: Europe (73.3%), Americas (11.8%), Asia Pacific (7.5%) and others (7.4%).
Retail banking[edit]
Retail banking is BNP Paribas' largest business unit representing 72% of its 2015 revenues. Its operations are concentrated in Europe, especially in the group's three domestic markets of France, Italy (where it operates as Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL)), and Belgium (as BNP Paribas Fortis). The group also owns an American subsidiary BancWest which operates as Bank of the West in the western United States and First Hawaiian Bank in Hawaii. BNP Paribas's Europe Mediterranean group also runs large retail banks in Poland, Turkey, Ukraine, and northern Africa.
BNP Paribas is the largest bank in the Eurozone by total assets and second largest by market capitalization according to The Banker magazine, just behind Banco Santander. It employs over 189,000 people, according to the bank as of 31 December 2015, of which 147,000 work in Europe, and maintains a presence in 75 countries.
Domestic markets[edit]

France: BNP Paribas runs one of France's largest retail banking networks with 2,200 branches and over 3,200 ATMs. In Paris alone the bank has 187 agencies. BNP Paribas serves over 6 million French households and 60,000 corporate customers. In 2009 The French Retail Banking unit (FRB) had revenues of €6.1 billion (15.2% of total group's), income of €1.5 billion (15% of total group's), and employs 31,000 people (15.4% of total group's workforce)[21]
Italy: In 2006 BNP Paribas purchased Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), Italy's sixth largest bank at the time. In 2009 BNL had 810 branches in Italy, 2.5 million individual clients, and over 150,000 corporate clients. It grossed €2.9 billion in revenue (7.2% of the total group's) and €540 million of net income (9.3% of the total group's), and employs around 13,000 employees (6.5% of the total group's).[21]
Belgium: BNP Paribas acquired BNP Paribas Fortis when it acquired the retail banking assets of the Belgian lender Fortis in 2009. This deal also included Fortis's subsidiaries in Poland and Turkey, now grouped in the "Europe Mediterranean" division.

United States[edit]
In the United States, BNP Paribas owns BancWest, which in turn operates retail banking subsidiaries Bank of the West and First Hawaiian Bank. Bank of the West operates in 19 Western US states (where it ranks as the 7th largest bank by assets), while First Hawaiian is Hawaii's leading bank with a 40% market share in deposits. Together the two banks operate 710 branches, and service 5 million clients.
The two banks were merged into BancWest 1998, and BNP Paribas took full control of the combined entity in 2001.
The group has a strong presence on niche markets such as lending for marine and recreational vehicles, church lending, and agribusiness. In 2009 BancWest had €2.1 billion in revenues (5.2% of the total group's), and 11,200 employees (5.5% of the total group's headcount).[21] BancWest lost €223 million in 2009 largely due to its exposure in the subprime mortgage crisis in California, Arizona, and Nevada.
Emerging markets[edit]
In 2009, BNP Paribas reorganized its retail banking divisions renaming its "Emerging Markets" group the "Europe Mediterranean" group. This change was made because after the integration of Fortis Bank's Polish and Turkish subsidiaries, BNP Paribas's emerging market activities are now heavily concentrated in Eastern Europe and the southern half of the Mediterranean basin.
BNP Paribas is a member of the Global ATM Alliance, a joint venture of several major international banks that allows customers of the banks to use their ATM card or check card at another bank within the Global ATM Alliance with no ATM surcharges when traveling internationally. Other participating banks are Barclays (United Kingdom), Bank of America (United States), China Construction Bank (China), Deutsche Bank (Germany), Santander Serfin (Mexico), UkrSibbank (Ukraine), Scotiabank (Canada) and Westpac (Australia and New Zealand).[22]

Investment solutions[edit]
BNP Paribas's "Investment Solutions" unit includes its asset management, custodial banking, real estate, insurance, online brokerage, "Personal Investors" and wealth management activities.[21]
On 11 June 2008, BNP Paribas formally signed an agreement to purchase the Prime Brokerage Services division of Bank of America Securities. The sale was expected to be completed by the end of the 2008 third quarter.
In 2016, BNP Paribas set up a dedicated fintech accelerator to support start-ups that are seeking to improve the customer experience. The programme provided funding of up to €100,000 to chosen fintech firms in order to help develop new products, services and opportunities across the company.[25]

Asset Management: The asset management activities of BNP Paribas are grouped under BNP Paribas Investment Partners. In 2009 BNP Paribas IP had 2,400 employees in more than 70 countries and US $395.1 billion in assets under management (AuM) in 2014 according to the Scorpio Partnership,[26] an increase of 11% over 2013.[26]

Events in 2005[edit]
On 23 September 2005, BNP Paribas was set to take a 20 percent stake in China's Nanjing City Commercial Bank, a Chinese official and state press reports said. "BNP is going to sign a deal with us to buy a stake next month," an official from Nanjing City Commercial told AFP. The Shanghai-based Oriental Morning Post said BNP would pay up to US$100 million, although the bank official said the figure was incorrect. He declined to give further details. The French newspaper La Tribune reported in August 2005 that BNP Paribas had talked to four Chinese commercial banks—Ningbo, Wuxi, Nanjing and Suzhou—and was prepared to invest US$50–100 million. "We've talked to different financial institutions, but only BNP showed its good faith. It was not easy for us to reach an agreement," the Nanjing City Commercial Bank official said. BNP Paribas refused to comment. The International Financial Corporation, the investment arm of the World Bank, already owns 15 percent of Nanjing City Commercial Bank, which has regulatory approval to list on the country's domestic stock markets.

Controversies[edit]
Check processing[edit]
In 2010 the French government's Autorité de la concurrence fined BNP and 10 other banks €384 million for colluding to charge unjustified fees on check processing, including extra fees during the transition from paper check transfer to "Exchanges Check-Image" electronic transfer.[34] On 19 January 2011 BNP sued Russian grain trader, OOO Rosinteragroservis, and its subsidiary OAO Kubankhlebprodukt, claiming US$20 million in debts and penalties.[35]
Nuclear investments[edit]
BNP Paribas is the biggest investor in the nuclear sector as a bank, according to Profundo, with more than €13.5 billion in nuclear investments. On 23 October 2011 Greenpeace organised a protest against BNP Paribas in 24 French cities.[36]
Sanctions violations[edit]
On 30 May 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that the United States Department of Justice was negotiating a possible guilty plea with BNP Paribas as well as the size of the resulting fine for violating U.S. regulations and evading US sanctions. The Justice Department sought a fine of more than US $10 billion, which was expected to be reduced to $8 or $9 billion in negotiations.[37] BNP Paribas was said to have laundered up to US $100 billion from the sanctioned countries of Sudan, Iran, and Cuba.[38]
On 1 July 2014, BNP Paribas pled guilty in a New York state court to falsifying business records as well as conspiracy in connection to those falsifications. It is also expected to plead guilty in federal court to violating laws against money-laundering.[39] It agreed to pay $8.9 billion, the largest fine ever for violating U.S. sanctions, and substantially more than the previous record of $1.9 billion.[19][39] BNP Paribas was also barred for one year under the plea agreement from certain US dollar-dominated transactions. The fine exceeded the bank's $6.4 billion 2013 annual income and the $1.1 billion it previously had allocated for the anticipated fine.[39][40]
The bank's failure to cooperate with the multi-year investigation was given as a significant factor in the size of the fine. Additionally, BNP Paribas continued to process sanctioned transactions after the investigation began. About 30 employees left the bank as a result of the investigation.[39] According to the FBI’s New York Field Office and Chief Richard Weber of the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) "BNPP deliberately disregarded the law and provided rogue nations, and Sudan in particular, with vital access to the global financial system, helping that country’s lawless government to harbor and support terrorists and to persecute its own people. Today’s sentence demonstrates that financial institutions will be punished severely but appropriately for violating sanctions laws and risking our national security interests."[41]
After the fine was announced, BNP said it would be "just fine" and that it had "a comprehensive plan" to avoid similar violations in the future. The company's stock, which had fallen 12% since news of the investigation first leaked, rose 4% on the announcement.[39][40] To comply with the transaction ban, BNP Paribas will use a third party to clear its US transactions. Standard & Poor's said it was reviewing the bank's financial standing[when?] in light of the fine and penalties for a possible downgrade.[39]
Russian president Vladimir Putin alleged without providing any supporting evidence that the US government was using the case to punish France for selling Mistral amphibious assault ships to Russia. He said the large fine and the imposition of sanctions on the French bank were the result of US displeasure with France's decision not to stop the sale.[42] Former European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet had previously said that a large fine was neither fair nor proportionate to the violations and could disrupt the global banking system.[39]
152 Million Erroneous Trade case[edit]
The German FOCUS magazine and the French Les Echos newspaper published an article regarding a 163 Million EUR mistrade (erroneous trade) in which BNP Paribas Arbitrage is allegedly involved.[43][44] The bank has sold securities for 326,400 EUR to the investor Armin S. but the value of the securities is 163 Million EUR according to the bank.
According to the article, the error remained unnoticed for several days. BNP has even reconfirmed the original price. However, a trade-cancellation was only possible until the next day according to prevailing mistrade rules.
A German lawyer stated in the article that a bank not recognizing an error of this magnitude should not be protected by law.[43][45] [46]
Sponsorship[edit]
BNP Paribas has been a major sponsor of tennis. In 1973 it became the major sponsor of the French Open, one of the four prestigious Grand Slam tournaments in the sport. In 2001 the bank began to sponsor the Davis Cup before becoming the title sponsor in 2002. Also in 2002 it became the sponsor of the Paris Masters, one of the nine high-profile tournaments of the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 series. It also expanded to the United States in 2009 when it became the title sponsor of the Indian Wells Masters, a two-week tournament in California which is also one of the nine Masters 1000 series. The Stanford Classic, since 1992, is instead directly sponsored by the Bank of the West subsidiary.
Corporate philanthropy[edit]
Under the aegis of the Fondation de France, the BNP Paribas Foundation[47] has been playing a key role in corporate philanthropy for more than 30 years. It is also encouraging to developing the BNP Paribas international philanthropic policy where the Group does business.
The BNP Paribas Foundation[47] aims at developing its activities through a corporate philanthropic approach, dedicated to three fields of action:

The Arts: contemporary dance, new circus arts, jazz music, restoration of artworks, classical music festivals;
Solidarity : programme focusing on equal opportunities, social entrepreneurship, fight against exclusion and situations of extreme deprivation;
The Environmental research: support to laboratories in France, in Europe and on an international collaboration so as to implement the research projects on climate change.

The BNP Paribas Foundation supports since 1984, more than 300 cultural projects, 40 programmes on research, and a thousand of social & educational initiatives in France and worldwide. Its major programmes are:

Dream Up, new international educational programme based on the practice of the arts;
BNP Paribas for Art, programme supporting restoration of works of arts since 1994;
Climate Initiative, in support of fundamental research on climate change;
Projet Banlieues, initiative created in connection with the BNP Paribas network of agencies inside the Solidarity activity;
Help to Help, a programme that promotes the Group staff initiative as volunteers.

In 2015, BNP Paribas Corporate Philanthropy in the world represented a commitment of almost 40 million euros.
In 2015, Standard Ethics Aei has given a Sustainability Rating to BNP Paribas (EE+) in order to include it in its Standard Ethics French Index.[48]

History[edit]
Name in brief[edit]
The Banque Nationale de Paris S.A. (BNP) resulted from a merger of two French banks – Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie (BNCI) and Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris (CNEP) – in 1966.
The Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas S.A. (Bank of Paris and the Netherlands), or Paribas, was formed from two investment banks based respectively in Paris and Amsterdam, in 1872. Les Pays-Bas ("The Low Countries") is French for the Netherlands.
In May 2000, BNP and Paribas merged to form BNP Paribas, which is thus descended from four founding banking institutions.
Background and heritage as four banks: 1820–2000[edit]
BNP (Banque Nationale de Paris)[edit]
Main articles: Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris and Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie
On 7 March 1848, the French Provisional Government founded the Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris (CNEP) in response to the financial shock caused by the revolution of February 1848. The upheaval destroyed the old credit system, which was already struggling to provide sufficient capital to meet the demands of the railway boom and the resulting growth of industry. The CEP grew steadily in France and overseas, although in 1889 there was a crisis in which it was temporarily placed in receivership.
Separately, on 18 April 1932, the French government replaced Banque nationale de crédit (BNC), which failed as a result of the 1930s recession, with the new bank Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie (BNCI). The former banks headquarter and staff were used to create BNCI with fresh capital of 100 million francs. The bank initially grew rapidly through absorbing a number of regional banks that got into financial trouble. After the Second World War, it continued to grow steadily. It grew its retail business in France and its commercial business overseas in the French colonial empire.
After the end of the Second World War, the French state decided to "put banks and credit to work for national reconstruction". René Pleven, then Minister of Finance, launched a massive reorganization of the banking industry. A law passed on 2 December 1945 and which went into effect on 1 January 1946 nationalized the four leading French retail banks: Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie (BNCI), Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris (CNEP), Crédit Lyonnais, and Société Générale.
In 1966, the French government decided to merge Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris with Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie to create one new bank called Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP).
The bank was re-privatised in 1993 under the leadership of Michel Pébereau as part of a second Chirac government's privatization policy.[5][6]
Paribas (Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas)[edit]
See also: Paribas and Bischoffsheim family
Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas (Paribas) was established on 27 January 1872, through the merger of Banque de Crédit et de Dépôt des Pays-Bas, which had been established in 1820 by Louis-Raphaël Bischoffsheim in Amsterdam, and Banque de Paris, which had been founded in 1869 by a group of Parisian bankers. It went on to develop a strong investment banking business both domestically in France and overseas.
During the period 1872 to 1913, it was involved in raising funds for the French and other governments as well as big businesses through a number of bond issues. It helped the French government raise funds during the First World War and raised further capital and expanded into investments into industrial companies during the Great Depression. It stagnated and lost assets during the Second World War.
After World War II, it missed the nationalisation of the other French banks due to its status as an investment bank and managed to take advantage of that by expanding its operations overseas. It also directs its activity towards businesses and participates in the development and restructuring of French industry, including names such as Groupe Bull and Thomson-CSF.
The bank was nationalized in 1982 by the government of Pierre Mauroy under François Mitterrand as part of a law that nationalized five major industrial companies, thirty-nine registered banks, and two financial companies, Suez and Paribas. It was re-privatized in January 1987 by the Chirac government.
In the 1990s, Paribas had an active policy of acquisitions and divestiture. This included selling the Ottoman Bank to Doğuş Holding, and setting up the joint venture lending company Cetelem in Germany. It sold Crédit du Nord to Société Générale and in 1998 it merged with Compagnie Bancaire, renaming the bank with the official name Compagnie Financière de Paribas.
Founding of BNP Paribas till date: 2000–present[edit]
In 1999, BNP and Société Générale fought a complex battle on the stock market, with Société Générale bidding for Paribas and BNP bidding for Société Générale and counter-bidding for Paribas. BNP's bid for Société Générale failed, while its bid for Paribas succeeded leading to a merger of BNP and Paribas one year later on 22 May 2000.
On 9 August 2007, BNP Paribas became the first major financial group to acknowledge the impact of the sub-prime crisis by closing two funds exposed to it. This day is now generally seen as the start of the credit crisis and the bank's quick reaction saved it from the fate of other large European banks such as UBS.[7][8]
On 6 October 2008, BNP took over 75% of troubled bank Fortis' activities in Belgium, and 66% in Luxembourg, in exchange for the Belgian government becoming the new group's major shareholder. The sales of the Fortis shares was suspended by a court order from the Court of Appeal on Friday 12 December[9][10]
On 14 December 2008, BNP announced it could lose €350 million as a victim of the Madoff fraud.[11]
In the end of January, the Belgian government and BNP negotiated for a 75% partnership in Fortis Bank Belgium. Fortis Insurance Belgium would be reintegrated in Fortis Holding.
On 11 February, Fortis' shareholders decided that Fortis Bank Belgium and Fortis Insurance Belgium should not become property of BNP Paribas. However the acquisition was completed and BNP Paribas took 75% share holding and renamed the new subsidiary BNP Paribas Fortis. After this only Fortis Insurance International was left in Fortis Holding and this was renamed as Ageas, a business that had Insurance all over Europe and Asia. The remaining Fortis Bank Netherlands was in the hands of the Dutch Government which merged it with other ABN AMRO holdings it already owned under the name ABN AMRO.
In May 2009, BNP Paribas became the majority shareholder (65.96%) of BGL (formerly Fortis Bank Luxembourg), the State of Luxembourg retaining 34% making BNP the eurozone's largest bank by deposits held.[12]
On 21 September, the bank's registered name was changed to BGL BNP Paribas and in February 2010, BGL BNP Paribas became the 100% owner of BNP Paribas Luxembourg. The transfer was finalised on 1 October 2010 with the incorporation of BNP Paribas Luxembourg's business in the operational platforms of BGL BNP Paribas.[13] In 2013 BNP Paribas was awarded the Bank of the Year award by The International Financing Review ("IFR"), Thomson Reuters' leading financial industry publication. The IFR awards are a key industry benchmark and Bank of the Year is the top honour awarded.[14][15][16]
BNP Paribas reached an agreement in December 2013 to acquire Rabobank's Polish unit BGZ Bank for around $1.4 billion.[17] In September 2014, BNP completed the purchase of BGZ Bank for a final fee stated in the media to be $1.3 billion.[18]
In June 2014, BNP Paribas pleaded guilty to falsifying business records and conspiracy, having violated U.S. sanctions against Cuba, Iran, and Sudan. It agreed to pay an $8.9 billion fine, the largest ever for violating U.S. sanctions at that time.[19][20]
Corporate Identity[edit]
The BNP Paribas logo since 2000 (designed by Laurent Vincent under the leadership of the Communications Director, Antoine Sire) is called the "courbe d'envol" (curve of taking flight). The stars allude to Europe and universality. The transformation of the stars into birds conveys openness, freedom, growth, and the ability to change and adapt. The shape and movement of the curve places the logo in the universe of life. The green square symbolises nature and optimism.
Business units[edit]
In 2015, the BNP Paribas Group was organized around two business areas:
Retail Banking & Services, a global network of nearly 7,000 branches, comprising Domestic Markets and International Financial Services, and Corporate & Institutional Banking (CIB).
At the end of 2015, outstanding deposits stood at EUR700.3 billion and outstanding loans at EUR682.5 billion. The geographic breakdown of revenues was as follows: Europe (73.3%), Americas (11.8%), Asia Pacific (7.5%) and others (7.4%).
Retail banking[edit]
Retail banking is BNP Paribas' largest business unit representing 72% of its 2015 revenues. Its operations are concentrated in Europe, especially in the group's three domestic markets of France, Italy (where it operates as Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL)), and Belgium (as BNP Paribas Fortis). The group also owns an American subsidiary BancWest which operates as Bank of the West in the western United States and First Hawaiian Bank in Hawaii. BNP Paribas's Europe Mediterranean group also runs large retail banks in Poland, Turkey, Ukraine, and northern Africa.
BNP Paribas is the largest bank in the Eurozone by total assets and second largest by market capitalization according to The Banker magazine, just behind Banco Santander. It employs over 189,000 people, according to the bank as of 31 December 2015, of which 147,000 work in Europe, and maintains a presence in 75 countries.
Domestic markets[edit]

France: BNP Paribas runs one of France's largest retail banking networks with 2,200 branches and over 3,200 ATMs. In Paris alone the bank has 187 agencies. BNP Paribas serves over 6 million French households and 60,000 corporate customers. In 2009 The French Retail Banking unit (FRB) had revenues of €6.1 billion (15.2% of total group's), income of €1.5 billion (15% of total group's), and employs 31,000 people (15.4% of total group's workforce)[21]
Italy: In 2006 BNP Paribas purchased Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), Italy's sixth largest bank at the time. In 2009 BNL had 810 branches in Italy, 2.5 million individual clients, and over 150,000 corporate clients. It grossed €2.9 billion in revenue (7.2% of the total group's) and €540 million of net income (9.3% of the total group's), and employs around 13,000 employees (6.5% of the total group's).[21]
Belgium: BNP Paribas acquired BNP Paribas Fortis when it acquired the retail banking assets of the Belgian lender Fortis in 2009. This deal also included Fortis's subsidiaries in Poland and Turkey, now grouped in the "Europe Mediterranean" division.

United States[edit]
In the United States, BNP Paribas owns BancWest, which in turn operates retail banking subsidiaries Bank of the West and First Hawaiian Bank. Bank of the West operates in 19 Western US states (where it ranks as the 7th largest bank by assets), while First Hawaiian is Hawaii's leading bank with a 40% market share in deposits. Together the two banks operate 710 branches, and service 5 million clients.
The two banks were merged into BancWest 1998, and BNP Paribas took full control of the combined entity in 2001.
The group has a strong presence on niche markets such as lending for marine and recreational vehicles, church lending, and agribusiness. In 2009 BancWest had €2.1 billion in revenues (5.2% of the total group's), and 11,200 employees (5.5% of the total group's headcount).[21] BancWest lost €223 million in 2009 largely due to its exposure in the subprime mortgage crisis in California, Arizona, and Nevada.
Emerging markets[edit]
In 2009, BNP Paribas reorganized its retail banking divisions renaming its "Emerging Markets" group the "Europe Mediterranean" group. This change was made because after the integration of Fortis Bank's Polish and Turkish subsidiaries, BNP Paribas's emerging market activities are now heavily concentrated in Eastern Europe and the southern half of the Mediterranean basin.
BNP Paribas is a member of the Global ATM Alliance, a joint venture of several major international banks that allows customers of the banks to use their ATM card or check card at another bank within the Global ATM Alliance with no ATM surcharges when traveling internationally. Other participating banks are Barclays (United Kingdom), Bank of America (United States), China Construction Bank (China), Deutsche Bank (Germany), Santander Serfin (Mexico), UkrSibbank (Ukraine), Scotiabank (Canada) and Westpac (Australia and New Zealand).[22]

Fixed Income: BNP Paribas' fixed income team helps companies hedge their exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate, and credit risks, primarily though the structuring and sale of derivative products such as interest rate and foreign exchange swaps, foreign exchange options and credit derivatives. It also trades in these markets on behalf of clients or for its own proprietary account. On an average day, a quarter of a trillion dollars in fixed income instruments are traded at BNP Paribas Americas’ fixed income trading floor located just blocks from the NASDAQ MarketSite in Manhattan, New York City.[23][24]
Equity & Derivatives: BNP Paribas' Equity & Derivatives team helps companies manage their risks and investment portfolios with equity derivatives such as options, futures, and swaps, as well as highly complex, customized solutions such as structured products. It also trades in these markets on behalf of clients or for its own proprietary account.
Commodity Derivatives: BNP Paribas' Commodity Derivatives team helps clients hedge their exposure to commodity risk though the structuring and sale of commodity futures and OTC commodity swaps. It also trades in these markets on behalf of its clients or proprietary account.
Investment Banking: BNP Paribas' Corporate Finance team performs most of the traditional investment banking functions of the group including mergers and acquisitions advisory, and equity raising operations such as Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), rights issues, and convertible bond issues.
Structured Finance: BNP Paribas' Structured Finance group offers clients project finance solutions, export financing, syndicated loans, and financing for acquisitions and leveraged buyouts.
Corporate & Transaction Group: BNP Paribas' Corporate and Transaction group offers clients simplified flow banking services including trade finance, international cash management, and basic hedging solutions.

In 2009, BNP CIB earned €12.2 billion in revenue (30% of total group's), €4.4 billion in pre-tax income (48.9% of total group's), and 18,000 employees (9.0% of total group's headcount.)[21]
Investment solutions[edit]
BNP Paribas's "Investment Solutions" unit includes its asset management, custodial banking, real estate, insurance, online brokerage, "Personal Investors" and wealth management activities.[21]
On 11 June 2008, BNP Paribas formally signed an agreement to purchase the Prime Brokerage Services division of Bank of America Securities. The sale was expected to be completed by the end of the 2008 third quarter.
In 2016, BNP Paribas set up a dedicated fintech accelerator to support start-ups that are seeking to improve the customer experience. The programme provided funding of up to €100,000 to chosen fintech firms in order to help develop new products, services and opportunities across the company.[25]

Asset Management: The asset management activities of BNP Paribas are grouped under BNP Paribas Investment Partners. In 2009 BNP Paribas IP had 2,400 employees in more than 70 countries and US $395.1 billion in assets under management (AuM) in 2014 according to the Scorpio Partnership,[26] an increase of 11% over 2013.[26]

Events in 2005[edit]
On 23 September 2005, BNP Paribas was set to take a 20 percent stake in China's Nanjing City Commercial Bank, a Chinese official and state press reports said. "BNP is going to sign a deal with us to buy a stake next month," an official from Nanjing City Commercial told AFP. The Shanghai-based Oriental Morning Post said BNP would pay up to US$100 million, although the bank official said the figure was incorrect. He declined to give further details. The French newspaper La Tribune reported in August 2005 that BNP Paribas had talked to four Chinese commercial banks—Ningbo, Wuxi, Nanjing and Suzhou—and was prepared to invest US$50–100 million. "We've talked to different financial institutions, but only BNP showed its good faith. It was not easy for us to reach an agreement," the Nanjing City Commercial Bank official said. BNP Paribas refused to comment. The International Financial Corporation, the investment arm of the World Bank, already owns 15 percent of Nanjing City Commercial Bank, which has regulatory approval to list on the country's domestic stock markets.

Controversies[edit]
Check processing[edit]
In 2010 the French government's Autorité de la concurrence fined BNP and 10 other banks €384 million for colluding to charge unjustified fees on check processing, including extra fees during the transition from paper check transfer to "Exchanges Check-Image" electronic transfer.[34] On 19 January 2011 BNP sued Russian grain trader, OOO Rosinteragroservis, and its subsidiary OAO Kubankhlebprodukt, claiming US$20 million in debts and penalties.[35]
Nuclear investments[edit]
BNP Paribas is the biggest investor in the nuclear sector as a bank, according to Profundo, with more than €13.5 billion in nuclear investments. On 23 October 2011 Greenpeace organised a protest against BNP Paribas in 24 French cities.[36]
Sanctions violations[edit]
On 30 May 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that the United States Department of Justice was negotiating a possible guilty plea with BNP Paribas as well as the size of the resulting fine for violating U.S. regulations and evading US sanctions. The Justice Department sought a fine of more than US $10 billion, which was expected to be reduced to $8 or $9 billion in negotiations.[37] BNP Paribas was said to have laundered up to US $100 billion from the sanctioned countries of Sudan, Iran, and Cuba.[38]
On 1 July 2014, BNP Paribas pled guilty in a New York state court to falsifying business records as well as conspiracy in connection to those falsifications. It is also expected to plead guilty in federal court to violating laws against money-laundering.[39] It agreed to pay $8.9 billion, the largest fine ever for violating U.S. sanctions, and substantially more than the previous record of $1.9 billion.[19][39] BNP Paribas was also barred for one year under the plea agreement from certain US dollar-dominated transactions. The fine exceeded the bank's $6.4 billion 2013 annual income and the $1.1 billion it previously had allocated for the anticipated fine.[39][40]
The bank's failure to cooperate with the multi-year investigation was given as a significant factor in the size of the fine. Additionally, BNP Paribas continued to process sanctioned transactions after the investigation began. About 30 employees left the bank as a result of the investigation.[39] According to the FBI’s New York Field Office and Chief Richard Weber of the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) "BNPP deliberately disregarded the law and provided rogue nations, and Sudan in particular, with vital access to the global financial system, helping that country’s lawless government to harbor and support terrorists and to persecute its own people. Today’s sentence demonstrates that financial institutions will be punished severely but appropriately for violating sanctions laws and risking our national security interests."[41]
After the fine was announced, BNP said it would be "just fine" and that it had "a comprehensive plan" to avoid similar violations in the future. The company's stock, which had fallen 12% since news of the investigation first leaked, rose 4% on the announcement.[39][40] To comply with the transaction ban, BNP Paribas will use a third party to clear its US transactions. Standard & Poor's said it was reviewing the bank's financial standing[when?] in light of the fine and penalties for a possible downgrade.[39]
Russian president Vladimir Putin alleged without providing any supporting evidence that the US government was using the case to punish France for selling Mistral amphibious assault ships to Russia. He said the large fine and the imposition of sanctions on the French bank were the result of US displeasure with France's decision not to stop the sale.[42] Former European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet had previously said that a large fine was neither fair nor proportionate to the violations and could disrupt the global banking system.[39]
152 Million Erroneous Trade case[edit]
The German FOCUS magazine and the French Les Echos newspaper published an article regarding a 163 Million EUR mistrade (erroneous trade) in which BNP Paribas Arbitrage is allegedly involved.[43][44] The bank has sold securities for 326,400 EUR to the investor Armin S. but the value of the securities is 163 Million EUR according to the bank.
According to the article, the error remained unnoticed for several days. BNP has even reconfirmed the original price. However, a trade-cancellation was only possible until the next day according to prevailing mistrade rules.
A German lawyer stated in the article that a bank not recognizing an error of this magnitude should not be protected by law.[43][45] [46]
Sponsorship[edit]
BNP Paribas has been a major sponsor of tennis. In 1973 it became the major sponsor of the French Open, one of the four prestigious Grand Slam tournaments in the sport. In 2001 the bank began to sponsor the Davis Cup before becoming the title sponsor in 2002. Also in 2002 it became the sponsor of the Paris Masters, one of the nine high-profile tournaments of the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 series. It also expanded to the United States in 2009 when it became the title sponsor of the Indian Wells Masters, a two-week tournament in California which is also one of the nine Masters 1000 series. The Stanford Classic, since 1992, is instead directly sponsored by the Bank of the West subsidiary.
Corporate philanthropy[edit]
Under the aegis of the Fondation de France, the BNP Paribas Foundation[47] has been playing a key role in corporate philanthropy for more than 30 years. It is also encouraging to developing the BNP Paribas international philanthropic policy where the Group does business.
The BNP Paribas Foundation[47] aims at developing its activities through a corporate philanthropic approach, dedicated to three fields of action:

The Arts: contemporary dance, new circus arts, jazz music, restoration of artworks, classical music festivals;
Solidarity : programme focusing on equal opportunities, social entrepreneurship, fight against exclusion and situations of extreme deprivation;
The Environmental research: support to laboratories in France, in Europe and on an international collaboration so as to implement the research projects on climate change.

The BNP Paribas Foundation supports since 1984, more than 300 cultural projects, 40 programmes on research, and a thousand of social & educational initiatives in France and worldwide. Its major programmes are:

Dream Up, new international educational programme based on the practice of the arts;
BNP Paribas for Art, programme supporting restoration of works of arts since 1994;
Climate Initiative, in support of fundamental research on climate change;
Projet Banlieues, initiative created in connection with the BNP Paribas network of agencies inside the Solidarity activity;
Help to Help, a programme that promotes the Group staff initiative as volunteers.

In 2015, BNP Paribas Corporate Philanthropy in the world represented a commitment of almost 40 million euros.
In 2015, Standard Ethics Aei has given a Sustainability Rating to BNP Paribas (EE+) in order to include it in its Standard Ethics French Index.[48]

History[edit]
Name in brief[edit]
The Banque Nationale de Paris S.A. (BNP) resulted from a merger of two French banks – Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie (BNCI) and Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris (CNEP) – in 1966.
The Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas S.A. (Bank of Paris and the Netherlands), or Paribas, was formed from two investment banks based respectively in Paris and Amsterdam, in 1872. Les Pays-Bas ("The Low Countries") is French for the Netherlands.
In May 2000, BNP and Paribas merged to form BNP Paribas, which is thus descended from four founding banking institutions.
Background and heritage as four banks: 1820–2000[edit]
BNP (Banque Nationale de Paris)[edit]
Main articles: Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris and Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie
On 7 March 1848, the French Provisional Government founded the Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris (CNEP) in response to the financial shock caused by the revolution of February 1848. The upheaval destroyed the old credit system, which was already struggling to provide sufficient capital to meet the demands of the railway boom and the resulting growth of industry. The CEP grew steadily in France and overseas, although in 1889 there was a crisis in which it was temporarily placed in receivership.
Separately, on 18 April 1932, the French government replaced Banque nationale de crédit (BNC), which failed as a result of the 1930s recession, with the new bank Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie (BNCI). The former banks headquarter and staff were used to create BNCI with fresh capital of 100 million francs. The bank initially grew rapidly through absorbing a number of regional banks that got into financial trouble. After the Second World War, it continued to grow steadily. It grew its retail business in France and its commercial business overseas in the French colonial empire.
After the end of the Second World War, the French state decided to "put banks and credit to work for national reconstruction". René Pleven, then Minister of Finance, launched a massive reorganization of the banking industry. A law passed on 2 December 1945 and which went into effect on 1 January 1946 nationalized the four leading French retail banks: Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie (BNCI), Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris (CNEP), Crédit Lyonnais, and Société Générale.
In 1966, the French government decided to merge Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris with Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie to create one new bank called Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP).
The bank was re-privatised in 1993 under the leadership of Michel Pébereau as part of a second Chirac government's privatization policy.[5][6]
Paribas (Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas)[edit]
See also: Paribas and Bischoffsheim family
Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas (Paribas) was established on 27 January 1872, through the merger of Banque de Crédit et de Dépôt des Pays-Bas, which had been established in 1820 by Louis-Raphaël Bischoffsheim in Amsterdam, and Banque de Paris, which had been founded in 1869 by a group of Parisian bankers. It went on to develop a strong investment banking business both domestically in France and overseas.
During the period 1872 to 1913, it was involved in raising funds for the French and other governments as well as big businesses through a number of bond issues. It helped the French government raise funds during the First World War and raised further capital and expanded into investments into industrial companies during the Great Depression. It stagnated and lost assets during the Second World War.
After World War II, it missed the nationalisation of the other French banks due to its status as an investment bank and managed to take advantage of that by expanding its operations overseas. It also directs its activity towards businesses and participates in the development and restructuring of French industry, including names such as Groupe Bull and Thomson-CSF.
The bank was nationalized in 1982 by the government of Pierre Mauroy under François Mitterrand as part of a law that nationalized five major industrial companies, thirty-nine registered banks, and two financial companies, Suez and Paribas. It was re-privatized in January 1987 by the Chirac government.
In the 1990s, Paribas had an active policy of acquisitions and divestiture. This included selling the Ottoman Bank to Doğuş Holding, and setting up the joint venture lending company Cetelem in Germany. It sold Crédit du Nord to Société Générale and in 1998 it merged with Compagnie Bancaire, renaming the bank with the official name Compagnie Financière de Paribas.
Founding of BNP Paribas till date: 2000–present[edit]
In 1999, BNP and Société Générale fought a complex battle on the stock market, with Société Générale bidding for Paribas and BNP bidding for Société Générale and counter-bidding for Paribas. BNP's bid for Société Générale failed, while its bid for Paribas succeeded leading to a merger of BNP and Paribas one year later on 22 May 2000.
On 9 August 2007, BNP Paribas became the first major financial group to acknowledge the impact of the sub-prime crisis by closing two funds exposed to it. This day is now generally seen as the start of the credit crisis and the bank's quick reaction saved it from the fate of other large European banks such as UBS.[7][8]
On 6 October 2008, BNP took over 75% of troubled bank Fortis' activities in Belgium, and 66% in Luxembourg, in exchange for the Belgian government becoming the new group's major shareholder. The sales of the Fortis shares was suspended by a court order from the Court of Appeal on Friday 12 December[9][10]
On 14 December 2008, BNP announced it could lose €350 million as a victim of the Madoff fraud.[11]
In the end of January, the Belgian government and BNP negotiated for a 75% partnership in Fortis Bank Belgium. Fortis Insurance Belgium would be reintegrated in Fortis Holding.
On 11 February, Fortis' shareholders decided that Fortis Bank Belgium and Fortis Insurance Belgium should not become property of BNP Paribas. However the acquisition was completed and BNP Paribas took 75% share holding and renamed the new subsidiary BNP Paribas Fortis. After this only Fortis Insurance International was left in Fortis Holding and this was renamed as Ageas, a business that had Insurance all over Europe and Asia. The remaining Fortis Bank Netherlands was in the hands of the Dutch Government which merged it with other ABN AMRO holdings it already owned under the name ABN AMRO.
In May 2009, BNP Paribas became the majority shareholder (65.96%) of BGL (formerly Fortis Bank Luxembourg), the State of Luxembourg retaining 34% making BNP the eurozone's largest bank by deposits held.[12]
On 21 September, the bank's registered name was changed to BGL BNP Paribas and in February 2010, BGL BNP Paribas became the 100% owner of BNP Paribas Luxembourg. The transfer was finalised on 1 October 2010 with the incorporation of BNP Paribas Luxembourg's business in the operational platforms of BGL BNP Paribas.[13] In 2013 BNP Paribas was awarded the Bank of the Year award by The International Financing Review ("IFR"), Thomson Reuters' leading financial industry publication. The IFR awards are a key industry benchmark and Bank of the Year is the top honour awarded.[14][15][16]
BNP Paribas reached an agreement in December 2013 to acquire Rabobank's Polish unit BGZ Bank for around $1.4 billion.[17] In September 2014, BNP completed the purchase of BGZ Bank for a final fee stated in the media to be $1.3 billion.[18]
In June 2014, BNP Paribas pleaded guilty to falsifying business records and conspiracy, having violated U.S. sanctions against Cuba, Iran, and Sudan. It agreed to pay an $8.9 billion fine, the largest ever for violating U.S. sanctions at that time.[19][20]
Corporate Identity[edit]
The BNP Paribas logo since 2000 (designed by Laurent Vincent under the leadership of the Communications Director, Antoine Sire) is called the "courbe d'envol" (curve of taking flight). The stars allude to Europe and universality. The transformation of the stars into birds conveys openness, freedom, growth, and the ability to change and adapt. The shape and movement of the curve places the logo in the universe of life. The green square symbolises nature and optimism.
Business units[edit]
In 2015, the BNP Paribas Group was organized around two business areas:
Retail Banking & Services, a global network of nearly 7,000 branches, comprising Domestic Markets and International Financial Services, and Corporate & Institutional Banking (CIB).
At the end of 2015, outstanding deposits stood at EUR700.3 billion and outstanding loans at EUR682.5 billion. The geographic breakdown of revenues was as follows: Europe (73.3%), Americas (11.8%), Asia Pacific (7.5%) and others (7.4%).
Retail banking[edit]
Retail banking is BNP Paribas' largest business unit representing 72% of its 2015 revenues. Its operations are concentrated in Europe, especially in the group's three domestic markets of France, Italy (where it operates as Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL)), and Belgium (as BNP Paribas Fortis). The group also owns an American subsidiary BancWest which operates as Bank of the West in the western United States and First Hawaiian Bank in Hawaii. BNP Paribas's Europe Mediterranean group also runs large retail banks in Poland, Turkey, Ukraine, and northern Africa.
BNP Paribas is the largest bank in the Eurozone by total assets and second largest by market capitalization according to The Banker magazine, just behind Banco Santander. It employs over 189,000 people, according to the bank as of 31 December 2015, of which 147,000 work in Europe, and maintains a presence in 75 countries.
Domestic markets[edit]

France: BNP Paribas runs one of France's largest retail banking networks with 2,200 branches and over 3,200 ATMs. In Paris alone the bank has 187 agencies. BNP Paribas serves over 6 million French households and 60,000 corporate customers. In 2009 The French Retail Banking unit (FRB) had revenues of €6.1 billion (15.2% of total group's), income of €1.5 billion (15% of total group's), and employs 31,000 people (15.4% of total group's workforce)[21]
Italy: In 2006 BNP Paribas purchased Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), Italy's sixth largest bank at the time. In 2009 BNL had 810 branches in Italy, 2.5 million individual clients, and over 150,000 corporate clients. It grossed €2.9 billion in revenue (7.2% of the total group's) and €540 million of net income (9.3% of the total group's), and employs around 13,000 employees (6.5% of the total group's).[21]
Belgium: BNP Paribas acquired BNP Paribas Fortis when it acquired the retail banking assets of the Belgian lender Fortis in 2009. This deal also included Fortis's subsidiaries in Poland and Turkey, now grouped in the "Europe Mediterranean" division.

United States[edit]
In the United States, BNP Paribas owns BancWest, which in turn operates retail banking subsidiaries Bank of the West and First Hawaiian Bank. Bank of the West operates in 19 Western US states (where it ranks as the 7th largest bank by assets), while First Hawaiian is Hawaii's leading bank with a 40% market share in deposits. Together the two banks operate 710 branches, and service 5 million clients.
The two banks were merged into BancWest 1998, and BNP Paribas took full control of the combined entity in 2001.
The group has a strong presence on niche markets such as lending for marine and recreational vehicles, church lending, and agribusiness. In 2009 BancWest had €2.1 billion in revenues (5.2% of the total group's), and 11,200 employees (5.5% of the total group's headcount).[21] BancWest lost €223 million in 2009 largely due to its exposure in the subprime mortgage crisis in California, Arizona, and Nevada.
Emerging markets[edit]
In 2009, BNP Paribas reorganized its retail banking divisions renaming its "Emerging Markets" group the "Europe Mediterranean" group. This change was made because after the integration of Fortis Bank's Polish and Turkish subsidiaries, BNP Paribas's emerging market activities are now heavily concentrated in Eastern Europe and the southern half of the Mediterranean basin.
BNP Paribas is a member of the Global ATM Alliance, a joint venture of several major international banks that allows customers of the banks to use their ATM card or check card at another bank within the Global ATM Alliance with no ATM surcharges when traveling internationally. Other participating banks are Barclays (United Kingdom), Bank of America (United States), China Construction Bank (China), Deutsche Bank (Germany), Santander Serfin (Mexico), UkrSibbank (Ukraine), Scotiabank (Canada) and Westpac (Australia and New Zealand).[22]

Equity & Derivatives: BNP Paribas' Equity & Derivatives team helps companies manage their risks and investment portfolios with equity derivatives such as options, futures, and swaps, as well as highly complex, customized solutions such as structured products. It also trades in these markets on behalf of clients or for its own proprietary account.

Investment solutions[edit]
BNP Paribas's "Investment Solutions" unit includes its asset management, custodial banking, real estate, insurance, online brokerage, "Personal Investors" and wealth management activities.[21]
On 11 June 2008, BNP Paribas formally signed an agreement to purchase the Prime Brokerage Services division of Bank of America Securities. The sale was expected to be completed by the end of the 2008 third quarter.
In 2016, BNP Paribas set up a dedicated fintech accelerator to support start-ups that are seeking to improve the customer experience. The programme provided funding of up to €100,000 to chosen fintech firms in order to help develop new products, services and opportunities across the company.[25]

Asset Management: The asset management activities of BNP Paribas are grouped under BNP Paribas Investment Partners. In 2009 BNP Paribas IP had 2,400 employees in more than 70 countries and US $395.1 billion in assets under management (AuM) in 2014 according to the Scorpio Partnership,[26] an increase of 11% over 2013.[26]

Events in 2005[edit]
On 23 September 2005, BNP Paribas was set to take a 20 percent stake in China's Nanjing City Commercial Bank, a Chinese official and state press reports said. "BNP is going to sign a deal with us to buy a stake next month," an official from Nanjing City Commercial told AFP. The Shanghai-based Oriental Morning Post said BNP would pay up to US$100 million, although the bank official said the figure was incorrect. He declined to give further details. The French newspaper La Tribune reported in August 2005 that BNP Paribas had talked to four Chinese commercial banks—Ningbo, Wuxi, Nanjing and Suzhou—and was prepared to invest US$50–100 million. "We've talked to different financial institutions, but only BNP showed its good faith. It was not easy for us to reach an agreement," the Nanjing City Commercial Bank official said. BNP Paribas refused to comment. The International Financial Corporation, the investment arm of the World Bank, already owns 15 percent of Nanjing City Commercial Bank, which has regulatory approval to list on the country's domestic stock markets.

Controversies[edit]
Check processing[edit]
In 2010 the French government's Autorité de la concurrence fined BNP and 10 other banks €384 million for colluding to charge unjustified fees on check processing, including extra fees during the transition from paper check transfer to "Exchanges Check-Image" electronic transfer.[34] On 19 January 2011 BNP sued Russian grain trader, OOO Rosinteragroservis, and its subsidiary OAO Kubankhlebprodukt, claiming US$20 million in debts and penalties.[35]
Nuclear investments[edit]
BNP Paribas is the biggest investor in the nuclear sector as a bank, according to Profundo, with more than €13.5 billion in nuclear investments. On 23 October 2011 Greenpeace organised a protest against BNP Paribas in 24 French cities.[36]
Sanctions violations[edit]
On 30 May 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that the United States Department of Justice was negotiating a possible guilty plea with BNP Paribas as well as the size of the resulting fine for violating U.S. regulations and evading US sanctions. The Justice Department sought a fine of more than US $10 billion, which was expected to be reduced to $8 or $9 billion in negotiations.[37] BNP Paribas was said to have laundered up to US $100 billion from the sanctioned countries of Sudan, Iran, and Cuba.[38]
On 1 July 2014, BNP Paribas pled guilty in a New York state court to falsifying business records as well as conspiracy in connection to those falsifications. It is also expected to plead guilty in federal court to violating laws against money-laundering.[39] It agreed to pay $8.9 billion, the largest fine ever for violating U.S. sanctions, and substantially more than the previous record of $1.9 billion.[19][39] BNP Paribas was also barred for one year under the plea agreement from certain US dollar-dominated transactions. The fine exceeded the bank's $6.4 billion 2013 annual income and the $1.1 billion it previously had allocated for the anticipated fine.[39][40]
The bank's failure to cooperate with the multi-year investigation was given as a significant factor in the size of the fine. Additionally, BNP Paribas continued to process sanctioned transactions after the investigation began. About 30 employees left the bank as a result of the investigation.[39] According to the FBI’s New York Field Office and Chief Richard Weber of the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) "BNPP deliberately disregarded the law and provided rogue nations, and Sudan in particular, with vital access to the global financial system, helping that country’s lawless government to harbor and support terrorists and to persecute its own people. Today’s sentence demonstrates that financial institutions will be punished severely but appropriately for violating sanctions laws and risking our national security interests."[41]
After the fine was announced, BNP said it would be "just fine" and that it had "a comprehensive plan" to avoid similar violations in the future. The company's stock, which had fallen 12% since news of the investigation first leaked, rose 4% on the announcement.[39][40] To comply with the transaction ban, BNP Paribas will use a third party to clear its US transactions. Standard & Poor's said it was reviewing the bank's financial standing[when?] in light of the fine and penalties for a possible downgrade.[39]
Russian president Vladimir Putin alleged without providing any supporting evidence that the US government was using the case to punish France for selling Mistral amphibious assault ships to Russia. He said the large fine and the imposition of sanctions on the French bank were the result of US displeasure with France's decision not to stop the sale.[42] Former European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet had previously said that a large fine was neither fair nor proportionate to the violations and could disrupt the global banking system.[39]
152 Million Erroneous Trade case[edit]
The German FOCUS magazine and the French Les Echos newspaper published an article regarding a 163 Million EUR mistrade (erroneous trade) in which BNP Paribas Arbitrage is allegedly involved.[43][44] The bank has sold securities for 326,400 EUR to the investor Armin S. but the value of the securities is 163 Million EUR according to the bank.
According to the article, the error remained unnoticed for several days. BNP has even reconfirmed the original price. However, a trade-cancellation was only possible until the next day according to prevailing mistrade rules.
A German lawyer stated in the article that a bank not recognizing an error of this magnitude should not be protected by law.[43][45] [46]
Sponsorship[edit]
BNP Paribas has been a major sponsor of tennis. In 1973 it became the major sponsor of the French Open, one of the four prestigious Grand Slam tournaments in the sport. In 2001 the bank began to sponsor the Davis Cup before becoming the title sponsor in 2002. Also in 2002 it became the sponsor of the Paris Masters, one of the nine high-profile tournaments of the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 series. It also expanded to the United States in 2009 when it became the title sponsor of the Indian Wells Masters, a two-week tournament in California which is also one of the nine Masters 1000 series. The Stanford Classic, since 1992, is instead directly sponsored by the Bank of the West subsidiary.
Corporate philanthropy[edit]
Under the aegis of the Fondation de France, the BNP Paribas Foundation[47] has been playing a key role in corporate philanthropy for more than 30 years. It is also encouraging to developing the BNP Paribas international philanthropic policy where the Group does business.
The BNP Paribas Foundation[47] aims at developing its activities through a corporate philanthropic approach, dedicated to three fields of action:

The Arts: contemporary dance, new circus arts, jazz music, restoration of artworks, classical music festivals;
Solidarity : programme focusing on equal opportunities, social entrepreneurship, fight against exclusion and situations of extreme deprivation;
The Environmental research: support to laboratories in France, in Europe and on an international collaboration so as to implement the research projects on climate change.

The BNP Paribas Foundation supports since 1984, more than 300 cultural projects, 40 programmes on research, and a thousand of social & educational initiatives in France and worldwide. Its major programmes are:

Dream Up, new international educational programme based on the practice of the arts;
BNP Paribas for Art, programme supporting restoration of works of arts since 1994;
Climate Initiative, in support of fundamental research on climate change;
Projet Banlieues, initiative created in connection with the BNP Paribas network of agencies inside the Solidarity activity;
Help to Help, a programme that promotes the Group staff initiative as volunteers.

In 2015, BNP Paribas Corporate Philanthropy in the world represented a commitment of almost 40 million euros.
In 2015, Standard Ethics Aei has given a Sustainability Rating to BNP Paribas (EE+) in order to include it in its Standard Ethics French Index.[48]

History[edit]
Name in brief[edit]
The Banque Nationale de Paris S.A. (BNP) resulted from a merger of two French banks – Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie (BNCI) and Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris (CNEP) – in 1966.
The Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas S.A. (Bank of Paris and the Netherlands), or Paribas, was formed from two investment banks based respectively in Paris and Amsterdam, in 1872. Les Pays-Bas ("The Low Countries") is French for the Netherlands.
In May 2000, BNP and Paribas merged to form BNP Paribas, which is thus descended from four founding banking institutions.
Background and heritage as four banks: 1820–2000[edit]
BNP (Banque Nationale de Paris)[edit]
Main articles: Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris and Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie
On 7 March 1848, the French Provisional Government founded the Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris (CNEP) in response to the financial shock caused by the revolution of February 1848. The upheaval destroyed the old credit system, which was already struggling to provide sufficient capital to meet the demands of the railway boom and the resulting growth of industry. The CEP grew steadily in France and overseas, although in 1889 there was a crisis in which it was temporarily placed in receivership.
Separately, on 18 April 1932, the French government replaced Banque nationale de crédit (BNC), which failed as a result of the 1930s recession, with the new bank Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie (BNCI). The former banks headquarter and staff were used to create BNCI with fresh capital of 100 million francs. The bank initially grew rapidly through absorbing a number of regional banks that got into financial trouble. After the Second World War, it continued to grow steadily. It grew its retail business in France and its commercial business overseas in the French colonial empire.
After the end of the Second World War, the French state decided to "put banks and credit to work for national reconstruction". René Pleven, then Minister of Finance, launched a massive reorganization of the banking industry. A law passed on 2 December 1945 and which went into effect on 1 January 1946 nationalized the four leading French retail banks: Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie (BNCI), Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris (CNEP), Crédit Lyonnais, and Société Générale.
In 1966, the French government decided to merge Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris with Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie to create one new bank called Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP).
The bank was re-privatised in 1993 under the leadership of Michel Pébereau as part of a second Chirac government's privatization policy.[5][6]
Paribas (Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas)[edit]
See also: Paribas and Bischoffsheim family
Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas (Paribas) was established on 27 January 1872, through the merger of Banque de Crédit et de Dépôt des Pays-Bas, which had been established in 1820 by Louis-Raphaël Bischoffsheim in Amsterdam, and Banque de Paris, which had been founded in 1869 by a group of Parisian bankers. It went on to develop a strong investment banking business both domestically in France and overseas.
During the period 1872 to 1913, it was involved in raising funds for the French and other governments as well as big businesses through a number of bond issues. It helped the French government raise funds during the First World War and raised further capital and expanded into investments into industrial companies during the Great Depression. It stagnated and lost assets during the Second World War.
After World War II, it missed the nationalisation of the other French banks due to its status as an investment bank and managed to take advantage of that by expanding its operations overseas. It also directs its activity towards businesses and participates in the development and restructuring of French industry, including names such as Groupe Bull and Thomson-CSF.
The bank was nationalized in 1982 by the government of Pierre Mauroy under François Mitterrand as part of a law that nationalized five major industrial companies, thirty-nine registered banks, and two financial companies, Suez and Paribas. It was re-privatized in January 1987 by the Chirac government.
In the 1990s, Paribas had an active policy of acquisitions and divestiture. This included selling the Ottoman Bank to Doğuş Holding, and setting up the joint venture lending company Cetelem in Germany. It sold Crédit du Nord to Société Générale and in 1998 it merged with Compagnie Bancaire, renaming the bank with the official name Compagnie Financière de Paribas.
Founding of BNP Paribas till date: 2000–present[edit]
In 1999, BNP and Société Générale fought a complex battle on the stock market, with Société Générale bidding for Paribas and BNP bidding for Société Générale and counter-bidding for Paribas. BNP's bid for Société Générale failed, while its bid for Paribas succeeded leading to a merger of BNP and Paribas one year later on 22 May 2000.
On 9 August 2007, BNP Paribas became the first major financial group to acknowledge the impact of the sub-prime crisis by closing two funds exposed to it. This day is now generally seen as the start of the credit crisis and the bank's quick reaction saved it from the fate of other large European banks such as UBS.[7][8]
On 6 October 2008, BNP took over 75% of troubled bank Fortis' activities in Belgium, and 66% in Luxembourg, in exchange for the Belgian government becoming the new group's major shareholder. The sales of the Fortis shares was suspended by a court order from the Court of Appeal on Friday 12 December[9][10]
On 14 December 2008, BNP announced it could lose €350 million as a victim of the Madoff fraud.[11]
In the end of January, the Belgian government and BNP negotiated for a 75% partnership in Fortis Bank Belgium. Fortis Insurance Belgium would be reintegrated in Fortis Holding.
On 11 February, Fortis' shareholders decided that Fortis Bank Belgium and Fortis Insurance Belgium should not become property of BNP Paribas. However the acquisition was completed and BNP Paribas took 75% share holding and renamed the new subsidiary BNP Paribas Fortis. After this only Fortis Insurance International was left in Fortis Holding and this was renamed as Ageas, a business that had Insurance all over Europe and Asia. The remaining Fortis Bank Netherlands was in the hands of the Dutch Government which merged it with other ABN AMRO holdings it already owned under the name ABN AMRO.
In May 2009, BNP Paribas became the majority shareholder (65.96%) of BGL (formerly Fortis Bank Luxembourg), the State of Luxembourg retaining 34% making BNP the eurozone's largest bank by deposits held.[12]
On 21 September, the bank's registered name was changed to BGL BNP Paribas and in February 2010, BGL BNP Paribas became the 100% owner of BNP Paribas Luxembourg. The transfer was finalised on 1 October 2010 with the incorporation of BNP Paribas Luxembourg's business in the operational platforms of BGL BNP Paribas.[13] In 2013 BNP Paribas was awarded the Bank of the Year award by The International Financing Review ("IFR"), Thomson Reuters' leading financial industry publication. The IFR awards are a key industry benchmark and Bank of the Year is the top honour awarded.[14][15][16]
BNP Paribas reached an agreement in December 2013 to acquire Rabobank's Polish unit BGZ Bank for around $1.4 billion.[17] In September 2014, BNP completed the purchase of BGZ Bank for a final fee stated in the media to be $1.3 billion.[18]
In June 2014, BNP Paribas pleaded guilty to falsifying business records and conspiracy, having violated U.S. sanctions against Cuba, Iran, and Sudan. It agreed to pay an $8.9 billion fine, the largest ever for violating U.S. sanctions at that time.[19][20]
Corporate Identity[edit]
The BNP Paribas logo since 2000 (designed by Laurent Vincent under the leadership of the Communications Director, Antoine Sire) is called the "courbe d'envol" (curve of taking flight). The stars allude to Europe and universality. The transformation of the stars into birds conveys openness, freedom, growth, and the ability to change and adapt. The shape and movement of the curve places the logo in the universe of life. The green square symbolises nature and optimism.
Business units[edit]
In 2015, the BNP Paribas Group was organized around two business areas:
Retail Banking & Services, a global network of nearly 7,000 branches, comprising Domestic Markets and International Financial Services, and Corporate & Institutional Banking (CIB).
At the end of 2015, outstanding deposits stood at EUR700.3 billion and outstanding loans at EUR682.5 billion. The geographic breakdown of revenues was as follows: Europe (73.3%), Americas (11.8%), Asia Pacific (7.5%) and others (7.4%).
Retail banking[edit]
Retail banking is BNP Paribas' largest business unit representing 72% of its 2015 revenues. Its operations are concentrated in Europe, especially in the group's three domestic markets of France, Italy (where it operates as Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL)), and Belgium (as BNP Paribas Fortis). The group also owns an American subsidiary BancWest which operates as Bank of the West in the western United States and First Hawaiian Bank in Hawaii. BNP Paribas's Europe Mediterranean group also runs large retail banks in Poland, Turkey, Ukraine, and northern Africa.
BNP Paribas is the largest bank in the Eurozone by total assets and second largest by market capitalization according to The Banker magazine, just behind Banco Santander. It employs over 189,000 people, according to the bank as of 31 December 2015, of which 147,000 work in Europe, and maintains a presence in 75 countries.
Domestic markets[edit]

France: BNP Paribas runs one of France's largest retail banking networks with 2,200 branches and over 3,200 ATMs. In Paris alone the bank has 187 agencies. BNP Paribas serves over 6 million French households and 60,000 corporate customers. In 2009 The French Retail Banking unit (FRB) had revenues of €6.1 billion (15.2% of total group's), income of €1.5 billion (15% of total group's), and employs 31,000 people (15.4% of total group's workforce)[21]
Italy: In 2006 BNP Paribas purchased Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), Italy's sixth largest bank at the time. In 2009 BNL had 810 branches in Italy, 2.5 million individual clients, and over 150,000 corporate clients. It grossed €2.9 billion in revenue (7.2% of the total group's) and €540 million of net income (9.3% of the total group's), and employs around 13,000 employees (6.5% of the total group's).[21]
Belgium: BNP Paribas acquired BNP Paribas Fortis when it acquired the retail banking assets of the Belgian lender Fortis in 2009. This deal also included Fortis's subsidiaries in Poland and Turkey, now grouped in the "Europe Mediterranean" division.

United States[edit]
In the United States, BNP Paribas owns BancWest, which in turn operates retail banking subsidiaries Bank of the West and First Hawaiian Bank. Bank of the West operates in 19 Western US states (where it ranks as the 7th largest bank by assets), while First Hawaiian is Hawaii's leading bank with a 40% market share in deposits. Together the two banks operate 710 branches, and service 5 million clients.
The two banks were merged into BancWest 1998, and BNP Paribas took full control of the combined entity in 2001.
The group has a strong presence on niche markets such as lending for marine and recreational vehicles, church lending, and agribusiness. In 2009 BancWest had €2.1 billion in revenues (5.2% of the total group's), and 11,200 employees (5.5% of the total group's headcount).[21] BancWest lost €223 million in 2009 largely due to its exposure in the subprime mortgage crisis in California, Arizona, and Nevada.
Emerging markets[edit]
In 2009, BNP Paribas reorganized its retail banking divisions renaming its "Emerging Markets" group the "Europe Mediterranean" group. This change was made because after the integration of Fortis Bank's Polish and Turkish subsidiaries, BNP Paribas's emerging market activities are now heavily concentrated in Eastern Europe and the southern half of the Mediterranean basin.
BNP Paribas is a member of the Global ATM Alliance, a joint venture of several major international banks that allows customers of the banks to use their ATM card or check card at another bank within the Global ATM Alliance with no ATM surcharges when traveling internationally. Other participating banks are Barclays (United Kingdom), Bank of America (United States), China Construction Bank (China), Deutsche Bank (Germany), Santander Serfin (Mexico), UkrSibbank (Ukraine), Scotiabank (Canada) and Westpac (Australia and New Zealand).[22]

It also trades in these markets on behalf of clients or for its own proprietary account. On an average day, a quarter of a trillion dollars in fixed income instruments are traded at BNP Paribas Americas’ fixed income trading floor located just blocks from the NASDAQ MarketSite in Manhattan, New York City.[23][24]
Equity & Derivatives: BNP Paribas' Equity & Derivatives team helps companies manage their risks and investment portfolios with equity derivatives such as options, futures, and swaps, as well as highly complex, customized solutions such as structured products. It also trades in these markets on behalf of clients or for its own proprietary account.
Commodity Derivatives: BNP Paribas' Commodity Derivatives team helps clients hedge their exposure to commodity risk though the structuring and sale of commodity futures and OTC commodity swaps. It also trades in these markets on behalf of its clients or proprietary account.
Investment Banking: BNP Paribas' Corporate Finance team performs most of the traditional investment banking functions of the group including mergers and acquisitions advisory, and equity raising operations such as Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), rights issues, and convertible bond issues.
Structured Finance: BNP Paribas' Structured Finance group offers clients project finance solutions, export financing, syndicated loans, and financing for acquisitions and leveraged buyouts.

Investment solutions[edit]
BNP Paribas's "Investment Solutions" unit includes its asset management, custodial banking, real estate, insurance, online brokerage, "Personal Investors" and wealth management activities.[21]
On 11 June 2008, BNP Paribas formally signed an agreement to purchase the Prime Brokerage Services division of Bank of America Securities. The sale was expected to be completed by the end of the 2008 third quarter.
In 2016, BNP Paribas set up a dedicated fintech accelerator to support start-ups that are seeking to improve the customer experience. The programme provided funding of up to €100,000 to chosen fintech firms in order to help develop new products, services and opportunities across the company.[25]

Asset Management: The asset management activities of BNP Paribas are grouped under BNP Paribas Investment Partners. In 2009 BNP Paribas IP had 2,400 employees in more than 70 countries and US $395.1 billion in assets under management (AuM) in 2014 according to the Scorpio Partnership,[26] an increase of 11% over 2013.[26]

Events in 2005[edit]
On 23 September 2005, BNP Paribas was set to take a 20 percent stake in China's Nanjing City Commercial Bank, a Chinese official and state press reports said. "BNP is going to sign a deal with us to buy a stake next month," an official from Nanjing City Commercial told AFP. The Shanghai-based Oriental Morning Post said BNP would pay up to US$100 million, although the bank official said the figure was incorrect. He declined to give further details. The French newspaper La Tribune reported in August 2005 that BNP Paribas had talked to four Chinese commercial banks—Ningbo, Wuxi, Nanjing and Suzhou—and was prepared to invest US$50–100 million. "We've talked to different financial institutions, but only BNP showed its good faith. It was not easy for us to reach an agreement," the Nanjing City Commercial Bank official said. BNP Paribas refused to comment. The International Financial Corporation, the investment arm of the World Bank, already owns 15 percent of Nanjing City Commercial Bank, which has regulatory approval to list on the country's domestic stock markets.

Controversies[edit]
Check processing[edit]
In 2010 the French government's Autorité de la concurrence fined BNP and 10 other banks €384 million for colluding to charge unjustified fees on check processing, including extra fees during the transition from paper check transfer to "Exchanges Check-Image" electronic transfer.[34] On 19 January 2011 BNP sued Russian grain trader, OOO Rosinteragroservis, and its subsidiary OAO Kubankhlebprodukt, claiming US$20 million in debts and penalties.[35]
Nuclear investments[edit]
BNP Paribas is the biggest investor in the nuclear sector as a bank, according to Profundo, with more than €13.5 billion in nuclear investments. On 23 October 2011 Greenpeace organised a protest against BNP Paribas in 24 French cities.[36]
Sanctions violations[edit]
On 30 May 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that the United States Department of Justice was negotiating a possible guilty plea with BNP Paribas as well as the size of the resulting fine for violating U.S. regulations and evading US sanctions. The Justice Department sought a fine of more than US $10 billion, which was expected to be reduced to $8 or $9 billion in negotiations.[37] BNP Paribas was said to have laundered up to US $100 billion from the sanctioned countries of Sudan, Iran, and Cuba.[38]
On 1 July 2014, BNP Paribas pled guilty in a New York state court to falsifying business records as well as conspiracy in connection to those falsifications. It is also expected to plead guilty in federal court to violating laws against money-laundering.[39] It agreed to pay $8.9 billion, the largest fine ever for violating U.S. sanctions, and substantially more than the previous record of $1.9 billion.[19][39] BNP Paribas was also barred for one year under the plea agreement from certain US dollar-dominated transactions. The fine exceeded the bank's $6.4 billion 2013 annual income and the $1.1 billion it previously had allocated for the anticipated fine.[39][40]
The bank's failure to cooperate with the multi-year investigation was given as a significant factor in the size of the fine. Additionally, BNP Paribas continued to process sanctioned transactions after the investigation began. About 30 employees left the bank as a result of the investigation.[39] According to the FBI’s New York Field Office and Chief Richard Weber of the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) "BNPP deliberately disregarded the law and provided rogue nations, and Sudan in particular, with vital access to the global financial system, helping that country’s lawless government to harbor and support terrorists and to persecute its own people. Today’s sentence demonstrates that financial institutions will be punished severely but appropriately for violating sanctions laws and risking our national security interests."[41]
After the fine was announced, BNP said it would be "just fine" and that it had "a comprehensive plan" to avoid similar violations in the future. The company's stock, which had fallen 12% since news of the investigation first leaked, rose 4% on the announcement.[39][40] To comply with the transaction ban, BNP Paribas will use a third party to clear its US transactions. Standard & Poor's said it was reviewing the bank's financial standing[when?] in light of the fine and penalties for a possible downgrade.[39]
Russian president Vladimir Putin alleged without providing any supporting evidence that the US government was using the case to punish France for selling Mistral amphibious assault ships to Russia. He said the large fine and the imposition of sanctions on the French bank were the result of US displeasure with France's decision not to stop the sale.[42] Former European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet had previously said that a large fine was neither fair nor proportionate to the violations and could disrupt the global banking system.[39]
152 Million Erroneous Trade case[edit]
The German FOCUS magazine and the French Les Echos newspaper published an article regarding a 163 Million EUR mistrade (erroneous trade) in which BNP Paribas Arbitrage is allegedly involved.[43][44] The bank has sold securities for 326,400 EUR to the investor Armin S. but the value of the securities is 163 Million EUR according to the bank.
According to the article, the error remained unnoticed for several days. BNP has even reconfirmed the original price. However, a trade-cancellation was only possible until the next day according to prevailing mistrade rules.
A German lawyer stated in the article that a bank not recognizing an error of this magnitude should not be protected by law.[43][45] [46]
Sponsorship[edit]
BNP Paribas has been a major sponsor of tennis. In 1973 it became the major sponsor of the French Open, one of the four prestigious Grand Slam tournaments in the sport. In 2001 the bank began to sponsor the Davis Cup before becoming the title sponsor in 2002. Also in 2002 it became the sponsor of the Paris Masters, one of the nine high-profile tournaments of the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 series. It also expanded to the United States in 2009 when it became the title sponsor of the Indian Wells Masters, a two-week tournament in California which is also one of the nine Masters 1000 series. The Stanford Classic, since 1992, is instead directly sponsored by the Bank of the West subsidiary.
Corporate philanthropy[edit]
Under the aegis of the Fondation de France, the BNP Paribas Foundation[47] has been playing a key role in corporate philanthropy for more than 30 years. It is also encouraging to developing the BNP Paribas international philanthropic policy where the Group does business.
The BNP Paribas Foundation[47] aims at developing its activities through a corporate philanthropic approach, dedicated to three fields of action:

The Arts: contemporary dance, new circus arts, jazz music, restoration of artworks, classical music festivals;
Solidarity : programme focusing on equal opportunities, social entrepreneurship, fight against exclusion and situations of extreme deprivation;
The Environmental research: support to laboratories in France, in Europe and on an international collaboration so as to implement the research projects on climate change.

The BNP Paribas Foundation supports since 1984, more than 300 cultural projects, 40 programmes on research, and a thousand of social & educational initiatives in France and worldwide. Its major programmes are:

Dream Up, new international educational programme based on the practice of the arts;
BNP Paribas for Art, programme supporting restoration of works of arts since 1994;
Climate Initiative, in support of fundamental research on climate change;
Projet Banlieues, initiative created in connection with the BNP Paribas network of agencies inside the Solidarity activity;
Help to Help, a programme that promotes the Group staff initiative as volunteers.

In 2015, BNP Paribas Corporate Philanthropy in the world represented a commitment of almost 40 million euros.
In 2015, Standard Ethics Aei has given a Sustainability Rating to BNP Paribas (EE+) in order to include it in its Standard Ethics French Index.[48]

Where to stay in Paris
Each of the city’s 20 arrondissements, or districts, has a personality all its own. If you prefer high-end accommodations and to be in the middle of the action, look for lodging in the 1st through the 4th arrondissements. For more affordable lodging and access to major metro lines, try the 12th. The Oberkampf area of the 11th arrondissement has an edgier, more hip vibe. For easy access to tourist sites,  the 16th is within a stone’s throw of the Arc de Triomph and the Eiffel Tower, and the 17th is within walking distance to the Champs-Elysées. Avoid the 18th, 19th, and 20th, because these can be dangerous, especially if you’re not familiar with the city.

The BNP PARIBAS is the oldest building in france. They are very unique structures and some of the structures are old antique house. Every street we can find one BNP building.

The BNP Paribas is one of eight Masters tournaments on the ATP circuit. Essentially all the best players (who aren't sick or injured) will show up. Delicious. Except it's an indoor tournament, played ...

友達と彼女と一緒に初めて フランスのパリにあるBNP paribas にいきました。 正直いって めちゃくちゃオシャレです。 いろいろなものがキレイですし、居心地もよくめちゃくちゃ癒される感じです。 初めていきましたが１回は行く価値はあると思います。 是非ともお時間あるかたは行ってみてください。 
                                                    more »

Went to a friends with her for the first time, Paris France, is BNP paribas. Frankly speaking, it is very fashionable. It seems things are beautiful and cosy will be healed very well. I think it's worth going once had for the first time. Give us all the time, try.

United States








Sightseeing
Museums
Nature



More than the country of car-packed streets seen in TV shows and movies, the United States of America is a complex and diverse home to over 300 million people living in a wide range of landscapes and climates. From its big-city skyscrapers to its sprawling natural parks, the country's ''melting pot'' combines many ethnic groups that share a strong sense of national identity despite their cultural differences. A country of road trips and big blue skies, the United States harbors orderly cities filled with restaurants, parks, museums, and innumerable sightseeing opportunities, as well as pristine natural areas perfect for a holiday in the great outdoors. To see as much as you can of this diverse land quickly, drive over some of the more than 6 million km (4 million mi) of highways leading through deserts, mountain peaks, fertile fields, and giant urban centers. When using our United States trip planner, you're building your holiday based on your own interests, visitor reviews, and the informed opinions of our well-traveled writers.

United States Holiday Planning GuideMore than just a country of car-packed streets seen in TV shows and movies, the United States of America is a complex and diverse home to over 300 million people living in a wide range of landscapes and climates. From its big-city skyscrapers to its sprawling natural parks, the country's ''melting pot'' combines many ethnic groups that share a strong sense of national identity despite their cultural differences. A country of road trips and big blue skies, the United States harbors orderly cities filled with restaurants, parks, and museums, as well as pristine natural areas teeming with native plant and animal life.

You can head for the majestic national parks in California or the Southwest, and then explore nearby cities and towns. Alternatively, base your trip in one of the larger metropolises like New York City, San Francisco, Chicago, or Boston, which offer a diversity of kid-friendly attractions to fill entire days.  If you wish to add a bit of magic to your great American adventure, don't miss one of the country's famous theme parks, like Magic Kingdom Park and Walt Disney World Resort. For a beach vacation in the United States, you can opt for the far-flung Hawaii, the resorts along the Mid-Atlantic, or the iconic coast of New England. Of course, the warm waters of the Florida coast draw beach-going families year-round. Things to Do in the United States with KidsIf your United States itinerary has you in a city for a few days, balance visits to museums and historical sites with trips to a local park--Central Park or Boston Common, for example, make great places where kids can blow off some steam. Learn about the animal kingdom at the celebrated San Diego Zoo, and visit other educational sites popular with both children and their parents, such as USS Midway Museum and Alcatraz Island.If you want to spend time outdoors, explore the country's protected natural areas, like Grand Canyon National Park, or get your hands dirty and discover what's left of the Wild West at a cattle ranch in Texas. For skiing fun in the winter and hiking adventures in the summer, visit Colorado, a place so naturally beautiful it inspired the opening lyrics of the song "America the Beautiful."Tips for a Family Vacation in the United StatesWhen planning your kid-friendly United States vacation, remember that this country spans six time zones and encompasses varied landscapes that include snow-covered mountains, desolate deserts, and tropical beaches. Try to pick activities and places suitable to your family's interests, and plan your outdoor adventures with the local weather in mind. Unless you want to spend your entire vacation on the road getting from one distant place to another, focus on a few destinations and leave plenty of time for short day trips. Add a few big cities to your tour of the United States if you want quick access to major airports and popular attractions, but don't forget that smaller towns provide a chance to discover the local culture at a less-hurried pace more suited for families with kids.Dining and Shopping on Holiday in the United StatesCuisine of the United StatesFew places in the world offer so many different dining options as the United States, prompting many people to visit the country for the sole purpose of experiencing its unique food culture. Though you can choose from thousands of fast food, take-out, and ethnic restaurants, remember that small diners offer you a chance to enrich your United States trip with a more casual atmosphere and inexpensive yet hearty dishes. Food trucks are a growing phenomenon, perhaps most famously in Los Angeles, where you can try everything from simple sandwiches to gourmet dishes prepared by renowned chefs. Chicago's deep-dish pizza remains a crowd-favorite, while New York City offers outstanding cheesecakes and corned-beef sandwiches. In the South, be sure to sample regional dishes like grits, deep-fried catfish, and gumbo, and when in the Pacific Northwest and New England, the local seafood is superb.Shopping in the United StatesThe Unites States remains one of the world's top shopping destinations, boasting a lengthy list of well-known self-service supermarkets, chain stores, factory outlets, warehouse club stores, and modern shopping centers. Visit any of the country's big cities to choose from hundreds of department stores, offering everything from inexpensive clothing and accessories to designer furniture, state-of-the-art electronics, and branded jewelry. For the ultimate buying experience at the largest indoor shopping complex in the country, add Mall of America to you United States itinerary. If giant shopping centers aren't your thing, try bargaining for used goods at garage sales and flea markets, usually held on weekends all across the country.Know Before You Go on a Trip to the United StatesHistory of the United StatesThe first inhabitants of North America arrived from Siberia nearly 15,000 years ago. Some of those early cultures developed advanced agricultural and architectural skills, but the arrival of the Spanish conquistadores in the 16th century resulted in the decline of the native populations. To learn more about the continent's early history, include places like La Brea Tar Pits & Museum and The Field Museum in your United States itinerary.European settlers continued to conquer North America over the next two centuries. The continent's first elected legislative body came into existence in 1619 in Virginia. This assembly established important precedents for the democratic processes that would develop throughout the 13 British colonies, eventually forming the basis for the United States of America. Discover the life of early settlers at one of the country's living museums, like Plimoth Plantation in Massachusetts.American colonists declared their independence on July 4, 1776, when the 13 original colonies openly broke their allegiance to the British crown. The resulting American Revolutionary War became the first successful colonial war of independence fought against a European power. Britain recognized the newly formed country's independence in the peace treaty of 1783. A few years later, American states ratified a new constitution and reorganized their federal government into three branches. George Washington, the hero of the Revolutionary War, became the country's first president. You can enhance your United States tour by exploring historical sites in Philadelphia, the birthplace of the American democracy. Consider visiting attractions like Independence Hall and Valley Forge National Historical Park for more insight into the nation's origins.Americans expanded westward during the next few decades, which caused a series of wars against Native American tribes. Monuments like Crazy Horse Memorial pay tribute to the bravery--and suffering--of the Native Americans. Civil war broke out in 1861, when southern slave states seceded from the United States and formed the Confederate States of America. By 1865, the Confederacy was defeated, slavery abolished, and federal power significantly increased.Over the next few decades the country quickly industrialized, helped greatly by the massive influx of immigrants from around the world. In the 20th century, America took part in both world wars, emerging as a major economical, political, and cultural power. Despite the challenges of the 21st century, the country remains a "melting pot" of cultures and continues to play a major role in global affairs. Create an unforgettable United States holiday by visiting the nation's big cities and stunning natural wonders, like Yellowstone National Park and Canyon de Chelly National Monument.Customs of the United StatesMost visitors to the United States find the country's social customs relaxed and the locals friendly and tolerant. Make a good impression during your United States tour by greeting people you meet for the first time with direct eye contact, a firm handshake, and a warm smile. Show respect by leaving about an arm's length of personal space between yourself and others, but don't be surprised or offended by the American readiness to chat with strangers at parties and other social gatherings. Dress appropriately for the occasion, and prevent uncomfortable social situations by avoiding conversations about sensitive subjects like religion or politics.Holidays & Festivals in the United StatesTry to plan your United States vacation with local events in mind, but remember that national public holidays generally mean closed banks, post offices, and museums. The country's biggest holidays include New Year's Day, Memorial Day (the last Monday in May), Independence Day (July 4), Labor Day (the first Monday in September), Thanksgiving (the fourth Thursday in November), and Christmas (December 25). Many small towns host summer fairs, offering rides, games, and local foods.United States Travel TipsClimate of the United StatesThe United States includes a number of geographic regions, each with its own distinct climate. The northern and central sections offer mostly temperate weather, while the deep southern regions and the areas along the Gulf Coast feature a subtropical climate. Much of California offers Mediterranean weather, while arid deserts affect large sections of the Southwest. When planning your United States holiday, keep in mind that the majority of the country enjoys high temperatures between June and August. This is also one of the busiest travel seasons, with big crowds and higher prices in most tourist resorts. If you prefer a quieter vacation, plan for autumn, when much of the country enjoys milder weather and spectacular seasonal colors. If visiting in winter, keep your eye on the local weather reports, as winter storms in several regions can create dangerous driving conditions and disruption in air travel.Transportation in the United StatesDue to its size, the easiest way to tour the United States is by car. The country seems tailor-made for road trips, its vast network of highways including a staggering 6.4 million km (4 million mi) of public roads. No wonder, then, that America remains one of the world's largest automobile markets, with the average citizen spending just under one hour driving every single day. If statistics can't convince you to get behind the wheel, consider traveling between America's big cities by plane. Air travel is the easiest way to hop across the country, allowing you to journey from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast in mere hours. If you're not in a rush and have less ground to cover, intercity buses provide a slower but more affordable option, and railway lines take you through some lovely landscapes--though not at the speeds one might expect in Europe or elsewhere.Language of the United StatesWhile the United States has no official language, English is the most commonly spoken language of the United States. Many communities also speak Spanish, French, and various Native American tongues. Don't be surprised to hear a number of distinctive accents and dialects on your United States trip, as different regions continue to speak English with noticeable differences in pronunciation. Expect to see road signs in English only, though a growing number of tourist attractions include information displays in other languages as well.Tipping in the United StatesMake your United States holiday a pleasant experience by remembering that most Americans view tipping as more than just an optional sign of appreciation. In much of the service industry wages are relatively low, with the expectation that gratuity will supplement a worker's income. Therefore, tip 10 to 20 percent at restaurants, and 10 to 15 percent at bars. Always tip taxi drivers, valet parking attendants, and hotel staff, unless you feel the services provided were outrageously bad.

South America








Museums

Historic Sites



South America is a continent that over 371,090,000 people call home, where the cities are just as colorful as the jungles, and indigenous people preserve tradition while the youth fill dance floors. It is also the home of hyperbole with the world's highest waterfall (Angel Falls in Venezula,) the world's largest river by volume (the Amazon,) not to mention the largest rainforest (the Amazon Rainforest) residing on the same continent as the world's driest desert (the Atacama Desert.)  The terrain is a varitable feast for the senses ranging from jungle to forest, mountain, beaches, and deserts. Although it seems a recently tamed wilderness, evidence of humans inhabiting this land dates back to 9,000 BC. Over the centuries these first human inhabitants formed tribes that scattered themselves over the diverse landscape: some of these developed into thriving civilizations, the most famous of which was the Inca. Colonialization by the Portuguese and Spanish settlers brought massive change to these tribal cultures and native civilizations, but some still practice their way of life deep inside the jungles and high on the mountaintops where visitors are few and seldom.

Europe








Sightseeing
Nightlife
Museums



A mosaic of many different languages and nationalities, Europe draws nearly half a billion annual visitors with its wealth of cultural, artistic, and architectural attractions. Europe also features one of the world's most efficient rail and road networks, generally making travel a pleasant and easy experience. The world's smallest continent in terms of surface area, this land stretching from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Ural Mountains in the east boasts thousands of years of history preserved and displayed in hundreds of world-famous museums, galleries, libraries, and universities. Offering travelers a seemingly endless variety of landscapes, Europe encompasses booming cities, tiny villages, lush river valleys, majestic mountain ranges, deep lakes, and sprawling seas. If you have already discovered the popular destinations of Italy or Greece, try the less-explored Balkans or Scandinavia.

Europe Holiday Planning GuideA mosaic of many different languages and nationalities, Europe draws nearly half a billion annual visitors with its wealth of cultural, artistic, and architectural attractions. Europe also features one of the world's most efficient rail and road networks, making travel a pleasant and easy experience. The world's smallest continent in terms of surface area, this colorful land stretching from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Ural Mountains in the east boasts thousands of years of history, preserved and displayed in hundreds of world-famous museums, galleries, libraries, and universities. Offering travelers a seemingly endless variety of landscapes, Europe encompasses booming cities, tiny villages, lush river valleys, majestic mountain ranges, deep lakes, and sprawling seas. If you've already discovered the popular destinations of Italy, France, and Greece, don't feel you've exhausted your options: add the less-explored Balkans or Scandinavia to your Europe itinerary.Places to Visit in EuropeCountries of EuropeEngland: While England's sprawling urban areas provide easy access to world-class shopping, nightlife, and dining, the sweeping countryside features dozens of atmospheric villages and ancient remains of once-powerful societies.Italy: A land of high fashion, fine art, and exquisite architecture, Italy boasts the largest number of World Heritage Sites in the world, making it an ideal place for a memorable holiday in Europe.France: The world's most popular tourist destination, this country remains best known for its outstanding cuisine, rich history, distinct culture, and illustrious fashion industry.Spain: A favorite destination for seaside vacations in Europe, Spain offers a relaxed lifestyle, excellent food, vibrant

active Europe vacation ideas, including mountain climbing, scuba diving, rafting, and skiing.Germany: One of Europe's easiest countries to explore thanks to an efficient transportation network, Germany draws visitors with its medieval castles, picturesque villages, sprawling natural areas, and savvy urban centers.Portugal: Small in size but huge in terms of tourist attractions, Portugal features diverse landscapes that include lush vineyards, verdant valleys, sandy coastlines, and rolling hills dotted with historical towns and villages preserving age-old traditions, art, and culture.Ireland: Ireland's gentle green hills include some of the most popular tourist attractions in Europe, like historical castles and pristine natural parks.Greece: Known as much for its sun-drenched beaches as for its ancient history, Greece features countless fascinating places to visit, including lively seaside towns, well-preserved ruins, and serene whitewashed villages.Scotland: Though it boasts thousands of years of history, Scotland draws most of its visitors with a selection of modern whiskey distilleries, renowned golf courses, and award-winning museums.Cities in EuropeLondon: One of the world's leading cultural, financial, and political centers, this city offers visitors a comprehensive transportation system and easy access to well-known museums, galleries, monuments, public squares, restaurants, and shops.Paris: Perhaps the ultimate destination for romantic Europe holidays, the City of Light features a lengthy list of Michelin-starred restaurants, as well as some of the most-visited tourist attractions in the world, like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre.Rome: The birthplace of the Roman Empire, this modern metropolis combines an immensely rich historical heritage with a cosmopolitan atmosphere, which many visitors choose to experience at one of the city's vibrant piazzas.Barcelona: Youthful energy and outstanding architecture make Barcelona an ideal place for sightseeing in Europe, with plenty of chances to experience modern restaurants, chic bars, and swanky nightclubs.Istanbul: This transcontinental city is a living reminder of the Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman Empires, with a World Heritage-listed town center known for both Islamic minarets and Christian church domes.Amsterdam: Indisputably one of the world's great small cities, Amsterdam offers a cozy atmosphere and charming 17th-century architecture, as well as a dynamic nightlife scene and plenty of modern shopping options.Prague: Over a thousand years old, this World Heritage-listed capital lures millions of annual tourists with its hilltop castle, picturesque bridges, and labyrinthine lanes.Dublin: An increasingly popular stop on Europe itineraries, compact Dublin can easily explored on foot or by bicycle, and its traditional pubs make ideal places for meeting the natives and experiencing the colorful local culture.Berlin: Germany's largest city, Berlin offers everything from elegantly restored medieval palaces to ultra-modern steel buildings, all with a healthy dose of innovative restaurants and internationally renowned art galleries.Lisbon: Built on seven hills, Lisbon remains something of a hidden gem, delighting visitors with plenty of notable monuments and museums, as well as quaint alleyways and historical neighborhoods.Things to Do in EuropePopular Europe Tourist AttractionsEiffel Tower: The starting point for many Europe sightseeing tours, this iconic Paris structure continues to impress visitors with its scale and grandeur, not to mention its breathtaking city views.Colosseum: Among the greatest architectural achievements of the Roman Empire, this famous Roman landmark remains the largest amphitheater in the world, once capable of seating 50,000 spectators of animal fights and gladiatorial combats.Tower of London: Among the world's most famous towers, this thousand-year-old structure stands on the north bank of the Thames River and notably includes an exhibit of over 23,000 royal gems. Louvre Museum: Nearly 30,000 works of art make this renowned museum a perennial favorite among Europe attractions, famed for housing ancient religious artifacts and masterpieces by Michelangelo and da Vinci.La Sagrada Familia: Barcelona's eye-catching symbol, this World Heritage-listed church astonishes sightseers with its height and intricate design, devised by celebrated architect Antoni Gaudi.Sultan Ahmed Mosque: Named for its stunning blue-tile interior, this impressive Istanbul mosque boasts a total of six minarets, one main dome, and eight secondary domes, blending traditional Islamic style with Byzantine architectural elements.Van Gogh Museum: This Amsterdam museum houses the largest collection of Van Gogh's works, including over 200 paintings and 600 drawings.Schönbrunn Palace: Regularly cited as one of the most fascinating places to visit in Europe, this lavish Vienna palace includes over 1,400 rooms, and its grounds contain one of the world's oldest zoos.Park Güell: One of Barcelona's many Antoni Gaudi structures, this garden complex features a network of scenic footpaths and offers unbeatable views of the surrounding area.Anne Frank House: Once the hiding place of a Jewish family immortalized in a young girl's personal diary, this Amsterdam museum offers a sobering look at one of European history's darkest moments.Planning a Europe Vacation with KidsPlaces to Visit in Europe with KidsEurope offers so many different activities suitable for travelers with children, you'll have no trouble filling up your itinerary with family-friendly things to do. If your holiday in Europe involves teenagers enthusiastic about outdoor adventures, try skiing or hiking the mountain slopes of Rhone-Alpes, one of the most picturesque regions in France. Families with smaller children may opt for a more leisurely experience, like exploring the castles and ancient ruins scattered across England. Other low-key adventures include easy sightseeing trips along the canals of Venice, making sand castles on a beach in Greece, or walking the old and narrow lanes of medieval Prague. To spend some time indoors, explore the world-class museums of London or hunt for unique souvenirs at a covered market in Istanbul.Things to Do in Europe with KidsWith literally hundreds of notable kid-friendly attractions, Europe remains one of the world's most popular destinations for family-oriented holidays. Begin exploring the continent's endless variety of attractions at one of its big cities, where you can explore historical sites like Parthenon and Trevi Fountain. To add a few lessons about the world's diverse natural ecosystems to your Europe itinerary, think about visiting places like Barcelona Zoo. If you want the family to spend a few pleasant and educational hours indoors, consider visiting a big-city museum, such as Vasa Museum. If, however, your kids prefer theme parks to museums and zoos, head to Disneyland Park, or enjoy the modern amenities of Tropical Islands Resort.Tips for a Family Vacation in EuropeAs you plan your family vacation in Europe, keep in mind the continent's size, varied climates, and different time zones. Avoid exhausting the family with too many distant places to visit and focus on activities and attractions best suited to your kids' interests. Basing your trip in a big city lets you take advantage of affordable hotels and easy access to public transportation. On the other hand, smaller towns or villages in beautiful natural surroundings may prove a slower-paced alternative while still keeping young ones entertained with things to see and do. Pick a few distant destinations to visit by train or car, and leave lots of time for short day trips that both you and the kids can enjoy on foot or by bicycle. Enlist the youngest members of the family to help plan your Europe itinerary, and keep things interesting by combining tours of popular museums with visits to castles, palaces, churches, and zoos.Dining and Shopping on Holiday in EuropeCuisine of EuropeA patchwork of many different cultures, Europe is also a hodgepodge of regional culinary traditions. You could spend months exploring the continent's gastronomic delights, concentrating either on renowned big-city restaurants or small-town bars and pubs serving up local specialties. Everybody knows Italy as the place for pizza and pasta dishes, though a growing number of tourists head here to try its regional wines and beers. For outstanding tapas, or "pintxos" as the locals call them, stop through Basque Country on your Europe trip. For tasty dishes combining both eastern and western culinary traditions, explore Serbia--one of Europe's emerging destinations for gastronomic itineraries. Visit Russia for great soups and stews, Bosnia and Herzegovina for a range of kebab-inspired specialties, and Turkey for outstanding baklava and a cup of world-famous coffee.Shopping in EuropeShopping is no small thing in Europe, which draws visitors to its big urban centers like Rome and Paris, as well as broader regions like Amalfi Coast and Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur. You can easily find plenty of conventional shopping options to add to your Europe itinerary, but if you're looking for a slightly different buying experience, consider exploring some of the continent's more unusual and authentic shopping attractions. Highlights include Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, Harrods, and Grand Bazaar (Kapali Carsi). Keep in mind that regional delicacies make some of the best souvenirs to take home. Think Swiss and Belgian chocolates, French wines, and high-quality German cheeses.Know Before You Go on a Trip to EuropeHistory of EuropeEurope's rich and turbulent history dates back thousands of years. Scientists have found evidence of human inhabitation on the continent that is up to 40,000 years old, but one of the earliest signs of a complex European culture comes from ancient Greece. The birthplace of Western civilization, this culture became a driving force behind revolutionary developments in early philosophy, humanism, medicine, and science.Classical Greek culture exerted a powerful influence on the Roman Empire, which in turn left an indelible mark on European law, language, architecture, and politics. During the "Pax Romana" period, this empire encompassed most of the European continent. To learn more about early Greek and Roman cultures, add a few ancient sites to your Europe itinerary, including Colosseum and Acropolis Museum.The emergence of Christianity brought about the gradual collapse of the Roman Empire. By the early 8th century CE, the Carolingian Empire occupied large sections of Western Europe and formed the basis for the later Holy Roman Empire. This period also saw the rise of cities and universities, followed by a historical era known as the Renaissance. The grand flourishing of culture originated in Florence and spread across Europe between the 14th and 16th centuries. Art, philosophy, music, and the sciences thrived under the patronage of royal families, nobility, and an emerging merchant class. Enrich your Europe sightseeing experience by visiting Vatican Museums, housing numerous Renaissance masterpieces.The 18th century saw the emergence of the Age of Enlightenment, an intellectual movement promoting scientific thought. Dissatisfaction with aristocracy led to the French Revolution, a violent yet hugely influential period of political and social upheaval in France. Napoleon Bonaparte came to power in the aftermath of this revolution and established a huge empire that encompassed much of Europe. Visit Arc de Triomphe to pay homage to soldiers who fought in the landmark French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.A revolution of a different kind, the Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and resulted in the rapid growth of European cities, giving rise to a new working class in the 19th century. If you're looking for some educational things to do in Europe, British Museum provides insight about the changes European society underwent during this period.Two hugely destructive world wars dominated the first half of the 20th century in Europe. World War I saw massive losses on all sides and ended in the disintegration of empires. World War II, sparked by Adolf Hitler's territorial ambitions, left much of the continent ravaged if not razed, and shook European civilization to its core with mass exterminations in Nazi concentration camps. For most of the second half of the 20th century, Europe remained a divided continent. While Western Europe integrated into what would eventually become the European Union, the continent's eastern section remained under strong Soviet influence until the 1990s. Though today's Europe continues to face new challenges, it celebrates its multiplicity of nations and languages. Get a sense of the scope of this heritage on your holiday in Europe by exploring some of its most popular sights, like State Hermitage Museum and Winter Palace and St. Peter's Basilica.  Customs of EuropeAlthough European social etiquette differs greatly from country to country, and sometimes even from region from region, you can make your visit a more pleasant experience by following a few basic rules. Remember that a warm smile and an honest attempt to speak at least a few phrases of the local language go a long way in making friends in a new city or region. Shake hands and use a formal mode of address when meeting people for the very first time. Show respect by arriving on time to all your social engagements, be they formal dinners or casual parties. Avoid unpleasant social situations by refraining from comments about sensitive local subjects like politics, religion, or sports. Blend in during your holiday in Europe by dressing like a native, and politely ask a local friend, host, or hotel staff about anything that seems confusing or unusual from a foreign visitor's perspective.Holidays & Festivals in EuropeAll European countries celebrate their own official public holidays, with most nations observing Christmas, New Year's Day, Easter, and Labor Day (May 1). Many Europeans take their summer holidays in July and August, which usually translates into huge crowds on major roads, as well as in railway stations and international airports. You can also expect heavy traffic in late December, when many schools close for the end-of-the-year holidays and families enjoy an extended winter break. If you wish to add some local flavor to your Europe vacation, plan your visit around a regional festival. Visit Munich during Oktoberfest, or head to Serbia for the country's summertime Guca Brass Band Festival.Europe Travel TipsClimate of EuropeEurope lies mainly in the temperate climate zones, which are greatly influenced by the Gulf Stream. Known as "Europe's central heating," this warm ocean current makes the continent's climate milder and wetter than other areas of the same latitude. That said, weather can vary from place to place, so plan your Europe trip with the local climate in mind and remember that the best time to visit is in the summer. The Mediterranean countries offer the warmest temperatures and plenty of sunshine, which makes them hugely popular summer destinations. If you plan your visit for winter but wish to avoid the low temperatures and abundant precipitation of Central and Northern Europe, consider the Turkish Riviera or one of the many Greek islands.Transportation in EuropeMost of Europe offers a reliable and efficient public transportation system, so you should have very little trouble exploring the continent's urban areas. While you can enjoy your tour of Europe by every modern mode of transportation, the train remains arguably the easiest and quickest way to get from one city--or town--to the next. If you can't find a railway service suited to your itinerary, consider renting a car or motorcycle. Traveling with your own vehicle provides you with unparalleled flexibility and allows you to get off the beaten path and tour remote rural areas.Language of EuropeMost Europeans speak a tongue from one of three Indo-European language groups: Romance, Germanic, or Slavic. Many speak multiple languages, with the most commonly spoken tongues including English, Spanish, French, Russian, German, and Italian. For the sake of convenience during your vacation in Europe, learn at least a few basic phrases in the local language, and consider bringing along a phrasebook or pocket dictionary. If you wish to immerse yourself deeper into the native culture, look for accelerated language courses offered by many European private schools and universities.Tipping in EuropeThough you'll find that tipping habits vary significantly as you move from country to country on your tour of Europe, you can generally play it safe by adding 5 to 10 percent to restaurant bills. Unless you feel the service provided was especially poor, leave taxi drivers, hotel porters, and bartenders a small tip to show your appreciation for a job well done. One rule generally applies across borders in Europe: to ensure the intended recipient actually gets the gratuity, tip in cash, not on your credit card.

History[edit]
Name in brief[edit]
The Banque Nationale de Paris S.A. (BNP) resulted from a merger of two French banks – Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie (BNCI) and Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris (CNEP) – in 1966.
The Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas S.A. (Bank of Paris and the Netherlands), or Paribas, was formed from two investment banks based respectively in Paris and Amsterdam, in 1872. Les Pays-Bas ("The Low Countries") is French for the Netherlands.
In May 2000, BNP and Paribas merged to form BNP Paribas, which is thus descended from four founding banking institutions.
Background and heritage as four banks: 1820–2000[edit]
BNP (Banque Nationale de Paris)[edit]
Main articles: Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris and Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie
On 7 March 1848, the French Provisional Government founded the Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris (CNEP) in response to the financial shock caused by the revolution of February 1848. The upheaval destroyed the old credit system, which was already struggling to provide sufficient capital to meet the demands of the railway boom and the resulting growth of industry. The CEP grew steadily in France and overseas, although in 1889 there was a crisis in which it was temporarily placed in receivership.
Separately, on 18 April 1932, the French government replaced Banque nationale de crédit (BNC), which failed as a result of the 1930s recession, with the new bank Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie (BNCI). The former banks headquarter and staff were used to create BNCI with fresh capital of 100 million francs. The bank initially grew rapidly through absorbing a number of regional banks that got into financial trouble. After the Second World War, it continued to grow steadily. It grew its retail business in France and its commercial business overseas in the French colonial empire.
After the end of the Second World War, the French state decided to "put banks and credit to work for national reconstruction". René Pleven, then Minister of Finance, launched a massive reorganization of the banking industry. A law passed on 2 December 1945 and which went into effect on 1 January 1946 nationalized the four leading French retail banks: Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie (BNCI), Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris (CNEP), Crédit Lyonnais, and Société Générale.
In 1966, the French government decided to merge Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris with Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie to create one new bank called Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP).
The bank was re-privatised in 1993 under the leadership of Michel Pébereau as part of a second Chirac government's privatization policy.[5][6]
Paribas (Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas)[edit]
See also: Paribas and Bischoffsheim family
Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas (Paribas) was established on 27 January 1872, through the merger of Banque de Crédit et de Dépôt des Pays-Bas, which had been established in 1820 by Louis-Raphaël Bischoffsheim in Amsterdam, and Banque de Paris, which had been founded in 1869 by a group of Parisian bankers. It went on to develop a strong investment banking business both domestically in France and overseas.
During the period 1872 to 1913, it was involved in raising funds for the French and other governments as well as big businesses through a number of bond issues. It helped the French government raise funds during the First World War and raised further capital and expanded into investments into industrial companies during the Great Depression. It stagnated and lost assets during the Second World War.
After World War II, it missed the nationalisation of the other French banks due to its status as an investment bank and managed to take advantage of that by expanding its operations overseas. It also directs its activity towards businesses and participates in the development and restructuring of French industry, including names such as Groupe Bull and Thomson-CSF.
The bank was nationalized in 1982 by the government of Pierre Mauroy under François Mitterrand as part of a law that nationalized five major industrial companies, thirty-nine registered banks, and two financial companies, Suez and Paribas. It was re-privatized in January 1987 by the Chirac government.
In the 1990s, Paribas had an active policy of acquisitions and divestiture. This included selling the Ottoman Bank to Doğuş Holding, and setting up the joint venture lending company Cetelem in Germany. It sold Crédit du Nord to Société Générale and in 1998 it merged with Compagnie Bancaire, renaming the bank with the official name Compagnie Financière de Paribas.
Founding of BNP Paribas till date: 2000–present[edit]
In 1999, BNP and Société Générale fought a complex battle on the stock market, with Société Générale bidding for Paribas and BNP bidding for Société Générale and counter-bidding for Paribas. BNP's bid for Société Générale failed, while its bid for Paribas succeeded leading to a merger of BNP and Paribas one year later on 22 May 2000.
On 9 August 2007, BNP Paribas became the first major financial group to acknowledge the impact of the sub-prime crisis by closing two funds exposed to it. This day is now generally seen as the start of the credit crisis and the bank's quick reaction saved it from the fate of other large European banks such as UBS.[7][8]
On 6 October 2008, BNP took over 75% of troubled bank Fortis' activities in Belgium, and 66% in Luxembourg, in exchange for the Belgian government becoming the new group's major shareholder. The sales of the Fortis shares was suspended by a court order from the Court of Appeal on Friday 12 December[9][10]
On 14 December 2008, BNP announced it could lose €350 million as a victim of the Madoff fraud.[11]
In the end of January, the Belgian government and BNP negotiated for a 75% partnership in Fortis Bank Belgium. Fortis Insurance Belgium would be reintegrated in Fortis Holding.
On 11 February, Fortis' shareholders decided that Fortis Bank Belgium and Fortis Insurance Belgium should not become property of BNP Paribas. However the acquisition was completed and BNP Paribas took 75% share holding and renamed the new subsidiary BNP Paribas Fortis. After this only Fortis Insurance International was left in Fortis Holding and this was renamed as Ageas, a business that had Insurance all over Europe and Asia. The remaining Fortis Bank Netherlands was in the hands of the Dutch Government which merged it with other ABN AMRO holdings it already owned under the name ABN AMRO.
In May 2009, BNP Paribas became the majority shareholder (65.96%) of BGL (formerly Fortis Bank Luxembourg), the State of Luxembourg retaining 34% making BNP the eurozone's largest bank by deposits held.[12]
On 21 September, the bank's registered name was changed to BGL BNP Paribas and in February 2010, BGL BNP Paribas became the 100% owner of BNP Paribas Luxembourg. The transfer was finalised on 1 October 2010 with the incorporation of BNP Paribas Luxembourg's business in the operational platforms of BGL BNP Paribas.[13] In 2013 BNP Paribas was awarded the Bank of the Year award by The International Financing Review ("IFR"), Thomson Reuters' leading financial industry publication. The IFR awards are a key industry benchmark and Bank of the Year is the top honour awarded.[14][15][16]
BNP Paribas reached an agreement in December 2013 to acquire Rabobank's Polish unit BGZ Bank for around $1.4 billion.[17] In September 2014, BNP completed the purchase of BGZ Bank for a final fee stated in the media to be $1.3 billion.[18]
In June 2014, BNP Paribas pleaded guilty to falsifying business records and conspiracy, having violated U.S. sanctions against Cuba, Iran, and Sudan. It agreed to pay an $8.9 billion fine, the largest ever for violating U.S. sanctions at that time.[19][20]
Corporate Identity[edit]
The BNP Paribas logo since 2000 (designed by Laurent Vincent under the leadership of the Communications Director, Antoine Sire) is called the "courbe d'envol" (curve of taking flight). The stars allude to Europe and universality. The transformation of the stars into birds conveys openness, freedom, growth, and the ability to change and adapt. The shape and movement of the curve places the logo in the universe of life. The green square symbolises nature and optimism.
Business units[edit]
In 2015, the BNP Paribas Group was organized around two business areas:
Retail Banking & Services, a global network of nearly 7,000 branches, comprising Domestic Markets and International Financial Services, and Corporate & Institutional Banking (CIB).
At the end of 2015, outstanding deposits stood at EUR700.3 billion and outstanding loans at EUR682.5 billion. The geographic breakdown of revenues was as follows: Europe (73.3%), Americas (11.8%), Asia Pacific (7.5%) and others (7.4%).
Retail banking[edit]
Retail banking is BNP Paribas' largest business unit representing 72% of its 2015 revenues. Its operations are concentrated in Europe, especially in the group's three domestic markets of France, Italy (where it operates as Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL)), and Belgium (as BNP Paribas Fortis). The group also owns an American subsidiary BancWest which operates as Bank of the West in the western United States and First Hawaiian Bank in Hawaii. BNP Paribas's Europe Mediterranean group also runs large retail banks in Poland, Turkey, Ukraine, and northern Africa.
BNP Paribas is the largest bank in the Eurozone by total assets and second largest by market capitalization according to The Banker magazine, just behind Banco Santander. It employs over 189,000 people, according to the bank as of 31 December 2015, of which 147,000 work in Europe, and maintains a presence in 75 countries.
Domestic markets[edit]

France: BNP Paribas runs one of France's largest retail banking networks with 2,200 branches and over 3,200 ATMs. In Paris alone the bank has 187 agencies. BNP Paribas serves over 6 million French households and 60,000 corporate customers. In 2009 The French Retail Banking unit (FRB) had revenues of €6.1 billion (15.2% of total group's), income of €1.5 billion (15% of total group's), and employs 31,000 people (15.4% of total group's workforce)[21]
Italy: In 2006 BNP Paribas purchased Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), Italy's sixth largest bank at the time. In 2009 BNL had 810 branches in Italy, 2.5 million individual clients, and over 150,000 corporate clients. It grossed €2.9 billion in revenue (7.2% of the total group's) and €540 million of net income (9.3% of the total group's), and employs around 13,000 employees (6.5% of the total group's).[21]
Belgium: BNP Paribas acquired BNP Paribas Fortis when it acquired the retail banking assets of the Belgian lender Fortis in 2009. This deal also included Fortis's subsidiaries in Poland and Turkey, now grouped in the "Europe Mediterranean" division.

United States[edit]
In the United States, BNP Paribas owns BancWest, which in turn operates retail banking subsidiaries Bank of the West and First Hawaiian Bank. Bank of the West operates in 19 Western US states (where it ranks as the 7th largest bank by assets), while First Hawaiian is Hawaii's leading bank with a 40% market share in deposits. Together the two banks operate 710 branches, and service 5 million clients.
The two banks were merged into BancWest 1998, and BNP Paribas took full control of the combined entity in 2001.
The group has a strong presence on niche markets such as lending for marine and recreational vehicles, church lending, and agribusiness. In 2009 BancWest had €2.1 billion in revenues (5.2% of the total group's), and 11,200 employees (5.5% of the total group's headcount).[21] BancWest lost €223 million in 2009 largely due to its exposure in the subprime mortgage crisis in California, Arizona, and Nevada.
Emerging markets[edit]
In 2009, BNP Paribas reorganized its retail banking divisions renaming its "Emerging Markets" group the "Europe Mediterranean" group. This change was made because after the integration of Fortis Bank's Polish and Turkish subsidiaries, BNP Paribas's emerging market activities are now heavily concentrated in Eastern Europe and the southern half of the Mediterranean basin.
BNP Paribas is a member of the Global ATM Alliance, a joint venture of several major international banks that allows customers of the banks to use their ATM card or check card at another bank within the Global ATM Alliance with no ATM surcharges when traveling internationally. Other participating banks are Barclays (United Kingdom), Bank of America (United States), China Construction Bank (China), Deutsche Bank (Germany), Santander Serfin (Mexico), UkrSibbank (Ukraine), Scotiabank (Canada) and Westpac (Australia and New Zealand).[22]

Investment solutions[edit]
BNP Paribas's "Investment Solutions" unit includes its asset management, custodial banking, real estate, insurance, online brokerage, "Personal Investors" and wealth management activities.[21]
On 11 June 2008, BNP Paribas formally signed an agreement to purchase the Prime Brokerage Services division of Bank of America Securities. The sale was expected to be completed by the end of the 2008 third quarter.
In 2016, BNP Paribas set up a dedicated fintech accelerator to support start-ups that are seeking to improve the customer experience. The programme provided funding of up to €100,000 to chosen fintech firms in order to help develop new products, services and opportunities across the company.[25]

Asset Management: The asset management activities of BNP Paribas are grouped under BNP Paribas Investment Partners. In 2009 BNP Paribas IP had 2,400 employees in more than 70 countries and US $395.1 billion in assets under management (AuM) in 2014 according to the Scorpio Partnership,[26] an increase of 11% over 2013.[26]

Events in 2005[edit]
On 23 September 2005, BNP Paribas was set to take a 20 percent stake in China's Nanjing City Commercial Bank, a Chinese official and state press reports said. "BNP is going to sign a deal with us to buy a stake next month," an official from Nanjing City Commercial told AFP. The Shanghai-based Oriental Morning Post said BNP would pay up to US$100 million, although the bank official said the figure was incorrect. He declined to give further details. The French newspaper La Tribune reported in August 2005 that BNP Paribas had talked to four Chinese commercial banks—Ningbo, Wuxi, Nanjing and Suzhou—and was prepared to invest US$50–100 million. "We've talked to different financial institutions, but only BNP showed its good faith. It was not easy for us to reach an agreement," the Nanjing City Commercial Bank official said. BNP Paribas refused to comment. The International Financial Corporation, the investment arm of the World Bank, already owns 15 percent of Nanjing City Commercial Bank, which has regulatory approval to list on the country's domestic stock markets.

Controversies[edit]
Check processing[edit]
In 2010 the French government's Autorité de la concurrence fined BNP and 10 other banks €384 million for colluding to charge unjustified fees on check processing, including extra fees during the transition from paper check transfer to "Exchanges Check-Image" electronic transfer.[34] On 19 January 2011 BNP sued Russian grain trader, OOO Rosinteragroservis, and its subsidiary OAO Kubankhlebprodukt, claiming US$20 million in debts and penalties.[35]
Nuclear investments[edit]
BNP Paribas is the biggest investor in the nuclear sector as a bank, according to Profundo, with more than €13.5 billion in nuclear investments. On 23 October 2011 Greenpeace organised a protest against BNP Paribas in 24 French cities.[36]
Sanctions violations[edit]
On 30 May 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that the United States Department of Justice was negotiating a possible guilty plea with BNP Paribas as well as the size of the resulting fine for violating U.S. regulations and evading US sanctions. The Justice Department sought a fine of more than US $10 billion, which was expected to be reduced to $8 or $9 billion in negotiations.[37] BNP Paribas was said to have laundered up to US $100 billion from the sanctioned countries of Sudan, Iran, and Cuba.[38]
On 1 July 2014, BNP Paribas pled guilty in a New York state court to falsifying business records as well as conspiracy in connection to those falsifications. It is also expected to plead guilty in federal court to violating laws against money-laundering.[39] It agreed to pay $8.9 billion, the largest fine ever for violating U.S. sanctions, and substantially more than the previous record of $1.9 billion.[19][39] BNP Paribas was also barred for one year under the plea agreement from certain US dollar-dominated transactions. The fine exceeded the bank's $6.4 billion 2013 annual income and the $1.1 billion it previously had allocated for the anticipated fine.[39][40]
The bank's failure to cooperate with the multi-year investigation was given as a significant factor in the size of the fine. Additionally, BNP Paribas continued to process sanctioned transactions after the investigation began. About 30 employees left the bank as a result of the investigation.[39] According to the FBI’s New York Field Office and Chief Richard Weber of the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) "BNPP deliberately disregarded the law and provided rogue nations, and Sudan in particular, with vital access to the global financial system, helping that country’s lawless government to harbor and support terrorists and to persecute its own people. Today’s sentence demonstrates that financial institutions will be punished severely but appropriately for violating sanctions laws and risking our national security interests."[41]
After the fine was announced, BNP said it would be "just fine" and that it had "a comprehensive plan" to avoid similar violations in the future. The company's stock, which had fallen 12% since news of the investigation first leaked, rose 4% on the announcement.[39][40] To comply with the transaction ban, BNP Paribas will use a third party to clear its US transactions. Standard & Poor's said it was reviewing the bank's financial standing[when?] in light of the fine and penalties for a possible downgrade.[39]
Russian president Vladimir Putin alleged without providing any supporting evidence that the US government was using the case to punish France for selling Mistral amphibious assault ships to Russia. He said the large fine and the imposition of sanctions on the French bank were the result of US displeasure with France's decision not to stop the sale.[42] Former European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet had previously said that a large fine was neither fair nor proportionate to the violations and could disrupt the global banking system.[39]
152 Million Erroneous Trade case[edit]
The German FOCUS magazine and the French Les Echos newspaper published an article regarding a 163 Million EUR mistrade (erroneous trade) in which BNP Paribas Arbitrage is allegedly involved.[43][44] The bank has sold securities for 326,400 EUR to the investor Armin S. but the value of the securities is 163 Million EUR according to the bank.
According to the article, the error remained unnoticed for several days. BNP has even reconfirmed the original price. However, a trade-cancellation was only possible until the next day according to prevailing mistrade rules.
A German lawyer stated in the article that a bank not recognizing an error of this magnitude should not be protected by law.[43][45] [46]
Sponsorship[edit]
BNP Paribas has been a major sponsor of tennis. In 1973 it became the major sponsor of the French Open, one of the four prestigious Grand Slam tournaments in the sport. In 2001 the bank began to sponsor the Davis Cup before becoming the title sponsor in 2002. Also in 2002 it became the sponsor of the Paris Masters, one of the nine high-profile tournaments of the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 series. It also expanded to the United States in 2009 when it became the title sponsor of the Indian Wells Masters, a two-week tournament in California which is also one of the nine Masters 1000 series. The Stanford Classic, since 1992, is instead directly sponsored by the Bank of the West subsidiary.
Corporate philanthropy[edit]
Under the aegis of the Fondation de France, the BNP Paribas Foundation[47] has been playing a key role in corporate philanthropy for more than 30 years. It is also encouraging to developing the BNP Paribas international philanthropic policy where the Group does business.
The BNP Paribas Foundation[47] aims at developing its activities through a corporate philanthropic approach, dedicated to three fields of action:

The Arts: contemporary dance, new circus arts, jazz music, restoration of artworks, classical music festivals;
Solidarity : programme focusing on equal opportunities, social entrepreneurship, fight against exclusion and situations of extreme deprivation;
The Environmental research: support to laboratories in France, in Europe and on an international collaboration so as to implement the research projects on climate change.

The BNP Paribas Foundation supports since 1984, more than 300 cultural projects, 40 programmes on research, and a thousand of social & educational initiatives in France and worldwide. Its major programmes are:

Dream Up, new international educational programme based on the practice of the arts;
BNP Paribas for Art, programme supporting restoration of works of arts since 1994;
Climate Initiative, in support of fundamental research on climate change;
Projet Banlieues, initiative created in connection with the BNP Paribas network of agencies inside the Solidarity activity;
Help to Help, a programme that promotes the Group staff initiative as volunteers.

In 2015, BNP Paribas Corporate Philanthropy in the world represented a commitment of almost 40 million euros.
In 2015, Standard Ethics Aei has given a Sustainability Rating to BNP Paribas (EE+) in order to include it in its Standard Ethics French Index.[48]

History[edit]
Name in brief[edit]
The Banque Nationale de Paris S.A. (BNP) resulted from a merger of two French banks – Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie (BNCI) and Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris (CNEP) – in 1966.
The Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas S.A. (Bank of Paris and the Netherlands), or Paribas, was formed from two investment banks based respectively in Paris and Amsterdam, in 1872. Les Pays-Bas ("The Low Countries") is French for the Netherlands.
In May 2000, BNP and Paribas merged to form BNP Paribas, which is thus descended from four founding banking institutions.
Background and heritage as four banks: 1820–2000[edit]
BNP (Banque Nationale de Paris)[edit]
Main articles: Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris and Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie
On 7 March 1848, the French Provisional Government founded the Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris (CNEP) in response to the financial shock caused by the revolution of February 1848. The upheaval destroyed the old credit system, which was already struggling to provide sufficient capital to meet the demands of the railway boom and the resulting growth of industry. The CEP grew steadily in France and overseas, although in 1889 there was a crisis in which it was temporarily placed in receivership.
Separately, on 18 April 1932, the French government replaced Banque nationale de crédit (BNC), which failed as a result of the 1930s recession, with the new bank Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie (BNCI). The former banks headquarter and staff were used to create BNCI with fresh capital of 100 million francs. The bank initially grew rapidly through absorbing a number of regional banks that got into financial trouble. After the Second World War, it continued to grow steadily. It grew its retail business in France and its commercial business overseas in the French colonial empire.
After the end of the Second World War, the French state decided to "put banks and credit to work for national reconstruction". René Pleven, then Minister of Finance, launched a massive reorganization of the banking industry. A law passed on 2 December 1945 and which went into effect on 1 January 1946 nationalized the four leading French retail banks: Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie (BNCI), Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris (CNEP), Crédit Lyonnais, and Société Générale.
In 1966, the French government decided to merge Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris with Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie to create one new bank called Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP).
The bank was re-privatised in 1993 under the leadership of Michel Pébereau as part of a second Chirac government's privatization policy.[5][6]
Paribas (Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas)[edit]
See also: Paribas and Bischoffsheim family
Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas (Paribas) was established on 27 January 1872, through the merger of Banque de Crédit et de Dépôt des Pays-Bas, which had been established in 1820 by Louis-Raphaël Bischoffsheim in Amsterdam, and Banque de Paris, which had been founded in 1869 by a group of Parisian bankers. It went on to develop a strong investment banking business both domestically in France and overseas.
During the period 1872 to 1913, it was involved in raising funds for the French and other governments as well as big businesses through a number of bond issues. It helped the French government raise funds during the First World War and raised further capital and expanded into investments into industrial companies during the Great Depression. It stagnated and lost assets during the Second World War.
After World War II, it missed the nationalisation of the other French banks due to its status as an investment bank and managed to take advantage of that by expanding its operations overseas. It also directs its activity towards businesses and participates in the development and restructuring of French industry, including names such as Groupe Bull and Thomson-CSF.
The bank was nationalized in 1982 by the government of Pierre Mauroy under François Mitterrand as part of a law that nationalized five major industrial companies, thirty-nine registered banks, and two financial companies, Suez and Paribas. It was re-privatized in January 1987 by the Chirac government.
In the 1990s, Paribas had an active policy of acquisitions and divestiture. This included selling the Ottoman Bank to Doğuş Holding, and setting up the joint venture lending company Cetelem in Germany. It sold Crédit du Nord to Société Générale and in 1998 it merged with Compagnie Bancaire, renaming the bank with the official name Compagnie Financière de Paribas.
Founding of BNP Paribas till date: 2000–present[edit]
In 1999, BNP and Société Générale fought a complex battle on the stock market, with Société Générale bidding for Paribas and BNP bidding for Société Générale and counter-bidding for Paribas. BNP's bid for Société Générale failed, while its bid for Paribas succeeded leading to a merger of BNP and Paribas one year later on 22 May 2000.
On 9 August 2007, BNP Paribas became the first major financial group to acknowledge the impact of the sub-prime crisis by closing two funds exposed to it. This day is now generally seen as the start of the credit crisis and the bank's quick reaction saved it from the fate of other large European banks such as UBS.[7][8]
On 6 October 2008, BNP took over 75% of troubled bank Fortis' activities in Belgium, and 66% in Luxembourg, in exchange for the Belgian government becoming the new group's major shareholder. The sales of the Fortis shares was suspended by a court order from the Court of Appeal on Friday 12 December[9][10]
On 14 December 2008, BNP announced it could lose €350 million as a victim of the Madoff fraud.[11]
In the end of January, the Belgian government and BNP negotiated for a 75% partnership in Fortis Bank Belgium. Fortis Insurance Belgium would be reintegrated in Fortis Holding.
On 11 February, Fortis' shareholders decided that Fortis Bank Belgium and Fortis Insurance Belgium should not become property of BNP Paribas. However the acquisition was completed and BNP Paribas took 75% share holding and renamed the new subsidiary BNP Paribas Fortis. After this only Fortis Insurance International was left in Fortis Holding and this was renamed as Ageas, a business that had Insurance all over Europe and Asia. The remaining Fortis Bank Netherlands was in the hands of the Dutch Government which merged it with other ABN AMRO holdings it already owned under the name ABN AMRO.
In May 2009, BNP Paribas became the majority shareholder (65.96%) of BGL (formerly Fortis Bank Luxembourg), the State of Luxembourg retaining 34% making BNP the eurozone's largest bank by deposits held.[12]
On 21 September, the bank's registered name was changed to BGL BNP Paribas and in February 2010, BGL BNP Paribas became the 100% owner of BNP Paribas Luxembourg. The transfer was finalised on 1 October 2010 with the incorporation of BNP Paribas Luxembourg's business in the operational platforms of BGL BNP Paribas.[13] In 2013 BNP Paribas was awarded the Bank of the Year award by The International Financing Review ("IFR"), Thomson Reuters' leading financial industry publication. The IFR awards are a key industry benchmark and Bank of the Year is the top honour awarded.[14][15][16]
BNP Paribas reached an agreement in December 2013 to acquire Rabobank's Polish unit BGZ Bank for around $1.4 billion.[17] In September 2014, BNP completed the purchase of BGZ Bank for a final fee stated in the media to be $1.3 billion.[18]
In June 2014, BNP Paribas pleaded guilty to falsifying business records and conspiracy, having violated U.S. sanctions against Cuba, Iran, and Sudan. It agreed to pay an $8.9 billion fine, the largest ever for violating U.S. sanctions at that time.[19][20]
Corporate Identity[edit]
The BNP Paribas logo since 2000 (designed by Laurent Vincent under the leadership of the Communications Director, Antoine Sire) is called the "courbe d'envol" (curve of taking flight). The stars allude to Europe and universality. The transformation of the stars into birds conveys openness, freedom, growth, and the ability to change and adapt. The shape and movement of the curve places the logo in the universe of life. The green square symbolises nature and optimism.
Business units[edit]
In 2015, the BNP Paribas Group was organized around two business areas:
Retail Banking & Services, a global network of nearly 7,000 branches, comprising Domestic Markets and International Financial Services, and Corporate & Institutional Banking (CIB).
At the end of 2015, outstanding deposits stood at EUR700.3 billion and outstanding loans at EUR682.5 billion. The geographic breakdown of revenues was as follows: Europe (73.3%), Americas (11.8%), Asia Pacific (7.5%) and others (7.4%).
Retail banking[edit]
Retail banking is BNP Paribas' largest business unit representing 72% of its 2015 revenues. Its operations are concentrated in Europe, especially in the group's three domestic markets of France, Italy (where it operates as Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL)), and Belgium (as BNP Paribas Fortis). The group also owns an American subsidiary BancWest which operates as Bank of the West in the western United States and First Hawaiian Bank in Hawaii. BNP Paribas's Europe Mediterranean group also runs large retail banks in Poland, Turkey, Ukraine, and northern Africa.
BNP Paribas is the largest bank in the Eurozone by total assets and second largest by market capitalization according to The Banker magazine, just behind Banco Santander. It employs over 189,000 people, according to the bank as of 31 December 2015, of which 147,000 work in Europe, and maintains a presence in 75 countries.
Domestic markets[edit]

France: BNP Paribas runs one of France's largest retail banking networks with 2,200 branches and over 3,200 ATMs. In Paris alone the bank has 187 agencies. BNP Paribas serves over 6 million French households and 60,000 corporate customers. In 2009 The French Retail Banking unit (FRB) had revenues of €6.1 billion (15.2% of total group's), income of €1.5 billion (15% of total group's), and employs 31,000 people (15.4% of total group's workforce)[21]
Italy: In 2006 BNP Paribas purchased Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), Italy's sixth largest bank at the time. In 2009 BNL had 810 branches in Italy, 2.5 million individual clients, and over 150,000 corporate clients. It grossed €2.9 billion in revenue (7.2% of the total group's) and €540 million of net income (9.3% of the total group's), and employs around 13,000 employees (6.5% of the total group's).[21]
Belgium: BNP Paribas acquired BNP Paribas Fortis when it acquired the retail banking assets of the Belgian lender Fortis in 2009. This deal also included Fortis's subsidiaries in Poland and Turkey, now grouped in the "Europe Mediterranean" division.

United States[edit]
In the United States, BNP Paribas owns BancWest, which in turn operates retail banking subsidiaries Bank of the West and First Hawaiian Bank. Bank of the West operates in 19 Western US states (where it ranks as the 7th largest bank by assets), while First Hawaiian is Hawaii's leading bank with a 40% market share in deposits. Together the two banks operate 710 branches, and service 5 million clients.
The two banks were merged into BancWest 1998, and BNP Paribas took full control of the combined entity in 2001.
The group has a strong presence on niche markets such as lending for marine and recreational vehicles, church lending, and agribusiness. In 2009 BancWest had €2.1 billion in revenues (5.2% of the total group's), and 11,200 employees (5.5% of the total group's headcount).[21] BancWest lost €223 million in 2009 largely due to its exposure in the subprime mortgage crisis in California, Arizona, and Nevada.
Emerging markets[edit]
In 2009, BNP Paribas reorganized its retail banking divisions renaming its "Emerging Markets" group the "Europe Mediterranean" group. This change was made because after the integration of Fortis Bank's Polish and Turkish subsidiaries, BNP Paribas's emerging market activities are now heavily concentrated in Eastern Europe and the southern half of the Mediterranean basin.
BNP Paribas is a member of the Global ATM Alliance, a joint venture of several major international banks that allows customers of the banks to use their ATM card or check card at another bank within the Global ATM Alliance with no ATM surcharges when traveling internationally. Other participating banks are Barclays (United Kingdom), Bank of America (United States), China Construction Bank (China), Deutsche Bank (Germany), Santander Serfin (Mexico), UkrSibbank (Ukraine), Scotiabank (Canada) and Westpac (Australia and New Zealand).[22]

Equity & Derivatives: BNP Paribas' Equity & Derivatives team helps companies manage their risks and investment portfolios with equity derivatives such as options, futures, and swaps, as well as highly complex, customized solutions such as structured products.

Investment solutions[edit]
BNP Paribas's "Investment Solutions" unit includes its asset management, custodial banking, real estate, insurance, online brokerage, "Personal Investors" and wealth management activities.[21]
On 11 June 2008, BNP Paribas formally signed an agreement to purchase the Prime Brokerage Services division of Bank of America Securities. The sale was expected to be completed by the end of the 2008 third quarter.
In 2016, BNP Paribas set up a dedicated fintech accelerator to support start-ups that are seeking to improve the customer experience. The programme provided funding of up to €100,000 to chosen fintech firms in order to help develop new products, services and opportunities across the company.[25]

Asset Management: The asset management activities of BNP Paribas are grouped under BNP Paribas Investment Partners. In 2009 BNP Paribas IP had 2,400 employees in more than 70 countries and US $395.1 billion in assets under management (AuM) in 2014 according to the Scorpio Partnership,[26] an increase of 11% over 2013.[26]

Events in 2005[edit]
On 23 September 2005, BNP Paribas was set to take a 20 percent stake in China's Nanjing City Commercial Bank, a Chinese official and state press reports said. "BNP is going to sign a deal with us to buy a stake next month," an official from Nanjing City Commercial told AFP. The Shanghai-based Oriental Morning Post said BNP would pay up to US$100 million, although the bank official said the figure was incorrect. He declined to give further details. The French newspaper La Tribune reported in August 2005 that BNP Paribas had talked to four Chinese commercial banks—Ningbo, Wuxi, Nanjing and Suzhou—and was prepared to invest US$50–100 million. "We've talked to different financial institutions, but only BNP showed its good faith. It was not easy for us to reach an agreement," the Nanjing City Commercial Bank official said. BNP Paribas refused to comment. The International Financial Corporation, the investment arm of the World Bank, already owns 15 percent of Nanjing City Commercial Bank, which has regulatory approval to list on the country's domestic stock markets.

Controversies[edit]
Check processing[edit]
In 2010 the French government's Autorité de la concurrence fined BNP and 10 other banks €384 million for colluding to charge unjustified fees on check processing, including extra fees during the transition from paper check transfer to "Exchanges Check-Image" electronic transfer.[34] On 19 January 2011 BNP sued Russian grain trader, OOO Rosinteragroservis, and its subsidiary OAO Kubankhlebprodukt, claiming US$20 million in debts and penalties.[35]
Nuclear investments[edit]
BNP Paribas is the biggest investor in the nuclear sector as a bank, according to Profundo, with more than €13.5 billion in nuclear investments. On 23 October 2011 Greenpeace organised a protest against BNP Paribas in 24 French cities.[36]
Sanctions violations[edit]
On 30 May 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that the United States Department of Justice was negotiating a possible guilty plea with BNP Paribas as well as the size of the resulting fine for violating U.S. regulations and evading US sanctions. The Justice Department sought a fine of more than US $10 billion, which was expected to be reduced to $8 or $9 billion in negotiations.[37] BNP Paribas was said to have laundered up to US $100 billion from the sanctioned countries of Sudan, Iran, and Cuba.[38]
On 1 July 2014, BNP Paribas pled guilty in a New York state court to falsifying business records as well as conspiracy in connection to those falsifications. It is also expected to plead guilty in federal court to violating laws against money-laundering.[39] It agreed to pay $8.9 billion, the largest fine ever for violating U.S. sanctions, and substantially more than the previous record of $1.9 billion.[19][39] BNP Paribas was also barred for one year under the plea agreement from certain US dollar-dominated transactions. The fine exceeded the bank's $6.4 billion 2013 annual income and the $1.1 billion it previously had allocated for the anticipated fine.[39][40]
The bank's failure to cooperate with the multi-year investigation was given as a significant factor in the size of the fine. Additionally, BNP Paribas continued to process sanctioned transactions after the investigation began. About 30 employees left the bank as a result of the investigation.[39] According to the FBI’s New York Field Office and Chief Richard Weber of the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) "BNPP deliberately disregarded the law and provided rogue nations, and Sudan in particular, with vital access to the global financial system, helping that country’s lawless government to harbor and support terrorists and to persecute its own people. Today’s sentence demonstrates that financial institutions will be punished severely but appropriately for violating sanctions laws and risking our national security interests."[41]
After the fine was announced, BNP said it would be "just fine" and that it had "a comprehensive plan" to avoid similar violations in the future. The company's stock, which had fallen 12% since news of the investigation first leaked, rose 4% on the announcement.[39][40] To comply with the transaction ban, BNP Paribas will use a third party to clear its US transactions. Standard & Poor's said it was reviewing the bank's financial standing[when?] in light of the fine and penalties for a possible downgrade.[39]
Russian president Vladimir Putin alleged without providing any supporting evidence that the US government was using the case to punish France for selling Mistral amphibious assault ships to Russia. He said the large fine and the imposition of sanctions on the French bank were the result of US displeasure with France's decision not to stop the sale.[42] Former European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet had previously said that a large fine was neither fair nor proportionate to the violations and could disrupt the global banking system.[39]
152 Million Erroneous Trade case[edit]
The German FOCUS magazine and the French Les Echos newspaper published an article regarding a 163 Million EUR mistrade (erroneous trade) in which BNP Paribas Arbitrage is allegedly involved.[43][44] The bank has sold securities for 326,400 EUR to the investor Armin S. but the value of the securities is 163 Million EUR according to the bank.
According to the article, the error remained unnoticed for several days. BNP has even reconfirmed the original price. However, a trade-cancellation was only possible until the next day according to prevailing mistrade rules.
A German lawyer stated in the article that a bank not recognizing an error of this magnitude should not be protected by law.[43][45] [46]
Sponsorship[edit]
BNP Paribas has been a major sponsor of tennis. In 1973 it became the major sponsor of the French Open, one of the four prestigious Grand Slam tournaments in the sport. In 2001 the bank began to sponsor the Davis Cup before becoming the title sponsor in 2002. Also in 2002 it became the sponsor of the Paris Masters, one of the nine high-profile tournaments of the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 series. It also expanded to the United States in 2009 when it became the title sponsor of the Indian Wells Masters, a two-week tournament in California which is also one of the nine Masters 1000 series. The Stanford Classic, since 1992, is instead directly sponsored by the Bank of the West subsidiary.
Corporate philanthropy[edit]
Under the aegis of the Fondation de France, the BNP Paribas Foundation[47] has been playing a key role in corporate philanthropy for more than 30 years. It is also encouraging to developing the BNP Paribas international philanthropic policy where the Group does business.
The BNP Paribas Foundation[47] aims at developing its activities through a corporate philanthropic approach, dedicated to three fields of action:

The Arts: contemporary dance, new circus arts, jazz music, restoration of artworks, classical music festivals;
Solidarity : programme focusing on equal opportunities, social entrepreneurship, fight against exclusion and situations of extreme deprivation;
The Environmental research: support to laboratories in France, in Europe and on an international collaboration so as to implement the research projects on climate change.

The BNP Paribas Foundation supports since 1984, more than 300 cultural projects, 40 programmes on research, and a thousand of social & educational initiatives in France and worldwide. Its major programmes are:

Dream Up, new international educational programme based on the practice of the arts;
BNP Paribas for Art, programme supporting restoration of works of arts since 1994;
Climate Initiative, in support of fundamental research on climate change;
Projet Banlieues, initiative created in connection with the BNP Paribas network of agencies inside the Solidarity activity;
Help to Help, a programme that promotes the Group staff initiative as volunteers.

In 2015, BNP Paribas Corporate Philanthropy in the world represented a commitment of almost 40 million euros.
In 2015, Standard Ethics Aei has given a Sustainability Rating to BNP Paribas (EE+) in order to include it in its Standard Ethics French Index.[48]

History[edit]
Name in brief[edit]
The Banque Nationale de Paris S.A. (BNP) resulted from a merger of two French banks – Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie (BNCI) and Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris (CNEP) – in 1966.
The Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas S.A. (Bank of Paris and the Netherlands), or Paribas, was formed from two investment banks based respectively in Paris and Amsterdam, in 1872. Les Pays-Bas ("The Low Countries") is French for the Netherlands.
In May 2000, BNP and Paribas merged to form BNP Paribas, which is thus descended from four founding banking institutions.
Background and heritage as four banks: 1820–2000[edit]
BNP (Banque Nationale de Paris)[edit]
Main articles: Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris and Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie
On 7 March 1848, the French Provisional Government founded the Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris (CNEP) in response to the financial shock caused by the revolution of February 1848. The upheaval destroyed the old credit system, which was already struggling to provide sufficient capital to meet the demands of the railway boom and the resulting growth of industry. The CEP grew steadily in France and overseas, although in 1889 there was a crisis in which it was temporarily placed in receivership.
Separately, on 18 April 1932, the French government replaced Banque nationale de crédit (BNC), which failed as a result of the 1930s recession, with the new bank Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie (BNCI). The former banks headquarter and staff were used to create BNCI with fresh capital of 100 million francs. The bank initially grew rapidly through absorbing a number of regional banks that got into financial trouble. After the Second World War, it continued to grow steadily. It grew its retail business in France and its commercial business overseas in the French colonial empire.
After the end of the Second World War, the French state decided to "put banks and credit to work for national reconstruction". René Pleven, then Minister of Finance, launched a massive reorganization of the banking industry. A law passed on 2 December 1945 and which went into effect on 1 January 1946 nationalized the four leading French retail banks: Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie (BNCI), Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris (CNEP), Crédit Lyonnais, and Société Générale.
In 1966, the French government decided to merge Comptoir national d'escompte de Paris with Banque nationale pour le commerce et l'industrie to create one new bank called Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP).
The bank was re-privatised in 1993 under the leadership of Michel Pébereau as part of a second Chirac government's privatization policy.[5][6]
Paribas (Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas)[edit]
See also: Paribas and Bischoffsheim family
Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas (Paribas) was established on 27 January 1872, through the merger of Banque de Crédit et de Dépôt des Pays-Bas, which had been established in 1820 by Louis-Raphaël Bischoffsheim in Amsterdam, and Banque de Paris, which had been founded in 1869 by a group of Parisian bankers. It went on to develop a strong investment banking business both domestically in France and overseas.
During the period 1872 to 1913, it was involved in raising funds for the French and other governments as well as big businesses through a number of bond issues. It helped the French government raise funds during the First World War and raised further capital and expanded into investments into industrial companies during the Great Depression. It stagnated and lost assets during the Second World War.
After World War II, it missed the nationalisation of the other French banks due to its status as an investment bank and managed to take advantage of that by expanding its operations overseas. It also directs its activity towards businesses and participates in the development and restructuring of French industry, including names such as Groupe Bull and Thomson-CSF.
The bank was nationalized in 1982 by the government of Pierre Mauroy under François Mitterrand as part of a law that nationalized five major industrial companies, thirty-nine registered banks, and two financial companies, Suez and Paribas. It was re-privatized in January 1987 by the Chirac government.
In the 1990s, Paribas had an active policy of acquisitions and divestiture. This included selling the Ottoman Bank to Doğuş Holding, and setting up the joint venture lending company Cetelem in Germany. It sold Crédit du Nord to Société Générale and in 1998 it merged with Compagnie Bancaire, renaming the bank with the official name Compagnie Financière de Paribas.
Founding of BNP Paribas till date: 2000–present[edit]
In 1999, BNP and Société Générale fought a complex battle on the stock market, with Société Générale bidding for Paribas and BNP bidding for Société Générale and counter-bidding for Paribas. BNP's bid for Société Générale failed, while its bid for Paribas succeeded leading to a merger of BNP and Paribas one year later on 22 May 2000.
On 9 August 2007, BNP Paribas became the first major financial group to acknowledge the impact of the sub-prime crisis by closing two funds exposed to it. This day is now generally seen as the start of the credit crisis and the bank's quick reaction saved it from the fate of other large European banks such as UBS.[7][8]
On 6 October 2008, BNP took over 75% of troubled bank Fortis' activities in Belgium, and 66% in Luxembourg, in exchange for the Belgian government becoming the new group's major shareholder. The sales of the Fortis shares was suspended by a court order from the Court of Appeal on Friday 12 December[9][10]
On 14 December 2008, BNP announced it could lose €350 million as a victim of the Madoff fraud.[11]
In the end of January, the Belgian government and BNP negotiated for a 75% partnership in Fortis Bank Belgium. Fortis Insurance Belgium would be reintegrated in Fortis Holding.
On 11 February, Fortis' shareholders decided that Fortis Bank Belgium and Fortis Insurance Belgium should not become property of BNP Paribas. However the acquisition was completed and BNP Paribas took 75% share holding and renamed the new subsidiary BNP Paribas Fortis. After this only Fortis Insurance International was left in Fortis Holding and this was renamed as Ageas, a business that had Insurance all over Europe and Asia. The remaining Fortis Bank Netherlands was in the hands of the Dutch Government which merged it with other ABN AMRO holdings it already owned under the name ABN AMRO.
In May 2009, BNP Paribas became the majority shareholder (65.96%) of BGL (formerly Fortis Bank Luxembourg), the State of Luxembourg retaining 34% making BNP the eurozone's largest bank by deposits held.[12]
On 21 September, the bank's registered name was changed to BGL BNP Paribas and in February 2010, BGL BNP Paribas became the 100% owner of BNP Paribas Luxembourg. The transfer was finalised on 1 October 2010 with the incorporation of BNP Paribas Luxembourg's business in the operational platforms of BGL BNP Paribas.[13] In 2013 BNP Paribas was awarded the Bank of the Year award by The International Financing Review ("IFR"), Thomson Reuters' leading financial industry publication. The IFR awards are a key industry benchmark and Bank of the Year is the top honour awarded.[14][15][16]
BNP Paribas reached an agreement in December 2013 to acquire Rabobank's Polish unit BGZ Bank for around $1.4 billion.[17] In September 2014, BNP completed the purchase of BGZ Bank for a final fee stated in the media to be $1.3 billion.[18]
In June 2014, BNP Paribas pleaded guilty to falsifying business records and conspiracy, having violated U.S. sanctions against Cuba, Iran, and Sudan. It agreed to pay an $8.9 billion fine, the largest ever for violating U.S. sanctions at that time.[19][20]
Corporate Identity[edit]
The BNP Paribas logo since 2000 (designed by Laurent Vincent under the leadership of the Communications Director, Antoine Sire) is called the "courbe d'envol" (curve of taking flight). The stars allude to Europe and universality. The transformation of the stars into birds conveys openness, freedom, growth, and the ability to change and adapt. The shape and movement of the curve places the logo in the universe of life. The green square symbolises nature and optimism.
Business units[edit]
In 2015, the BNP Paribas Group was organized around two business areas:
Retail Banking & Services, a global network of nearly 7,000 branches, comprising Domestic Markets and International Financial Services, and Corporate & Institutional Banking (CIB).
At the end of 2015, outstanding deposits stood at EUR700.3 billion and outstanding loans at EUR682.5 billion. The geographic breakdown of revenues was as follows: Europe (73.3%), Americas (11.8%), Asia Pacific (7.5%) and others (7.4%).
Retail banking[edit]
Retail banking is BNP Paribas' largest business unit representing 72% of its 2015 revenues. Its operations are concentrated in Europe, especially in the group's three domestic markets of France, Italy (where it operates as Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL)), and Belgium (as BNP Paribas Fortis). The group also owns an American subsidiary BancWest which operates as Bank of the West in the western United States and First Hawaiian Bank in Hawaii. BNP Paribas's Europe Mediterranean group also runs large retail banks in Poland, Turkey, Ukraine, and northern Africa.
BNP Paribas is the largest bank in the Eurozone by total assets and second largest by market capitalization according to The Banker magazine, just behind Banco Santander. It employs over 189,000 people, according to the bank as of 31 December 2015, of which 147,000 work in Europe, and maintains a presence in 75 countries.
Domestic markets[edit]

France: BNP Paribas runs one of France's largest retail banking networks with 2,200 branches and over 3,200 ATMs. In Paris alone the bank has 187 agencies. BNP Paribas serves over 6 million French households and 60,000 corporate customers. In 2009 The French Retail Banking unit (FRB) had revenues of €6.1 billion (15.2% of total group's), income of €1.5 billion (15% of total group's), and employs 31,000 people (15.4% of total group's workforce)[21]
Italy: In 2006 BNP Paribas purchased Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), Italy's sixth largest bank at the time. In 2009 BNL had 810 branches in Italy, 2.5 million individual clients, and over 150,000 corporate clients. It grossed €2.9 billion in revenue (7.2% of the total group's) and €540 million of net income (9.3% of the total group's), and employs around 13,000 employees (6.5% of the total group's).[21]
Belgium: BNP Paribas acquired BNP Paribas Fortis when it acquired the retail banking assets of the Belgian lender Fortis in 2009. This deal also included Fortis's subsidiaries in Poland and Turkey, now grouped in the "Europe Mediterranean" division.

United States[edit]
In the United States, BNP Paribas owns BancWest, which in turn operates retail banking subsidiaries Bank of the West and First Hawaiian Bank. Bank of the West operates in 19 Western US states (where it ranks as the 7th largest bank by assets), while First Hawaiian is Hawaii's leading bank with a 40% market share in deposits. Together the two banks operate 710 branches, and service 5 million clients.
The two banks were merged into BancWest 1998, and BNP Paribas took full control of the combined entity in 2001.
The group has a strong presence on niche markets such as lending for marine and recreational vehicles, church lending, and agribusiness. In 2009 BancWest had €2.1 billion in revenues (5.2% of the total group's), and 11,200 employees (5.5% of the total group's headcount).[21] BancWest lost €223 million in 2009 largely due to its exposure in the subprime mortgage crisis in California, Arizona, and Nevada.
Emerging markets[edit]
In 2009, BNP Paribas reorganized its retail banking divisions renaming its "Emerging Markets" group the "Europe Mediterranean" group. This change was made because after the integration of Fortis Bank's Polish and Turkish subsidiaries, BNP Paribas's emerging market activities are now heavily concentrated in Eastern Europe and the southern half of the Mediterranean basin.
BNP Paribas is a member of the Global ATM Alliance, a joint venture of several major international banks that allows customers of the banks to use their ATM card or check card at another bank within the Global ATM Alliance with no ATM surcharges when traveling internationally. Other participating banks are Barclays (United Kingdom), Bank of America (United States), China Construction Bank (China), Deutsche Bank (Germany), Santander Serfin (Mexico), UkrSibbank (Ukraine), Scotiabank (Canada) and Westpac (Australia and New Zealand).[22]

Fixed Income: BNP Paribas' fixed income team helps companies hedge their exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate, and credit risks, primarily though the structuring and sale of derivative products such as interest rate and foreign exchange swaps, foreign exchange options and credit derivatives. It also trades in these markets on behalf of clients or for its own proprietary account. On an average day, a quarter of a trillion dollars in fixed income instruments are traded at BNP Paribas Americas’ fixed income trading floor located just blocks from the NASDAQ MarketSite in Manhattan, New York City.[23][24]
Equity & Derivatives: BNP Paribas' Equity & Derivatives team helps companies manage their risks and investment portfolios with equity derivatives such as options, futures, and swaps, as well as highly complex, customized solutions such as structured products. It also trades in these markets on behalf of clients or for its own proprietary account.

Investment Banking: BNP Paribas' Corporate Finance team performs most of the traditional investment banking functions of the group including mergers and acquisitions advisory, and equity raising operations such as Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), rights issues, and convertible bond issues.
Structured Finance: BNP Paribas' Structured Finance group offers clients project finance solutions, export financing, syndicated loans, and financing for acquisitions and leveraged buyouts.
Corporate & Transaction Group: BNP Paribas' Corporate and Transaction group offers clients simplified flow banking services including trade finance, international cash management, and basic hedging solutions.

In 2009, BNP CIB earned €12.2 billion in revenue (30% of total group's), €4.4 billion in pre-tax income (48.9% of total group's), and 18,000 employees (9.0% of total group's headcount.)[21]
Investment solutions[edit]
BNP Paribas's "Investment Solutions" unit includes its asset management, custodial banking, real estate, insurance, online brokerage, "Personal Investors" and wealth management activities.[21]
On 11 June 2008, BNP Paribas formally signed an agreement to purchase the Prime Brokerage Services division of Bank of America Securities. The sale was expected to be completed by the end of the 2008 third quarter.
In 2016, BNP Paribas set up a dedicated fintech accelerator to support start-ups that are seeking to improve the customer experience. The programme provided funding of up to €100,000 to chosen fintech firms in order to help develop new products, services and opportunities across the company.[25]

Asset Management: The asset management activities of BNP Paribas are grouped under BNP Paribas Investment Partners. In 2009 BNP Paribas IP had 2,400 employees in more than 70 countries and US $395.1 billion in assets under management (AuM) in 2014 according to the Scorpio Partnership,[26] an increase of 11% over 2013.[26]

Events in 2005[edit]
On 23 September 2005, BNP Paribas was set to take a 20 percent stake in China's Nanjing City Commercial Bank, a Chinese official and state press reports said. "BNP is going to sign a deal with us to buy a stake next month," an official from Nanjing City Commercial told AFP. The Shanghai-based Oriental Morning Post said BNP would pay up to US$100 million, although the bank official said the figure was incorrect. He declined to give further details. The French newspaper La Tribune reported in August 2005 that BNP Paribas had talked to four Chinese commercial banks—Ningbo, Wuxi, Nanjing and Suzhou—and was prepared to invest US$50–100 million. "We've talked to different financial institutions, but only BNP showed its good faith. It was not easy for us to reach an agreement," the Nanjing City Commercial Bank official said. BNP Paribas refused to comment. The International Financial Corporation, the investment arm of the World Bank, already owns 15 percent of Nanjing City Commercial Bank, which has regulatory approval to list on the country's domestic stock markets.

Controversies[edit]
Check processing[edit]
In 2010 the French government's Autorité de la concurrence fined BNP and 10 other banks €384 million for colluding to charge unjustified fees on check processing, including extra fees during the transition from paper check transfer to "Exchanges Check-Image" electronic transfer.[34] On 19 January 2011 BNP sued Russian grain trader, OOO Rosinteragroservis, and its subsidiary OAO Kubankhlebprodukt, claiming US$20 million in debts and penalties.[35]
Nuclear investments[edit]
BNP Paribas is the biggest investor in the nuclear sector as a bank, according to Profundo, with more than €13.5 billion in nuclear investments. On 23 October 2011 Greenpeace organised a protest against BNP Paribas in 24 French cities.[36]
Sanctions violations[edit]
On 30 May 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that the United States Department of Justice was negotiating a possible guilty plea with BNP Paribas as well as the size of the resulting fine for violating U.S. regulations and evading US sanctions. The Justice Department sought a fine of more than US $10 billion, which was expected to be reduced to $8 or $9 billion in negotiations.[37] BNP Paribas was said to have laundered up to US $100 billion from the sanctioned countries of Sudan, Iran, and Cuba.[38]
On 1 July 2014, BNP Paribas pled guilty in a New York state court to falsifying business records as well as conspiracy in connection to those falsifications. It is also expected to plead guilty in federal court to violating laws against money-laundering.[39] It agreed to pay $8.9 billion, the largest fine ever for violating U.S. sanctions, and substantially more than the previous record of $1.9 billion.[19][39] BNP Paribas was also barred for one year under the plea agreement from certain US dollar-dominated transactions. The fine exceeded the bank's $6.4 billion 2013 annual income and the $1.1 billion it previously had allocated for the anticipated fine.[39][40]
The bank's failure to cooperate with the multi-year investigation was given as a significant factor in the size of the fine. Additionally, BNP Paribas continued to process sanctioned transactions after the investigation began. About 30 employees left the bank as a result of the investigation.[39] According to the FBI’s New York Field Office and Chief Richard Weber of the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) "BNPP deliberately disregarded the law and provided rogue nations, and Sudan in particular, with vital access to the global financial system, helping that country’s lawless government to harbor and support terrorists and to persecute its own people. Today’s sentence demonstrates that financial institutions will be punished severely but appropriately for violating sanctions laws and risking our national security interests."[41]
After the fine was announced, BNP said it would be "just fine" and that it had "a comprehensive plan" to avoid similar violations in the future. The company's stock, which had fallen 12% since news of the investigation first leaked, rose 4% on the announcement.[39][40] To comply with the transaction ban, BNP Paribas will use a third party to clear its US transactions. Standard & Poor's said it was reviewing the bank's financial standing[when?] in light of the fine and penalties for a possible downgrade.[39]
Russian president Vladimir Putin alleged without providing any supporting evidence that the US government was using the case to punish France for selling Mistral amphibious assault ships to Russia. He said the large fine and the imposition of sanctions on the French bank were the result of US displeasure with France's decision not to stop the sale.[42] Former European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet had previously said that a large fine was neither fair nor proportionate to the violations and could disrupt the global banking system.[39]
152 Million Erroneous Trade case[edit]
The German FOCUS magazine and the French Les Echos newspaper published an article regarding a 163 Million EUR mistrade (erroneous trade) in which BNP Paribas Arbitrage is allegedly involved.[43][44] The bank has sold securities for 326,400 EUR to the investor Armin S. but the value of the securities is 163 Million EUR according to the bank.
According to the article, the error remained unnoticed for several days. BNP has even reconfirmed the original price. However, a trade-cancellation was only possible until the next day according to prevailing mistrade rules.
A German lawyer stated in the article that a bank not recognizing an error of this magnitude should not be protected by law.[43][45] [46]
Sponsorship[edit]
BNP Paribas has been a major sponsor of tennis. In 1973 it became the major sponsor of the French Open, one of the four prestigious Grand Slam tournaments in the sport. In 2001 the bank began to sponsor the Davis Cup before becoming the title sponsor in 2002. Also in 2002 it became the sponsor of the Paris Masters, one of the nine high-profile tournaments of the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 series. It also expanded to the United States in 2009 when it became the title sponsor of the Indian Wells Masters, a two-week tournament in California which is also one of the nine Masters 1000 series. The Stanford Classic, since 1992, is instead directly sponsored by the Bank of the West subsidiary.
Corporate philanthropy[edit]
Under the aegis of the Fondation de France, the BNP Paribas Foundation[47] has been playing a key role in corporate philanthropy for more than 30 years. It is also encouraging to developing the BNP Paribas international philanthropic policy where the Group does business.
The BNP Paribas Foundation[47] aims at developing its activities through a corporate philanthropic approach, dedicated to three fields of action:

The Arts: contemporary dance, new circus arts, jazz music, restoration of artworks, classical music festivals;
Solidarity : programme focusing on equal opportunities, social entrepreneurship, fight against exclusion and situations of extreme deprivation;
The Environmental research: support to laboratories in France, in Europe and on an international collaboration so as to implement the research projects on climate change.

The BNP Paribas Foundation supports since 1984, more than 300 cultural projects, 40 programmes on research, and a thousand of social & educational initiatives in France and worldwide. Its major programmes are:

Dream Up, new international educational programme based on the practice of the arts;
BNP Paribas for Art, programme supporting restoration of works of arts since 1994;
Climate Initiative, in support of fundamental research on climate change;
Projet Banlieues, initiative created in connection with the BNP Paribas network of agencies inside the Solidarity activity;
Help to Help, a programme that promotes the Group staff initiative as volunteers.

In 2015, BNP Paribas Corporate Philanthropy in the world represented a commitment of almost 40 million euros.
In 2015, Standard Ethics Aei has given a Sustainability Rating to BNP Paribas (EE+) in order to include it in its Standard Ethics French Index.[48]
