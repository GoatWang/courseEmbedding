                                            Madison/Deerfield- Richard W. Anderson, age 81, passed away on Saturday, February 11, 2017 at Agrace HopsiceCare.  He was born in Chicago on November 3, 1935, the son of William and Alma Anderson.  On December 22, 1961 Dick married Carole Sprengel.  He was a self-employed door-to-door milk man for over 20 years in the Illinois Chain of Lakes area.  After his retirement, Dick ran the Barrel of Fun Park in Douglas, MI for five years.  In 2008 Dick and Carole moved to WI to be closer to their children.  He enjoyed spending time with his grandchildren especially attending their sporting events, and sailing on Lake Michigan and Madison lakes.  Dick is survived by his children, Carolyn (Rich) Wyman, Will (Angie) Anderson and Darren (Julie) Anderson; 14 grandchildren, Cody, Amber, Cade Wyman, Madey and Noah Anderson, Eva, Raquel, Liana, Sofia, Olivia, Alicia, Julia, Marcia, Gabriella Anderson; sister, Dorothy Nordlander; many extended relatives and friends; and his beloved cat, Misty.  He was preceded in death by his parents; his wife Carole in 2012; and sister, Marilyn Wobith.  Funeral services will be held at 11:00 AM on Wednesday, February 15, 2017 at Abiding Shepherd Lutheran Church, 406 W. Cottage Grove Road, Cottage Grove, with Rev. Nathan Krause officiating.  Friends and relatives are invited to a luncheon, immediately following the services, in the church fellowship hall.  Burial will take place in Sunset Memory Gardens.  Visitation will be held from 10:00 AM until the time of services Wednesday at church.  Memorials may be made to Agrace HospiceCare Inc.  A special thank you to the staff of Agrace HospiceCare Inc. and UW Hospital, and to Dick's friends at The Gardens in Madison.  Please share your memories of Dick.

                                            Madison/Deerfield- Richard W. Anderson, age 81, passed away on Saturday, February 11, 2017 at Agrace HopsiceCare.  He was born in Chicago on November 3, 1935, the son of William and Alma Anderson.  On December 22, 1961 Dick married Carole Sprengel.  He was a self-employed door-to-door milk man for over 20 years in the Illinois Chain of Lakes area.  After his retirement, Dick ran the Barrel of Fun Park in Douglas, MI for five years.  In 2008 Dick and Carole moved to WI to be closer to their children.  He enjoyed spending time with his grandchildren especially attending their sporting events, and sailing on Lake Michigan and Madison lakes.  Dick is survived by his children, Carolyn (Rich) Wyman, Will (Angie) Anderson and Darren (Julie) Anderson; 14 grandchildren, Cody, Amber, Cade Wyman, Madey and Noah Anderson, Eva, Raquel, Liana, Sofia, Olivia, Alicia, Julia, Marcia, Gabriella Anderson; sister, Dorothy Nordlander; many extended relatives and friends; and his beloved cat, Misty.  He was preceded in death by his parents; his wife Carole in 2012; and sister, Marilyn Wobith.  Funeral services will be held at 11:00 AM on Wednesday, February 15, 2017 at Abiding Shepherd Lutheran Church, 406 W. Cottage Grove Road, Cottage Grove, with Rev. Nathan Krause officiating.  Friends and relatives are invited to a luncheon, immediately following the services, in the church fellowship hall.  Burial will take place in Sunset Memory Gardens.  Visitation will be held from 10:00 AM until the time of services Wednesday at church.  Memorials may be made to Agrace HospiceCare Inc.  A special thank you to the staff of Agrace HospiceCare Inc. and UW Hospital, and to Dick's friends at The Gardens in Madison.  Please share your memories of Dick.
