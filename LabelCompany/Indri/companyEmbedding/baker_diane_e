Beauty Secret



No other cream combines so many potent peptides with nature’s most hydrating botanicals. It’s a five-star recipe for beautiful skin at every age. As we like to say "When modern science meets Mother Nature, amazing things happen!"
Your skin will look rejuvenated—fresher, younger, prettier. Age spots and redness fade from view, wrinkles disappear. You'll wake up every morning with a radiant, healthy youthful glow. This triple power Dream Cream gives you dewy skin that lies about your age—even if you don't!


How to Get Rid of Wrinkles
Although beauty may only be skin deep, we’d like it to last a lifetime, if possible. The good news is that with the proper diet, the right exercise, and a little TLC (below), you can discover just how to get rid of wrinkles and look great well into your golden years!
So what causes wrinkles exactly? The longer you live, the more your skin naturally starts to dry out and tighten up. Those little lines that were once barely visible become much more noticeable, especially if you spend a lot of time in the sun. Wrinkles also develop if you don’t keep your skin properly hydrated. So you should drink at least 8-10 glasses of water every single day. Finally, smoking not only dries out your skin, but the chemicals you inhale destroy blood vessels around your eyes and mouth, causing deeper wrinkles. (See our Look Younger, Prettier, Sexier…NOW! Special Report for details.) Now that you know what causes the problem, here’s how to get rid of those bothersome wrinkles.
It may seem like magic, but it’s really the latest skin science. Thanks to the following clinically-proven ingredients, you can get rid of wrinkles and help yourself to younger-looking skin:

Peptides are powerful proteins that stimulate collagen production to increase skin thickness and improve skin elasticity.
Vitamins A, C, and E improve firmness and plump up tissue to fill in wrinkles, while also vacuuming up free radicals to protect your skin.
Aloe vera and sweet almond oil heal irritation and moisturize instantly to make skin feel velvety soft.
Rich butters contribute powerful emollients with strong hydrating properties to help smooth out wrinkles and improve elasticity.
Botanical extracts fade age spots, reduce redness, brighten skin tone, boost collagen production, help reduce wrinkles, and firm up and strengthen sagging skin.

Does feeding your skin the purest form of vitamins, antioxidants, rejuvenating herbs, and hydrating butters really make a difference? YOU BET! Baker’s Best Anti-Aging and Wrinkle Cream contains these wonderful ingredients and much, much more. This “Dream Cream” attacks what causes wrinkles, helping to fade age spots, reduce redness, brighten skin tone, and boost collagen production, while improving the appearance of existing wrinkles and preventing new ones from forming in the first place. It’s a five-star recipe for beautiful skin and the secret of how to get rid of wrinkles at every age!
Baker's Best® Anti-Aging & Wrinkle Cream as well as the Baker's Best® Age Spot & Skin Brightening Cream combines all of these ingredients in one fantastic formula to help get rid of age spots, even out skin tone, and peel years off your appearance in just a few short weeks!


"Your Anti-Aging and Wrinkle Cream has made my face look and feel 20 times better than before. I didn’t say anything to anyone for a while. Then my friend at church said, ‘I love to hug you because your face is so soft and you look great!"  Nancy A., MO
"I use your Cream every morning and evening for crow’s feet and deep wrinkles on my forehead. It works very well and gives my skin a healthy glow."  Glenda W., KS
"Your Cream started helping immediately. I am 82 years old and really didn’t expect miracles, but my wrinkles don’t look as deep. I saw improvement right away."  Mary Lou D., SC
"Your Cream made my skin tone more even and my pores smaller. Plus, my overall complexion really improved. I would definitely recommend it because it works!"  Nancy B., MI
"Your Cream works fast, making my skin look nice and tight."  Joyce R., MO
"I love your Cream! I use it every morning under my makeup, and it feels real soothing on my face. I’ve also used it on my feet, and it’s getting rid of the cracked skin on my heels."  Nancy W., OH
 "I love how your Cream goes on so smooth and is absorbed completely. My twin sister recently noticed something different about me…she said I looked a lot younger. I told her about your new Cream, and she wanted some…immediately!"  Kathy J., MI 
 "After using your Cream for only a month, my skin is smoother and my age spots are disappearing. It really seems to plump up my thin skin and sagging neck from the inside out. And I see a marked difference in texture. If this Cream continues to improve my skin the way it has been, I'll soon look 30 years younger!"  Nancy A., NV 
 "I am 87 years old and I can't tell you how much I love what your amazing Cream has done for me! I had wrinkles and sagging skin that made me look older than I feel. But you can see for yourself how good I look now!"  Mary S., WA
 "This product should be called ‘Wrinkles Are Gone Cream’! After using your Anti-Aging & Wrinkle Cream for two weeks, the skin on my face and throat was noticeably firmer, smoother, and healthier. Thanks for giving me back my youthful glow!"  Jo A., TX 
 "I've been using your Cream twice daily to smooth out the appearance of wrinkles... and now I look years younger!"  Constance B., MI
 "Before using your Cream, I had lines around my eyes. Now they have markedly diminished. I have very sensitive skin and have always had problems when trying new products. Your Cream did not cause my skin to break out and leaves it very smooth. I absolutely love your Cream—it works very well and lives up to its claims."  Lisa M., MI  
 "Your Cream is smooth and lightweight. It also has a terrific texture and does a great job of softening the appearance of my 70-year-old wrinkles!"  Sue O., FL 
 "Before using your Cream, my skin always felt dry and dehydrated, but not any more! I love your Cream!"   Linda B., MI 
 "After wasting a lot of money, I finally found a Cream that solves my dry skin problem. Since using it, the fine lines around my eyes have faded, and I no longer fear the harsh winter weather."   Patti S., MI 
"Since I started using your new Cream, my whole neck is firmer and the small wrinkles around my eyes are not noticeable. Thanks for a terrific product that really works!"  Susan W., MI 
 "I call your Cream 'extreme moisturizer.' I use it all winter long and my face never dries out. I also use it to protect my skin from the summer sun while working as a lifeguard. Keep it coming!"   Katelyn S., MI 
 "I enjoy swimming laps in a local pool four days a week. I use your Cream on my face and body to combat the effects of the harsh water. And I heartily recommend it to anyone who has dry skin."   Virginia W., MD 
 "I love the feeling of the cream on my skin and the look of my skin after using it. Before, I had spots and uneven skin texture. But now they are very much improved."  Diane P., TX
"Your Cream feels smooth going on, and it leaves my skin feeling refreshed."  Linda H., OH
And it's not for women only-
Check out what men have to say about our amazing Anti-Aging & Wrinkle Cream:

“I am a 76-year-old man and even though I've always looked younger than my years, since using your Cream, I look 8 to 10 years younger! Rick L. AZ
"This Cream actually works! I had age lines under my eyes and crow's feet. After using your Cream, all of my lines have softened. I'm an aging baby boomer in the twilight of my second childhood, and with Baker's Best, I now get lots of looks from the ladies." Charles F., IL

Biography
Diane Bakers career began with a spilled
beverage at the Beverly Hills Hotel. At age 18, she was one of hundreds of entrants in the
annual Rheingold Beer contest, yet despite having been born and raised in Hollywood, she
had no ties to the entertainment industry, and her only preparation for Rheingolds
prestigious contest consisted of some modeling classes taken after school. As Diane
nervously approached judges Irene Dunne, Joan Fontaine, and Ida Lupino, her attempt to
gracefully set her portfolio on the table resulted in a decidedly ungraceful fumble which
sent a glass of the beer flyingdirectly into the lap of Irene Dunne. An inauspicious
beginning? Far from it; Ms. Dunne just laughed and told Diane to take the impromptu
drenching as a good sign, and Diane became one of the six Rheingold finalists.
While on the Rheingold tour, Diane was constantly
asked by the press what she hoped to do with her life. Each time she answered that she was
torn between becoming an actress, or a career in politics. To all who knew Diane, it
looked as if politics would prevail. When Diane was 8 years old she met the Douglas family
who made a profound impression on her. Although Congresswoman Helen Gahagan Douglas was
defeated in her run against Richard Nixon for the Senate, she impressed upon Diane the
importance of doing the best work you could to make a difference in the world. 
When Diane returned to Los Angeles, her parents
convinced her to put an acting career aside in favor of attending the University of
Southern California. She attended college for two semesters, but found herself reading
every play she could get her hands on. These she carefully concealed within the pages of
her textbooks, and spent much of the time learning lines for scenes for her evening acting
class. She continued through her third semester, when one of her understanding, professors
helped Diane accept the fact that her heart belonged to acting and that she should pursue
a career in that field. 
Taking the money she earned from the Rheingold
contest, Diane moved to New York where she studied acting with Charles Conrad, and ballet
with Nina Fonaroff. Dianes California boyfriend, however, wasted no time in
launching an extensive campaign to bring Diane home. When Diane held firm, the resourceful
fellow enlisted the aid of Dianes father, until the barrage of phone calls and
letters stemming from their collective efforts could no longer be ignored. Diane returned
to Hollywood, to her family, her boyfriend and her friends. 
She continued her training in Los Angeles at the
Estelle Harman Workshop, and quickly secured a contract with Twentieth Century Fox. There
she was introduced to director George Stevens Sr., who was in the process of casting
"The Diary Of Anne Frank." With the possible exception of spilling beer on Irene
Dunne, it is difficult to imagine a more awkward meeting. Diane was taken by the hand and
marched across the commissary to meet George Stevens while he was eating his lunch. His
attempt to stand and shake her hand became a muddle of dropped napkins and silverware, but
it also led to an audition for the role of Margot Frank. Diane won the coveted role during
her first screen test, when Otto Frank was moved to tears over how very much Diane
resembled his daughter. That night, Otto Frank invited Diane and Millie Perkins, who
played "Anne" to visit, high in the Hollywood hills where he was a house guest.
With the lights of the city spread out below them, Diane sat with Otto Frank, and as she
shared photos and memories of his family, she realized that she had found her true
calling. Like her mentors, Helen Gahagan and Melvyn Douglas, she knew she wanted to make a
difference in the world, but she now knew that she might be able to communicate her
beliefs through the medium of film. This would continue to be the hallmark of Dianes
career. 
Diane remained at 20th Century Fox as a contract
player for four and a half years where she performed in films such as "Journey To The
Center of the Earth", "The Best of Everything", "300 Spartans,"
"The Wizard of Baghdad," and "Nine Hours to Rama" directed by Mark
Robson. After her contract ended she went to MGM to film "The Prize" again
working with Mark Robson. She was offered a new contract at Universal, which she turned
down but did two films for the studio; "Mirage" with Gregory Peck and
"Marnie" for director, Alfred Hitchcock. Dianes knowledge and appreciation
of her craft constantly grew, thanks to the excellent directors and actors with whom she
worked, including George Stevens, Mark Robson, and actors, Melvyn Douglas, Edward G.
Robinson, Paul Newman, Barbara Stanwyck and Joan Crawford. 
The filming of the movie "Nine Hours to
Rama" took Diane on location to India, where she visited a local home in which
several children were gathered around a tiny black and white television set, engrossed in
an American program. Diane was struck, not just by how far American entertainment reached,
but by the low caliber of material that was being produced. And so, in a dusty Indian
village, she decided it was time to take responsibility for a higher quality of television
and film, and her career as a producer was born. 
Dianes first effort as a producer was the
self-financed documentary, "Ashiana," which dealt with the end of feudalism in
India. Other documentaries followed, and then dramas, but even when she took on a work of
fiction, Diane never strayed from her commitment to tell stories that would have a
positive impact on her audience. Diane produced "Portrait of Grandpa Doc," for
director Randal Kleiser whom she credits with "really helping me to start my
producing career" and the award winning "One of A Kind." She personally
screened these films for an executive at ABC and they were immediately purchased and aired
on ABC. She next tackled the independent feature "Second Star to the Right," aka
"Never Never Land", which initially seemed destined to fall apart due to a
myriad of difficulties, but she refused to give up and decided to go "hat in
hand" and raised the money through private financing and set out to film on location
in London. It was more than enough to scare away the most seasoned producer, but Diane had
based her career on less than easy beginnings. If she could follow an awkward introduction
to George Stevens with an audition performance that moved everyone watching to tears, she
could keep her film afloat. With no office other than her briefcase, Diane produced the
film in London with the help of wonderful members of the British Film Industry and Petula
Clark, who played the lead. This success opened the door for a future project, a
mini-series based on Barbara Taylor Bradfords "A Woman Of Substance,"
which received an Emmy nomination.
Fortunately for her fans, Dianes producing
career did not signal an end to her acting days, although she has remained resolute in her
desire to only accept quality acting work. She has worked with Anthony Hopkins and
director Jonathan Demme in "Silence of the Lambs," and her television credits
include "The Blue and the Gray," "Inherit the Wind" and most recently
"About Sarah", "ER" and CBS "Jackie O." playing the role of
Rose Kennedy. As well a part in a new HBO pilot series 
directed by George Clooney.
Diane is developing 
several feature films and is bringing the creative elements together. She enjoys 
working with new writers, directors and actors, helping them achieve their 
goals.   
 Diane continues to reinvent herself, as an actress, a producer and soon as a director. She
will always be driven by her interest in social issues, coupled with the knowledge that
while no one person can single-handedly improve mans plight,
 by making good films,
one can make a difference. Framed in Dianes office is a quote from one of her
favorite filmmakers, Francois Truffaut, which reads, "Making a movie is like a
stage coach ride through the old west. At first you hope for a pleasant journey, and then
you simply hope to reach your destination." For Diane Baker, however, there is no
doubt that as she continues moving forward she will continue to enjoy her journey.
