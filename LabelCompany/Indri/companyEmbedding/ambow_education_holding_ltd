《人民政协报》：用互联网精神推动大学转型当前位置：首页媒体《人民政协报》：用互联网精神推动大学转型











陈亚聪
2016-04-27期10版
几年前的一件事，重庆文理学院校长孙泽平至今还记得。那时学校需要招聘一个网球老师，3个研究生来应聘。“你们跟我们的学生打一局吧”，让他没想到的是，居然没有一个人打得过学生。“看，这就是我们大学培养出来的人才，只有理论，缺乏技能，学校自己都不想用，更何况企业呢？”那一刻，孙泽平越发坚定学校要转型，要走应用型大学的路子，要改革人才培养模式，只有这样，培养的学生毕业后才能直接上手，与企业需求无缝对接。
可是改革不是简单的增加一门课，而是需要一整套的课程体系及相应老师，这对很多学校而言并不是件容易事，尤其是缺乏企业资源，不能根据企业需求有针对性地设计课程。怎么办？一次意外的机会，孙泽平认识了安博教育集团的董事长黄劲，他突然找到了解决方法。
“我们有针对各大企业的大数据平台，收集了不同企业的需求后总结、拎出共性需求，并利用自己丰富的专业资源设计课程体系，为学校提供教学方案，甚至还可以负责师资培训。”黄劲告诉记者，这样培养的人才具备适合这一领域的基本素质，可直接进入企业，在此基础上，不同企业可依据个性需求再做简单的上岗培训即可。“这便是真正的校企合作，既解决了学生的就业、又满足了企业的需求。”
针对向应用型大学转型的本科学校，安博还有一种模式，简单到校方只用回答yes或no。即校方购买服务，委托集团来打造、管理这个学院，从课程体系到管理团队，集团的管理模式、平台、社会资源都一同被引进到学校。“这种模式打破了过去封闭式培养，转向开放式的联合培养，恰恰契合了高等教育的改革精神——开放，也符合政府提倡的积极购买社会服务。”孙泽平说自己回去就准备采用这一模式。
“你正好需要，我正好专业。其实，这正是互联网精神：合作、资源共享，专业的人做专业的事，实现真正的共赢。”黄劲希望这一模式可以助力更多本科院校实现转型。

We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
