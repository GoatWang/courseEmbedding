(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The information in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") should be read in conjunction with the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes set forth in Item 1 of Part I of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, our MD&A set forth in Item 7 of Part II of our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our consolidated financial statements and related notes set forth in Item 8 of Part II of our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Part II, Item 1A, "Risk Factors," below and "Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Information," above, and the information referenced therein, for a description of risks that we face and important factors that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements. All amounts and percentages are approximate due to rounding and all dollars are in millions, except per share amounts or where otherwise noted. When we cross-reference to a "Note," we are referring to our "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements," unless the context indicates otherwise. All amounts noted within the tables are in thousands and amounts and percentages are approximate due to rounding.  Overview  Our Company  We design, manufacture and market a broad array of products that power, protect and connect electronic circuits. These products are primarily used in the networking, telecommunications, computing, military, aerospace, transportation and broadcasting industries. Bel's portfolio of products also finds application in the automotive, medical and consumer electronics markets.  We operate through three geographic segments: North America, Asia and Europe. In the three months ended March 31, 2017, 53% of the Company's revenues were derived from North America, 32% from Asia and 15% from its Europe operating segment. By product group, 37% of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017 related to the Company's connectivity solutions products, 32% in power solutions and protection products and 31% in magnetic products.  Our operating expenses are driven principally by the cost of labor where the factories that Bel uses are located, the cost of the materials that we use and our ability to effectively and efficiently manage overhead costs. As labor and material costs vary by product line and region, any significant shift in product mix can have an associated impact on our costs of sales. Costs are recorded as incurred for all products manufactured. Such amounts are determined based upon the estimated stage of production and include labor cost and fringes and related allocations of factory overhead. Our products are manufactured at various facilities in the U.S., Mexico, Dominican Republic, England, Czech Republic, Slovakia and the PRC.  In the PRC, where we generally enter into processing arrangements with several independent third-party contractors and also have our own manufacturing facilities, the availability of labor is cyclical and is significantly affected by the migration of workers in relation to the annual Lunar New Year holiday as well as economic conditions in the PRC. In addition, we have little visibility into the ordering habits of our customers and we can be subjected to large and unpredictable variations in demand for our products. Accordingly, we must continually recruit and train new workers to replace those lost to attrition each year and be able to address peaks in demand that may occur from time to time. These recruiting and training efforts and related inefficiencies, and overtime required in order to meet demand, can add volatility to the costs incurred by us for labor in the PRC.  Key Factors Affecting our Business  The Company believes the key factors affecting Bel's results for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and/or future results include the following:  � Revenues -The Company's revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 decreased by $7.5 million (or 6.2%) as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decline experienced in the Power Solutions business throughout 2016 accounted for $6.9 million of the decrease in sales in first quarter 2017 sales compared to the first quarter of 2016. Lower sales through distribution partners and weakness in the industrial markets, particularly in the oil and gas segment, also contributed to the reduced sales volume in the first quarter. On a sequential basis, consolidated sales were down by $4.9 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, largely due to the seasonal interruption related to the Lunar New Year holiday in the first quarter which impacts all of our product lines.  � Product Mix - Material and labor costs vary by product line and any significant shift in product mix between higher- and lower-margin product lines will have a corresponding impact on the Company's gross margin percentage. In general, our connectivity products have the highest contribution margins, our magnetic products are less profitable than the connectivity products and our power products are on the lower end of our profit margin range. Fluctuations in sales volume among our product groups will have a corresponding impact on Bel's profit margins.  Return to Index  � Impact of Foreign Currency - Since we are a U.S. domiciled company, we translate our foreign currency-denominated financial results into U.S. dollars. Due to the changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, translating our financial results and the revaluation of certain intercompany transactions to and from foreign currencies to U.S. dollars may result in a favorable or unfavorable impact to our condensed consolidated statements of operations and cash flows. The Company monitors changes in foreign currencies and implements pricing actions to help mitigate the impact that changes in foreign currencies may have on its operating results. See Selling, General and Administrative Expense below for further details.  � Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") System Implementation - We are currently engaged in a multi-year process of conforming the majority of our operations onto one global ERP system. We currently estimate total costs over the next three years to be between $4 million to $5 million. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company incurred $0.4 million of consulting costs in connection with this implementation, which are included in SG&A in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. We anticipate future expenses of approximately $0.5 million per quarter through the remainder of 2017. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for further information.  � Effective Tax Rate - The Company's effective tax rate will fluctuate based on the geographic segment in which our pretax profits are earned. Of the geographic segments in which we operate, the U.S. has the highest tax rates; Europe's tax rates are generally lower than U.S. tax rates; and Asia has the lowest tax rates of the Company's three geographical segments.  While first quarter sales continued to decline both year-over-year and sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2016, we are encouraged by the upturn in our bookings during the first quarter across all of our product lines. Within the connectivity solutions group, there were increased orders related to our RF and Harsh Environment Optical products from military and distribution customers both in the U.S. and Europe. On the power solutions and protection side, there was a mild upswing in sales to customers that support datacenters and we expect growth in this product group in the second half of 2017 as certain key projects move into full production. In addition, recent project wins in the eMobility segment should have a favorable impact on sales beginning in 2018. The preceding discussions represent Forward-Looking Statements. See "Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."  Summary by Operating Segment Net sales to external customers by operating segment for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 North America $ 60,430 53 % $ 66,300 55 % Asia 35,812 32 % 35,762 29 % Europe 17,426 15 % 19,120 16 % $ 113,668 100 % $ 121,182 100 %  The decline in North America sales noted above was primarily due to a $4.7 million reduction in Power Solutions sales in North America during the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016, coupled with reduced demand for our plugs and general weakness in our structured cabling assemblies in 2017. The reduction in sales in Europe noted in the table above primarily resulted from lower Power Solutions sales in that region. See Net Sales, Power Solutions and Protection, below.  Net sales and income from operations by operating segment for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows. Segment net sales are attributed to individual segments based on the geographic source of the billing for customer sales.  Return to Index   Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Total segment sales: North America $ 63,155 $ 69,254 Asia 56,411 59,648 Europe 20,385 22,373 Total segment sales 139,951 151,275 Reconciling item: Intersegment sales (26,283 ) (30,093 ) Net sales $ 113,668 $ 121,182 Income from operations: North America $ 730 $ (43,187 ) Asia 1,036 (38,808 ) Europe 327 (21,412 ) $ 2,093 $ (103,407 )  The non-cash impairment charge recorded during the first quarter of 2016 related to goodwill and other intangible assets impacted all of the Company's operating segments. See Note 12, Segments, for the allocation of this charge by operating segment. Excluding this impairment charge, income from operations by operating segment for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $1.8 million for North America, $2.7 million for Asia and $0.6 million for Europe. The income from operations for North America in the first quarter of 2016 included a $1.5 million reduction in SG&A expenses related to the settlement of value-added tax (VAT). Operating income in the first quarter of 2017 declined in all segments from the first quarter of 2016 (excluding the impairment charge) due to lower sales in 2017.  Net Sales The Company's net sales by major product line for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Magnetic solutions $ 35,696 31 % $ 35,507 29 % Power solutions and protection 36,153 32 % 42,231 35 % Connectivity solutions 41,819 37 % 43,444 36 % $ 113,668 100 % $ 121,182 100 %  Magnetic Solutions:  We experienced a slight improvement in demand for our ICM/TRP products during the first quarter of 2017 as we continue to focus on increasing volume through our distribution partners and deploying new variants of our ICM products.  Power Solutions and Protection:  The decline in power solutions and protection products during the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the same quarter of 2016 was primarily attributable to a $6.9 million reduction in Power Solutions sales. Sales within the Power Solutions business (acquired in 2014) continued to trend downward throughout 2016 and into the first quarter of 2017, as new projects were moving through the 18-24 month design-to-market cycle and the NPS product line (sold in 2015) began to transition off of its 2-year manufacturing services agreement. This decline was partially offset by increases in sales of our AC/DC converter products of $0.7 million and our circuit protection products of $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the first quarter of 2016.  Connectivity Solutions:  The reduction in sales of connectivity solutions products in the first quarter of 2017 primarily relate to lower demand for plugs and structured cabling within our Stewart Connector business. Approximately half of this decline is expected to be a permanent reduction due to consolidation within our customer base. The remainder is largely tied to the deferral in construction spending, which is expected to improve in the second half of 2017.  Return to Index  Cost of Sales Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 consisted of the following: Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Material costs 40.1 % 41.2 % Labor costs 10.2 % 10.6 % Research and development expenses 5.8 % 5.5 % Other expenses 23.4 % 23.7 % Total cost of sales 79.5 % 81.0 %  Material costs as a percentage of sales were lower during the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the same period of 2016, primarily due to the decline in sales within our power solutions and protection group, as those products carry a higher material content than our other product lines.  Included in cost of sales is research and development ("R&D") expense of $6.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and $6.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016.  The other expenses noted in the table above include fixed cost items such as support labor and fringe, depreciation and amortization, and facility costs (rent, utilities, insurance). In total, these other expenses decreased during the first quarter of 2017 by $1.9 million as compared to the same period of 2016. The largest driver of the decrease in fixed costs was in support labor and fringe expense, which declined by $0.9 million in first quarter of 2017 as compared to the same period 2016, due to the operational efficiencies and restructuring efforts implemented in 2016.  Selling, General and Administrative Expense ("SG&A")  SG&A expense increased $3.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared with the same period of 2016. In the first quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a benefit of $2.8 million for certain value-added and business tax items in connection with the acquisition of Power Solutions. Other factors contributing to the increase in 2017 related to $0.4 million of consulting fees incurred during the first quarter of 2017 in connection with the Company's ERP implementation and an increase of foreign exchange losses of $0.2 million as compared to the first quarter of 2016.  Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill and other intangibles impairment charge of $108.6 million. The impairment charge does not impact any future cash expenditures, impact liquidity, affect the ongoing business or financial performance, or impact compliance with our debt covenants.  Provision for Income Taxes  The Company's effective tax rate will fluctuate based on the geographic segment in which the pretax profits are earned. Of the geographic segments in which the Company operates, the U.S. has the highest tax rates; Europe's tax rates are generally lower than U.S. tax rates; and Asia has the lowest tax rates of the Company's three geographical segments.  The benefit for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was less than $0.1 million and $4.9 million, respectively. The Company's earnings (loss) before benefit for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were approximately $106.3 million higher than the same period in 2016, primarily attributable to the $108.6 million impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets during the three months ended March 31, 2016. The Company's effective tax rate was (3.2%) and 4.6% for the three month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate during the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the same period of 2016, is primarily attributable to the tax effect related to the impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets, as well as the settlement of the liability for uncertain tax positions in 2016. Additionally, foreign taxes were lower in the first quarter of 2017 due to a decrease in the Europe and Asia segment income.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our primary sources of cash are the collection of trade receivables generated from the sales of our products and services to our customers and amounts available under our existing lines of credit, including our credit facility. Our primary uses of cash are payments for operating expenses, investments in working capital, capital expenditures, interest, taxes, dividends, debt obligations and other long-term liabilities. We believe that our current liquidity position and future cash flows from operations will enable us to fund our operations, including all of the items mentioned above in the next twelve months.  Return to Index  Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable comprised approximately 34.0% of the Company's total assets at March 31, 2017 and 34.6% of total assets at December 31, 2016. The Company's current ratio (i.e., the ratio of current assets to current liabilities) was 2.9 to 1 at March 31, 2017 and 2.8 to 1 at December 31, 2016.  On June 19, 2014, the Company entered into a senior Credit and Security Agreement ("CSA") (see Note 7, Debt, for additional details). The CSA, as amended, contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default and financial covenants that measure (i) the ratio of the Company's total funded indebtedness, on a consolidated basis, to the amount of the Company's consolidated EBITDA, as defined ("Leverage Ratio"), and (ii) the ratio of the amount of the Company's consolidated EBITDA to the Company's consolidated fixed charges. If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the CSA would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due thereunder and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor.  At March 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants, including its most restrictive covenant, the Leverage Ratio. The unused credit available under the credit facility at March 31, 2017 was $46.0 million, of which we had the ability to borrow $43.4 million without violating our Leverage Ratio covenant based on the Company's existing consolidated EBITDA.  We are currently engaged in a multi-year process of conforming the majority of our operations onto one global ERP system. The ERP is designed to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and financial transaction processes, accurately maintain our books and records, and provide information important to the operation of the business to our management team. The implementation of the ERP is being conducted by business unit on a three phase approach over the next three years. We currently estimate total costs over the next three years to be between $4 million to $5 million. These costs will be included in SG&A on the condensed consolidated financial statements. Upon completion of the implementation of the new ERP, we anticipate lower maintenance and lower external information and technology support fees resulting in annual savings of approximately $2 million. The preceding sentence represents a Forward-Looking Statement. See "Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."  Cash Flows  Three Months Ended March 31, 2017  During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company's cash and cash equivalents decreased by $1.1 million. This decrease was due to the following:  � net cash used in operating activities of $0.7 million;  � purchases of property, plant and equipment of $1.0 million; and  � dividend payments of $0.8 million; partially offset by  � net borrowings of long-term debt during the quarter of $1.5 million.  During the three months ended March 31, 2017, accounts receivable decreased by $2.0 million primarily due to lower sales volume in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Days sales outstanding (DSO) increased to 58 days at March 31, 2017 from 54 days at December 31, 2016, primary due to a 32% increase in sales from February to March 2017. Inventory levels were up by $2.4 million at March 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 as raw materials and work in progress balances increased from year-end levels to accommodate the anticipated increase in sales for the second half of 2017.  Three Months Ended March 31, 2016  During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company's cash and cash equivalents decreased by $16.0 million. This decrease was primarily due to the following:  � repayments of long-term debt of $21.6 million;  � purchases of property, plant and equipment of $1.6 million; and  � net cash provided by operations of $8.9 million.  Return to Index  Critical Accounting Policies  Management's discussion and analysis of Bel's financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to product returns, bad debts, inventories, goodwill, intangible assets, investments, warranties, SERP expense, income taxes and contingencies and litigation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  The discussion of new financial accounting standards applicable to the Company is incorporated herein by reference to Note 1 to the Company's Financial Statements, "Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies," included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Fuse Type:



Ferrule(2)

Ferrule fuses, sometimes called cylindrical fuses, are used for low power applications where space is limited.


Finger Safe(1)

Finger-safe fuses reduce the chance of shock in order to lower the chance of coming in contact with a live conductor as well as reduce hazards.


General Purpose(1530)

General purpose or class H non-renewable cartridge fuse have a single element and two cylindrical end caps designed for disposable, one-time use


Midget(17)

Midget fues are designed to protect circuits in various types of industrial equipment used in industrial and commercial buildings. They commonly have ampere ratings up to 50 amps.


Miniature Ceramic(217)

Miniature ceramic fuses are constructed of a conductive metal placed on a small ceramic body. They are more durable than glass bodies and are commonly used in appliances and electronics.


Miniature Glass(548)

Miniature glassfuses are constructed of a conductive metal placed on a small glass body. Fuses with glass bodies are easier to see if they are blown. They are commonly used in appliances and electronics.


Miniature Glass/Ceramic(2)

Miniature glass and ceramic fuses are constructed of a conductive metal placed on a small ceramic or glass body. Fuses with glass bodies are easier to see if they are blown while ceramic bodies are more durable. They are commonly used in appliances and electronics.


Multimeter(3)

Multimeter fuses are designed to protect both analog and digital multi-meters. They are rated at 1000V AC or DC and are commonly used in power electronics meters and controls.


Pin Indicator(33)

Pin indicator fuses are designed with a pin that extends out of the fuse cap when an overload are short circuit occurs.


Plug Fuse(34)

Plug fuses, also known as edison fuses, are designed with a thread to screw into a socket and are often found in a box cover units or panels. They are commonly used in residential, industrial applications as well as for motor protection.


Renewable(205)

Renewable fuses have replaceable fuse elements, allowing the fuse body to be reused if not damaged after an overload or short circuit. They are made to Class H standards. Renewable fuses and links are not recommended for new applications.


Semiconductor/High Speed(181)

Semiconductor/high speed fuses are designed to protect devices from overcurrents. They are quick reacting, reduce the need of other components to have high short-circuit current ratings.


Size Rejecting/NonRejecting(47)

Size rejecting/non rejecting fuses are designed to prevent fuses from being used with the incorrect size as well as prevent a low interrupting rating from being used in a circuit that needs a higher rating.


Supplemental(4)

Supplemental fuses are designed to provide limited overcurrent protection for specific applications and equipment. They are commonly used for luminaires, appliances and other equipment with internal circuits and components.










Fuse Class:



 Fuse class refers to industry standard physical specifications and electrical performance requirements for fuses with voltage ratings of 600V or less. Typical classes are K, RK1, RK5, G, L, H, T, CC and J.










Amperage (mA):



 Amperage refers to the maximum electrical current the product is intended to accommodate.










Amperage (A):



 Amperage refers to the maximum electrical current the product is intended to accommodate.










Voltage:



 Voltage is the force of electrical pressure that moves electrons through a conductor. The more voltage, the more electrons are forced to a circuit.










Fuse Timing:
Fuse timing indicates whether or not a fuse is designated as fast-acting or on a time-delay.



Fast-Acting(1159)

Fast acting fuses refer to the amount of time that a fuse can withstand a current before overload. They are used to protect sensitive equipment.


Time Delay(1597)

Time delay fuses, also known as duel-element fuses, are designed to allow for a surge in electricity during a short time before overloading or shorting out. They can protect equipment from overload and allow for greater starting amperage.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
