Testimonials 
What Our Clients Say






										I have had the opportunity of Working with Adam Phillips through my dental office. When we first came to Adam our corporate documents were a mess and did nothing to protect me or our business partnership. Adam was very thorough and conscientiously fixed our documents to make sure they did what they were designed to do. He also helped us fix our employee handbook and even came to one of our staff meetings to make sure our office staff understood the new handbook and answer any questions they might have. I would highly recommend Adam to anyone seeking this type of help.
									








By 
DR. BROCK OLSON DMD







										I have used the services of Adam Phillips and was extremely impressed. He was always extremely responsive to any needs and concerns that I had. Adam is young, energetic, and extremely professional. His professionalism is paired with being very personal and easy to work with. He is very fair and balanced, and has a great handle on the Law. I would highly encourage retaining Adam based on my experience. If there was a phrase to sum up Adam, I would say that he is a “top of the class” sort of Lawyer. This meaning he is very smart and is a very motivated person.
									








By 
GRIFFIN SPROUT







										From business acquisition to contract documents to end-of-life planning, Adam Phillips has helped me address any legal issues that have come my way, both business related and private. His quick response time, high level of competence, and fair billing practices have led me to recommend his services to many people and I will continue to do so.
									








By 
DAVID HESS







										I recommend Adam Phillips to everyone. I have worked with him for business contracts and personal wills. Before I found Adam I became frustrated with attorneys who didn't effectively solve my problems and charged large fees. The first time I used him I remember thinking "Wow, he really helped me, and he saved me a lot of money over the other guys.
